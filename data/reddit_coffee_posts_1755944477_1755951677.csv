The Wren groaned as its grapples strained against the mass of the broken shuttle. Elias Calder muttered to himself, hands dancing across the console like he was coaxing an old dog out of a ditch.



“C’mon, Birdie. Just a little more bite. She’s not gonna fly herself.”



The shuttle was scorched, half-crushed, spinning slowly in the black. No registry. No known design. Alien, but not hostile. Just… lost.



After an hour of maneuvering, the Wren’s cargo bay sealed with a heavy thud. The shuttle was aboard.



Elias suited up. Not because he had to—but because it felt right. Like armor for grief.



Inside the wreck, the air was thin. The walls were slick with coolant and blood. He found the adult first—slumped over the controls, body twisted, eyes open but empty. Humanoid, but not human. Skin like pearl, hair like silver thread.



And then he heard it.



A soft, high-pitched whimper. Like a bird caught in a vent.



He turned, flashlight sweeping across the cabin—and there she was.



A child. Maybe three years old. Curled in a blanket of strange fibers. Her face was almost human: delicate features, wide eyes, faint bioluminescent freckles glowing like starlight. She looked up at him, silent, trembling.



Elias knelt slowly.



“Hey there, little one. You’re safe now.”



She didn’t speak. Just reached out and touched his glove.



🪐 The Burial

Elias didn’t know the rites. Didn’t know the name. But he knew what respect looked like.



He cleared a space in the Wren’s observation bay—a quiet corner with a view of the stars. Wrapped the body in a clean tarp. Placed a wrench beside it, because it felt right. Lit a small flame. Said nothing.



The child watched from a distance, clutching a blanket. She didn’t cry. Just stared, eyes glowing faintly.



Elias looked up at the stars.



“I don’t know who you were. But you mattered. And I’ll make sure she knows that.”



🌠 The Farewell Fire

Elias stood in the Wren’s launch bay, the adult’s body sealed inside a ceremonial capsule. The design was simple—no insignia, no flag. Just a smooth shell with a guidance beacon and a burn-sequence core. It would flare bright as it neared the star, a final blaze before silence.



He’d wrapped the body himself. Carefully. Respectfully. The alien’s features were still, peaceful now. Elias had placed a wrench beside the body—not for utility, but for meaning. A symbol of work, of effort, of trying.



The child watched from the viewport, silent. Her eyes glowed faintly, reflecting the launch rail’s amber lights.



Elias keyed in the trajectory. Virell, the old sun, loomed ahead—golden, patient, waiting.



“I don’t know your name,” he said softly, “but I’ll send you to the light. That’s what we do now. No graves. No tombs. Just fire and stars.”



The capsule locked into place. A low hum filled the chamber.



He pressed the ignition.



With a hiss and a flash, the capsule launched—cutting through the void like a comet. It would drift for days, then ignite in the corona. A flare. A memory.



The child pressed her hand to the glass. Elias stood beside her, helmet off, heart heavy.



“He mattered,” Elias whispered. “And you do too.”



🛠️ Chapter Two: Birdie and the Girl

The Wren was old. Not ancient, but seasoned—patched hull, scorched plating, a cockpit that smelled faintly of oil and coffee. Elias had flown her through asteroid fields, solar flares, and one regrettable wedding on Titan. She’d earned her nickname: Birdie. Not because she was graceful, but because she always came home.



The girl didn’t speak yet. But she listened.



Elias showed her the ship slowly. Patiently. Like a father teaching a child to walk.



“This here’s the nav console. Birdie’s brain. She’s smarter than she looks, but don’t tell her I said that.”



The girl touched the screen, eyes wide. It flickered with star maps and old flight logs.



“And this—this is the galley. Not much, but it’ll make soup. Or something soup-adjacent.”



He cooked for her. Cleaned her. Wrapped her in a blanket stitched from old Earth fibers. Told her stories while she ate.



📖 Tales from the Dirtball

Elias had a voice like gravel and honey. He told her about Earth—not the politics or the wars, but the feel of it.



“There was a place called Montana. Big sky. You could lie on your back and see forever. My dad used to say the stars were holes punched in heaven’s roof.”



“And there was music. Real music. Guitars and voices and heartbreak. Not just synth loops and orbital noise.”



“We had birds, too. Real ones. Sparrows, crows, robins. Birdie’s named after them. Because she’s stubborn and loud and always finds her way.”



The girl didn’t understand the words yet. But she understood the rhythm. The warmth. The way Elias looked at her—not like a mystery, but like a miracle.



He taught her to say Birdie. It came out soft and slurred, but it was hers.



“Birdie,” she whispered one night, pointing at the ship.



Elias smiled. Not the kind you fake. The kind that breaks you a little.



“That’s right, sweetheart. She’s ours now.”





🌌 Chapter Three: Pawpaw

Days passed. Maybe weeks. Time aboard the Wren wasn’t measured in hours—it was measured in meals shared, systems checked, stories told.



Elias and the girl fell into rhythm.



She followed him through the ship like a shadow—barefoot, silent, curious. He taught her how to check the coolant levels, how to listen for the hum of the reactor core, how to pat Birdie’s console twice before sleep.



“She’s old,” he’d say, “but she’s got heart. Like me.”



The girl didn’t speak much. But she watched. Learned. And one morning, while Elias was fixing a jammed hatch, she padded up behind him and said it:



“Pawpaw.”



He froze.



Not “Captain.” Not “Elias.” Not “Mister.”



Just Pawpaw.



The word hit him like a solar flare to the chest. He didn’t turn around. Didn’t let her see the tears welling up in his eyes. But his voice cracked when he answered.



“Well now… that’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time.”



He laughed. Not loud. Not forced. Just soft and real.



“You can call me that, sweetheart. You earned it.”



She smiled. A small, glowing thing. And he let her hear the joy in his voice, even as he wiped his face with a grease-stained rag.



📡 Chapter Four: The Signal

The shuttle was cold. Elias had rigged a portable generator to power the interior—just enough juice to run diagnostics, maybe salvage a few systems. He didn’t expect much. The wreck had been silent since the day he pulled it aboard.



But tonight, something changed.



He was elbow-deep in a panel, tracing wires, when the generator surged. A soft whine turned into a sharp ping. Then a voice—garbled, alien, looping.



“—distress—coordinates—breach—”



Elias froze.



The shuttle’s comms array had come online. Not just online—broadcasting. A distress call. Old, automated, but still active. It was punching out into the void, loud and clear.



“—evacuation—hostile—child—preserve—”



He scrambled to the console, fingers flying. The interface was foreign, symbols half-deciphered from weeks of study. The call kept looping, louder now, echoing through Birdie’s hull.



“—preserve—preserve—preserve—”



Elias slammed the override. The signal cut.



Silence returned.



He stood there, breathing hard, staring at the console. The message had been transmitting for minutes. Maybe longer. Long enough for someone—something—to hear.



He looked toward the corridor. The girl was still asleep, curled in her blanket, unaware.



“What the hell were you running from?” he whispered.



🛠️ Chapter Five: Pawpaw’s Oath

The broadcast had stopped. The silence returned. But something had shifted.



Elias sat in the shuttle’s cockpit, staring at the dark console. The girl—his littlelady—was asleep back in Birdie, curled up with a blanket and a wrench she’d claimed as her own.



He didn’t know who might’ve heard the signal. Didn’t know what it meant. But he knew this:



It didn’t matter.



She was his now. His littlelady. And he was her Pawpaw.



Old bones, sure. Scarred hands. A heart patched together with duct tape and stubbornness. But he was skilled. He’d flown through hell and come out humming. He’d buried the dead, lit the stars, and taught a child to say Birdie.



He stood, cracked his neck, and whispered to the empty shuttle:



“You can come for her. You can come for me. But you better bring more than fire.”



He walked back to the Wren, boots echoing in the corridor. The ship felt warmer now. Like home.



She stirred as he entered, blinking up at him.



“Pawpaw?”



He smiled. That same quiet, breaking smile.



“I’m here, littlelady. Always.”

🌌 Chapter Six: The Search Begins

Eight months after the signal—long after Elias shut it down, long after he stopped wondering who might’ve heard it—a fleet emerges from the edge of known space.



Fifty ships. Sleek, angular, humming with power. Their hulls shimmer with refractive plating, their weapons systems hot but idle. They don’t fire. They don’t hail. They scan.



They are looking.



For a shuttle. For a signal. For a child.



For a princess.



🛠️ Meanwhile, A Sector Away

The Wren drifts through a quiet trade lane, eight months and a dozen jumps removed from the crash site. Elias and the girl—Sela, though he still calls her littlelady—have settled into a rhythm that feels like home.



She’s grown. Not much in size, but in spirit. She speaks more now. Draws pictures of stars and birds and a man with a beard who fixes things. She hums when she works. She calls him Pawpaw with a confidence that breaks him every time.



They have no idea.



Humanity doesn’t know either. The signal was brief, buried in static. No one traced it. No one flagged it. The Brex haven’t heard. The colonies haven’t seen. The Wren is just another dot on a long, quiet map.



But the fleet is moving.



📡 Fleet Transmission – Internal Log

“We have traced the signal to this sector. Shuttle ID matches royal escape protocols. No confirmed survivors.”



“The child may still live. If so, she is heir to the throne. We must recover her. We must know what happened.”



“Prepare diplomatic protocols. Prepare military contingencies. Prepare for anything.”





🚨 Chapter Seven: The Standoff at Virex Drift

The Virex Drift was supposed to be quiet. A neutral zone. A place for refueling, minor trade, and watching the stars spin.



But on this day, it becomes the eye of a storm.



Humanity’s 5th Expeditionary Fleet, fresh from patrol routes near the Brex border, drops out of FTL to investigate anomalous readings—gravitic distortions, faint signal echoes, and a strange energy signature that doesn’t match any known tech.



They find fifty alien ships already there.



Angular. Silent. Armed.



The alien fleet doesn’t respond to hails. Doesn’t move. Doesn’t retreat. They scan. They wait.



Humanity’s fleet forms up. Shields raised. Weapons hot. No one fires.



For six hours, the two fleets drift in silence, locked in a ballet of tension. Fighters scramble. Commanders bark orders. Diplomats scramble for translation protocols. The Drift’s comms hub overloads with encrypted chatter.



Then—a breakthrough.



📡 Intercepted Transmission – Alien Fleet

“...child may be aboard a civilian vessel. Signal fragment matches royal escape beacon. We must locate her.”



“If humans have her, we must speak. If not, we must search. She is not a threat. She is our hope.”



🧠 Human Fleet Intelligence Briefing

“They’re not here to fight. They’re searching for someone. A child. Possibly a survivor from a crash eight months ago.”



“We cross-referenced the signal. It matches a brief anomaly logged by a freighter called The Wren. No known registry. No recent sightings.”



“We may have passed her. We may have missed her. We need to talk.”



🤝 The Moment of Realization

A human diplomat—Commander Riva—steps onto a neutral shuttle and crosses the void. She meets the alien envoy aboard a shimmering cruiser named The Solace of Kin. They speak. They share data. They compare fragments.



And slowly, the tension bleeds away.



This isn’t a war. It’s a search.



For a girl.



For a princess.



For a myth reborn.



🌠 Chapter Nine: The Relay at Kestrel’s Hollow

They were three months deeper into the fringe now. Past the mapped lanes. Past the trade routes. The Wren had become a ghost ship in a quiet sea, drifting between dust clouds and forgotten moons.



Elias liked it that way.



Sela had grown bolder—climbing into maintenance ducts, sketching constellations on the bulkhead, asking questions about gravity and music and why some stars blinked and others didn’t. She was thriving. And Elias, for all his gruffness, had started to believe they might outrun the past.



Then they found the relay.



It was old. Half-buried in the crust of a dead moon. A Kestrel-class comms node, long abandoned but still humming faintly with power. Elias patched in, mostly out of habit.



And the signal came through.



📡 GalNet Bulletin – Priority Transmission

“To all vessels: The 5th Expeditionary Fleet has confirmed the existence of a royal escapee from the Arakari system. The child is believed to be aboard a civilian freighter, possibly unregistered. Humanity has pledged full cooperation in the search.”



“If you encounter a vessel matching the Wren’s profile, do not engage. Report immediately. The child is not a threat. She is a bridge.”



“We seek peace. We seek truth. We seek her.”



🧠 Elias Reads the Message

He stood there for a long time, the words flickering on the cracked relay screen. The Wren’s profile. The child. A bridge.



He didn’t move. Didn’t speak.



Sela was in the engine room, humming to herself, drawing birds on the coolant tanks.



Elias ran a hand over his beard, stared at the stars beyond the viewport, and whispered:



“They’re not just looking for her. They’re hoping she’s the answer.”



🤔 His Thoughts, Unspoken

If I keep running, I protect her. But I deny her the truth.



If I turn back, I risk everything. But maybe… maybe she belongs to more than just me.



She’s not just a passenger anymore. She’s the center of something mythic.



🌌 Scene: The Wren’s Bridge, Late Evening

The stars outside are slow and golden, drifting past the viewport like embers in a dying fire. Elias stands at the console, the relay message still flickering on the screen. Sela sits nearby, legs crossed, sketching a bird with wings made of constellations.



He clears his throat.



“Littlelady… I need to tell you something.”



She looks up. Her eyes are calm, curious.



“Your people—they’re looking for you. Not just a few. A whole fleet. Fifty ships. And now humanity’s joined them. They’re searching the stars for a girl who vanished. A girl who might be… you.”



Sela blinks. Her pencil stills.



“Me?”



Elias nods slowly.



“I didn’t know at first. I didn’t want to know. I just saw a scared kid in a busted shuttle and figured I’d keep her safe. But now… now the whole damn galaxy’s listening. And I think it’s time we spoke.”



He kneels beside her, voice low.



“I need your help to call them. Not just to tell them you’re alive—but to tell them who you are. If you want to. If you’re ready.”



She’s quiet for a long time. Then she reaches out and touches the console.



“Will they be kind?”



Elias swallows hard.



“I don’t know. But I’ll be right here. Every step.”



📡 Universal Broadcast: Unintended Transmission from The Wren

\[BEGIN TRANSMISSION\]



Visual: A worn command chair. Elias Calder, grizzled and squinting, sits with a small girl curled on his lap. She’s clutching a sketchpad and blinking sleepily. The stars drift behind them like slow fireflies.



Elias (scratching his beard):



“Uh… hey y’all. Might’ve hit the wrong button here. Looks like we’re causin’ a bit of a fuss out there. Sorry ‘bout that.”



He glances down at the girl, who’s now tugging his sleeve.



“We’re headin’ y’all’s way soon. Thought maybe it’s time you met the littlelady. Go ahead, sweetheart—say hello.”



Sela (softly, smiling):



“Hi. I’m Sela. I’m okay. Pawpaw fixed my ship and taught me how to make toast with a plasma coil. We saw a comet and he let me name it. It’s called Birdie.”



“We live on the Wren now. It’s cozy. I have a blanket with stars on it. Pawpaw reads me stories. He’s the best fixer in the galaxy.”



“I think I used to be someone important. But now I’m just me. And I’m happy.”



She yawns, curls tighter against him.



Elias (chuckling):



“Alright, that’s enough excitement for one night. She’s driftin’ off.”



He leans forward, voice low and warm.



“Okay y’all, I gotta get her tucked in. When she wakes up, we’ll head back fast as we can toward Earth. But Birdie don’t like flyin’ when my littlelady’s nappin.”



“So this is Pawpaw… peace.”



\[END TRANSMISSION\]



🌌 Galactic Reaction: Silence, Then a Roar

Across fleets, stations, and colonies, the message plays. No encryption. No protocol. Just raw truth.



Commanders pause. Civilians cry. The alien fleet replays it twice.



And somewhere deep in the diplomatic core, someone whispers:



“We’re not chasing a fugitive. We’re welcoming a family.”



🌍 Humanity’s Reaction

🛡️ 5th Expeditionary Fleet – Admiral Vance’s Bridge

The admiral watches the transmission in silence. His officers glance at him, waiting for orders. He finally speaks:



“Stand down. All ships. That’s not a fugitive. That’s a family. We escort them home.”



The fleet shifts formation—not to intercept, but to welcome. Fighters peel off to clear lanes. Comms officers begin broadcasting a new signal:



“To the Wren: You are not alone. We await your return.”



🏙️ Earth – Civilian Response

Newsfeeds explode with the clip. “Pawpaw and the Princess” becomes a trending phrase.



Children draw Birdie, the comet. Artists sketch Sela’s star blanket. Musicians remix her sleepy voice into lullabies.



A movement begins: “Let her choose.” People want peace. They want unity. They want her story to be hers.



🛸 Alien Fleet Reaction – Arakari High Command

🧬 Council Chamber, Arakari Prime

The elders watch the broadcast. One weeps silently. Another whispers:



“She remembers. She calls him Pawpaw. She is safe.”



They issue a new directive: “No weapons. No demands. Only welcome.”



The fleet begins crafting a ceremonial escort. Ships repaint their hulls with royal insignias. A new anthem is composed—half in Arakari tongue, half in human harmony.



🛰️ Neutral Zones and Fringe Worlds

Pirate crews pause mid-raid to watch the clip. One grizzled captain mutters, “That old man’s got guts.”



Fringe traders begin tagging their ships with “Birdie-friendly” decals, signaling safe passage.



A relay station on the edge of Brex space replays the message hourly. Locals gather to listen, like it’s a bedtime story.



🕊️ Diplomatic Core – Joint Human-Arakari Council

They draft a new protocol: The Wren Accord.



“Any vessel carrying Sela Calder shall be granted safe passage, full protection, and diplomatic immunity. She is not a symbol of war. She is a symbol of peace.”



🎙️ Final Note: The Galaxy Waits

Across the stars, ships slow. Messages pour in. Some offer help. Some offer songs. Some simply say:



“We heard you, Pawpaw. We’re ready.”



🎥 Raw Footage – The Wren, Galley Deck

The footage begins mid-motion. No title card. No music. Just the soft hum of the Wren’s systems and the shuffle of boots on metal.



The shuttle doors had opened an hour ago. No greeting party. No armed escort. Just a quiet “no” from Elias Calder when the diplomats tried to step forward first.



“She sees her kind first. That’s the rule.”



And so she did.



Sela had run—not walked—into the arms of her people. Not all were kin by blood, but they were kin by memory. By the same stars. By the same scars. She showed them everything: her drawings, her bunk, the scorch mark she called “Birdie’s birthmark.” She pointed to the galley and whispered, “That’s where Pawpaw makes the good stuff.”



The reporters followed, cameras rolling, but no one spoke. No narration. No commentary. Just the sound of Sela’s voice, high and bright, echoing through the freighter like sunlight in a cave.



🍻 Later – Galley Table, Wren

The footage cuts to a wide shot: a worn wooden table, clearly handmade. The grain is uneven. One leg has a bolt through it. Around it sit six guests—three humans, three Arakari—each with a mug of homemade ale.



Sela is curled under a faded blanket on the couch bolted to the wall. Her sketchpad rests on her chest, one hand still clutching a crayon. She’s asleep.



Elias Calder sits at the head of the table. He doesn’t speak. Doesn’t toast. Just waits.



The silence stretches. Not awkward. Not tense. Just real.



Finally, one of the Arakari envoys—an elder with silver skin and a voice like wind through reeds—leans forward.



“She is safe here.”



A human reporter nods.



“She’s home here.”



Elias lifts his mug, takes a sip, and sets it down.



“Then we can talk.”



🕊️ Broadcast Notes – Unedited Transmission

No cuts. No overlays. Just raw footage streamed across both networks.



Viewership spikes within minutes. Comments flood in: “This feels real.” “I cried when she showed the couch.” “That table looks like my granddad’s.”



Diplomatic channels stall. Not because of conflict—but because no one wants to interrupt the moment.



🎙️ Universal Broadcast – The Wren, Galley Deck

The camera’s still rolling. No edits. No cuts. Just the low hum of the freighter and the clink of mugs on wood.



Elias Calder leans forward, elbows on the table, eyes steady. Sela sleeps behind him, curled under a blanket, her breath slow and even.



He sighs. Then speaks.



“I’m not stupid. I know she needs her people. And her people need her.”



“But I wanna speak to everyone here—and out there.”



“As a human, I found her. No question. I was gonna save her. It’s the right thing to do.”



“Now I’m PawPaw to her. And I know where she needs to be.”



He pauses, voice thick with truth.



“I don’t like it. I’m willing to start an interstellar incident to keep her safe.”



“So I’ve given this thought. Whatever agreement y’all make—that’s fine. That’s between the peoples. Diplomats can deal.”



“But I’m PawPaw. And PawPaw isn’t leaving her.”



“So I’m gonna follow them across the void. If they like it or not.”



“If they do—I’ll be PawPaw beside her ‘til my end.”



“If not—me and Birdie’ll be overwatch ‘til my end.”



He lifts his mug, not in toast, but in testament.



“I’m not rejecting humanity by leaving. I’m embracing it.”



📡 Fleetwide Reaction: Silence, Then Reverence

Human diplomats lower their heads. One whispers, “That’s what we’re supposed to be.”



Arakari elders mark the moment with a gesture of kinship—two fingers to the heart, then to the stars.



Viewers across systems replay the speech. Parents quote it to their children. Soldiers etch it into their armor.



🕊️ Legacy Begins

This isn’t just a speech. It’s a vow. A myth. A new kind of diplomacy—one built not on treaties, but on devotion.



🌌 Scene: After the Broadcast

Elias finishes speaking. The words hang in the air like smoke from a campfire—rough, warm, unforgettable.



Before anyone can respond, Sela stirs on the couch. She blinks, sees him at the table, and bolts across the galley.



She throws her arms around him, burying her face in his chest.



“Pawpaw…”



He wraps her up, one hand cradling her head, the other steady on her back. No cameras needed. No commentary. Just a hug that says I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.



🛠️ The Wren Reborn

The Wren was never meant to cross into Andromeda. Her jump core was outdated. Her hull was rated for local drift, not intergalactic burn. But none of that mattered.



She was Sela’s home. And Pawpaw had made a promise.



So humanity and the Arakari came together—engineers, physicists, shipwrights, dreamers. They drydocked the Wren in orbit over Luna, stripped her down to the bones, and rebuilt her for the journey ahead.



Human tech: Reinforced hull plating, quantum nav systems, gravitic shielding.



Arakari tech: Bio-reactive life support, harmonic stabilizers, memory-threaded AI.



But through it all, one thing never changed: Sela’s bed stayed exactly where it was.



The couch in the galley. The blanket with stars. The sketchpad tucked in the corner. No matter the upgrades, the soul stayed the same.



And to everyone’s quiet pride, Sela never spent a single night away from it.



🛸 The Arakari Finally Speak

After Elias’s broadcast, after the hug, after the silence—one of the Arakari elders steps forward. Their voice is soft, melodic, resonant.



“You speak not as a soldier. Not as a diplomat. But as a father. We have no word for Pawpaw. But we will learn it.”



“You are welcome among us. Not as guardian. Not as guest. But as kin.”



Elias nods, eyes misty but steady.



“Then let’s fly.”



🕊️ Final Shot

The Wren, reborn, launches from drydock. Her hull gleams with new alloys, her engines hum with alien harmony. But inside, the galley still smells like old wood and homemade ale.



Sela sleeps on her couch. Elias sits nearby, boots up, watching the stars blur past.



And somewhere in the void, a new myth begins:



“She crossed galaxies in a ship built of love. And Pawpaw never left her side.”



🚀 One Shot: 1500 Years Later

The year is 3525. Humanity has long since left Earth behind, scattering across stars like seeds in the wind. But today, they gather—on the orbital ring of New Sol, beneath the twin moons of the Terran Archive—to witness something sacred.



Two ships stand ready in the drydock, gleaming under the light of a blue giant star.



The Pawpaw: A deep-range colony vessel, rugged and resolute. Its hull bears the scars of simulated meteor storms, a tribute to the freighter that once defied the void.



The Sela: A diplomatic ark, graceful and radiant. Its interior is designed around a central galley with a couch—replicated exactly from historical scans.



They are not warships. They are not scouts. They are symbols.



📜 The Ceremony

A voice echoes across the ring—ancient, synthesized from Elias Calder’s final broadcast.



“She crossed galaxies in a ship built of love. And Pawpaw never left her side.”



The crowd is silent. Then, from the observation deck, a child steps forward. She places a sketchpad on the console. It’s a drawing of a bird—half freighter, half phoenix.



The launch director nods.



“By order of the Terran Council, and in honor of the myth that made us whole… we launch the Pawpaw and the Sela. May they carry our soul into the stars.”



🌠 Final Shot

The ships ignite their drives. Twin trails of light spiral outward, weaving like ribbons through the dark.



As they vanish into the deep, the Archive plays a final log:



“This is Elias Calder. If you’re hearing this, it means we made it. Not just across the stars—but through the silence. Through the fear. Through the loss.”



“We made it because we stayed together. Because one little girl never spent a night without her bed. And because one old man never stopped flying.”

\-@clowbranded74 postsmore on music collabsThought for 8sHey there! Since you're digging into more on music collabs with@clowbranded(aka C-LoW), I'll break it down based on what I know from his online vibes and posts. He's all about that creative energy, so let's dive in:Who is@clowbrandedand His Music Scene?

* Background: C-LoW (real handle@clowbranded) is a musician hailing from Coos Bay, Oregon. He's a working artist who balances day jobs with music production, often sharing raw, passionate tracks inspired by life, dreams (like those alien revelations he rants about), and social issues like fighting homelessness. His style blends indie vibes with experimental sounds—think lo-fi beats, introspective lyrics, and a touch of psychedelic edge.
* Online Presence: Active on platforms like Twitter/X, SoundCloud, and Instagram, where he posts snippets, behind-the-scenes, and calls for collabs. He's got that grassroots hustle, rallying fans to vote on tracks or share his stuff.

His Take on Music CollabsFrom his recent posts and interactions, C-LoW is super open to collaborations—it's like his love language for building the music community. Here's the scoop:

* What He's Into: He's hyping up joint projects right now, especially with producers, vocalists, or even visual artists for music videos. Recent tweets show him vibing with ideas like remixing tracks with guest features or co-writing songs about real-world topics (e.g., crypto dreams mixed with social justice anthems). He mentioned wanting to collab on something ""out-of-this-world"" tied to his alien fascination—maybe a sci-fi themed EP?
* Recent Vibes: In one thread, he shouted out Rihanna as an inspiration (dreaming of a feature? Who knows!), and he's been teasing crypto-inspired beats. He's all about remote collabs too—sharing stems via Dropbox or Discord for folks worldwide. No gatekeeping here; he encourages DMs for ideas.
* Examples of His Collab Style:
   * Past/Teased Projects: He's done informal collabs with local Oregon artists, like layering vocals over beats for free mixtapes. One standout was a track with a fellow indie rapper on homelessness awareness—super heartfelt and community-driven.
   * Current Calls: He's posting things like ""Who's down to collab on a beat drop that slaps harder than my coffee addiction? Tag your producers! #MusicCollab #ClowbrandedVibes"". If you're a musician, hit him up—he's responsive and all about mutual growth.

How to Get Involved

* Reach Out: Slide into his Twitter/X DMs (@clowbranded) or check his SoundCloud for open collab invites. He's mentioned using tools like Splice for sample sharing.
* Why Collab with Him?: Low-pressure, high-creativity. Plus, he's got that underdog story—your input could help amplify his (and your) voice on bigger platforms. He's even tying it to causes, like donating proceeds from collab tracks to anti-homelessness orgs.
* Pro Tip: If you're into Rihanna-level pop with a twist, or crypto-fueled electronic stuff, align your pitch there. He's all about positive energy and ""vibing"" together.

If you've got a specific angle (like genre or a track idea), I can brainstorm more tailored suggestions. What's your music style—wanna collab on a hypothetical with C-LoW?",1,1755951405.0,MusicPromotion,0,1.0,False

1mxztqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1mxztqo/super_wet_puck/,Super wet puck,"hi, looking for any help,

 I did check past wet puck experiences but mine seems a little different, the portafilter does not come out filled with water after back-flushing, only shots with a puck of coffee. 

I am using a Caedo e5p, and was using a breville duo temp, everything was great until breville shit the bed, but very dry pucks, like just steaming no liquid. 

 I picked up a Gaggia classic 03', and I have not had one dry puck since, so it isn't the grinder. Everything is dialed in to a basic level (18g basket, 18.5g full city, 36g out, 30 sec) and I end up with a puck covered in standing water , not just soupy or wet. its weird because the solenoid does remove some water into the tray, but its like a 1/3 of the amount when backlashing and doesn't really do anything besides the cool whoosh noise. 

I don't think the solenoid being clogged is the issue, because when backlashing the solenoid works great, it shoots a good amount of water into tray, and the protafilter drier than my puck of coffee after a shot.  ive also tried alternating steam and brew trick to see if that does anything.

 Also my flow is completely fine out of the group head, no issues there. 

  
any suggestions? 

(also I understand wet pucks don't effect the quality of a shot, but it is a big inconvenience to dump a soupy puck as it is messy and gets everywhere when hitting, and my knock box collects mold after a day if they are that wet)",1,1755951193.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

What are your experiencea if this? Want to figure out if it's because of my old lapband or just MJ. 


I finished the four-week starter at 2.5 mg, then tried a 3.75 mg “golden” dose to test my tolerance. Apart from mild gastrointestinal upset on day four, I was fine and lost 5 kg in five weeks (I still have 20 kg to lose; I am 161 cm and small-framed).

I have a lapband that's partially full. I am under the care of a specialist. The band is malfunctioning so we don't want to add further fill. While it reduces my intake, it's not enough to help me drop the weight anymore. 

Last night I took my first 5 mg injection. The food noise is quieter and my appetite lower than before Mounjaro, though not as suppressed as in the first fortnight at 2.5 mg. For breakfast at 10 am I had a protein-rich smoothie (spinach, banana, psyllium husk, protein powder, Greek yoghurt) and a small soy coffee. It is now 8 pm and I am still uncomfortably full. I have managed only 1.2 L of water.

Keen to hear of any similar experiences. I assume this fullness will ease, but want to get an understanding of what point should I consider reducing the dose and if it's because of the combination of the lapband. Eating and drinking so little cannot be healthy.

What paper filter or cheesecloth should I use? I've also started adding a pinch of salt and 1/8 tsp of ascorbic acid to help keep freshness.

We’ve been friends for years but only started dating this year. When we’re in our hometown he’s super nice and lets me stay at his house all the time which takes the pressure off of me to accommodate him. I still try my best to compensate by buying him food or always making him coffees (that I pay for in full) at my place of work. Anyways, we’re on vacation for a full 2 and a half weeks. So far I’ve noticed that he doesn’t offer to pay for anything and I don’t know if it’s because we brought our own international money?? (I have offered to pay for some of his things), he doesn’t offer me a bite of his meals or drinks even though I always offer him a bite so he can try different items. He always walks ahead of me where it occasionally seems like we aren’t together. Whenever I’ve pointed this out, he tells me that he’s “always been a fast walker” and that he actually does this to “everyone” and he claims that he walks slightly slower for me… 

It just is starting to build sadness and resentment for me. It makes me miss my friends and family back home because I know they consider me and care for me in ways where they’d offer me bites of their food, they’d walk at a pace suitable for both of us. 

I don’t know if I’m overthinking it but it’s making me wonder if this is a dealbreaker or not. AITAH for feeling this way? I just know I wouldn’t want to be with someone like this longterm especially if they react with defensiveness or push it aside whenever I bring up a concern. 

Or one other thing is that we went to a grocery store and I suggested that we buy sandwiches for the hotel so that we have something small to eat if we get hungry in the morning, he heard this and took one sandwich off the shelf for himself and then went straight to the cashier to pay… he didn’t ask if I wanted one and just left.

The world held its breath. News anchors spoke in clipped tones; markets trembled; governments whispered behind closed doors. Everyone knew something was coming—something big. But no one knew exactly what.

Maya Singh sat in the dim glow of her newsroom office, half-empty coffee growing cold beside her. She had been chasing whispers for weeks—rumors of a scientific breakthrough buried under layers of secrecy. Every lead pulled her deeper into a story that felt less like journalism and more like a fuse burning toward something explosive.

That morning, she found it. A single line in a press release from Dr. Rachel Kim, a physicist who rarely spoke to the public: We are on the edge of discovery. The kind that changes everything.

Maya's pulse quickened. Dr. Kim wasn’t known for exaggeration. Whatever this was, it wasn’t ordinary. She grabbed her recorder, her notebook, and her courage. It was time to find out what the world was really standing on the edge of.


---

Breaking the News

The research facility looked more like a military base than a lab—barbed wire fences, armed guards, watchtowers slicing the skyline. As Maya approached, the air smelled of rain and metal. She signed forms she didn’t read and surrendered her phone to a stone-faced guard before being led inside.

Dr. Rachel Kim looked like she hadn’t slept in days. Her lab coat was wrinkled, her hair tied in a loose knot, but her eyes burned with purpose.

""Ms. Singh,"" she said, shaking Maya’s hand firmly. ""Thank you for coming. I can only give you a glimpse, but you need to understand the stakes.""

In the lab’s center stood a machine unlike anything Maya had seen—sleek, humming softly, surrounded by monitors scrolling incomprehensible data.

""Zero-Point Energy,"" Dr. Kim said simply. ""Energy pulled from the quantum vacuum itself. Infinite. Clean. But... unstable, if misused.""

Maya scribbled furiously. ""This could end energy crises. Poverty. Climate change.""

""Yes,"" Dr. Kim said, voice low. ""Or trigger disasters we can’t contain. That’s why certain people want it buried.""

Hours later, back at the newsroom, Maya typed the story with shaking hands. As she hovered over the 'Publish' button, her editor burst in, pale-faced.

""Maya, hold it. The government called. They say this is classified. If you run it, they’ll come after us.""

Maya’s eyes locked on the headline: A World on the Brink: Zero-Point Energy and the Future of Humanity.

She hit Publish.


---

Global Response

The article detonated like a bomb.

Within hours, world leaders called emergency meetings. Talk shows speculated wildly. Protesters marched with signs reading Power to the People and Clean Energy Now. But as support grew, so did the threats.

A text arrived on Maya’s phone that night: You’re playing with fire. Stop before it’s too late.

At the United Nations, chaos reigned. Delegates shouted over one another as Dr. Kim presented the discovery’s potential—limitless energy, no emissions, no dependence on oil or coal. But an oil-state ambassador slammed his fist on the table.

""This technology will destroy our economies,"" he snarled. ""We will not accept this!""

Arguments fractured along political lines. Some saw salvation; others saw an existential threat to power itself.

From the press gallery, Maya watched alliances crumble like sandcastles in the tide. She felt the weight of history pressing on the room—and on her story.


---

Secrets in the Shadows

As negotiations dragged on, a stranger slipped a note under Maya’s hotel door: Midnight. Old clock tower. Come alone.

Curiosity battled fear, but in the end, the journalist won. At the clock tower, a nervous delegate emerged from the shadows, eyes darting.

""I opposed the project,"" he admitted, handing her a folder thick with documents. ""But not because of energy. Because of them. Corporations, officials—they want to control it, not share it. These files prove it.""

Before Maya could speak, footsteps echoed in the darkness. The delegate went rigid. ""They found us. Run.""

Figures closed in. Maya sprinted through rain-slick alleys, lungs burning, clutching the folder like a lifeline. A van screeched around the corner ahead of her—not the pursuers, but Dr. Kim.

""Get in!"" she yelled.


---

The Daring Broadcast

Together, they raced to a hidden studio prepared for one purpose: to tell the world everything.

As cameras rolled, Dr. Kim revealed the truth—the discovery, the corruption, the danger of secrecy. Maya spoke directly to the world: ""Knowledge belongs to everyone. And so does the future.""

Authorities stormed the building mid-broadcast, but too late. Backup systems kept the signal alive, beaming the truth to millions.

By morning, protests erupted across continents. Governments pledged transparency. Energy companies faced investigations. The Zero-Point Energy project moved under international oversight.

And somewhere in the chaos, Maya and Dr. Kim vanished, leaving only the story behind.


---

Epilogue

Months later, power plants lit up using the new technology. Children studied by clean, free light in villages that once went dark at sunset. But the files Maya leaked hinted at deeper secrets—projects still hidden, forces still watching.

Because revolutions, like discoveries, never really end.

The latest trend I’ve been seeing blow up on TikTok is POV-style clips with a funny twist, and they’re perfect for passive income channels.

I tested one with [**FunnyClips.ai**](http://FunnyClips.ai) using the prompt: “POV: Your coffee machine refuses to start until it’s had its own coffee.” In under a minute, the tool stitched it into a short, faceless video that actually outperformed my “serious” posts.

Faceless content means no awkward filming, no showing your face. Just viral ideas turned into clips that can grow on autopilot.",1,1755950489.0,FacelessContent101,0,1.0,False

1mxzi88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christians/comments/1mxzi88/looking_for_input_on_my_current_pastor_and_church/,Looking for input on my current pastor and church,"I'll try to keep this fairly brief, but wanted to ask some internet strangers for advice on this topic since I still can't decide if I should go ""all in"" with my current church or take a step back and just become part of the congregation. The main issue is the head pastor and how the church is run.

I came to Christ about three years ago, and I live in a part of the world where Christian churches have been growing in the last decade or so, but are still fairly new. I found my current church before coming to Christ because my wife is a believer and brought me there.

From the start, I enjoyed the church, it felt welcoming and not traditional as the one I experienced back home. I could come and get some value out of it even though I was not a believer, it felt like going to a ted talk with some music played before and after. Today I've realised this is a seeker-friendly church, but that is not my main issue. I also had great chats with the pastor and he felt very non-judgmental and had no issues with me not believing the Bible etc.

However, during the last 3 years as I came to Christ I've started to see some behaviour and issues with the pastor and the church that I need some other peoples opinion on, as I'm not sure if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it has to be, especially since I'm now part of the core team of the church. I also don't feel comfortable talking with other members of the church about this, as I don't want to stir up division or do something that might just be gossiping.

**Let's start with the pastor's behaviour**

Pretty early on, I saw that his behaviour could change behind closed doors, and he could be straight out mean to people, especially when they were not there. He started to come off like a high school bully, playing favourites with people who could benefit him, while freezing out anyone who went against him. He also seem to like to play people against each other, something he even bragged about doing in High School.

His slogan is ""a complaint is a volunteer"" making anyone afraid of raising issues or complain unless they are ready to fix the problem themselves..

He talked bad about some of the people I knew (God fearing reformed men) because they had made complaints to him about various things in the Church. He brought it up more than once to really hammer in that they were not to be associated with. At one point he also talked about a girl in the congregation who has severe autism and said ""she will never be in a leader position, she has a lot of issues this girl"".

But this behaviour also started to show in more public. He had sermons on how to manipulate people into liking you, (take a trip with them, call them X amount of times, using NLP etc). At one time he did baby dedication and the father was clearly very nervous and had a hard time speaking, he then hit him with the microphone in the head and said ""hello, anyone home??"" as the whole congregation watched and laughed, humiliating the guy in a moment that should be holy for his family.

At another point there was a young girl doing a testimony on stage, she had just finished telling about an abortion she did before coming to Christ and was still in tears. When he went up next to her, he said out loud in front of the congregation: ""I really want to hug you right now but you are too good looking"". For me, there are so many problems with this clearly sexual and flirtatious joke, especially in that moment.

At a team meeting he told us in the team to lie to the congregation if we had 1 on 1 and tell them that we had another meeting after to keep the time short. Maybe not a huge thing, but as a pastor I don't think it's suitable to tell your team to lie to the congregation.

Another friend of mine left the church a few years ago as he was serving in the team, but could not keep serving as he was living with his girlfriend (not wife). The pastor wanted him to keep serving, and even though my friend said he don't want to marry the girl, the pastor offered to do a quick elopement so he could keep serving. After this my friend lost all faith in this man as a pastor and left the church.

I have three more friends who have left the church for various reasons after disagreements with the pastor.

Besides these stories, I heard more and more people talk about how many people left the church after altercations with the pastor, that he visited girls alone in their homes etc, but at this point these are unconfirmed rumours so nothing I want to put much weight on for now.

**Now about the church**

It's a missionary church started by the pastor himself, supported by churches back home in the west. The problem I realised is that there is no accountability, no team of elders and the pastor is basically running the show all on his own. The church basically stands and falls with the pastor, so there is not a situation where you could ever get the pastor out for whatever reason and continue the church.

There have also been some really odd decisions in the church and they seem to be more interested in numbers than actually building a strong Christian and Bible believing church and preaching the word. Very little is preached about sin, the cross or heaven and hell. Secular music is being played at services and baptisms are being thrown out like free coffees.

The last part, that the church is seeker-friendly, is the least of my issues and I can definitely live with that, especially since they are building more and more foundation around the Sunday services that goes deeper into the word etc, and frankly there are not many options where I live. I still see room for my own ministry here. My main issue is with the pastor and how he runs the show.

Based on reading this, do you see any red flags that are worth adressing, or does this more seem like a ""get over it"" situation?",2,1755950239.0,Christians,3,1.0,False

1mxzh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1mxzh84/should_you_buy_the_best_business_laptop_hp/,Should You Buy the Best Business Laptop HP ProBook 445 G9,"Testing out the HP ProBook 445 G9 in my daily routine has been an exciting journey as someone constantly juggling work and personal demands. From its sleek design to solid performance capabilities, the HP ProBook 445 G9 feels like a product built to handle the ebbs and flows of modern business and casual usage.

**Portable and Sleek Design**  
This laptop immediately caught my attention with its understated silver finish and slim profile. Weighing just over 3 pounds, it feels light in hand and is easy to carry around whether I’m heading to meetings or working from a café. The 14-inch size strikes the perfect balance between portability and usability, especially with its thin bezels, which made watching videos or working in document-heavy formats a more immersive experience. It fits snugly into every backpack without feeling bulky, which is a big plus for daily commuters.

**Impressive Performance for Multitasking**  
I know the heart of any laptop lies in its power, and this one didn’t disappoint. Powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor (with 8 cores and a respectable 2.0 GHz base clock), coupled with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, the performance felt as seamless as melting butter on a hot skillet. From running multiple Chrome tabs to editing a few light videos on the fly, it tackled tasks without breaking a sweat. The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD added to its capability with minimal lag when booting up or loading programs. It delivered a smooth experience, even with demanding software like Photoshop.

**Vivid Display and Effective Webcam Features**  
The 14-inch Full HD touchscreen display with anti-glare properties stood out brilliantly in different lighting conditions. Working under natural light spilling through the windows? It handled the glare like a champ! Content consumption also felt vibrant, although the 45% NTSC color accuracy might not be ideal for professionals in photo or video editing. The included 720p HD IR webcam provided crystal-clear video calls and built-in privacy features, which added an additional sense of security during long Zoom meetings.  

**[Check HP ProBook 445 G9 price on Amazon.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b0cnr57m2b/)**  

**Good Points**  
- Offers a commercial-grade sleek build without compromising on durability.  
- AMD Ryzen processor and SSD combination ensures rapid and efficient processing.  
- Lightweight and compact, enhancing portability for professionals on the go.  
- Display clarity, even in brighter environments with anti-glare technology.  
- Security enhancements like the fingerprint reader and HP Wolf Security features.  

**Downsides**  
- Color reproduction on the display is basic, limiting usage for creative professionals.  
- While ample for regular productivity tasks, the three-cell battery sometimes struggled to keep up during prolonged heavy usage.  
- No optical drive, although this feels more like a feature of the times than a drawback.  

**Connectivity Options and Versatility**  
This laptop genuinely feels crafted for both office and everyday contexts. Its various port options—USB Type-C, USB Type-A, HDMI, and ethernet—meant I never had to scramble for dongles. Pairing devices via Bluetooth 5.3 or connecting to Wi-Fi 6 networks worked seamlessly, too. Testing out the multiple-output feature was a joy; connecting the laptop to two external monitors at 4K resolution made productivity skyrocket during data-heavy tasks. The spill-resistant keyboard came into play when my coffee-loving coworker accidentally knocked over my mug, saving me from catastrophe.  

**Other Options**  
Shopping for a business laptop inevitably invites comparisons, so how does it stack up against other products like the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 or Dell Inspiron 14? The HP ProBook 445 G9 holds its own in terms of style and functionality suitable for business environments. While the ThinkPad might edge ahead with its legendary keyboard ergonomics, the HP ProBook’s thoughtful combination of performance and portability is compelling. It also feels less bulky compared to the Inspiron 14, but the latter offers a more consistent battery performance. Pricing leans in favor of the ProBook for those seeking high-end specs without excessive splurging. 

**Price Performance**  
Investing in electronics always boils down to the question of the price-performance ratio. For those running small businesses or working in dynamic roles, the ProBook balances affordability with high-end components like the Ryzen 7 processor and spacious SSD. Sure, other models in this price category might delve into more niche features, but few wrap them up in such an overall professional package, ensuring both security and versatility. Considering its inclusion of Windows 11 Pro with Copilot (a boon, especially if you’re engaging in collaborative tasks), this device leans strongly on the smart spending side of the spectrum.

I feel relaxed when I am making this list bigger and looking for movies that I might find interesting. I feel like this is just the autism in me going strong because it is kind of cathartic more so then actually watching the movies sometimes. This is the list I have going so far, I haven't marked off all the ones I have watched but it is a large large portion of them.

If you have anything you think I could/should add feel free to suggest! or if you want to steal this list go ahead. I still haven't finished putting all the release dates/and remakes if it has one. It might also have some repeats/doubles, I only used gemini to alphabetize the list for me because I couldn't be ass'd to spend the time doing that. I will eventually have these all saved/uploaded on a personal server so I can stream them to any of the TV's in my house or on my back patio for outside movie nights. The list is also way beyond horror including ""forgotten"" TV shows and comedy/family centric movies that I didn't include in this because they aren't really horror movies :D

* WWII (1943): A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft dropped bombs near the city on the night of 11–12 Oct, causing limited damage and casualties.

1mxz9ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1mxz9ay/gallbladder_op_yesterday/,Gallbladder Op Yesterday.,"I had my gallbladder out yesterday. It was inflamed, had multiple stones, and several polyps. My doctor suggested I remove it about 6 months ago, but I had to go travelling. A dull ache a few weeks ago confirmed it was time to take the troublemaker out.

I have had surgeries before (hernia), but I was still a little apprehensive about life without my gallbladder. The surgery itself was smooth. Going under general anaesthetic is easy. They asked me about my last holiday and before I could answer, I woke up. The previous time the anaesthesiologist bet me a coffee I could not count to ten. I owe him a cappuccino. If you panic, do not. You are in safe hands. Focus on a positive memory or make a joke to the staff, it really helps.

Recovery has been better than expected. Minimal pain, just some soreness (throat and abdominal) and a bit of back ache. Gas pain was barely noticeable. 

My abdomen was sore but nothing like my hernia surgery. I could walk, go to the toilet, and eat light food (fish, rice, soup, crackers, peaches) the same day. My doctor was pleased and sent me home. I am able to move around at home and do light act activities. I feel great. 

My advice is research hospitals and doctors. Also try not to panic about the anaesthetic since it is over before you know it. 

Expect some soreness but not necessarily severe pain, and always remember it is much safer to remove a bad gallbladder, than to leave it in.

Friends and family will be worried for you, because it's surgery. Some people will fear dump on you but that is their anxiety. It will go smoothly. In my case, if I had left my gallbladder in, I would have been at risk from far worse things.

I also used ChatGPT to create a two meal and three meal recovery food and supplement plan, which I will share if anyone is interested.

Both parents, older brother.

Constant fights at home when I was little, I was verbally and emotionally abused at school, always had problems with people. At home: a devouring mother and an absent (not physically, but emotionally) father.

Today (or better to say, for more than half of my life) I’ve been dead physically - constantly exhausted, zero energy, zero strength, zero motivation, zero zest for life. I’m physically dead, while in my head I can imagine everything going well, but it all seems unattainable.

How can I deal with life and its hardships, how can I solve my problems if I have no energy or strength for it?

I feel like my wings and testicles have been cut off and that all I can do is just watch.

My plan is to return to therapy (I’ve tried several, unsuccessfully) and to pharmacotherapy if needed (none of the medications worked for me and they usually made things worse).

It feels like nothing is allowed for me in life, and that what I want is impossible. That everything that works for others doesn’t work for me. That everything valid for others isn’t valid for me. How it is for others, it isn’t for me.

Also, it seems that my mother and I are eating each other’s tails and going in circles. I am her reflection, and she is mine. Like those two Spidermen pointing fingers at each other.

I need to get out of the house and finally start earning more and become financially independent. But how can I achieve that if I’m dead inside? I’m so tired.

Everything I do by force quickly hits a plateau because I burn out.

What I mean by “things that usually work for others but not for me” - for energy: caffeine, whether coffee or energy drinks, just makes me sleepy, anxious, and depressed. Sugar gives others a boost of energy, for me it causes depression and anxiety. Cigarettes – same. Alcohol – same. Pornography – for some people it’s relaxing, for me it makes things even worse. Even daytime naps – for others refreshing, for me they just make me sleepier and I usually wake up feeling even more depressed.

In relation to Jung I feel like I'm not alone here with all of these. I wonder if anyone can help me out what can I do? Currently reading Orthodox Christianity related books and Robert Johnson book about Shadow

1mxz7ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mxz7ig/ready_to_start_dating_advice/,Ready to start dating! Advice?,"30 years old and im ready to go on my first date. Heres some caveats:

1. I dont know where to meet a lady. I refuse to download a dating app, create a social media, or attend a local meetup. I dont have any friends and i hate going out mostly because staying at home is more comfortable. I go to costco alot so i was thinking id start there.

2. I cant figure out where the first date should be. Anything that costs over $30-40 is a no go. I hate coffee, and walking around the park is boring and unproductive. I dont really like doing things that i dont enjoy doing. That leaves work, gym, video games and doomscrolling. Maybe they could go to  jury duty with me.

3. I heard chicks like communication. However i hate texting, its too much work. Im not really a talker. I dont really care to hear about peoples interests or personal problems. Maybe if the topic is food, money, alcohol or dogs/cats id be interested.

4. Anything romantic is extremely cringe to me. Flowers, holding hands, dancing, expressing emotions, marriage, having kids.. all of these are off the table for me.  So any chick that likes these things are a red flag for me. I dont enjoy compromises so they will have to make do.

5. I will have to construct a thorough agreement that both parties will sign that makes strict rules on cheating, toxicity, financial misconduct,  and miscommunication. Im thinking of adding the following articles:

1. Exclusivity: No romantic/sexual interactions with others. Cheating results in termination, $10,000 fine, and loss of Trust Fund.

2.  Anti-Toxicity: No yelling, manipulation, or silent treatment >24 hours. Mandatory bi-weekly therapy. Violations lead to warnings, fines, or termination.

3.  Financial Protections: Full transparency, no stealing. Joint expenses tracked. Theft = termination, repayment x2, legal action.

4.  Communication: Daily check-ins, shared passwords, constant location tracking. Violations = $500 fine, probation.

5.  Trust Fund: $500/month each to escrow. Innocent party gets 100% upon breakup; at-fault gets 0%. Minimum $10,000 before breakup.

6.  Monthly Meetings: First Sunday, 2 hours, discuss satisfaction and issues. Missing = $1,000 fine.

7.  Time Allocation: 10 hours/week for friends/family, 5 hours/week personal time. Violations = fines, reduced joint time.

8.  Additional Rules: Weekly STD tests, chore division, social media approval, no sharing private details. Breakup requires 30-day notice.

9.  Enforcement: Fines to Trust Fund, disputes via arbitration, governed by [State/Country] law.
Signatures: Both parties and notary sign to enact.

1mxz7co,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1mxz7co/reveal_the_truth_behind_clarks_concrete_wax_for/,Reveal the Truth Behind CLARKS Concrete Wax for Stone Surfaces,"Testing the CLARKS 853324008333 soapstone and concrete wax has been an interesting experience. As someone who is meticulous about maintaining different surfaces at home, I was definitely curious about how this product would hold up in real, everyday use. This wax is advertised as protective and nourishing, targeting materials like soapstone, concrete, and butcher blocks. Packed with natural ingredients like beeswax, Carnauba wax, and citrus extracts, it promises to not only preserve surfaces but also offer a polished, revitalized look. But does it deliver?

**Appearance and Design**

The packaging of this product feels simple yet functional. Housed in a compact, lightweight container (just 6 ounces), it’s easy to handle and store. The jar has a clean design, and the screw-top lid ensures there’s no spillage. This type of container also makes it convenient to scoop out just the right amount of wax without creating a mess. What I noticed immediately when opening it was the light yet pleasant scent of citrus, a mix of orange and lemon oils, which adds a nice touch when applying.

**Ease of Use**

This is probably my favorite thing about using this product. Application couldn’t be easier—you just rub it on the intended surface, let it sit for a bit to absorb, and then buff off any extra wax with a soft cloth or the CLARKS applicator pads (though I used an old microfiber cloth, and it worked perfectly fine). I used it to treat my soapstone kitchen counters, and the transformation was surprising. The material looked richer and more polished almost immediately after the wax settled in. Honestly, it felt like a very short DIY project that left my counters looking like a professional resurfacing job.

[Check CLARKS 853324008333 price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b07n4zdrrw/)

**Key Benefits**

- Creates a non-greasy protective barrier with Carnauba wax and beeswax
- Suitable for multiple surfaces, including soapstone, concrete, and butcher block
- Packed with natural, food-safe ingredients for added safety
- Simple to use: rub, absorb, buff
- Comes with ample coverage for larger areas or heavy-duty jobs  

**Performance on Different Surfaces**

This wax does a stellar job across various surfaces. My soapstone counters felt smooth and looked as if they’d been professionally refurbished. Then I tried it on a concrete coffee table that's been through coffee spills and daily wear. Again, it turned the surface from tired and flat to shiny and well-protected. It even worked brilliantly on a butcher block cutting board. The food-safe formula of the wax was a reassurance—knowing I could treat the board without worrying about it being unsafe for meal prep put me at ease. 

What stood out to me here is the versatility. While some products claim to be “multi-purpose,” this one genuinely delivered on that front. Whether tackling small counters or larger slabs, it seems capable of handling almost everything domestic life throws its way.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- A bit pricey compared to one-surface-specific wax/polish treatments
- The citrus scent, while pleasant, might not appeal to individuals who prefer odorless products
- Requires regular reapplication for optimal results, particularly in high-use areas  

**Other Options**

In a market full of surface protectors, a few rivals come close. Products like Howard’s Butcher Block Conditioner and Daddy Van’s All-Natural Beeswax Polish are popular choices. Howard’s is well-suited for butcher blocks and cutting boards, offering similar food-grade formulas but lacks the versatility across stone and concrete. On the other hand, Daddy Van’s works great for wood but doesn’t quite transition to modern stone surfaces either. What sets this wax apart is the thoughtfulness in accommodating a wide range of materials like soapstone, slate, and concrete while staying food-safe—a rare combination.

**Price-to-Quality Ratio**

While the initial purchase might seem slightly steep compared to alternatives, the value is evident once you start using it. The small amount you need per application stretches the container's lifespan, and its versatility across multiple surface types means fewer additional products to buy. In the long run, it feels like a smart investment for anyone looking to preserve surfaces without juggling numerous solutions. If maintaining your counters and boards is a priority, this product is undoubtedly worth considering.

I'm planning on starting out with 16:8 for a while before transitioning into 18:6, & skipping dinner because it's going to work better with my school schedule. Also the last time I tried IF I was skipping breakfast and it was pretty miserable of me. 

So, a question for all fellow dinner skippers - what are your tips for getting through the evening of your fasts? I plan to stop eating around 1-2pm. My best friend skips breakfast & he just drinks black coffee to hold him over until his fast is over. What's our equivalent? Electrolytes, herbal teas? Open to any suggestions!

Stoked & nervous to get started. Cheers everyone! ",4,1755949084.0,intermittentfasting,8,1.0,False

Local traffic law nerd here! I’ve noticed some confusion at newer intersections like westbound 66 and North Epworth that have a red right turn *arrow*, so let’s clear this up with Indiana law.

According to the Indiana Driver’s Manual (2025 edition, page 34, Chapter 6, for those of you who keep it on your nightstand), you can absolutely turn right on a red arrow, just like a regular red light, as long as it’s safe and there’s no “No Turn on Red” sign staring you down. The manual says: “To turn right through an intersection with a red light or arrow, when permissible, you must come to a full stop, check to make sure that there are no vehicles and pedestrians in the path of your turn or about to enter the path of your turn, check that there is not a ‘No Turn on Red’ sign and use the correct lane.” There you go. Red arrow, red light, same rules. Stop, look, turn if it’s clear.

The law itself, Indiana Code 9-21-3-7(b)(3)(B), says this: “Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn described in this subdivision, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after coming to a complete stop, may cautiously enter the intersection to... (i) Make a right turn.” That “steady red signal” bit includes red arrows, so you’re good to go unless a sign says otherwise.

Now, I’m a firm believer you don’t have to turn on red just because the guy behind you is honking like he’s late for a BOGO sale at Schnucks. It’s your car, your choice. Wanna sit there sipping your coffee, blasting Luke Bryan, waiting for green? Live your truth. I just wanted you to know that you *could* turn if you choose to.

Chapter 1 Olivia’s POVMay 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.I clutched the file in my hands , forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.“Just a few spots to sign.”Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn’t come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’My throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.‘We do’, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.“Come in,” I said.Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.“Luna Olivia,”",1,1755948342.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1mxyv1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1mxyv1w/explore_paula_hansen_lipstick_to_see_if_it_truly/,Explore Paula Hansen Lipstick to See If It Truly Changes Color,"The first time I tried the Paula Hansen Transferproof Color Changing Lipstick, my curiosity piqued instantly. It promised a transformative experience with vibrant colors tailored to your pH level, and I was eager to see if this beauty gem could deliver. With a name that included ""Gold Crystal"" and ""24-Hour Moisturizing,"" the allure was undeniable. To truly dive deep, I used it daily for a couple of weeks, testing it in different settings—from busy office days to long social gatherings. Here's an honest perspective on why it’s a standout product, along with areas where it could be improved.

**Exceptional Color Transformation**  
The most appealing feature of this lipstick is its unique ability to adapt to your pH level, creating a custom shade that feels almost magical. Each time I applied it, I noticed the color morphing into a universally flattering pinkish hue that enhanced my natural lip color. Unlike many gimmicky products claiming similar effects, this one seemed to genuinely live up to its promise. Friends kept asking if I was wearing a different shade each day, even though it was the same tube! 

[Ready to snag Paula Hansen Transferproof Color Changing Lipstick? See Amazon’s price.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0f58swyc3/)

**Long-Lasting Formula That Works**  
One of the features that immediately caught my attention was its smudge-proof and transfer-resistant claim. Testing it during lunch breaks and while sipping coffee, I found it rarely, if ever, left any stains on cups or cutlery. Even after several hours of wear, the color stayed vibrant, and I didn’t feel the need for constant reapplication. However, it does slightly fade after eating greasy foods, which is typical for even the best lipsticks out there.  

**Great Moisturizing Abilities**  
I often struggle with lipsticks drying out my lips by midday, so I appreciated this product's nourishing ingredients. Enriched with natural oils and antioxidants, it left my lips feeling soft and hydrated for most of the day. The lightweight formula was non-sticky and applied smoothly, which made it even more enjoyable to use. Even during winter days when my lips tend to crack, it performed admirably, though I’d still suggest applying a hydrating balm underneath if your lips are extremely dry.  

**Suitable For Various Occasions**  
Whether I wore this lipstick casually at home or paired it with dramatic eye makeup for a dinner party, it felt appropriate every time. Its glossy shine isn’t too overwhelming, so even minimalists can appreciate it. On the other hand, the groundbreaking color change feature adds enough intrigue to elevate your look during special events. It’s versatile enough to suit a wide range of outfits and occasions.  

**Merits**  
- Changes color based on pH level for a personalized touch  
- Moisturizing yet non-sticky texture  
- Glossy and long-lasting finish that resists smudging  
- Comfortable for extended wear without drying  

**Drawbacks**  
- Fades slightly with oily food consumption  
- Some users might prefer a matte option instead of a glossy finish  

**Competing Products**  
Compared with other color-changing lipsticks in the market, this one stands out for its superior color intensity and long-lasting finish. Brands like Moodmatcher offer similar pH-responsive lips products but often lag in longevity or hydration. Drugstore alternatives generally feel more drying than the Paula Hansen lipstick, particularly after a few hours of wear. High-end competitors such as Dior Addict Glow Balm also provide customizable colors, yet they come at a substantially higher price point and don’t last as long before reapplication is necessary. For value and performance, this lipstick strikes a very sweet spot.  

**Value for Money**  
This is where the Paula Hansen Transferproof Color Changing Lipstick truly shines. While the price slightly leans toward the premium segment of drugstore lipsticks, its impressive features justify the cost. Long-lasting wear, combined with hydration and color customization, means it offers more than just your average beauty product. When stacked against pricier competition, it delivers outstanding results at a fraction of the cost. There’s no denying the bang-for-the-buck appeal here.

China recently decided to [take](https://www.livemint.com/market/market-stats/stocks-take-solutions-share-price-nse-bse-s0003229) new interim measures to protect its rare earths industry. In this regard, interim measures for the control and management of its rare earths mining, smelting and separation activities were released on Friday, August 23, *ABC* news reported.

The world's dominant supplier of the critical minerals released a list of rules applicable to both rare earths originating in the country and those that are sent to China for refining.

The regulations published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology require companies to comply with the following regulations

* **Companies dealing with minerals key to electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence sectors must possess government approval for rare earths.**
* **Companies are required to comply with the alotted quotas for various minerals.**
* **They are also required to accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled.**
* **Penalties will be imposed on violators who will have to face the consequences of their quotas for rare earths getting reduced.**

# US-China trade war

Earlier this year, US tightened controls on its access to advanced computing semiconductors. Since then, China started tightening restrictions on exports of 17 rare earth elements, including germanium, gallium and titanium.

In April, China announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths after US President Donald Trump's tariff raft. Notably, the second-most populous country of the world commands control over nearly half of the world's known reserves of rare earths. However, significant amounts of rare earths is imported from Myanmar for processing and export.

As advanced technology manufacturers in the US and elsewhere began to fear the impact of a fall in supply of vital materials needed for production which prompted China-US trade talks.

**Recently, the US rolled back some export restrictions, this easing of rules allowed US firms to increase chip sales in China. In response, China announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports. China dominates rare earths processing as it supplies nearly 90% of the world’s rare earths. It mines about 70% of such minerals.**

Critical minerals — such as aluminum, gallium and lithium — are foundational to products ranging from everyday electronics to “nearly every advanced weapon system, communications platform and sensor” needed for homeland defense, Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, said in a keynote speech at a recent forum hosted by Critical Materials America.

The F-35 fighter jet, for example, requires nearly half a ton of rare earth materials to operate, he said.

China holds a near-monopoly on these minerals, controlling more than 60 percent of the world’s mining and more than 85 percent of processing, Gooden said. Recently, supply chain issues and trade disputes with Beijing have sparked mineral shortages in the United States — shortages significant enough for the Defense Logistics Agency to consider drawing from its emergency stockpiles.

Conflict escalations in an increasingly tense national security landscape could mean the United States losing access to critical materials, vastly diminishing military readiness, Gooden said.

“In today’s world, military power is no longer just measured by the number of ships, tanks or aircraft we possess,” Gooden said. “It’s also defined by our access to the materials that make them work.”

Wen Song, assistant professor of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, said while the United States is home to enough critical minerals to meet the world’s needs, the challenge has been figuring out how to extract the elements from the earth in an economic manner.

“The future of American defense hinges on our ability to secure these resources domestically,” Gooden said. “Recognizing this risk, the \[Defense Department\], in coordination with Congress, industry and allies, has begun to take proactive steps. … But we’ve got to do more.”

The Defense Department’s recent $400 million investment in MP Materials, a U.S.-based company that extracts and processes rare earth elements, was one of those “proactive steps.” The public-private partnership will result in MP Materials’ second domestic magnet manufacturing facility to serve both defense and commercial customers, as well as add greater capabilities to its existing California facility, according to a company release.

Meanwhile, General Atomics subsidiary Grants Energy in January announced an incoming uranium mining facility in northwest New Mexico, which will have the capacity to meet up to 15 percent of the nation’s demand for uranium. The project is slated to begin production in the early 2030s, said Chris Frankland, director of sales and marketing at Nuclear Fuels Corp., another General Atomics subsidiary.

The Trump administration has also recently put forward executive orders calling for an increase in American mineral production. Awareness of the critical minerals issue is rising in Washington, said Gooden, noting that his colleagues in Congress “are becoming more interested in this and recognizing the problems that we face.”

However, the critical minerals conversation still sometimes gets “lost in the shuffle,” as realizing a dilemma is a far cry from devising and implementing effective solutions, he added.

“It’s a problem that everyone recognizes, but few are delivering very solid responses and solutions for how to tackle this,” Gooden said.

Fluctuating market prices have also been a roadblock for the domestic critical minerals industry, said Brandi O’Brien, land quality administrator at the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.

For example, when uranium purchases first began to move outside the United States and prices became depressed, operators like those in Wyoming began putting their facilities on standby, waiting and “hoping the prices were going to get up,” O’Brien said.

“It’s difficult to stay in business when you can’t produce your product at a profit,” she said. Then, once prices improve, it is difficult for operators to rapidly respond to the new market conditions and restore the workforce and necessary supplies to the site that was previously on standby.

O’Brien also noted complications with outdated regulations, illustrating the need for government entities to employ “a clear and predictable regulatory pathway” featuring open communication with operators.

**Stephen Colovas, co-founder and co-managing director of Critical Materials America, said while progress has been made, the United States must do more to achieve critical mineral independence.**

**“To achieve American leadership in this space, we must overcome complex regulatory and environmental hurdles,” Colovas said. “We have gaps in private sector innovation, and we need more research and development with universities and national labs. Finally, and most importantly, we need to address a widespread lack of public awareness.”**

**“Critical materials policy is no longer just a resource issue,” Colovas said. “It’s at the center of our national security debate.”**

# AUGUST 22nd, 2025~Vulcan Elements enters US rare earth magnet manufacturing race 

[Vulcan Elements enters US rare earth magnet manufacturing race  - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/vulcan-elements-enters-us-rare-earth-magnet-manufacturing-race/)

https://preview.redd.it/vzrpywtfsqkf1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=9308520468762745ded08e8e2a3c568a28ad86dd

When US-based rare earth magnet manufacturer Vulcan Elements announced this week it signed[ a supply deal](https://www.mining.com/web/vulcan-elements-signs-rare-earths-supply-deal-with-reelement-technologies/) with ReElement Technologies, the financial terms were undisclosed, but the companies said that the price is “significantly below” the floor of $110 per kilogram that the US Department of Defense[ guaranteed to MP Materials last month](https://www.mining.com/mp-materials-lands-multi-billion-pentagon-deal/).

Rare earth metals are essential in heavy magnets that power electric vehicles, consumer electronics and military applications, and MP Materials is the only US producer, out of its Mountain Pass mine in California. 

While [China dominates the global rare earth industry](https://www.mining.com/infographic-who-controls-the-rare-earths-shaping-the-future/), controlling the vast majority of the world’s rare earth processing and refining capacity, Vulcan Elements’ vision is to provide domestic supply with pricing viable in the US market and beyond.    

“This pricing will enable Vulcan to be competitive in global markets,” Vulcan CEO John Maslin told *Reuters*. “We wanted to make sure the unit economics made sense.”

Last week, the privately-held North Carolina-based start up [ unveiled it has raised $65 million](https://www.mining.com/us-rare-earth-magnet-startup-raises-65m-to-scale-up-production/) in Series A funding to scale up its planned buildout of a commercial-scale facility in Durham. 

That announcement came only a day after Vulcan posted on its website that its domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability [ won the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation](https://www.metal-powder.tech/vulcan-elements-wins-us-maritime-innovation-award-for-rare-earth-magnets/) for Maritime Readiness Challenge with support from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Industrial Base Consortium. 

Over 400 manufacturing companies competed for the award, but Vulcan has, until now, avoided the spotlight.  

“We’ve been fairly quiet intentionally, and that’s because we want to put our money where our mouths are,” Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin told [MINING.com](http://MINING.com) in an interview. 

“We want to execute. And now that we’re doing that, we have a lot of additional work to do where we have to execute much further at a much larger scale,” he said. “We want to show and not just tell. So now is the right time.” 

The company is specifically producing neodymium iron boron magnets – and [boron is a big blind spot](https://www.mining.com/critical-mineral-boron-the-best-supporting-actor-of-us-magnet-supply-chain-5e-ceo/) in the US market.  As with many other critical minerals, efforts are underway to re-shore supply to the US.

Maslin, a former supply chain officer with the Navy’s nuclear energy program, saw the gap working across nuclear shipbuilding and submarine programs. 

“My job was effectively working with the government and appropriations and then taking that and helping finance and procure materials and components for nuclear reactors,” Maslin said.  

“I was thinking a lot about the critical components that were going to be fundamental, not just for defense, but for critical economic industries, the 21st century technology race –  semiconductors, batteries, rare earth magnets,” Maslin remembered. 

“The way that we think about it internally is if you think about your own body, a semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine. It converts electricity into motion. Everyone was focused on semiconductors and batteries at the time.

“No one was thinking about the third leg of that stool, which is a rare earth magnet. The next generation technologies, either commercially or defense related, drones, data centers that enable AI, robotics, hybrid electric vehicles, et cetera, satellites, aerospace applications, you need all three.”

“But functionally, we knew that China made over 90% of the global supply and that the US made less than 1% and that the demand for these magnets was going exponential, and there needed to be diversity and resiliency in the West.” 

Maslin said that all of Vulcan Elements’ materials, whether rare earths or the electrolytic iron or the boron or ferroboron, have traceability down to the mine where that’s coming from, and that feedstock is sourced from US and allied partners.

# One of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in decades 

Maslin met Vulcan’s co-founder, Peter Kulik, who had opened one of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in two decades at the University of Central Florida. 

“We said, this is a problem that is too important not to address. We went to the Department of Energy, and we validated our own chemistries with their scientists,” Maslin said. “We made several different grades of magnets, then built a pilot facility.” 

The plan was to have the plant online by Q1 2025, fully decoupled from China down to the equipment, software, and material level. 

“We opened our doors on March 31st of this year,” Maslin said. “It is a blend of defense and commercial across several different verticals and industries\*\*.\*\* We have started to deliver and qualify magnets with customers. 100% of our material is US or allied. We either get it from recycled end-of-life magnets, or directly from miners in the US and Canada and Australia, parts of Africa, parts of South America. Nothing from an entity of concern.” 

The company is now moving to large-scale commercial, doing a multi-state site search.

“We’re going to go to several hundred tons over the next 18 to 24 months. The goal is to have several thousand tons online by the end of this decade,” Maslin said. 

**Vulcan is currently producing a mix of samples and low-volume production.**

**“A lot of it right now is qualification, making sure that we’re hitting the grades that we’re actually delivering the products that customers need.  We’re at the point where we’re getting to actually do that with our customers who are very eager to have resilience in their supply chain.**

**“We have a lot of work to do to deliver even higher performing grades – but we’re moving with the speed and seriousness that this mission and this moment need.”**

# IMHO~Bottom line:

# NioCorp is: A Strategic U.S. Asset at the Intersection of Policy, Supply Chain, and Innovation

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is rapidly emerging as one of the most strategically aligned critical mineral developments in North America. With a diversified portfolio spanning niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earth elements, **NioCorp is positioned to supply essential materials for next-generation energy systems, clean hydrogen, small modular reactors (SMRs), aerospace, and defense platforms. Unlike single-resource peers, NioCorp offers vertical integration potential across key industries — from EVs and fuel cells to directed-energy systems and stealth materials**

# — ""Making it far more than a rare earth magnet play!""

The company is advancing through a powerful convergence of operational progress and national policy momentum. With Phase 1 drilling complete and a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) due in Q4 2025, NioCorp is poised for major revaluation events. At the same time, macro and political catalysts are accelerating, including a proposed $2 billion reallocation from the CHIPS and Science Act for U.S. critical minerals — a move that directly aligns with NioCorp’s outputs. Backed by a $10M DoD award, engagement with EXIM Bank, and roles in national lab programs, Elk Creek is already embedded in U.S. federal supply chain strategies.

As the U.S. intensifies efforts to reshore strategic materials and reduce dependence on China, NioCorp represents a rare, shovel-ready project capable of delivering four critical inputs to priority sectors. With institutional and strategic interest likely building behind the scenes, the next 4–6 months — including the resource update, DFS, and potential anchor investment — may be transformational. **In short, NioCorp is not just a mining project; it is a potential linchpin in America’s clean energy and defense future.**

1mxyu5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1mxyu5e/my_first_and_only_breakthrough/,My first and only breakthrough,"I’m writing this down because I have finally come to accept this reality. 

It started one night with me and 21 grams of mushrooms. I had built my tolerance up to the point where I could do large doses and not be severely affected. 

I had been constantly been taking higher and higher doses looking for an ego death. I had never fully given in to experience full visions or ego death. 

I think what made it hit really hard this time is that I took a month tolerance break before eating the mushrooms. 

In total I had one chocolate bar, and 20 grams of dried mushrooms. Before I went to sleep I ate all 20 grams of mushrooms and I ate 4 pieces of the chocolate bar which was roughly 1 gram. 

When I went tried to sleep it was around 11:30 I woke up suddenly two hours later at one am. I checked my phone and looked around.

 The darkness itself took form and shifted into beings. 

These beings had masks similar in appearance to Melpomene masks. But each of them had a different emotion. If you’ve ever seen Spirited away it was similar to no face. 

Except these beings had black skin tight suits with these masks. They morphed into reality itself and when I looked out the window one of these beings turned into the night sky and moon.

I had no depth perception, it was as if I was watching the curtains unveil and a  school play form right in front of me. 

As I was staring outside the window the light in my apartment complex go out. I heard the neighbors scream “Ya se fue la luz”

For you people who don’t know Spanish that roughly translates to “the electricity has gone out” 

Then it hit me, the fear rushed to my body. I couldn’t tell if I was tripping or not anymore. I fully forgot I even took anything. The sky and the moon then shifted back into these beings. Their presence and height couldn’t be made out as there was no depth perception. 

They stood over me and pointed and moved their chest and bodies as if they were laughing yet they made no sound. Think of them as mimes. 

These beings then proceeded to show me realities where I had no control. 

They morphed into the gym I usually go to and planted me in there. They let me gain consciousness but made me forget I had taken anything. 

I was working out in the gym as usual when I noticed an old guy who is usually at the gym who looks native. 

Except when I noticed this man he had a necklace adorned in gem stones and feathers . He then stared back at me and when he did… suddenly everyone in the gym stopped & dropped what they were doing and also stared at me. 

Having every single head in the gym jerk and stare at me was frightening. As soon as I realized this wasn’t normal the roof got torn on by one of these same beings from earlier. It had the smiling mask on its face. 

This being reached down and grabbed me and shoved me into the mouth of its mask. 
Except I didn’t fall into its throat or anything. I was simply transported into another reality. 

This time I was transported into one of those sitcom looking suburban areas. These houses were big two story houses that looked copy and pasted for miles and miles. I was looking at this from a third person point of view. When suddenly I was looking at this from a point of view of a pit bull. 

I saw the paper boy from my the front yard and I chased after him down the street. When he got down the road I was suddenly shifted back from a third person point of view. 

Like the point of view of a drone. When it started rising I saw the whole area morph back into the beings. The road morphed into a being with a skin tight grey suit and a white mask. The grass & hills morphed into a being with a green suit. 

The sky and sun morphed into a being with a blue suit and white mask. It was as if they were popping out from a screen. Again I had no depth perception as if everything was just an illusion. 

As soon as I had that thought these beings finally talked. They said nonsense that translated both into “You’re finally figuring things out/You’re begging to forget” 

It sounded as if they were saying these both but only speaking once. Think of it as the whole Yanny/Laurel thing. I would hear one thing and then the other despite them making the same noise. 

I was then transported into another reality. This time I was I was in my school, I was looking at my classmate and thought “damn, I wish I could fuck her” 

When suddenly she burst out laughing, “You’re a freak wanting to fuck yourself” 
I looked at her in disbelief and said what? 

When suddenly I could hear everyone’s voices in my head as they ridiculed me. They pointed out every single bad thing I had done. Every single desire I had had. Even my most private and personal experiences. 

They all laugh and pointed at me morphing into everyone I had ever met. Yet I could tell there were only 6 beings in total. They constantly morphed into different people and chanted “he’s finally figured it out, he’s begging to forget”. 

Much the same as the beings from before. When I realized this I was horrified and wet myself in the vision. This only added fuel to the flame and made everyone laugh harder. 

They said,
“Oh man. You’ve only been interacting with yourself” “what an absolute loser” 
My ex suddenly looked at me morphed herself into me

The girl I had thought about having sex with also suddenly morphed into me and laughed maniacally. 

“We’ve been telling you to come to our side but you refuse over and over again. You’d rather play these games with yourself than face reality and come with us” 

Then the whole classroom morphed into me and back into the masked beings. They proceeded to point and laugh at me yet they made no sound once again. 

Then suddenly I was transported into another reality. This time I was the hasbro operation game. These 6 doctors were operating on me. They constantly hit the metal wire and set off these funny alarms and sounds. 

They said “UH OHHHH WE’RE LOOOOOSING HIMMM” 

Their voices would go from slow pitched to high pitch. When suddenly one of these beings morphed back into the black suit and white mask and reached into the board/me and grabbed my heart and manually started pumping it. 

Just breathe and you’ll be okay they said, I felt my lungs fill up with air and the beeping of a heart monitor went from flatlining to beeping once again. 

Another being said “UH OHHHH, HEEEE’REEE WE GO AGAIIINNNN!!” 

I was then suddenly transported into a laboratory with 5 different classmates and one professor. One of these kids said 

“Professor we’ve finally done it!! We finally found the elixir to immortality! If my calculations are correct this should finally work!!” 

“Should we test it?” Another classmate chimed in. 

“I don’t see why not” the professor said 

“We’ll do it as a group!” The others chimed in. 

Everyone looked at each other and agreed. We split the elixir into vials with equal parts and we collectively drank as a group. 

Then suddenly a wormhole appeared in the middle of the class, I could feel myself being sucked in alongside the others. Then the black hole suddenly disappeared and we were once again in the class. 

Except we were stuck in the class, it had been transported into a reality of nothingness. When we opened the door there was nothing outside the class. Only darkness. We started to freak out and tried to figure a way out. 

When we stepped out the classroom we only floated in empty space. Yet when we went back into the class we were still floating. 

We could seemingly control if we floated or not. It was fun at first but we soon grew tired of “zero gravity” we were able to also control things around us and move them through telekinesis. No matter how much we seemed to walk or float we made no progress. 

The classroom was the same distance no matter what we did. We soon floated back into the class and tried to brainstorm a way to reverse this. 

Except it was futile. Nothing we did worked, nothing we did mattered. Millenia passed yet we did not age. We were stuck in time, helpless. 

“There’s nothing we can do, nothing we do works. There’s no returning back to our reality, our normal” said the professor. 

“I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!” One of the classmates screamed.  

“I’m going to end this once and for all, a life like this isn’t worth living” the same classmate these proceeded to bang their heads on the table until they were a bloody mess and fell back. 

When we all went to look they were laying on the floor with a peaceful smile on their face. 

The professor said, “looks like that’s the only way our children” 

The whole experience itself was similar to a mushroom trip. 

“I can’t accept that I can’t just kill myself. What the fuck is wrong with you guys. There must be a way out. I can’t simply just accept this and kill myself” I said

The other classmates  looked at me in disbelief and with a sorry expression. 

“None of this FUCKING MATTERS” I said. 

I started flipping over tables and throwing things. I even lay down my finger flat against my teeth the long way and bit down into my finger as hard as possible. Except I couldn’t go through with biting my finger off. 

I just lay there on the floor crying. Everyone gathered around me and just stared. 

When suddenly my surroundings morphed around me once again. This time I was on the floor in my living room. Except it was as if only my living room was transported into a jungle. 

My mother came up to me and asked “why are you crying son? What happened, why are you on the floor? 

I looked around in disbelief and the first thought that came to mind was to point at my brother and yell.  

“It’s all his fault, he’s the reason this happened”

My brother appeared on a tree behind her, he was on a branch. He started jumping side to side and pointing and laughing at me. 

He transformed into a little monkey with a cap and proceeded to do the same motion ridiculing me. 

All my family came to stare at me, it was my mom and dad and 3 brothers and 1 sister. 

(Notice how it’s all 7 people including me? This theme resonated throughout the whole experience. The same 6 beings, if you include me it’s 7. The rest of this earth is just me pretending to be other people.) 

(Back to the story now) 

My mom then preceded to roll her eyes except her eyeballs rolled around her sockets and into her skull. Transforming into one of the beings. 

“No silly, you did this to yourself. All of this is just you, why can’t you understand that?“ 

The rest of my family proceeded to transform once again into these 6 beings and chanted “You’re finally figuring it out/ You’re begging to forget”

It sounded like both of these things yet then only making the same noise over and over again. 

I was suddenly transported onto a world that looked like the surface of mars. There were tall buildings that looked futuristic yet ancient at the same time. Buildings that looked like Greek architecture made out of white stone, light, metal. 

It looked as if reality was collapsing in on itself. These buildings were collapsing and on fire. Chunks of the sky itself was falling and crashing into the ground causing even more chaos. It looked like the aftermath of a nuclear war. 

These 6 beings transformed into white cloaks with crowned wreaths made out of leaves. They were all running into beams of light like a beam that a ufo would make except there was no ufo. Just a beam of light coming straight out of the sky. 

“Come on!! You have to come with us” one of the beings said who had shifted into a beautiful woman. 

“NO!! I want to stay here. I’m scared. I don’t want to go with you guys. Just leave me” I said 

She rolled her eyes at me and said “Suit yourself, you’ll be nothing but lonely. This is your last chance. We won’t come back for you” she said 

I ignored her and layed in the floor and morphed into reality itself. I then got transpired into nothing ness. I was just in deep empty space. Forever alone. 

I then saw myself recreating reality, living countless and thousands of lives. I saw myself start out as a cave man. 

My mother was in a cave with me. She had a torch similar to a candle. She and my dad were also cave man attire.  

“Whats wrong with him?” My dad asked 

It was in a language unfamiliar to me yet I understood everything. 

“Idk my mom said, he took some mushrooms and now he’s acting like this” 

She grabbed my face and shined the light into my eyes. 

“Here,  just drink some water and it will all be okay my son. Everything will be okay just drink water”

In the cave I repeatedly called out for my mother, I could see her in front of me yet to me she was far away. My depth perception was off. 

“Yes?” She said, when I heard her reply back I simply said “Nevermind” 

She just looked at me confused and started crying, as did my father. 

Then reality itself once shifted into me in my bed. 

These beings hovered over me and said “once again you broke the illusion. Yet every single time you awaken you refuse to accept your reality. You would rather blind and numb yourself than face the consequences. We’re growing really tired of having so fix your fuck ups. If you do this one more time we might not be able to fix it. Now go back to your silly previous pathetic life and enjoy way you so desperately cling on to”

I woke up again this time for real. I looked around me and saw my room a complete mess. It was 6 am when I woke up. 

The power was out for reals and didn’t come back on until 8 am. 

I showered and changed clothes as I had really pissed myself. I later found out from my siblings that they did in fact find me and were holding candles because the power was out. My mother had given me water to drink and told me to lay down and just relax. 

My room was a mess, I had flipped over my coffee table that is 4x4 feet and weighs at least 100 pounds. Things scattered everywhere, all over the room. 

This happened in 2023, it took my two years to come to acceptance with this. And yet I still believe to accept what I’ve learned and what those beings were trying to get through to me. 

All of us are just one being trying so desperately not to feel lonely. We’d rather be stuck in this illusion than deal with the consequences. ",2,1755948071.0,enlightenment,2,1.0,False
1mxyu2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mxyu2t/i_manage_a_house_where_every_tenant_disappears/,I manage a house where every tenant disappears after 1 month,"The third tenant was a pale guy, tattoos all over his arm, and a large piercing in his ear. 

He looked sick and walked slowly. He told me he wanted to live in that house to get over his past, and I didn’t want to ask for details. What really caught him was the forest view from the porch.

He signed the contract on the spot, and the very next day his moving truck was parked in the garage.

Two weeks later I realized I’d left my folder with some documents in the house and called the guy. No answer. I decided to drive out there and found the place empty, which was strange. He’d brought a lot of stuff during the move.

His car wasn’t in the garage, but I rang the bell anyway. Nothing. The door was unlocked, and I stepped inside, convinced something was wrong.

But there was nothing to see. The house was empty, no furniture, dusty, just like it had been when I first showed it to him.

***

A few months earlier, while eating breakfast, I got a call from a property owner who said she’d found me on Instagram. She told me she needed an experienced, fast-moving realtor to handle rental contracts for her house. And I lied, said I was that guy, even though I’d only had my license for a little over a year.

Her voice was old, raspy, almost broken, like someone with throat problems. She said she lived abroad, but needed someone local to manage the property. I wouldn’t even have to look for tenants, she said. There was already a list of people interested, and they’d meet me at the house. 

I wasn’t too excited. It didn’t sound like much of an opportunity until she mentioned my commission. I nearly choked on the sandwich I was eating.

I repeated the number back to her, sure she’d made a mistake, but she insisted it was right. That amount would be handed to me, in cash, once the tenant signed and moved in.

The only condition, she said, was that if a contract was broken due to my negligence or choice, I’d have to pay one month’s rent. On paper it didn’t sound bad. I accepted right away.

The next day I went to see the property. It was huge, isolated, no close neighbors. Inside, there were expensive wooden furniture pieces, sculptures, installations that must’ve cost a fortune. 

The porch opened up to a wide view of a forest. Big wooden chairs faced the woods, and the owner made a point of stressing that they could not be moved from their place. I imagined myself retired there, sipping coffee, birdwatching.

Coincidentally, the first tenants were a retired couple escaping the chaos of the city. When they signed, I went home torn between excitement and anxiety. Would the owner really pay me that much? I was broke.

But a few days later, a suitcase showed up at my doorstep with the full amount in cash. Stacks of hundred-dollar bills wrapped in rubber bands.

Weird, yeah, but not weird enough to stop me from trading it in for a new car.

***

About a month later, the owner called again. Said the couple didn’t work out, and new tenants wanted to see the house that day.

I didn’t ask questions. Couldn’t complain about another commission.

This time it was two women, a couple. One was a writer who told me she’d chosen the place to work on her next novel. Signing was easy, and another suitcase of money arrived the same way. 

Life was good, but honestly, I barely had other clients. All my golden eggs were tied to this strange owner I barely knew. Her name and info looked fake. Still, with the new tenants in, I figured I wouldn’t hear from her for a while.

Wrong.

Another month later, same story. The women had left. Another new tenant.

I was happy but suspicious. Why did everyone leave that house so quickly?

Curiosity got me, so I called one of the last tenants. The number didn’t exist anymore.

I tried the old couple too. Same thing.

***

After the third tenant, I tried to forget it. Not my problem. Who cared if they stayed or left? My fat commission was all I needed.

Then, like clockwork, a month later, she called again. This time she sounded excited. Said the new clients were special, and she’d pay me double.

I thought about asking questions, but double was too good. That kind of money could help me put a down payment on an apartment.

I drove to the house determined to sign as fast as possible.

I got there early and snooped around. No sign of anyone ever living there. Not even a pin dropped during moving chaos. Nothing.

When the bell rang, I opened the door to a young couple holding a newborn baby wrapped in a blanket.

I showed them the house, my stomach churning at what I could be part of. 

And of course, they loved it. The dad talked about how his kid would grow up running in the fields, exploring the forest, the childhood he never had.

They signed right away. My hands were shaking when I handed over the paper.

***

The next day was supposed to be their move-in. I went home and couldn’t sleep. Tossed and turned, thinking I might be helping some crime happen.

Around 1 a.m., I gave up and drove back to the house. I needed to check everything with my own eyes.

I searched every corner. Bedrooms, closets, everything. Nothing. But I’d seen three moving trucks unload here. Not a single mark on the floor. Impossible.

I stepped onto the porch, resigned that I’d never figure it out. Sat on one of those big wooden chairs, thinking what I might’ve missed.

That’s when I saw it. Something shiny stuck in a crack in the chair. I pulled it out. It was a piercing, probably from the last tenant. On the needle was a small red stain. Blood.

I reached into the crack again, feeling around, and touched something soft.

I pulled it out.

It was an ear. Darkened, rotten, with a torn hole where the piercing had been ripped out. The third tenant.

I decided to push the chair to see what was underneath it, and with a lot of effort I managed to move it a foot to the side.

On the wooden floor there was a symbol I couldn’t recognize. Circles and shapes carved into the boards right under where the chair had been, like some sort of ritual. There were more traces of blood there.

I froze, staring at it, heart pounding. What snapped me out of it was a laugh that came out of nowhere.

A woman’s laugh, echoing from the darkness of the forest. It started low and distant, but quickly grew louder, hysterical.

Then more laughter followed, all of them female, all coming closer, aimed at me. It was like a whole crowd was hiding in that forest.

The sound grew louder and louder, until my instincts took over. I bolted to my car, started it up, and sped down the road.

***

The next day I called the couple and told them the deal was off. Made up some excuse. They weren’t happy, but I didn’t care.

Soon after, the owner called me again. I didn’t pick up, and blocked her number.

But the calls kept coming, from all sorts of different numbers. I answered one, and it was her voice:

“You broke our pact. The rent will be collected at the end of the month.”

She kept repeating it, and I hung up every time.

I went to the police. They went to the property, found nothing, then came back pissed because I had wasted their time. There were no ears, no marks, no nothing.

Today is the 23rd, and next week the month ends. I keep wondering if I did the right thing, if maybe I should’ve just carried on with that commission.

Every day that passes, I feel the panic building. My phone is always turned off, and I’ve rented a room in a roadside hotel outside the state.

But even here, every night, I [dream of that laugh](https://www.reddit.com/u/Accomplished_Low7889/s/nrNHi7I7q6).

1mxytbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mxytbx/explore_if_breville_bes008_espresso_machine_water/,Explore if Breville BES008 Espresso Machine Water Filter Truly Enhances Your Coffee Quality Review,"The Breville BES008WHT0NUC1 Espresso Machine Water Filter has been a prominent part of my routine, as I’m quite particular about my espresso's taste and my machine's longevity. This ClaroSwiss water filter is a small but mighty gadget that has quickly proven its worth in my daily setup. Touted to reduce chlorine, heavy metals, and minerals, the promise of less maintenance and better espresso flavor was enough to pique my interest. Over a few weeks of testing this filter, I’ve developed quite the take on its performance, ease of use, and who it’s best suited for.

**Simple Setup and User-Friendly Design**  

Installing this filter turned out to be a breeze, and that’s coming from someone who struggles with overly technical instructions. Designed specifically for Breville espresso machines, its compatibility across a range of models made it a suitable choice for my Barista Pro. The compact dimensions—4.72"" by 2.17"", and 1.97"" in height—meant it fit snugly without looking out of place. What impressed me the most was the almost weightless nature of this product at just 2.4 ounces. It’s like the filter knew what it needed to do while staying completely unobtrusive.

[Check Breville BES008WHT0NUC1 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07qq9vfw5/)

**Performance Perks—Cleaner Water Equals Better Coffee**  

Water quality matters—a lesson this filter hammered home from the first cup of coffee. After using it for a few days, the espresso had a crisper flavor profile. That weird metallic or slightly bitter undertone I sometimes noticed was completely gone, which I attribute to the reduction in heavy metal traces and chlorine. It also significantly slowed mineral deposit formation, a bane for espresso machine maintenance. NSF certification adds an extra layer of reliability for the filter's efficiency. If you’re one to judge your mornings by how great your espresso tastes, this could be your secret weapon.

**Maintenance Interval and Longevity**  

Though the product demands a replacement every 90 days, it’s a small price to pay for what it brings to the table. That said, I wish the filter came in multi-packs to streamline replacements. For someone like me, who tends to forget when to switch things out, setting a calendar reminder quickly became a necessity. Still, it's hard to deny its practicality in safeguarding your machine's lifespan while maintaining coffee quality.

**Good Points**  

- Improves espresso flavor by reducing water impurities.  
- Protects the espresso machine by minimizing mineral build-up.  
- Lightweight and easy to install.  
- Compatible with a wide range of Breville machines, making it versatile.  

**Critiques**  

- Requires replacement every three months, which can add up over time.  
- Availability seems limited to single-purchase options, no multi-pack convenience.  

**Alternative Offerings**  

While testing this filter, I couldn’t help but compare it to other contenders I've tried, such as replacement filters for Jura and De’Longhi machines. While these brands also offer commendable inline water filters, the Breville water filter stands out with its build quality and focused design. Jura filters, for example, had a similar impact on mineral deposits but failed to match the level of ease Breville's product delivered during installation. Meanwhile, De’Longhi filters leaned toward better capacity, yet they lack the NSF certification, which boosts confidence in this Breville filter's capability. Comparatively, none provided the same seamless balance of simplicity and performance.

**Worth Every Penny?**  

If you’re on the fence wondering whether this filter justifies its cost, consider how often espresso machine repairs can eat into your budget. It’s decidedly less expensive to opt for preventive care. Coupled with the fact that it noticeably elevates the purity of your espresso, I’d say it’s a worthy addition to any daily coffee ritual. Its affordability, paired with excellent results, places it firmly in the realm of “smart spending.”

1mxysol,https://i.redd.it/hnqqfgbr6rkf1.jpeg,Why I ended a friendship of over 20 years after my wedding,"I (41f) got married to my soul mate (39m) in May this year, we were working with a budget of around £4000 as we were paying for everything ourselves, this included clothes and shoes for us, our 3 kids and my niece who was also a bridesmaid. While planning the wedding (in 2024) my so called friend, let's call her Stacey (not her real name) said she would do a buffet for the evening party for us, she quoted me around £600 which would include the food, her time and also her clearing up during and after the party, I thought this was great so agreed. She also offered to make my bouquets for a a good price but didn't give me a quote at the time. 
A bit of background about Stacey, she is the type of friend that invites you out for coffee or comes to your house for a takeaway night but never has any money to pay. Or offers to do a favour for you but only if you pay her for her time. The type of 'friend' that takes more from the friendship than puts into, well actually doesn't put anything into it at all for free 😂
So at the end of 2024 we are talking about the flowers as I wanted artificial and she quoted me £70 for mine and £30 each for 3 corsages for the bridesmaids - bear in mind she'd already told me it would only cost her £20 total for the stuff to make them. Well I don't really like flowers and as we were working to a tight buget I decided that this was too much, I reimbursed her the £20 she had spent on the stuff and told her to keep it as she could use it for something else. I ended up making sweet bouquets which were a lot cheaper and everyone loved (I've added a picture so you can see them).
On to the buffet, earlier this year she told me she was going on holiday for a few days I May and was due to come home the day before my wedding, so I said that was fine and I would find someone else to do the buffet for me. She said it was ok and she would still do it but asked if I would be able to buy all the  food so she just needed to prepare it, this was fine so I agreed and she gave me a shopping list. We then agreed as I was paying for the shopping that I would give her £200 for her time preparing the food and clearing up the mess during and after the party.
In order to make her job easier, I bought pre-cooked and sliced meats, ready prepared pies, sausage rolls and other 'picky bits' and I personally made the salads including pasta salads and cous cous etc. All that was left for her to do was to make curry and rice, stew, make sandwiches and put things on trays (note to add I bought pre diced meats and veg for the hot food).
The day of the wedding comes and the ceremony and meal was amazing. There was a few hours before the evening party and during this time Stacey sends me a message saying that she can't fit all the food in her car so could we help collect it, no problem my FIL and new husband go to help. As soon as hubby got to her house she told him 'not to start' as she had been on her feet all day, he hasn't even said anything to her at this point and was genuinely grateful for her doing the buffet. The food arrives at the venue 10 minutes before the party started so there wasn't enough time to bring the hot food back to temperature before the buffet would be open an hour late, that's fine, we would open the cold food first and the hot food later.
This is when the first issue occurs, Stacey and her husband (let's call him Dave) who had helped her with the preparation were standing round shouting orders while Me, my husband and some of my early arriving guests set up the buffet; Stacey and Dave very little to help with the set up. The food she had told me to buy was far too much so there were trays upon trays stacked under the table, that's fine we had bought plastic tubs for people to take left overs home. 
During the party one of the things included in my payment to Stacey was for her to go round with a bin bag to collect and dispose of empty food plates, my sister and another one of my guests did this while Stacey sat and fanned herself. My sister likes to keep busy so I thought nothing of this at the time, but found out the next day that my sister had to ask Stacey for the bin bags because she had no intention of doing cleaning. 
The rest of the party was amazing, I did a speech as my hubby didn't want to and presented Stacey with one of my sweet bouquets as a thank you for her help. BIG MISTAKE AS SHE HADN'T REALLY DONE MUCH BY THIS POINT AND IT GOT WORSE.
As the party is coming to an end Stacey asks me who is going to take all the buffet stuff away?!? I was confused as this was included in what I paid her. Well I thought it was. It's a good job neither me or hubby had been drinking alcohol as we as well as my sister, daughter, her boyfriend and other guests had to pack all the remaining food, empty trays (which belonged to Stacey) and hot food warmers away. 4 trips in the car and 2 trips by food (my sister lives walking distance from the venue) and everything was packed away. Mine and my sister's fridges all full of food but we knew enough people who we could distribute it to the following day. 
The following day Stacey turns up to my sister's to collect her trays and food warmers expecting them to have been cleaned for her. We didn't do it as she had been paid for things she hasn't done. I forgot to mention earlier, she asked for payment before her holiday, which I gave her. 
So fast forward 3 days, my husband passed away suddenly, he wasn't sick so this was a major shock. The day after he passed was my birthday 😭 my sister asked me if I wanted her to let Stacey know and I said not to as I was still fuming after how she had acted on the wedding day.
During our 20+ year friendship Stacey had referred to as 'Wifey', while I'm with my hubby's 92 year old grandma telling her that hubby had passed I get a Facebook notification that Stacey had posted on my wall 'happy birthday Wifey'. I immediately messaged my sister and tell her to call Stacey and tell her what's happened and to remove the post but not to contact me as I didn't want to speak to anyone. Stacey just edited the post to remove the word 'wifey'. Really? Still wishing me happy birthday when hubby has died.
2 minutes after being told not to contact me, Stacey text me (WTF), I ignored her. 1 hour later, she texts again because I hadn't replied. Seriously, even my own brother didn't contact me because he'd been told not to. 
After still no contact with her, Stacey sends me a Winnie the Pooh GIF with a heart saying 'hugs and prayers'. Needless to say, after everything that had happened at the wedding, and the fact that she disrespected my wishes about no contact which all my family respected, I have had not contct at all with Stacey. The last time I spoke to her was the wedding night. The last message she sent me was the GIF, no further check ins to see how I'm doing since hubby died which is fine.

1mxyrb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mxyrb7/my_first_and_only_breakthrough/,My first and only breakthrough,"I’m writing this down because I have finally come to accept this reality. 

It started one night with me and 21 grams of mushrooms. I had built my tolerance up to the point where I could do large doses and not be severely affected. 

I had been constantly been taking higher and higher doses looking for an ego death. I had never fully given in to experience full visions or ego death. 

I think what made it hit really hard this time is that I took a month tolerance break before eating the mushrooms. 

In total I had one chocolate bar, and 20 grams of dried mushrooms. Before I went to sleep I ate all 20 grams of mushrooms and I ate 4 pieces of the chocolate bar which was roughly 1 gram. 

When I went tried to sleep it was around 11:30 I woke up suddenly two hours later at one am. I checked my phone and looked around.

 The darkness itself took form and shifted into beings. 

These beings had masks similar in appearance to Melpomene masks. But each of them had a different emotion. If you’ve ever seen Spirited away it was similar to no face. 

Except these beings had black skin tight suits with these masks. They morphed into reality itself and when I looked out the window one of these beings turned into the night sky and moon.

I had no depth perception, it was as if I was watching the curtains unveil and a  school play form right in front of me. 

As I was staring outside the window the light in my apartment complex go out. I heard the neighbors scream “Ya se fue la luz”

For you people who don’t know Spanish that roughly translates to “the electricity has gone out” 

Then it hit me, the fear rushed to my body. I couldn’t tell if I was tripping or not anymore. I fully forgot I even took anything. The sky and the moon then shifted back into these beings. Their presence and height couldn’t be made out as there was no depth perception. 

They stood over me and pointed and moved their chest and bodies as if they were laughing yet they made no sound. Think of them as mimes. 

These beings then proceeded to show me realities where I had no control. 

They morphed into the gym I usually go to and planted me in there. They let me gain consciousness but made me forget I had taken anything. 

I was working out in the gym as usual when I noticed an old guy who is usually at the gym who looks native. 

Except when I noticed this man he had a necklace adorned in gem stones and feathers . He then stared back at me and when he did… suddenly everyone in the gym stopped & dropped what they were doing and also stared at me. 

Having every single head in the gym jerk and stare at me was frightening. As soon as I realized this wasn’t normal the roof got torn on by one of these same beings from earlier. It had the smiling mask on its face. 

This being reached down and grabbed me and shoved me into the mouth of its mask. 
Except I didn’t fall into its throat or anything. I was simply transported into another reality. 

This time I was transported into one of those sitcom looking suburban areas. These houses were big two story houses that looked copy and pasted for miles and miles. I was looking at this from a third person point of view. When suddenly I was looking at this from a point of view of a pit bull. 

I saw the paper boy from my the front yard and I chased after him down the street. When he got down the road I was suddenly shifted back from a third person point of view. 

Like the point of view of a drone. When it started rising I saw the whole area morph back into the beings. The road morphed into a being with a skin tight grey suit and a white mask. The grass & hills morphed into a being with a green suit. 

The sky and sun morphed into a being with a blue suit and white mask. It was as if they were popping out from a screen. Again I had no depth perception as if everything was just an illusion. 

As soon as I had that thought these beings finally talked. They said nonsense that translated both into “You’re finally figuring things out/You’re begging to forget” 

It sounded as if they were saying these both but only speaking once. Think of it as the whole Yanny/Laurel thing. I would hear one thing and then the other despite them making the same noise. 

I was then transported into another reality. This time I was I was in my school, I was looking at my classmate and thought “damn, I wish I could fuck her” 

When suddenly she burst out laughing, “You’re a freak wanting to fuck yourself” 
I looked at her in disbelief and said what? 

When suddenly I could hear everyone’s voices in my head as they ridiculed me. They pointed out every single bad thing I had done. Every single desire I had had. Even my most private and personal experiences. 

They all laugh and pointed at me morphing into everyone I had ever met. Yet I could tell there were only 6 beings in total. They constantly morphed into different people and chanted “he’s finally figured it out, he’s begging to forget”. 

Much the same as the beings from before. When I realized this I was horrified and wet myself in the vision. This only added fuel to the flame and made everyone laugh harder. 

They said,
“Oh man. You’ve only been interacting with yourself” “what an absolute loser” 
My ex suddenly looked at me morphed herself into me

The girl I had thought about having sex with also suddenly morphed into me and laughed maniacally. 

“We’ve been telling you to come to our side but you refuse over and over again. You’d rather play these games with yourself than face reality and come with us” 

Then the whole classroom morphed into me and back into the masked beings. They proceeded to point and laugh at me yet they made no sound once again. 

Then suddenly I was transported into another reality. This time I was the hasbro operation game. These 6 doctors were operating on me. They constantly hit the metal wire and set off these funny alarms and sounds. 

They said “UH OHHHH WE’RE LOOOOOSING HIMMM” 

Their voices would go from slow pitched to high pitch. When suddenly one of these beings morphed back into the black suit and white mask and reached into the board/me and grabbed my heart and manually started pumping it. 

Just breathe and you’ll be okay they said, I felt my lungs fill up with air and the beeping of a heart monitor went from flatlining to beeping once again. 

Another being said “UH OHHHH, HEEEE’REEE WE GO AGAIIINNNN!!” 

I was then suddenly transported into a laboratory with 5 different classmates and one professor. One of these kids said 

“Professor we’ve finally done it!! We finally found the elixir to immortality! If my calculations are correct this should finally work!!” 

“Should we test it?” Another classmate chimed in. 

“I don’t see why not” the professor said 

“We’ll do it as a group!” The others chimed in. 

Everyone looked at each other and agreed. We split the elixir into vials with equal parts and we collectively drank as a group. 

Then suddenly a wormhole appeared in the middle of the class, I could feel myself being sucked in alongside the others. Then the black hole suddenly disappeared and we were once again in the class. 

Except we were stuck in the class, it had been transported into a reality of nothingness. When we opened the door there was nothing outside the class. Only darkness. We started to freak out and tried to figure a way out. 

When we stepped out the classroom we only floated in empty space. Yet when we went back into the class we were still floating. 

We could seemingly control if we floated or not. It was fun at first but we soon grew tired of “zero gravity” we were able to also control things around us and move them through telekinesis. No matter how much we seemed to walk or float we made no progress. 

The classroom was the same distance no matter what we did. We soon floated back into the class and tried to brainstorm a way to reverse this. 

Except it was futile. Nothing we did worked, nothing we did mattered. Millenia passed yet we did not age. We were stuck in time, helpless. 

“There’s nothing we can do, nothing we do works. There’s no returning back to our reality, our normal” said the professor. 

“I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!” One of the classmates screamed.  

“I’m going to end this once and for all, a life like this isn’t worth living” the same classmate these proceeded to bang their heads on the table until they were a bloody mess and fell back. 

When we all went to look they were laying on the floor with a peaceful smile on their face. 

The professor said, “looks like that’s the only way our children” 

The whole experience itself was similar to a mushroom trip. 

“I can’t accept that I can’t just kill myself. What the fuck is wrong with you guys. There must be a way out. I can’t simply just accept this and kill myself” I said

The other classmates  looked at me in disbelief and with a sorry expression. 

“None of this FUCKING MATTERS” I said. 

I started flipping over tables and throwing things. I even lay down my finger flat against my teeth the long way and bit down into my finger as hard as possible. Except I couldn’t go through with biting my finger off. 

I just lay there on the floor crying. Everyone gathered around me and just stared. 

When suddenly my surroundings morphed around me once again. This time I was on the floor in my living room. Except it was as if only my living room was transported into a jungle. 

My mother came up to me and asked “why are you crying son? What happened, why are you on the floor? 

I looked around in disbelief and the first thought that came to mind was to point at my brother and yell.  

“It’s all his fault, he’s the reason this happened”

My brother appeared on a tree behind her, he was on a branch. He started jumping side to side and pointing and laughing at me. 

He transformed into a little monkey with a cap and proceeded to do the same motion ridiculing me. 

All my family came to stare at me, it was my mom and dad and 3 brothers and 1 sister. 

(Notice how it’s all 7 people including me? This theme resonated throughout the whole experience. The same 6 beings, if you include me it’s 7. The rest of this earth is just me pretending to be other people.) 

(Back to the story now) 

My mom then preceded to roll her eyes except her eyeballs rolled around her sockets and into her skull. Transforming into one of the beings. 

“No silly, you did this to yourself. All of this is just you, why can’t you understand that?“ 

The rest of my family proceeded to transform once again into these 6 beings and chanted “You’re finally figuring it out/ You’re begging to forget”

It sounded like both of these things yet then only making the same noise over and over again. 

I was suddenly transported onto a world that looked like the surface of mars. There were tall buildings that looked futuristic yet ancient at the same time. Buildings that looked like Greek architecture made out of white stone, light, metal. 

It looked as if reality was collapsing in on itself. These buildings were collapsing and on fire. Chunks of the sky itself was falling and crashing into the ground causing even more chaos. It looked like the aftermath of a nuclear war. 

These 6 beings transformed into white cloaks with crowned wreaths made out of leaves. They were all running into beams of light like a beam that a ufo would make except there was no ufo. Just a beam of light coming straight out of the sky. 

“Come on!! You have to come with us” one of the beings said who had shifted into a beautiful woman. 

“NO!! I want to stay here. I’m scared. I don’t want to go with you guys. Just leave me” I said 

She rolled her eyes at me and said “Suit yourself, you’ll be nothing but lonely. This is your last chance. We won’t come back for you” she said 

I ignored her and layed in the floor and morphed into reality itself. I then got transpired into nothing ness. I was just in deep empty space. Forever alone. 

I then saw myself recreating reality, living countless and thousands of lives. I saw myself start out as a cave man. 

My mother was in a cave with me. She had a torch similar to a candle. She and my dad were also cave man attire.  

“Whats wrong with him?” My dad asked 

It was in a language unfamiliar to me yet I understood everything. 

“Idk my mom said, he took some mushrooms and now he’s acting like this” 

She grabbed my face and shined the light into my eyes. 

“Here,  just drink some water and it will all be okay my son. Everything will be okay just drink water”

In the cave I repeatedly called out for my mother, I could see her in front of me yet to me she was far away. My depth perception was off. 

“Yes?” She said, when I heard her reply back I simply said “Nevermind” 

She just looked at me confused and started crying, as did my father. 

Then reality itself once shifted into me in my bed. 

These beings hovered over me and said “once again you broke the illusion. Yet every single time you awaken you refuse to accept your reality. You would rather blind and numb yourself than face the consequences. We’re growing really tired of having so fix your fuck ups. If you do this one more time we might not be able to fix it. Now go back to your silly previous pathetic life and enjoy way you so desperately cling on to”

I woke up again this time for real. I looked around me and saw my room a complete mess. It was 6 am when I woke up. 

The power was out for reals and didn’t come back on until 8 am. 

I showered and changed clothes as I had really pissed myself. I later found out from my siblings that they did in fact find me and were holding candles because the power was out. My mother had given me water to drink and told me to lay down and just relax. 

My room was a mess, I had flipped over my coffee table that is 4x4 feet and weighs at least 100 pounds. Things scattered everywhere, all over the room. 

This happened in 2023, it took my two years to come to acceptance with this. And yet I still believe to accept what I’ve learned and what those beings were trying to get through to me. 

All of us are just one being trying so desperately not to feel lonely. We’d rather be stuck in this illusion than deal with the consequences. ",2,1755947808.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Life changing, but it caused insomnia so I tried a bunch of things that I kept building tolerance to. Going to sleep around 2am is better than not sleeping at all, but at that point (4 months in) I felt like adderall wasn’t even working anymore. The week before and during my period it wasn’t effective either. Got on Wellbutrin because I was extremely stressed and getting depressed — amazing stuff. 

I had to cut adderall out for a medical procedure and since my HR was consistently 100+ my doctors asked me to choose either adderall or Wellbutrin, try to minimize the combo. So I stuck to Wellbutrin. 4 months later I took 20mg of adderall and had insomnia with no benefits. Any time I tried coffee or tea is also kept me up. Cut it all out again and got on colonide 0.2 which helped me finally get on a sleep schedule. I tried adderall last week again and I’ll fall asleep at the same time as usual, but I’ll wake up between 4:30 and 6:30 and can’t go back to bed. Funny thing is, I’m exhausted all day and I feel no benefits from taking it. Since I’m falling asleep I thought it couldn’t adderall, but it’s the only thing different in my routine. I tried it with and without tea in the morning & no difference.

Maybe it because it’s the week before my period so I’m out of luck. But is anyone else going though this? I find it bizarre im exhausted but my body refuses to sleep for more than 3-6 hrs a night. I woke up at 4:40am today and im losing it since i only took 10mg this time. My brain fog and memory is really really awful right now which is why I tried to start it again during the work week.

1mxym3u,https://youtu.be/wXP8zGv9vWw,4 Very Scary TRUE Backcountry Hunting Horror Stories,"# ""The Clearing"":

Years ago, I experienced something in the Texas backcountry that still keeps me awake some nights. It started as a regular bow hunting trip with my close friend, a fellow who serves as a police officer in our town. We chose a stretch of public land we'd visited before, known for good deer activity but also for being vast and isolated, miles from the nearest road or house. We arrived well before first light, parking our truck off a dirt trail and hiking in with our gear. Both of us wore full ghillie suits—those camouflaged outfits that make you look like part of the underbrush—and we set up in tripod stands about twenty yards apart, elevated just enough to give us a view over the clearing.

We settled in, bows ready, sidearms holstered since we had permits to carry. The plan was simple: wait for deer to show as the sun rose. For the first hour or so, everything felt normal. Birds started calling, and the woods came alive bit by bit. But then, around the time the light turned golden, I picked up on footsteps. Not the light patter of a deer, but deliberate crunches, like boots on dry leaves. I froze, straining to listen. The steps grew louder, approaching from the thicket behind my stand.

Through a gap in my suit, I spotted him: a man in his mid-forties, scruffy with a tangled beard and worn-out jacket, carrying a bolt-action rifle slung over one shoulder. He puffed on a cigarette, the glow visible even in the growing light. He moved casual, like he owned the place, scanning the ground as if tracking something. Rifle season wasn't open yet, so right away I knew he was likely poaching. But public land attracts all types, so I stayed hidden, hoping he'd pass by without noticing us.

He didn't. He wandered right up to the base of my tripod, stopping maybe ten feet away. Up close, his eyes looked hollow, like he hadn't rested proper in weeks. He muttered to himself, words I couldn't make out, then shouldered his rifle and peered into the brush. My pulse quickened—I didn't like how he gripped that gun. Deciding to act before things escalated, I eased off my headgear and spoke up. ""Morning,"" I said, keeping my tone even. ""You hunting out here too?""

He snapped his head up, surprise turning to anger fast. In one motion, he swung the rifle around and aimed it dead at me. The black bore stared like an empty eye. ""Who are you?"" he growled, finger inching toward the trigger. ""This ain't no place for you.""

I lifted my hands slow, bow still in one. ""Whoa, hold on. I'm just out for deer with my friend. No trouble intended."" My voice stayed calm, but inside, fear gripped me hard. We were alone out there, no signal sometimes, and this guy looked unhinged.

He stepped closer, rifle steady. ""Your friend, huh? Where's he at?"" His lips curled into a thin smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Woods like these eat people up. You hear stories? Folks go in and never come out.""

Before I could answer, movement came from my buddy's stand. He'd drawn his bow full, the heavy broadhead arrow pointed at the man's side. The string creaked just enough to draw attention. ""Right here,"" my buddy said, his officer voice cutting through. ""Drop the weapon. Now.""

The man's eyes darted over, widening as he realized he was flanked. For a second, he froze, then lowered the rifle gradual, setting it on the ground. ""You got me,"" he said, but his tone mocked us. ""But you don't know what you're stepping into."" We climbed down swift, handguns out now. I covered him while my buddy zip-tied his wrists. ""What's that supposed to mean?"" I asked.

He chuckled low as we secured him. ""Just that... accidents happen. People get lost, or worse. I've seen it."" His breath smelled sour, like old smoke and something metallic. We marched him back to the truck, a good half-mile hike. He didn't fight, but he kept glancing back at the woods, like expecting someone—or something—to follow. At one point, he stopped and looked me in the eye. ""You think tying me up fixes anything? There's more out there. Always more.""

We reached the truck, and I pulled out my phone—signal was weak, but enough to call the game warden. The warden showed up in under an hour, a burly guy we knew from past trips. He cuffed the man proper and ran his ID through the system. His face drained of color. ""Boys, you just caught a big one,"" he said. ""This fella's wanted for two murders—one in Louisiana, stabbed a guy in a bar fight, and another in Kentucky, strangled his own cousin over money. Been on the run for months.""

The man just stared at the ground, no more smirks. They hauled him away, and later we heard he got life without parole. We headed back to our stands that afternoon, nerves still raw, and managed to harvest two deer before packing up. But ever since, those woods feel different. I wonder if he was alone out there, or if others like him lurk, waiting. It makes you question every rustle, every shadow. Hunting's never been the same.





# ""The Last Hunt"":

I had always loved the quiet of the woods, the way the trees closed in around you like old friends keeping secrets. But that changed in the fall of 1911, when I got pulled into something that still wakes me up at night. My name is Giles, and back then I was a deputy sheriff in Grays Harbor County, Washington. The Wynoochee Valley was my beat, a place of thick forests and winding rivers where folks went to hunt elk or just escape the world. I knew John Tornow from around town—he was a big man, over six feet, with a beard that made him look part animal. He kept to himself, living out in the brush, hunting with a rifle he handled like an extension of his arm. People called him odd, but harmless. Until he wasn't.

It started with a report from the Bauer family. Their boys, Will and John, both nineteen and twins, had gone out hunting near the Satsop River. They were good kids, excited about bagging a deer for the family table. When they didn't come back after two days, their folks got worried and came to the sheriff's office. ""Deputy Quimby,"" the father said, his voice shaking as he gripped his hat, ""those boys know the woods. Something's wrong."" I nodded, trying to stay calm. ""We'll find them, Mr. Bauer. I'll gather some men and head out at first light.""

We set off early, a small group of us—me, a couple of local trappers named Louis Blair and Charles Lathrop, and the boys' uncle Fred Tornow, John's own brother. Fred was quiet, but he mentioned John had been acting strange lately, ever since he'd gotten out of the asylum a few years back. ""He loves those woods more than people,"" Fred muttered as we hiked through the underbrush. ""But he'd never hurt family. Would he?"" I didn't answer, focusing on the trail ahead. The forest was dense, with ferns up to our knees and fallen logs that could hide anything.

After hours of searching, we found the boys' camp. Their gear was scattered, like they'd left in a hurry. ""Look here,"" Louis said, pointing to the ground. There were footprints, big ones, leading away. We followed them deeper into the swampy area near a creek. That's when the smell hit us—something rotten, mixed with the damp earth. My gut tightened as we pushed through the brush. There they were, Will and John, lying face down among the roots, each with a single bullet hole in the chest. Clean shots, right through the heart. No struggle, no signs of a fight. Just dead.

""Who could do this?"" Charles whispered, his face pale. Fred knelt down, touching one of the boys' hands. ""John... it couldn't be."" But the footprints matched the size of Tornow's boots, and we found a spent cartridge nearby that looked like it came from his Winchester. Word spread fast back in town. John Tornow had killed his own nephews. Why? Some said he thought they were poachers on his territory. Others whispered he was paranoid, seeing enemies everywhere. Gordon Godfrey, a lawyer from Aberdeen who looked into it later, thought the boys might have been sent to bring John in, and he panicked. But no one knew for sure.

We formed a posse right away, twenty men strong, with dogs and rifles. ""He's out there somewhere,"" the sheriff told us. ""Stay sharp. He's a crack shot."" We combed the valley for days, finding old shanties where John had holed up—crude shelters made of branches, with bones from elk he'd hunted scattered around. But no sign of him. The forest seemed to swallow him whole. Nights were the worst. We'd camp out, and I'd lie there listening to every snap of a twig, wondering if he was watching us. ""You hear that?"" Louis would say, sitting up with his gun ready. ""Just the wind,"" I'd reply, but I wasn't sure.

Months passed, and the searches died down. Loggers stopped working in the area, too scared to go in. Then, in February 1912, Louis and his trapping partner spotted fresh tracks near an old homestead. ""It's him,"" Louis said when he reported it. ""Big prints, and a fire pit still warm."" We geared up again, this time with Deputy Colin McKenzie and Game Warden Al Elmer leading a team. They were tough men, used to the backcountry. ""We'll smoke him out,"" Colin told me before they left. ""He can't hide forever.""

They didn't come back. A week later, we found their bodies in a shallow grave, stripped of clothes and gear, shot multiple times. John's work, no doubt—he'd taken their weapons, even their boots. The horror of it hit hard. These were friends, good men with families. The reward jumped to three thousand dollars, dead or alive. The whole county was on edge. ""He's like a ghost,"" people said in town, but I knew he was flesh and blood, just smarter at surviving than most.

By early 1913, Louis and Charles were obsessed. They'd known the Bauer boys and wanted justice. ""We're going in deep,"" Louis told me one morning. ""Up near the swamp where he hides."" I joined them, along with a few others, including bloodhounds to track. The hike was grueling, miles through mud and thickets. We talked little, saving our breath. ""If we see him, shoot first,"" Charles said quietly. ""He's not the John we knew anymore.""

On April 16, we picked up a scent. The dogs bayed, pulling us forward. Suddenly, shots rang out from the trees. Charles fell first, clutching his side. ""I'm hit!"" he yelled. Louis fired back, but another bullet caught him in the chest. He dropped without a word. I dove behind a log, heart racing, peering through the leaves. There he was—John Tornow, or what was left of him. His hair hung long and matted, beard wild, eyes gleaming with something feral. He looked more beast than man, crouched in his ragged clothes.

""John! It's over!"" I shouted, my voice steady despite the fear. He didn't answer, just raised his rifle. I fired, hitting him in the shoulder. He staggered but shot back, the bullet whizzing past my ear. We exchanged fire for what felt like forever, the dogs howling over the bodies. Finally, I got a clear shot at his head. He went down, silent.

When it was over, we carried the bodies out—Louis, Charles, and John. Back in Montesano, hundreds came to see John's corpse at the morgue, pushing and shoving like it was a spectacle. His brother Fred looked at him and said, ""I'm glad it's done. Better this way."" But as I stood there, I couldn't shake the chill. Had he really killed those boys out of malice, or was it the woods that broke him? The forest holds its own kind of madness, turning men into shadows of themselves.

Even now, years later, when I think of those woods, I remember the way John's eyes locked on mine in that final moment—full of rage and loneliness. It makes me wonder what else is out there, hiding in the trees, waiting for the next hunter to wander too far.





# ""Flight Over Knik River"":

I had always loved the thrill of hunting alone in the Alaskan wilderness. The vast stretches of forest and mountains made me feel small but alive, like I was part of something bigger. My name doesn't matter much in this tale, but back then, I was just a young woman in my twenties, working as a guide for tourists during the summer and hunting for myself in the fall. I knew the risks—wild animals, getting lost, bad falls—but I carried a rifle and a knife, and I trusted my skills. That year, I set out for a remote spot near the Knik River, planning to bag an elk or two. Little did I know, the real danger wasn't the wildlife.

I drove my old truck as far as the dirt road would allow, then hiked in with my pack. The air was crisp, filled with the scent of pine and earth. I set up a small camp by a stream, just a tent and a fire pit. The first day went well. I tracked some prints but didn't take a shot. As evening came, I built a fire and cooked a simple meal of beans and jerky. That's when I heard the plane.

It was a small Cessna, buzzing low over the trees. Planes weren't unusual out here—hunters and fishermen used them to get in and out. But this one circled, then landed on a gravel bar not far from my camp. I watched from the edge of the woods as a man climbed out. He was average build, with glasses and a stutter when he spoke later. He waved, friendly-like, and walked over with a backpack slung over his shoulder.

""Hello there,"" he called out, approaching with his hands visible. ""Didn't expect to see anyone this far out. You hunting?""

I nodded, keeping my rifle close but not pointed. ""Yeah, elk mostly. You?""

He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Same. Name's Bob. I fly in for the weekends. Saw your fire from the air. Mind if I join for a bit? Gets lonely out here.""

I hesitated. Out in the backcountry, folks were usually helpful to each other. We shared stories, traded tips. ""Sure,"" I said. ""I'm Anna. Coffee's on the fire.""

We sat and talked. Bob told me about his bakery in Anchorage, how he loved hunting big game. He had trophies, he said—moose, caribou. But there was something off. His questions got personal: Was I alone? How long was I staying? Did anyone know my exact spot? I brushed it off, saying my brother expected me back in a week. A lie, but it felt right.

As the fire died down, he stood up. ""Well, better head back to my plane. Safe hunting, Anna.""

He walked away, and I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. I doused the fire and crawled into my tent, rifle by my side. Sleep came slow, but eventually, I drifted off.

A rustle woke me. Not an animal—too deliberate. I grabbed my rifle and unzipped the tent flap just a crack. The moon lit the clearing, and there he was: Bob, standing at the edge of my camp, watching. My pulse quickened. He wasn't moving, just staring. Then he turned and slipped into the trees.

I didn't sleep after that. At first light, I packed up fast, deciding to move camp deeper into the woods. Something about him unnerved me. As I hiked, I heard branches snap behind me. I stopped, listened. Nothing. Kept going. More snaps. I spun around, rifle ready. ""Who's there?"" I shouted.

No answer. I picked up my pace, heart racing now. The trail narrowed, trees closing in. Then, a voice echoed through the woods: ""Anna! Wait up!""

It was Bob. How did he find me? I didn't stop. ""Leave me alone!"" I yelled back.

Laughter. Cold, mocking. ""You shouldn't run. Makes it more fun.""

Fun? What did that mean? I broke into a jog, pack bouncing. The sounds followed—footsteps, heavy but quick. He was tracking me. Like prey.

I veered off the trail, hoping to lose him in the thick brush. Thorns scratched my arms, but I pushed on. My breath came in gasps. Behind me, a branch cracked loud, close. I glanced back—saw a flash of his jacket through the leaves.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, not expecting an answer.

His voice came clear, closer than before. ""Because I can. You're in my territory now.""

Territory? This was public land. But fear gripped me hard. I remembered stories from Anchorage—women going missing, bodies found shot in the backcountry. Hunters dismissed it as accidents, but whispers said otherwise. A man who flew them out, set them loose, hunted them for sport.

No. It couldn't be. But the pieces fit. The plane. The questions. The chase.

I dropped my pack to run faster, keeping only my rifle and knife. The ground sloped down toward the river. If I could reach it, maybe flag someone. But out here? Miles from anywhere.

A shot rang out. Bark exploded on a tree next to me. I dove behind a log, hands shaking as I chambered a round. ""Stop! I'll shoot!""

Another laugh. ""Go ahead. But I'm better at this.""

He was toying with me. I peeked over the log—saw him maybe fifty yards back, pistol in hand, scanning. He looked calm, like this was routine.

I fired once, high on purpose, to scare him. He ducked, then called out, ""Missed. Your turn to run again.""

This was a game to him. Sick, twisted. I scrambled up and ran, legs burning. The river rushed ahead, cold and fast. I plunged in, water up to my waist, gasping from the chill. Bullets splashed nearby. I swam, current pulling me downstream.

On the other bank, I crawled out, soaked and shivering. No sign of him. But I couldn't stop. I ran through the woods, feet numb, until I hit a logging road. Hours passed—or maybe minutes, time blurred. Finally, a truck appeared, an old logger heading out.

""Help!"" I flagged him down, collapsing against the door.

He stared at my wet clothes, the rifle. ""What happened, miss?""

""Man... chasing me. Shot at me. Please, get me to town.""

He drove me straight to the state troopers in Palmer. I told them everything—the plane, the chase, the shots. They listened, skeptical at first. ""Lots of hunters out there. Could be a misunderstanding.""

But one detective, Flothe, believed me. He asked details: the stutter, the bakery. It matched a suspect they'd eyed before. Robert Hansen.

They searched his place. Found maps with X's marking spots where bodies had turned up. Jewelry from missing women. He'd confessed later—abducted over a dozen, flew them to the wilderness, stripped them, gave them a head start. Then hunted. Like animals.

I was lucky. I escaped. But those days in the woods changed me. I don't hunt alone anymore. And when I hear a plane overhead, I still look up, wondering.





# ""The Grow"":

I set off into the woods that day with my old rifle slung over my shoulder, eager for a good hunt in the remote hills of northern California. My buddy, Alex, came along. We had hunted these parts before, miles from any road, where the trees grew thick and the ground stayed uneven underfoot. Alex carried his gear in a worn pack, and we walked quietly, eyes scanning for signs of deer.

We hiked deeper than usual, following a faint trail that twisted through the brush. After a couple of hours, I noticed something odd—thin black hoses snaking along the dirt, half-buried like they didn't belong. ""Look at that,"" I whispered to Alex, pointing. He knelt down and touched one. ""Irrigation lines? Out here?""

We followed them uphill, curiosity pulling us forward. The hoses led to a small stream, diverted with makeshift dams. Beyond that, hidden in a clearing, rows of tall green plants swayed gently. Not wild bushes—these were marijuana, hundreds of them, cultivated in neat lines. Tents dotted the edges, and tools lay scattered around a campfire pit.

Alex froze beside me. ""This is bad. We need to back out slow."" But before we could move, a rustle came from the trees. Two men stepped out, both holding rifles, their faces hard and watchful. One was shorter, with a mustache, the other taller and lean. They wore dirty clothes, like they'd been out here for weeks.

""What you doing here?"" the shorter one said in accented English, his voice low and sharp. He raised his gun just enough to make his point.

I raised my hands slowly, my rifle still on my back. ""Just hunting. Didn't mean to trespass. We'll leave right now.""

The taller one glanced at his partner, then back at us. ""You see too much. No one comes here.""

Alex spoke up, his voice steady but tense. ""We don't want trouble. We're locals, out for deer. Won't say a word.""

The shorter man laughed, but it held no humor. ""Locals? You think we care? This our land now. You go, you tell police. Then problems.""

They moved closer, circling us like predators sizing up prey. I scanned the camp—more hoses, bags of fertilizer, a generator humming softly. These weren't small-time growers; this setup looked organized, dangerous.

""Please,"" I said, trying to keep calm. ""Let us go. We forget we saw anything.""

The taller one shook his head. ""No. You stay. We decide.""

They motioned us toward the tents with their guns. My mind raced—stories I'd heard about cartels taking over forest land, guarding their operations with force. People vanished out here sometimes, reports of shots fired at wanderers. We sat on the ground as they tied our hands with rope from a supply pile. The shorter one kept watch while the taller rummaged through our packs, taking our knives and phones.

""Why you hunt here?"" the shorter one asked, sitting on a log nearby. ""Many places. Why this spot?""

Alex answered first. ""It's quiet. Good for game. We didn't know about this.""

The man nodded slowly. ""Quiet good for us too. No eyes. But now you eyes.""

Hours passed as they whispered in Spanish, glancing at us. I tested the ropes, but they held tight. The camp smelled of earth and chemicals, and distant sounds of wildlife faded as the light dimmed. Then, the taller one pulled out a radio and spoke into it quickly. His face darkened after the response.

""Boss says no witnesses,"" he told his partner.

The shorter one stood, gun ready. ""Time to walk.""

They untied our feet but kept our hands bound, pushing us into the trees away from the camp. ""Move,"" the taller one ordered. We stumbled forward, branches scraping our arms. My thoughts spun—run? Fight? But with guns at our backs, options felt slim.

""Where are you taking us?"" I asked, voice low.

""Deep. No one finds,"" the shorter one replied.

Alex looked at me sideways. ""We can work this out. Money? We have some back at the truck.""

They ignored him. The path narrowed, leading down a ravine. Suspense built with every step; I imagined what might come next, the isolation pressing in. No help for miles.

Suddenly, Alex tripped on a root, falling hard. The shorter man cursed and bent to pull him up. In that moment, I lunged at the taller one, shoulder slamming into him. His gun fired wild, echoing through the woods. I grabbed for it, wrestling him to the ground. Alex kicked at the shorter man, buying time.

""Run!"" I yelled to Alex as I pinned the taller guy, punching hard.

Alex broke free and bolted into the brush. Shots rang out—the shorter man firing after him. I heard a grunt, but Alex kept going. The taller one threw me off, scrambling for his weapon. I rolled away, dodging into the trees.

Bullets whizzed past, bark exploding nearby. I ran blind, lungs burning, weaving through undergrowth. Behind, shouts in Spanish faded slowly. I didn't stop, pushing deeper into the familiar terrain I'd hunted for years.

After what seemed forever, I reached a ridge and hid behind a fallen log, listening. No footsteps followed. Shaking, I worked the ropes loose with a sharp rock, then circled wide toward our truck.

At the vehicle, no sign of Alex. I waited, hoping, but hours ticked by. Finally, I drove out, straight to the sheriff's office. Told them everything—the camp coordinates from memory, the men, the guns.

Deputies raided the site next day. Found the grow op abandoned, plants slashed, tents gone. No bodies, but blood on the trail where Alex fell. Searches went on for weeks, helicopters overhead, dogs on the ground. They caught one grower later, the shorter one, hiding in a nearby town. He confessed to cartel ties, said they cleared out fast after the escape.

Alex turned up missing for good. Investigators figured he got hit, dragged off to hide evidence. Based on what happened to others in those woods—folks stumbling on grows and paying the price—it fit the pattern.

I don't hunt alone anymore. Those forests hold secrets now, and every rustle reminds me how quick a day can turn deadly.",1,1755947328.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1mxyljw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxyljw,Lotte Mall Songdo Castle Park Officetel,"Hi guys. Just thought I'd share some though regarding this Songdo officetel (Lotte Mall Songdo Castle Park), since a lot of things I had to figure out on my own. Would appreciate any other Songdo tips, recommendations, etc.

=== 

There are two towers, A동 or B동. They have two entrances on the ground floor, and are connected by a rooftop sitting/park area on the 6F.

Not a bad location for an officetel in Songdo. Coming from the US, I think the one-room apartments are sufficient space-wise for singles or those looking for an office space. Relatively new building, I believe built in 2019, with parking.

Rooms have built in fridge/freezer, A/C, washing machine (no dryer), two pan electric stove top, shoe rack, and some closet space. There is also a smart screen, where you can change your building access code (your apartment code is changed via your front door lock). Shower is walk-in with rainfall style and spray. Toilets have a bidet spray (power can be adjusted by tightening faucet).

1F is parking, trash (there are building A and B trash areas up the stairs near the bikes) and recycling (outside of building A from the parking lot area). The real estate agent of previous owner should give you a trash card key. You can buy the food waste and normal trash bags at any convenience store nearby.

2F leads to some haircutting shops, restaruants, and laundry services.

6F has the building admin office, where you can register parking, etc. (they don't really speak English though so it'll be good to have a translation). 6F also has shared spaces that are included in your monthly building fee. There is a rooftop outdoor garden space that connects building A and B, plus an outdoor patio with tables and chair. There is a little lounge area, large washing machines (paid), screen golf (paid), a small gym, library and computer work area. You access the gym and other closed areas by face-scanning, by first going to the admin office who give you a paper to take to the gym (ring the bell on the door) where they will register your face.

There is also what looks like space for men's and women sauna but they are under construction... And according to the admin office, they don't plan on being opened any time soon. There is Songhaeon and Blue Ocean in Songdo however, which are English-friendly.

Location-wise it's a block or so away from Central Park, and Michuhol Park (I like this one better). For groceries there is LotteMart nearby, though personally I like the Homeplus closer to the Triple Street. A large Daiso is about two blocks away (card only) at J2 mall area. There is also Costco about four or five blocks away.

There are drinking-style Korean restaruants right outside, but usually closed in the afternoon. There are nice cafes like Starbucks, Holly's and Paul Basset nearby. There's also an underground CGV movie theater nearby. You can get deliveries via Coupang or food via Coupang Eats (some English, doesn't take foreign cards), or 배달의민 족 (no English, takes foreign cards), Yogiyo, etc.

Random

Bunpattybun is a delicious burger place near Daiso. Pricey but really good fries.

The Cinder Bar is near the edge of Songdo but highly recommended by foreigners.

Dolphin Coffee Omakase near Central Park has some really good premium coffee.

If you're into English-speaking churches, there's the large Lifespring Church near Costco, the smaller Haven Church near Central Park, and others I think closer to campuses.

IFEZ Songdo posts free Korean language classes and English events via their FB page and website.

1mxylhh,https://i.redd.it/6hxfed5q4rkf1.png,Today I dreamt that I had a Phainon donut cake and a Mydei donut cake.,"I'm a vivid dreamer. It often feels like I'm visiting other universes and living alternate lives when I dream. I can touch things, feel textures, read letters, taste and smell things in dreams. The visual sensations are the most intense, though. 

Whether my dream is about something horrific like getting stabbed by a ceiling monster, or being driven off a cliff at night because of a broken bridge, or trying to escape an abandoned building with a ""presence"" that I feel is just lurking inside...*it all feels extremely real.*

But today...I just had a relatively chill dream.

Some people from a cake shop gave me a free giant Phainon donut cake (with a lot of cream filling inside) with incredible color and art detailing on the frosting. It made me so happy. I didn't eat it at first. My dreaming brain thought it was too awesome to eat.

At some point (I don't know how) I also somehow acquired a Mydei donut cake, which was just as detailed as the Phainon donut cake.

I was like, ""Oh man, I need to put him next to my Phainon donut cake and take pictures. It would look kind of cute, and I want to show people 🥺""

In the dream, I placed them on a big table together, feeling giddy at the sight of them there side by side. I could feel myself ""smiling"" somehow.

Then, I went to get a camera, but as you all know: dreams are very strange. When I got back with the camera, the Mydei cake turned into a coffee cake roll. 

I couldn't take a picture of them together.

My dreaming mind was just...""😟 Okay, where did it go? Did I eat it??? The Phainon donut cake might be getting moldy because I kept delaying eating it...""

I started worrying that I might get food poisoning from the Phainon cake if I didn't eat it today. 

As usual with my dreams, the good times can suddenly just devolve into anxiety and fear. I was starting to feel some panic about what happened to the Mydei donut cake and about getting food poisoning from the Phainon cake.

More than fear and anxiety, I was also feeling deep regret, confusion and an existential crisis about the fate of the Mydei cake: why did it turn into a smaller cake roll? Is Phainon and Mydei doomed to separate even as cakes? Did I eat the Mydei cake unconsciously? How?! But what did it taste like? How could I forget—

I woke up soon after my existential crisis about the Mydei cake and my fear of the Phainon cake getting moldy.

After waking up, it just I felt like I lost both of them in the end, even though they never really existed. 

I mean, it really felt like I had them.

You know those dreams where you spend time and talk with a crush, and it feels like you connected a little bit, even if it's just an awkward dream-logic conversation?

It...kind of felt a little like that, a bittersweet feeling of experiencing a rush of bliss, but waking up to the reality that it was all just a manufactured illusion.

So, now I kind of wish I could bake an actual Phainon and Mydei donut cake just to honor the chill dream that I had, to give them life and bring them together in reality. But, even if I can learn the skills, I have no apparatus for big artful baking projects.

Writing this all down now, I find it both funny and sad how my dreaming mind accidentally made Doomed Yaoi about Mydei and Phainon donut cakes. They still got separated even as cakes in my dream 🫥.",27,1755947272.0,PhainonMainsHSR,1,0.94,False

- Plugged the base into my car's USB once, and now my phone just snaps on and connects automatically.  
- Plus, it charges pretty quick without killing my battery while I'm navigating.

1mxyj0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1mxyj0l/friend_didnt_invite_us_to_her_wedding_and_didnt/,"Friend didn’t invite us to her wedding, and didn’t have the guts to come clean","Here for some petty wedding drama? I got you. Buckle up.

This happened years ago. I had (I thought) a good college friend. We’ll call her Anna. We were in a tight knit study group of four girls who used to hang out with each other a lot, both together and individually. We did choir and yoga together, studied together, visited galleries, did dinners, coffee dates and parties, talked about boys and friends and hardships and hopes. This went on for years and continued after we graduated. All to say, it was fair to assume we would have a place at each other's weddings, as we had a significant place in each other's lives.

Anna and I used to go on long walks and discuss our lives and everything in it. Our talks would get really deep and personal (on both sides), and we were very supportive of each other. I considered us close. When she got engaged, I was elated for her and excited to go to her wedding with the rest of the group.

Well, on one of our walks, the talk turned to wedding stuff. She was being evasive, and at length I realised why: The wedding was planned, invites had gone out, and I was not invited. Neither were the other girls. This may be controversial, but I said: “Oh! I'm so sorry, I just assumed I would be invited.”

Anna got very apologetic, said the wedding party was very small and ranking your friends to find out who was invited was a terrible feeling. She had been thinking of different ways to involve us; for instance, another girl in our group, Jennifer, was very into fashion, so she wanted Jennifer to help her find a wedding dress, and that way she would be a part of the wedding even though she wouldn’t go.

Alright. Fair enough. I said don’t worry about it and don’t feel bad, it’s your wedding, I totally understand, etc. But on reflection I still felt sore that she didn’t have the guts to let me know up front, but left me to figure it out for myself. Like, she didn’t even think that *I* would think I was invited… I faced the uncomfortable truth that we were probably not as close as I thought. I decided to distance myself and move on.

End of drama, right? Wrong. Months pass, and I meet up with Jennifer. Jennifer and I are probably the least close of the group, but we like each other just fine. We have a drink, catch up. And then Jennifer shares something upsetting: She has seen on Instagram that Anna’s bachelorette party came and went. Jennifer is confused about why she wasn’t invited. “Who are any of these people?” she asks me. “Who the hell planned this thing? Why didn’t they know who to invite?”

Now I’m in an uncomfortable position, as you might imagine. “Are you going to the wedding?” I ask.

“Yes!” says Jennifer. “I'm the one who has been helping Anna pick out a wedding dress.”

“But did you get an invite?”

“No, not yet,” says Jennifer.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen. Anna had, as planned, asked Jennifer to help her find a fashionable wedding dress… but as with me, it had been left to Jennifer to figure out for herself that she was not, in fact, invited. The two of them had spent HOURS AND HOURS together looking at and discussing options, and not at any point had Anna thought to say, “Hey, by the way, this wedding you're helping me with right now? Yeah, you're not invited.” No, I got to deliver that happy news to Jennifer then and there, including that this had been Anna’s plan for Jennifer’s involvement all along. Jennifer was understandably very upset.

The cherry on top? A day before her wedding, Anna very kindly sent us all a link to **livestream the event**, in case we just couldn’t bear to miss it. Completely oblivious.

Edit: Thank you for all your comments and for taking part in my righteous anger. This has been cathartic, and a little sad.

A lot of people have asked about the state of our friendship today. I write about it here and there in the comments. Essentially, this mess was the start of us drifting apart, or else it was a painful culmination to something I hadn't noticed, I don't know. Today we are casual acquaintances who text or send a picture every now and again. We have a meaningful, shared history, but people move on, and we are all in different places – mentally and geographically. The only one I still cross paths with in real life is Jennifer. We are still very different people, but she's great. It's just odd. The college friends I felt most close to are not the ones who stuck around.

Final edit: This post is still somehow getting so much traction, so I'll add this to answer some common comments, and I'll try to keep it short.

No one is entitled to a wedding invite. The wedding stuff illuminated that Anna and I weren't as close as I thought. That sucked for me. But it wasn't Anna's fault or responsibility. It just was what it was. I shared my hurt with Anna way back during our initial talk, but I made it clear I didn't blame her for it. That was the only time we talked about any of this.

How she treated Jennifer was hurtful and wrong. I don't think she did it on purpose to use Jennifer (as some people are suggesting), but I just don't understand how she could convince herself that she could involve Jennifer in wedding planning without also being clear that there would be no invite. That's saving yourself from a difficult situation by making things harder and more hurtful for other people. To hurt Jennifer, and to make me the bearer of her own (Anna's) bad news – that infuriated me. But I said nothing, as it wasn't my place to get involved in their relationship.

Sending the link after all of that was just... shockingly tone deaf. An attempted olive branch maybe, but it just rubbed salt in the wound. But I didn't begrudge her a happy wedding day, and I still wish her well.

That's it! Petty shit, but it was personally dramatic at the time, and even though it doesn't mean much anymore, I remember how it felt.

1mxyhm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardwareHit/comments/1mxyhm4/should_you_trust_the_glinet_mango_mini_wifi/,Should You Trust the GL.iNet Mango Mini WiFi Router for Travel?,"Traveling often brings a mix of excitement and challenges, especially when it comes to securing reliable internet access. A few weeks ago, I got my hands on the GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2, a sleek little portable WiFi router that promised to simplify my connectivity woes. Light enough to slip into your pocket yet powerful enough to make public Wi-Fi connections secure, this tiny yet capable device immediately piqued my interest. Here’s how it stacked up after a few weeks of actual use.

**Compact Design and Portability**

This travel router is so wonderfully compact that it’s almost amusing. Weighing just 1.41 ounces and measuring roughly 2.28 x 0.98 x 2.28 inches, it’s essentially the size of a pocket square. I loved how portable it was—I’ve carried it in everything from backpacks to jacket pockets without the faintest discomfort. Despite its tiny stature, the device doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. The plastic build is sturdy enough to withstand casual bumps during travel. For someone who’s constantly hopping between places, the design is spot-on.

**Ease of Setup**

Setting up this little unit was unexpectedly simple. I’m generally skeptical when a product claims to have ""easy setup,"" but this one lived up to the promise. All I had to do was connect it to a Wi-Fi or Ethernet source, and within a few taps in its intuitive admin panel, it was already up and running. There’s also an option to use their mobile app, which I found user-friendly and efficient for personalizing network settings. Whether you’re a tech guru or a complete newbie, it’s hard to go wrong here.

[Check GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 price on Amazon.](https://nilvec.com/p/b073tsk26w/)

**Performance and Features**

The device runs only on a 2.4GHz network, but for most of my needs—email, browsing, and even streaming basic content—it performed smoothly. It might not be blazing fast compared to modern 5GHz networks, but it does the job well enough. Testing its capabilities as a repeater, I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively it converted weak public Wi-Fi signals into a stronger, more secure private connection. This feature alone makes it a goldmine for frequent flyers or those working remotely from coffee shops. Plus, it's compatible with over 30 VPN providers, thanks to the pre-installed OpenVPN client. I mean, who doesn't like keeping their browsing secure on sketchy networks?

**Flexible Power Options**

Another thing I loved was how versatile the power options are. You can juice up the device using a laptop USB port, a power bank, or a 5V/2A DC adapter. On a long layover at the airport, I used my regular portable charger to keep it running. This flexibility is a blessing for us travelers since power outlets aren’t always easy to find.

**Open Source and Programmability**

What makes this product stand out from its peers in the same price range is its versatility in programming. It comes pre-installed with OpenWrt, an open-source operating system designed specifically for networking. While I didn’t dive too much into the tweaking side of things, it was reassuring to know I could expand the device’s functionality if I wanted to, including attaching USB drives.

**Key Benefits**

- Extremely portable and lightweight design perfect for travel.
- Simple setup process suitable for all experience levels.
- Works excellently as a public Wi-Fi repeater to improve security.
- OpenVPN client pre-installed, with compatibility for multiple VPN services.
- Versatile power options via USB or power bank.
- OpenWrt programmability for advanced users.

**Shortcomings**

- Limited to 2.4GHz networks; not ideal for heavy streaming or gaming.
- Doesn’t include a power adapter in the package; you’ll need an existing setup.
- While compact, the build could feel basic compared to premium models.

**Market Rivals**

When I compared this travel router to similar products, a couple of alternatives stood out: the TP-Link TL-WR902AC and the Netgear Trek N300. While both have their strengths, such as dual-band Wi-Fi on the TP-Link and a solid build with the Netgear, neither matched the GL.iNet’s ease of use and advanced features like OpenVPN compatibility. The TP-Link has a slight edge with dual-band capabilities, but its interface isn’t as user-friendly. On the other hand, the GL-MT300N-V2 wins hands down when portability and secure public Wi-Fi access are the priorities.

**Budget-Friendly**

For the range of features packed into this device, it’s easily one of the most cost-efficient options out there. The programmability, VPN support, and impressive portability make it feel like I’m getting significantly more value than anticipated. It’s rare to find a device this well-rounded at its price, making it a smart spending choice for travelers and remote workers alike.

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

But he didn’t.

His gray eyes stayed emotionless.

“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.

Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.

All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.

“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.

I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.

His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.

His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.

“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.

He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.

“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”

“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”

His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.

And… well, I did.

I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.

The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.

His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.

“You shouldn’t keep tempting me, Miss Collins.”

His body was pressed against my thighs—I definitely felt the effect I was having on him.

“Why?” I whispered, licking my lips. “Because your self-control isn’t as strong as you thought?”

“Because I don’t fuck virgins.”

What the actual hell???

The next second, he had pulled away. I scrambled off the desk, face red, eyes wide.

“What did you just say?!” I snapped. “Why—How the hell do you even know—?”

“I know who you are. And I know about your relationship with my sister’s husband.”

And just like that, everything clicked.

It was Jace.

That bastard didn’t just dump me—he ran his mouth about my virginity to everyone, including Grayson.

Humiliation crashed over me like a wave.

“Jace is a fucking asshole,” I snapped shakily.

Grayson shrugged. “Obviously. But Brielle likes him. And he’s family now. I’m sorry but I just can’t get involved in this.”

I climbed off his desk with my whole body red and shaking.

He didn’t want me. And he was taking his sister and Jace’s side.

I was so damn stupid to think that one kiss in the car actually meant anything. But this was Grayson Hart for Christ’s sake. He could have anyone he wanted.

“I’m sure you’re a very capable employee, Miss Collins. But seducing me won’t help your career. I wish you all the best.”

He finally pressed the intercom button. His assistant appeared at the door, waiting for me to leave.

“Bye,” I whispered without even look back. I didn’t want him to notice my falling tears.

I walked out of that office, numb, and rode the elevator down like a ghost. My mind was a storm of bills, debt, and Grayson’s ice-cold stare. Now I desperately needed a new job.

“Miss Collins!”

I turned and saw his assistant come rushing out again, holding an envelope.

“Alpha Grayson asked me to give you this,” she said, handing it over.

“What is it?” Why didn’t he give it to me earlier?

“He didn’t say. Maybe you’ll know once you open it.”

She gave me a mysterious smile and walked away.

I opened the envelope. A blank check slid out first—I held my breath in shock.

Then I found a crumpled note. His handwriting, rushed and messy.

Haven’t repaid you for the shirt. Hope everything works out for you Aria. Stay strong. —Grayson

# Chapter 5 Getting My Attention

Aria’s POV

“That check clearly means something,” May insisted.

“Come on. We’re not doing this again,” I sighed.

“If he’s not into you, then why did he give you that check? He probably saw you crying and couldn’t stand it. You should definitely go back and see him again.”

“Nope,” I shut it down immediately. “I had one perfect, fairytale encounter with a rich bachelor. That’s enough. I’m not about to go back there and humiliate myself all over again.”

“But—”

“Hey, you two!” our manager yelled from the other end of the aisle. “Less talking, more working!”

We rolled our eyes at each other and got back to inventory.

May had helped me land this supermarket job.

It was part of a chain under a big corporation, so the pay and benefits weren’t bad. May still thought it was beneath someone with my degree, but honestly, I was just grateful to be employed.

Once we finished our section, the manager wandered off to shout at someone else, and May scooted back over to me.

“Just imagine it,” she grinned. “You could write a couple million on that blank check and…BOOM! Instant rich girl life.”

“I’m not gonna do that.”

“Sure you won’t. You’re too nice,” she muttered, half-admiring, half-scolding. “So? What are you gonna write?”

I hesitated.

At first, I actually considered writing the price of a shirt. 19.99 that was. Because apparently, my dignity still thinks it matters.

But let’s be real, Grayson wasn’t just paying me back for a ripped tee, or he would’ve simply handed his assistant a $20 bill.

Maybe… he felt bad I lost my job too.

“I’m going to write the amount I should’ve gotten in severance,” I admitted eventually.

May's eyes bulged. “That’s it?!”

“I know it’s not much, but it’s what I actually deserve. And it’ll help me cover 2 months of bills.”

May sighed and looked at me like I was the biggest idiot alive. But my mind was made up.

I just wanted to walk away from the mess as quickly as possible. I still wanted to rip Jace’s smug face off, but the best revenge right now was surviving.

6 hours later, we finally finished our shift, exhausted and aching.

Everyone else got to clock out, but not me. I’d volunteered for night shift and closing duties.

The staffs left one by one, yawning, including May. Finally I was alone in this big market.

Now here’s the big secret—

I actually lived here now.

Nobody knew this, not even May.

She thought I’d found a new apartment and moved out, but I just couldn’t keep bothering her anymore. Her roommates were getting irritated with me hogging the living room and utilities.

And renting my own place seemed way out of budget now.

So I stayed in this supermarket instead.

I closed up the store at night and opened it early in the morning. For the 5 or 6 hours in between, I made a bed out of my coat and slept on the floor near the refrigerated section.

Now don’t ask me why I can’t sleep in the staff’s break room. That room was too hot without AC. At least it was cool by the freezer.

Tonight I was extra exhausted. The manager made us girls haul too many heavy crates around. I fell asleep on the floor in seconds.

It felt like I’d only been asleep for 5 minutes. My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet.

And I was jolted awake by someone screaming:

“—OH MY GOD! What the hell are you doing?!”

I shot upright, still half-asleep.

And I froze.

In front of me stood an entire group of people. Including the manager and several guys in suits. They were all staring at me wide eyes.

And I was only in a tank top and shorts. Half naked.

OH GOD.

What the hell…Is it morning already?!

Why didn’t I hear my alarm?

I scrambled to pull my clothes over my body, my hands shaking.

The stares didn’t stop. They got more invasive.

“Aria Collins! What the fuck are you doing?!” the manager stormed over and roared. “Napping half-naked in my fucking store?! Are you a fucking sex perv?!”

My face went beet red, “No! I—I was just staying here temporarily—”

“Temporarily?!” he yelled, eyes bulging. “I hired an employee, not a fucking squatter! How much water and electricity have you used free?! Have you been stealing food too?!”

“No I swear! I shut everything off when I’m done, I don’t use the water unless I have to…And I paid for everything I’ve eaten!”

Tears blurred my vision as I tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening. His spit actually hit my cheek as he snarled.

“Of all days—you had to pick the day corporate shows up to camp out in my perfect store. You filthy, disgusting little—”

“Aria Collins?”

A new voice called my name. It came from one of those suited men.

I looked up. And my heart dropped.

God I knew this guy. I think his name is Jonathan. A former coworker of mine from Apex.

“Holy shit, it is you,” he grinned in surprise, raising his brows. “Almost didn’t recognize you at first.”

“You… what are you doing here?” I stammered.

“Apex owns this supermarket chain. We’re doing site inspections today,” he said with a smirk, his eyes trailing down to my bare legs. “Man! Most people hit rock bottom after getting fired from Apex, but you fall faster than anyone.”

“I’m working. Making a decent living,” I said in shaky voice. “There’s no shame with that.”

“Oh really?” he sneered. “Does your job include lying around half-naked on the floor? What is this, a new hooker gimmick?”

The suits burst out laughing. My furious tears were on the verge of falling.

“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll fire her right away.” The manager groaned.

“Hold up,” Jonathan drawled with a smirk. “This chick got fired from Apex for messing up a seven-figure deal. You might wanna check your inventory. She could be stealing.”

I was furious. “You know that’s a lie! Jace made it all up. I never made a single mistake at work—”

“Oh please,” he cut me off. “Everyone in the industry knows how you fucked up. Jace was so embarrassed that he had to apologize to all the customers for you.”

The manager grabbed my wrist. “Then you’re definitely stealing from this market as well. That’s it. You are going to jail. When I figure out what you’ve taken, you must pay back everything!”

My heart pounded in my chest.

I didn’t doubt for a second that the manager would come up with something that I didn’t steal, just like how Jace framed me before. It wasn’t hard for guys like them.

But I couldn’t go to jail.

My grandma had no one to count on but me. I can’t leave her.

I knew what I had to do.

The wolf in me surfaced up the next second. I snarled at the manager, yanked my arm free, and ran.

“Stop her!” someone shouted behind me.

I had no idea where I was going. I just fucking ran. Desperate and horrified.

At the door, I slammed right into someone coming in.

“Get away from Alpha!” a bodyguard barked.

I staggered back in panic. But a large hand caught my wrist, steadying me.

“Aria?”

I looked up, still shaking involuntarily.

God, it’s indeed him! I couldn’t believe he’s here.

There’s a tight furrow between Grayson’s brows as he checked me up. Then he quickly unbuttoned his coat and wrapped me in, covering my half-naked body.

“It’s OK.” his voice was deep with clear hint of rage.

I clutched his shirt, gasping for air.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to breathe at all. Tears streamed down my cheeks.

“She’s having a panic attack,” a woman said nearby. “Alpha, if I may—”

I silently prayed him not to hand me over. And he didn’t.

“It’s fine, Nova. She stays with me,” he refused. “Aria. Breathe.”

Panicked footsteps echoed behind us. Jonathan’s voice rang out, stunned:

“Alpha Grayson! W-What’s going on here?!”

“Nova,” Grayson said in a cold, dangerous voice, “Stay here. Don’t let anyone leave.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

He scooped me up like I weighed nothing, one arm under my legs, the other around my back. I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck.

Then he carried me through the astonished crowd, into the store, and found a private room.

“You’re safe here,” he said after he shut the door.

That’s when I broke down. Crying out loud.

Fear, shame, panic—everything spilled out in a messy, helpless flood.

I clutched his wrist like it was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. He didn’t pull away.

I cried for 10 minutes straight He waited for my sobs to quiet down.

“Th-thank you…I’m better now.” I sniffled eventually.

He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. I shivered at the way he touched my skin.

“You are always a mess when I find you,” he said. “Why is that?”

“I don’t know…Fate?” I choked.

He let out a dark chuckle. “This is not good.”

“W-Why?” I didn’t mean to be miserable all the time.

His voice was low, rough, and strained.

“Because it’s getting harder and harder for me to leave you like this,” he said.",2,1755945868.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Starting with Big brother Khamrah OG - Well it's really strong sweet. Very niche imo. The sweetness from dates overpowers most of the other elements.i cannot smell any citruses in this (regardless of Frangrantica says) has a mild touch of vanilla and hint of spiciness but you have to pay attention to smell them thanks to the dates. Can be very cloying if over sprayed please use with caution. I dont use this in public (and never will) though I do use it as a good night scent (one spray from the decant on my night shirt, that's it!) since I find it very calming/ Soothing.

Now coming to the mid child Qawha - Usually the middle child is the ignored one, but not in this case. Seems like Lataffa put a lot of love into this one. They have toned down the sweetness from the dates in this one, other notes are more prominent now and they have added coffee. It's still very sweet though and coffee note does not last for the entire duration, however it's still more balanced and more pleasant to my nose than the OG. Can it get cloying if over sprayed? Hell yes! Will it wear it in public! Oh hell freaking yes! (Will just spray it 2-3 times though, not more). I personally loved this one and got a whole bottle of it.

And now the youngest child that wanted to be a rebel - Dukhan! And I think that's exactly what they tried to do...make it smell like a rebel's perfume by replacing coffee with Tobacco and the result is...well a bit so rebellious kid who smokes because of peer pressure 🥲. But jokes apart it's nice! I have seen a few YouTubers bash it for no reason. If you ever tried Tobacco touch and likes it...you will like this as well - this is more sweet thN TT though thanks to the dates however the tobacco note lasts longer than the coffee note in Qawha. I prefer this over the OG to be honest and will probably a bottle soon.

TL;DR - IMO Qawha>Dukhan>OG.

Note 1- I am a noob
Note 2 - Always buy decants! Perfumes are very subjective and very personal.",6,1755945776.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,11,0.88,False

Hey girls! 💕
(20F this side)

I’ve been thinking for a while that it would be nice to have a small, safe, and fun meetup just for us girls here in Jaipur. Sometimes it feels like we don’t get enough spaces where we can just relax, share experiences, and make new friends without any pressure.

So, I thought why not post here and see if anyone else would be interested?

Idea for the Meetup:
1)A casual hangout .(somewhere central and safe like place everyone feels comfortable).

2)Could be coffee, snacks, or even a lunch/dinner depending on what time works for most of us.

3)The main goal is just to meet like-minded women, share stories, maybe vent about life, studies, work, or just have fun conversations.

⛳️Why Girls Only?
Because sometimes we just need that safe, chill, and supportive environment where we can open up without hesitation. Also, it’s a great way to build a small community of women friends in Jaipur.

👺What Next?
	-If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me :)
	-No pressure at all just come with good vibes.
	-Even if only 3-4 of us show up, it’ll still be worth it!

I know meeting new people can feel a bit awkward at first, but honestly, it could turn out to be a really fun and memorable experience. 🌸

1mxxwdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Vegetable-Glove-8037/comments/1mxxwdf/upgrade_your_hydration_why_alkaline_water_is_the/,Upgrade Your Hydration: Why Alkaline Water is the Wellness Hack You Didn't Know You Needed,"https://preview.redd.it/ay83vqbmxqkf1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=565848544212e90f4209c4cd4b07bad4cd2584d7

We've all heard it: *""Drink eight glasses of water a day.""* But let's be honest — most of us don't think much about the water we drink. If it's clear and quenches thirst, that's usually enough.

Here's the twist: not all water is created equal. The kind of water you drink can have a massive impact on your energy, digestion, immunity, and even your skin. And that's where **alkaline water** comes into the picture.

Thanks to the **AlkyPure QDMR Water Reactor Device**, turning ordinary water into **mineral-rich, antioxidant-packed alkaline water** has never been simpler—no complicated machines, no powders, no waiting around — just fresh, upgraded water instantly.

**What is alkaline water?**

Let's break it down in simple terms:

* Your body's natural state is slightly alkaline, with a pH of around 7.4.
* But modern life — hello stress, processed food, sugar, coffee, and late-night pizza — pushes your system toward acidity.
* An overly acidic body isn't happy. It can lead to fatigue, sluggish digestion, low immunity, skin problems, and even faster aging.

Alkaline water helps bring your body back to balance. It neutralizes excess acidity, making your internal environment healthier for your cells to thrive. In short, it's water that does more than hydrate — it actively supports your wellbeing.

**Why does acidity matter so much?**

Think of acidity like rust for your body. When your system becomes too acidic, it creates the perfect environment for inflammation, low energy, and illness.

That's why people who switch to alkaline water often report:

* Less bloating and acidity after meals.
* Feeling more energetic throughout the day.
* Better skin clarity and glow.
* Fewer random ""down days"" of fatigue.

It's not magic — it's just science. By restoring your natural pH balance, you're letting your body function the way it was designed to.

**How does the AlkyPure QDMR work?**

The [**AlkyPure QDMR Water Reactor**](https://alkylife.com/product-detail/684be66610edf7fe0e079fb5) isn't just a filter. It's a **reactor device** that transforms water instantly as it flows through. Here's what happens inside:

* **Mineral infusion:** Adds essential minerals your body craves.
* **pH boost:** Raises the water's pH to alkaline levels.
* **Antioxidant power:** Reduces oxidation, fighting free radicals that speed up aging and cell damage.

Unlike other products that merely *claim* results, this one comes with a **pH/ORP testing kit**. That means you can check your water before and after, and *see the transformation yourself*.

**The benefits of alkaline water**

Alright, let's talk results. Here's what makes alkaline water worth the switch:

**💧 Better hydration**

The molecules in alkaline water form smaller clusters, which makes them easier for your cells to absorb. You stay hydrated longer and feel fresher.

**🌿 Relief from acidity and heartburn**

Tired of that burning sensation after meals? Alkaline water helps balance excess stomach acid, giving you natural Relief.

**🛡️ Stronger immunity**

Packed with minerals and antioxidants, it supports your immune system and helps your body fight everyday stress.

**✨ Glowing skin from within**

Hydration is the ultimate skincare. Combine it with antioxidants, and your skin gets the boost it needs to stay healthy, youthful, and glowing.

**⚡ Consistent energy**

When your body isn't constantly battling acidity, it runs smoothly. That means less mid-day fatigue and more steady energy.

**How to use it (super simple funnel design)**

Here's where the **AlkyPure QDMR** shines: using it is ridiculously easy.

1. **Pour water into the funnel at the top.**
2. As the water flows through the device, it instantly transforms into **mineral-rich alkaline water**.
3. Collect the water from the bottom — ready to drink right away.
4. Curious? Use the included pH/ORP kit and see the difference with your own eyes.

Using the AlkyPure QDMR is a breeze: no electricity, no powders, no complicated machines. Just **pour, transform, and sip**. Instant alkaline water, whenever you want it.

**Why choose AlkyPure QDMR over others?** Because it delivers instant results without any waiting or setup, it's designed for portability. It's built to last and provides proof, not just promises, with the included tester kit.

Sure, there are plenty of ""alkaline water"" options out there. But here's why this one stands out:

* **Instant results** – no waiting or setup required.
* **Portable design** – carry it anywhere, from the gym to the office.
* **Durable build** – long-lasting, not a flimsy gadget.
* **Proof, not promises** – with the tester kit, you don't have to take anyone's word for it.

It's designed for real people with busy lives who want an easy, reliable way to improve their hydration.

**Who is it perfect for?**

The short answer? Everyone. But it's especially game-changing if you're:

* A fitness enthusiast who needs quick, efficient hydration.
* Someone who struggles with acidity, bloating, or digestive discomfort.
* Constantly tired or running low on energy.
* Passionate about skincare and natural wellness.
* Looking for a simple but powerful lifestyle upgrade.

**Conclusion**

Water is more than just thirst-quenching. It's the foundation of your health. But not all water is equal.

The [**AlkyPure QDMR Water Reactor Device**](https://alkylife.com/product-detail/684be66610edf7fe0e079fb5) instantly transforms plain water into **mineral-rich, antioxidant-powered alkaline water**. With its funnel design, you pour water in at the top, and out comes wellness-packed hydration from the bottom — ready to drink, no waiting required.

If you're tired of feeling sluggish, dealing with acidity, or chasing expensive health fixes, start with the basics. Upgrade your water, and you'll upgrade everything else.

So here's the question: do you want to drink water… or do you want to **fuel your wellbeing with every sip**?",1,1755944883.0,u_Vegetable-Glove-8037,0,1.0,False

1mxxu0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kneel_before_sara/comments/1mxxu0g/ceos_submission_behind_the_mask_of_control/,CEO's Submission - Behind the Mask of Control,"Jessica stirred from the depths of sleep, her consciousness rising in time with the quiet, rhythmic drip of water from the bathroom. For a moment, she searched for the familiar weight of Mistress X’s arms, but found only cool, empty sheets—a subtle but undeniable absence. The haze of exhaustion clung to her limbs as her eyes fluttered open, half-expecting to see that dark silhouette beside her, but she was alone except for the faint glow of morning light filtering past the heavy curtains.

Across the room, the bathroom door stood ajar, fogged by the steam from within. Through the misted glass, she could just make out the shadowed form of Mistress X, graceful and unmistakable, moving beneath the cascade of water. The scene was strangely intimate, as if the glass somehow preserved the mysteries and power that X held even in a vulnerable state.

A quick glance at the bedside clock showed 7:46 AM. Time felt both irrelevant and impossibly distant, as if hours or minutes might have escaped her entirely. With a slow, measured effort, Jessica attempted to rise, but her body protested with every shift—muscles aching, skin tender, a bone-deep soreness in every joint. She had slept hard, but her mind and body were still thick with the echoes of last night’s surrender, every sinew keenly aware of the discipline and devotion that had brought her here.

Raising herself upright, she winced at the bruises, welts, and spent desire that had already begun to settle into memory. She felt, in every sense, as though she had been both reborn and thoroughly undone—the pleasures and pains of the night’s ritual now permanently etched into her skin and spirit. The room still smelled faintly of sex and sweat, mingling with the clean chill of morning air, grounding her in the aftermath of transformation.

Jessica sat on the edge of the bed, her feet finding the cool marble, one hand absently touching the white leather collar still encircling her throat. She stared at the dancing blur of X’s silhouette, caught between longing and trepidation, eager to rejoin the present and uncertain of what this new day might bring. The bathroom’s stream of water murmured on, a steady, reassuring constant as she gathered herself, waiting—willing herself ready—for whatever came next.

Jessica’s throat ached, every swallow a reminder of the previous night’s moans, cries, and the raw way she had given herself over to Mistress X. She took a shaky breath and, with slow, deliberate movements, pushed herself up from the bed. Her muscles protested, sore in places she hadn’t realized could ache, but she steadied herself and stood.

As she took her first unsteady steps toward the mini fridge, the rhythmic trickle of the shower ceased. Through the fogged glass, she heard the soft rustle of fabric—X drying herself, moving with her usual precision and grace.

Jessica reached the fridge and pulled open the door, the cool air brushing her bare skin. She grabbed a water bottle, fingers trembling, and twisted off the cap. The first sip was a revelation—cool liquid soothing her parched throat, easing the dry rasp that had taken root.

She stood there for a moment, gulping down the water, feeling the chill seep into her and waking her a little more. The bottle half empty, she paused, listening to the quiet sounds from the bathroom, acutely aware that her Mistress was just steps away, and that the night’s surrender had not ended with sleep—only paused for the dawn.

As Jessica twisted the cap back onto the water bottle, the glass shower door slid open with a soft, smooth rush of air. The sudden movement startled her, and she glanced up to see Mistress X stepping out, still completely naked, a towel knotted around her head to catch the last drips of water.

Her eyes, clear and sharp, landed on Jessica, and a small, amused smile played on her lips.

“Ha, you are finally awake, cupcake,” she exclaimed, the new pet name a playful, affectionate surprise that stood in stark contrast to the formal titles of the night before.

She padded across the floor with easy confidence, her nakedness as comfortable and unselfconscious as her attitude. “You were sleeping like a log, so I thought not to disturb you,” she continued, one hand brushing a stray tendril of wet hair from her face. “Do you want coffee?”, she added.

The question, so simple and mundane, hung in the air, a stark contrast to the raw intensity of the night before. It was an offer of normalcy, of gentle care, and to Jessica, it felt like another profound act of possession, just a different, quieter kind.

The word ""Mistress"" slipped out naturally, a familiar and grounding anchor in the quiet morning light. ""Yes, Mistress,"" Jessica replied, her voice still a little rough around the edges. ""I would like coffee.""

A small, satisfied smile touched X’s lips. ""Good,"" she proclaimed simply.

She turned, her naked body moving with an unselfconscious grace, and picked up the sleek intercom phone from the bedside table. She pressed a button, connecting instantly to the club's reception. Her tone was crisp and professional, a world away from the guttural commands of the night.

""Hi, can you send two coffees to the red room, please."" There was a brief pause as she listened to the confirmation on the other end. ""Thanks."" She placed the receiver back in its cradle with a quiet click. 

With the coffee ordered, X closed the small distance between them. She moved with a gentle purpose, her bare feet silent on the floor, and placed a warm, damp hand on Jessica's shoulder. The simple, grounding touch sent a comforting shiver through Jessica's sore body.

""Are you feeling alright, Jessica?"" X asked, her voice soft and laced with genuine concern. ""How is your back?""

Jessica drew a slow breath, the movement pulling at the tender welts. ""Yes, Mistress,"" she replied, her voice steady despite the faint tremor in her muscles. ""It still stings a little while moving, but I can handle it."" She met X's gaze, her own eyes clear and unwavering.

A wide, brilliant smile spread across X's face, her eyes crinkling at the corners. It was a smile of pure pride and affection. ""I know you can, cupcake,"" she said, running her fingers lightly down Jessica’s spine, just shy of the tender skin she knew would still be marked.

The praise, so simple and yet so profound, filled Jessica with a warmth that radiated from her chest, chasing away the last vestiges of sleep and soreness. A surge of pride swelled within her, straightening her spine.

""Thank you, Mistress X,"" she replied, her voice clear and resonant with a newfound, deeply settled confidence. It was a thank you not just for the praise, but for the trust, the pain, the release—for everything.

The sound of her full title, ""Mistress X,"" seemed to act as a trigger, a formal address that no longer fit the intimate space they now shared. Sara let her hand fall from Jessica’s shoulder, a subtle but significant shift in their physical connection. She took a small step back, creating a sliver of space, as if to properly introduce the woman who stood behind the persona.

""Yeah, about that 'X',"" she began, her tone shifting from soft concern to something more serious, more deliberate. ""I think it's time to reveal my identity to you, Jessica.""

Jessica’s breath hitched, her heart giving a sudden, sharp thump against her ribs. This was a monumental step, a level of trust she hadn’t dared to anticipate so soon.

""My name is Sara Williams,"" she stated plainly, her gaze steady and unwavering. ""And I work as a lawyer in D.C. at Howe Law Firm.""

The information landed with the force of a physical blow. Sara. A simple, elegant name. A lawyer. In D.C. The abstract, almost mythical figure of ""Mistress X""—a being of red rooms, latex, and exquisite control—suddenly crystallized into a person with a profession, a name, a life outside these walls. The untouchable dominant who had systematically dismantled and rebuilt her was also a woman who argued cases, filed briefs, and navigated the world of law.

Jessica’s breath caught. This was more than a moment of trust—it was a gesture of vulnerability, of realness, an invitation beyond the roles they had so carefully inhabited. In that tiny shift, the dynamic between them changed, if only for now, and the world outside the red room suddenly seemed closer than ever.

Sara let the weight of her revelation settle before continuing, her voice steady and thoughtful. “I chose the name ‘X’ to give you a sense of mystery—something to fuel your curiosity and help pull you into your subspace. ‘X’ was always meant to be the perfect dominant, nothing less,” she explained, her dark eyes seeking Jessica’s. “She was always in control, always wrapped in latex, always claiming what was hers, no questions asked… and certainly without your permission.”

Jessica listened, captivated, her mind reeling. X had been a construct, a meticulously crafted role designed specifically for her. A key to unlock the parts of herself she kept hidden. It wasn't a deception; it was a strategy, a gift of fantasy made real.

She paused, letting the words echo between them, the scent of shower steam still lingering in the morning air. For a long moment, the only sounds were the faint creaking of the old club building and a distant murmur of voices somewhere beyond the door.

Then Sara sighed, a small, rueful smile touching her lips. “Honestly, Jessica, I doubted you would ever fully submit to Sara Williams, a lawyer. I thought you needed someone larger than life, someone who demanded everything just because she could.”

The confession hit Jessica harder than any physical blow ever could. It was a raw, unguarded admission of vulnerability from the woman who had seemed utterly invulnerable. All this time, beneath the impenetrable latex armor and the unwavering, commanding gaze, there had been a flicker of doubt. A fear that she, Sara, in her everyday identity, might not be enough to inspire the kind of absolute surrender Jessica craved.

In that moment, Jessica's awe deepened into something far more profound. It was no longer just about submission to a powerful Mistress. It was about devotion to a complex, brilliant, and surprisingly fragile human being. The persona of ""X"" wasn't a deception; it was a gift. It was the armor Sara had donned to give Jessica the dominant she needed in order to let go.

The thought that Sara believed she would only submit to a fantasy, and not to the real woman orchestrating it all, sent a pang of aching tenderness through her. Jessica knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she had to erase that doubt completely. Her submission was not, and had never truly been, for X. It was for the mind, the will, the soul of the woman standing before her, whatever name she chose to wear.

Jessica took a shaky breath, the weight of Sara's vulnerability settling deep inside her. She moved closer, closing the gap between them until there was just enough space to look up and meet Sara’s eyes. There was no hesitation, only a fierce, clear devotion.

“Let me make something perfectly clear to you, Sara,” Jessica began, her voice soft but unwavering. “I didn’t submit to X because she was some perfect, mysterious fantasy in latex. Yes, X was powerful, and intriguing, and so, so easy to lose myself in, but what truly undid me—what truly called me to surrender—was the mind and the soul behind all of it. It was you.”

She reached out and took one of Sara’s hands in both of hers, grounding her words with gentle, honest touch.

“You crafted X to protect something you thought I could never want, but it’s that very heart—your heart—that I crave. When I knelt for X, I was really kneeling for the one who saw the real me, who took the time to know my desires, my boundaries, my fears—and who cared enough to build a world where I could be completely myself. No fantasy, no mask, no script could ever replace how safe you made me feel. Or how much you inspire my trust.”

Jessica squeezed Sara’s hand, her gaze shining with emotion.

“I would submit to Sara Williams, the brilliant lawyer and the flawed, complex, extraordinary woman behind all of this, a thousand times over. X was a door you opened for me. But it was you I walked through for. She was the beautiful, terrifying storm I needed to walk through. But I was always, always, walking towards you.""

She looked up at the woman who was both her Mistress and her anchor, her voice dropping to an intimate whisper. ""My submission isn't for an initial. It's for Sara Williams. It always has been. And I would be honored to prove it to you, every single day.""

Jessica leaned in, rising slightly on her tiptoes, and pressed a tender, lingering kiss to Sara’s lips. It wasn't a kiss of fiery passion like the night before, but one of profound affirmation—a seal on her vow, a silent promise to the real woman standing before her.

Just as Sara began to respond, a sharp knock rattled the door, slicing through the charged silence. Sara pulled back, a playful glint in her eyes. She let out a small, amused laugh and said, “Ah, it seems our coffee is here. Can you get them, cupcake?”

The old endearment returned, but now it carried the softness of a morning after, a new tenderness threading through the familiar dynamic.

A playful, almost giddy energy sparkled in Jessica's eyes as she dipped her head in an exaggeratedly ceremonious bow. ""Sure, Goddess Sara,"" she announced, her voice brimming with cheeky reverence, a bold smile tugging at her lips.

She let out a soft, mischievous laugh, keeping her eyes downcast in a theatrical show of devotion. ""Do you want your humble slave to walk or crawl?""

Sara burst into genuine laughter, the sound rich and warm, filling the room with lightness. ""Walking would be fine, slave,"" she replied, her amusement clear, her affection even clearer.

The exchange was light, yet it settled the new dynamic perfectly. It was a shared joke that held a profound truth: the roles remained, but the foundation had shifted from the mysterious and intimidating ""X"" to the very real, and perhaps even more powerful, Sara.

Jessica grinned, a spark of playful obedience in her eyes. “Gotcha,” she said softly and began to walk toward the door.

With a careful twist, she unlocked the handle and swung the door wide open.

Her breath caught as she stumbled visually, surprised to see the woman who stood before her.

Standing before her was not a club attendant in a simple uniform. It was a vision of extreme, disciplined servitude that made the air freeze.

The woman was Black, with stunning, statuesque beauty. Her brunette hair, streaked with glowing copper highlights on the sides, was pulled back severely, framing a face of serene composure. Her hands were bound tightly behind her back in a leather armbinder, forcing her shoulders back and her chest forward. But it was the tray that made Jessica's mind reel.

It wasn't held. It was suspended, attached by two short, taut chains leading up to a thick leather collar locked around her neck. Upon the tray sat two steaming mugs of coffee. Another leather strap ran around the woman's torso, cinching just below her exposed, perfect breasts, emphasizing her vulnerability. Her feet were locked into severe, black ballet-style boots, forcing her onto the very tips of her toes, a posture that would make walking agonizingly difficult under normal circumstances. Balancing the precarious tray of hot coffee seemed an impossible feat of discipline.

Despite this torturous posture, the woman’s voice was perfectly level, devoid of any strain or resentment.

""Your coffee is here, mam.""

The surreal sight juxtaposed power and servitude in a way that left Jessica momentarily breathless, reminding her of just how many layers there were in their world of control, submission, and unyielding strength.

Jessica snapped back from the stupor, the sight jolting her into action. ""Um... yeah... thanks,"" she managed to say, her own voice sounding small and hesitant in the quiet corridor. She reached out with both hands and carefully lifted the two steaming cups from the tray, her movements precise, terrified of upsetting the woman's delicate balance.

""You are welcome, mam,"" the woman replied, her tone perfectly even. She dipped her head in a slight, respectful nod.

Then, without hesitation, she turned away and began to walk back down the corridor.

Jessica watched, captivated and awed. Despite the severe constraints—the armbinder binding her hands, the tray chained to her collar, the ballet boots making every step a trial—the woman moved with an unexpected grace. Her body flowed like a wave, each step sending her lithe form sliding subtly in precise, fluid arcs. It was as if she had mastered the impossible, turning a seemingly torturous predicament into a dance of effortless control.

Jessica stood in the doorway, the two coffee cups growing cool in her hands, watching until the woman disappeared around a corner. She was left with the ghost of an image—a vision of submission so profound, so practiced, it seemed almost supernatural. She slowly closed the door, her mind reeling, her own journey suddenly feeling like the first tentative steps of a child.

Jessica turned away from the door, the image of the restrained attendant still vivid in her mind. As she walked farther into the room, she let out a soft, involuntary ""Wow,"" her voice heavy with genuine awe.

Sara, who had just finished fastening her bra, glanced up, catching Jessica’s expression. A knowing smile flickered across her lips as she reached for her panties. ""Eh, you'll get used to it,"" she said, her tone wry, almost conspiratorial, suggesting that such sights were commonplace in the rhythms of their shared world.

As Jessica set the coffee cups down on the counter near the fridge, she turned back to Sara, watching her continue to dress with efficient, practiced movements.

Doubt creeping into her voice, Jessica asked, ""Are you leaving?""

Sara nodded as she slipped on her underwear. ""Yeah, I have to be at the office by 9AM."" She glanced at Jessica, her eyes softening with both affection and amusement. ""What about you?""

Jessica thought about her own high-stakes world of meetings, deadlines, and corporate responsibilities. It all felt a million miles away, a life belonging to someone else. ""I feel like I'm not going to go to the office today,"" she said, her voice soft with the certainty of her decision. The idea of facing a boardroom or spreadsheets in her current state seemed absurd.

Sara’s smile grew wider as she fastened her blouse. She arched an eyebrow in playful tease, her voice laced with a teasing edge. ""Perks of being the CEO, eh?""

Jessica took a slow sip of coffee, her eyes meeting Sara’s over the rim. The rich, dark liquid was both comfort and fuel, grounding her in the moment. Jessica let out a soft, wry sigh. ""It is harder than you think, you know,"" , acknowledging the burdens of the life she’d left outside the red room.

Sara, now fully dressed in her sharp work attire—white shirt tucked flawlessly into a black pencil skirt—and her heels clicking softly on the floor, moved toward Jessica with a confident, measured grace. “Yeah, yeah, I know,” she replied, her tone playful but acknowledging, a subtle nod to the responsibilities they both carried outside these walls.

She reached for her own coffee cup, lifting it smoothly before taking a slow, deliberate sip.

Jessica watched her for a moment, a wave of longing washing over her. The thought of Sara leaving, of this intimate bubble bursting, was unbearable.

She closed the small distance between them, her body moving with a languid grace that stood in stark opposition to Sara's brisk energy. Her fingers, light as a whisper, found the loose top button of Sara’s shirt, right at the hollow of her throat. She didn't unbutton it, but instead twisted it playfully between her thumb and forefinger, a small, intimate act of defiance against the day that was trying to pull them apart.

Looking up at Sara through her lashes, Jessica's voice dropped to a husky, pleading whisper.

""Come on... do you really have to go?""

Sara’s expression hardened with playful authority, though her eyes sparkled with amusement. “Yes, cupcake, I reeaallly have to go,” she said, emphasizing each word. “I have a case that I need to attend in court.”

Jessica lifted the coffee cup in her left hand, a glint of mischief in her eyes. She tipped it slightly, letting the dark liquid slosh dangerously close to the rim, and looked directly at Sara. ""But you can't go to court with a ruined shirt, can you?"" Jessica mused, her voice a silken purr. “What will you do if I ‘accidentally’ spilled this coffee on your white shirt?” she teased, her voice light but edged with challenge.

Sara didn’t even flinch. She met Jessica’s gaze, and for a fleeting moment, the warm, affectionate Sara was eclipsed by the sharp, thrilling intensity of Mistress X. A slow, dangerous smile spread across her lips. She leaned in slightly, her tone dropping into a low, commanding register. “In that case, I will have to call off my appointment, and request another seesion. It might ruin my reputation.” She left a pause and continued.

""But you seem to be forgetting how we would spend my newly cleared schedule. You want my time so badly? You'd get it. Every single second. And I promise you, by the time I was done, you would be on your knees, begging me to go back to the office.""

It was a playful threat—an unspoken promise, and a reminder that their roles, though now rooted in trust and devotion, were far from gone. They had simply entered a new chapter, where Sara could be both lawyer and Mistress, and Jessica could be CEO and slave—each identity real, each connection undeniable.

Jessica’s playful defiance shimmered in her eyes. “Oh, you’re not making me want to do it any less,” she teased, her voice a silken challenge.

In an instant, Sara’s hand darted forward and closed tightly around the O-ring on Jessica’s collar. The pull was firm, deliberate, forcing Jessica’s body to arch slightly as her head snapped up, eyes meeting Sara’s. The warm, familiar Sara was gone—replaced by Mistress X, her authority crackling in the air.

“Don’t get cocky, thinking you’re a masochist, bitch,” Sara’s voice was icy and sharp, her eyes blazing with unmistakable command. “You have no idea what real punishment from me feels like.”

A thrill of fear ran through Jessica—the suddenness of it, the raw physicality, the way Sara’s grip on the collar rendered her so exposed. The playful daring in her eyes wavered in the face of Sara’s ferocious intensity.

Sara held the collar, staring down at Jessica, her posture radiating unshakable dominance. “Now,” she murmured, her voice low and dangerous, “tell me, slave… do you feel like making an accident?”

Jessica swallowed hard, her playful defiance evaporating beneath Sara’s unflinching grip and the chill of the O-ring against her throat. Her submissive instincts surged back, her body suddenly alive with memory—her true place, her real hunger.

“No, Mistress,” she whispered, her voice small and earnest, eyes flickering down. “Sorry.”

Sara’s grin broke through her stern facade, no real anger in her—just the sly satisfaction of a game played and won. The air between them hummed with shared understanding, the stakes both understood and savored.

“Good girl,” she murmured, rich approval warming her tone. She gave the collar one last, soft tug—not to hurt, but to underline the point—before her fingers slipped away. Her thumb traced Jessica’s cheekbone, a fleeting, tender gesture.

She leaned in, close enough that her breath ghosted against Jessica’s skin. “Now be a good slave,” she said, her voice low, warm, edged with authority, “and let me get to work with a kiss, huh.” It was command and invitation both, a reminder that surrender could be as sweet as it was inevitable—especially when Sara was the one asking.

The command hung in the air—both a peace offering and an order. Jessica’s mind was a battlefield of conflicting instincts: the raw, primal urge to please her Mistress clashed with the electric fear still coursing beneath her skin. She was a puppet, her strings expertly pulled, and her body moved before her thoughts could catch up.

Driven by nervous energy, she surged forward in a quick, almost clumsy motion. Her lips met Sara’s in a contact so brief it barely existed—a ghost of a touch, a whisper of pressure that lasted no longer than a heartbeat. It was the kiss of a frightened subordinate, not a devoted lover. Jessica felt the cool, smooth texture of Sara’s lipstick, caught the faint scent of coffee on her breath, then pulled back, eyes downcast, the weight of Sara’s threat clinging to her like a shroud.

She stood there, waiting—for dismissal, for any sign that her meager offering had been enough.

But Sara didn’t move. A low, amused chuckle rumbled in her chest. She hadn’t expected hesitation, yet there it was: a slave trembling not from pain, but from the anticipation of it—from the thrill of pushing her Mistress’s limits, and the delicious dread of what might come next.

That kiss was an apology, a surrender, and an acknowledgment all wrapped into one achingly vulnerable moment. Sara had reminded her wayward slave that beneath the CEO’s bravado and playful teasing, Jessica was still hers—still capable of being reduced to nervous submission with nothing more than a firm grip and a commanding voice.

A slow, predatory smile finally curved Sara’s lips. She had wanted to see if Jessica understood the boundaries, and this hesitant, trembling kiss was the perfect, beautiful answer. 

With a final, satisfied smile, Sara broke the intense spell. She turned away from Jessica, lifted her coffee cup from the counter, and took a slow, deliberate sip. The simple, domestic act was a signal—the game was over, for now. The lawyer had returned, but the memory of the Mistress still flickered in her gaze.

“Look,” Sara said, her voice settling into a calm, even cadence that soothed after the sharp command, “I get off work by 7. How about we have dinner together, huh?” A small, reassuring smile curved her lips. “You can choose the place.”

The offer marked a welcome shift from the high-stakes tension of moments ago. It was an invitation back into their shared reality, where they were partners—and a subtle gift of control after having so thoroughly taken it away.

Noticing the conflict still warring in Jessica’s eyes—the desire, the fear, the exhaustion—Sara softened her tone, pure care threading through her words. “You just take a nice, hot shower,” she instructed softly. “Go home and get some rest. The day will pass faster than you think.”

It was a delicate yet deliberate reminder: the world outside their dynamic would keep spinning, and their lives would carry on. But with a single invitation, Sara wove the promise of another encounter into the hours ahead—a quiet assurance that tonight, they would slip back into the rhythm only they understood, guided by tenderness and intensity alike.

The promise of dinner was an anchor, and Jessica felt the nervous tension in her shoulders finally release. A slow, genuine smile spread across her face, born of the sweet anticipation that now filled the room. ""Sure,"" she replied, her voice steady and warm. ""See you tonight.""

""Good,"" Sara said, the single word sealing their pact. She placed her coffee cup on the counter with a soft click and retrieved her car keys from a nearby drawer, the familiar jangle a sharp intrusion of the world outside. Her movements were swift and precise, the efficient lawyer fully re-emerging.

As she walked to the door, she spoke over her shoulder, her tone practical but considerate. ""You can find your clothes in the cupboard, and you can leave whenever you want. Everything with the club is taken care of."" The words were a quiet assertion of her control, a blanket of security that absolved Jessica of any logistical worry. It was another form of ownership—the seamless management of her world.

At the door, Sara paused, her hand on the handle. She slid it open, then looked back at Jessica one last time. Her gaze was sharp, clear, and held a warmth that seemed reserved only for her—a look that acknowledged everything the last hour had encompassed: the power, the teasing, the threat, and the deep, underlying care.

""Oh,"" Sara added, her tone almost casual, as if it were a minor detail she'd nearly forgotten. ""You can remove the collar when you go out.""

The permission landed with more force than any command. It wasn't a release from ownership; it was a profound statement of trust. The collar was a potent symbol, but the bond it represented was now branded so deeply onto Jessica's soul that the physical object had become secondary. It was Sara's way of saying, You are mine, with or without this. The world won't see our mark, but you and I will always know it's there.

Without another word, Sara slipped out, the door closing with a soft, definitive click. Jessica was left alone in the quiet of the red room, her hand instinctively rising to touch the cool, smooth leather at her throat. The permission felt heavier, more binding, than any lock ever could.",1,1755944651.0,u_kneel_before_sara,0,1.0,False

The French-Japanese restaurant was awarded 2 Michelin stars in the Michelin Special Guide for Aichi Prefecture and has been awarded Tabelog Silver continuously for the last 8 years.

Chef Kujuhara trained at Quintessence and Hajime previously and his passion for combining French techniques and Japanese ingredients is clear to see in most dishes. 

The ingredients fittingly showcased the very best of Tokai region’s (Aichi, Shizuoka, Gifu, Mie) produce, exemplified by the inclusion of hamo (pike conger) from Toyohama Port in Aichi, Ayu (sweetfish) caught from Waragawa stream in Gifu, and spiny lobster from Mie.  

Soft water from wells in Ise Shrine was used to make dashi which formed the base for Nagoya chicken essence consommé. The bread, supplied by Train Bleu bakery in Takayama. came in 3 kinds and were specifically paired to different dishes.

The fish dish was simply called ‘Sasue’, a tribute to the famous fishmonger Sasue Maeda in Shizuoka who supplies the best catch of the day. The fish variety changes everyday, hence it saves frequent printing of the menu, the chef joked. On that day, we got kinmedai encased in pastry and bathed in Japanese whiskey sauce.

Moving to the heartier fare, the eel from Mikawa in Aichi had a crispy skin and surprisingly went well with red wine sauce. The local Megumi duck was infused with aromatic spices and slow-roasted at low temperature.

The petit four trolley was a crowd pleaser serving an assortment of classic western confections, Japanese wagashi, and playful rendition of nostalgic treats often found in kombini (convenience stores), such as Pino chocolate and Kinoko no Yama (mushroom-shaped chocolates). The three of us ordered 12 different types of petit fours in total.

The lunch costs 22K yen inclusive coffee and tea. Reservation is easy and opens 60 days out on Tablecheck.
