1hdr0ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hdr0ql/how_do_i_know_when_to_plan_to_meetup_with_someone/,How do I know when to plan to meetup with someone or exchange contact information?,"I feel like for me interacting with people in real life, if it‚Äôs someone I want to interact with is the easy part of social interactions because I can use the environment to help prompt what to say without needing to really think about it, and I can use facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice to help gauge whether someone enjoys talking to me and whether the person likes what I have to say and how I interact.

I feel like the hard part is knowing when and how to plan a meetup with someone, or when and how to exchange contact information.  I mean I know that if I ask too soon it can turn someone off, but if I ask too late they may lose interest especially if romantic interest is involved as the person can go from single to in a relationship if I take too long, and knowing a good middle ground is challenging.  Also I‚Äôm not sure if what matters is more the length of time I‚Äôve known someone before trying to plan a meetup or exchange information or how well I get to know the person.  Also I‚Äôm not sure whether to try to exchange contact information first, to plan to meetup first, or do both at the same time.  It‚Äôs also hard to know whether I should ask for a persons number, social media, or offer to give my number.  Also I‚Äôm not sure whether I should only ask if I know the answer is going to be a yes or ask when unsure if the answer will be a yes based on the idea that they won‚Äôt mind me asking.  Also I feel like not drinking coffee, or alcohol can make it harder to think of what to say when asking for a meetup as I don‚Äôt want to sound like I do drink coffee by saying, ‚ÄúDo you want to get coffee sometime?‚Äù as I feel that could turn off the very types of people I would most want to be friends with or have a relationship with.

I feel like also a lot of social, texting, and dating advice I‚Äôve seen around isn‚Äôt really made for Autistic people because it relies somewhat on reading between the lines and I can take advice more literally than it‚Äôs meant to be taken in terms of having trouble seeing exceptions to certain rules.  Also I feel like people can give certain advice with certain hidden assumptions about who the person who‚Äôs getting advice would interact with, and how, that may be less likely to apply to neurodivergent people.  Also I think in general people who give dating advice might be more likely to in general read between the lines too much when the one asking is Autistic.  I mean as one example I noticed for a long time I took the rule against double texting too literally but then realized there are times that it‚Äôs ok to send multiple text messages in between responses.  For this reason I feel like just looking up social, texting, and dating advice can be better than nothing, but might not be as useful for me as it would be for a non Autistic person.",1,1734137379.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1hdr0hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hdr0hc/living_with_a_chronic_illness_is_destroying_my/,Living with a chronic illness is destroying my mental health,"In June of this year I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, a progressive autoimmune disease that causes arthritis and inflammation in the spine and other large joints. I have spent the last year in constant pain. I started treatment for AS in july and it is slowly started to work. Most days, I am feeling pretty ok, but today I feel like shit, both physically and mentally.

Having a chronic illness has made my anxiety so much worse. I spend every day from the moment I wake up until the second I fall asleep, obsessing over my health. I am scared I am going to die early. I am scared that there is more going on with my body. I analyze every ache and pain, and it has sent me into a downward spiral. Lately my heart rate has been so high from being anxious all the time and on the verge of a panic attack. I had a doctor's appointment and my doctor noticed my heart rate was high. I told her I was aware and that lately I feel like I am so aware of my heart beating all the time and experiencing palpitations. She next me for an EKG as a precautionary thing, but the EKG came back abnormal and I was referred to cardiology. I was also given a prescription of propranolol to help with anxiety and bring me heart rate down. Now I am obsessing over if I am going to have a heart attack of not. I am scared the doctor is going to tell me something bad is wrong with me. 

I hate living this way. I take care of myself. I don't drink or smoke, I eat a balanced diet, I drink one cup of coffee a day, I play by the rules, I work my ass off, I work out. I have done everything right and I look at the people around me who treat their bodys like shit, but they are perfectly healthy. It's not fair. And I don't want something bad to happen to them, I just want to be normal again. I want to spend a day just laying in bed, watching TV and not suffer from pain in my neck and lower back. I want to eat a shitty meal and not have to worry if it will cause a flar up or not. I want to wear high heels and not suffer the next day, barely able to walk. I want to fly to Europe and not stress about sitting for a 9 hour flight. I want to fall in love and not worry if my chronic illness will drive a man away. I want to move to another state, and not be scared to lose a great team of doctors. 

Sometimes I feel like my life was stolen from me, and I am only 35. All the things I planned for myself feel impossible sometimes. No one around me understands because I look healthy on the outside. It's hard to talk about it with my family and friends because it doesn't make sense to them. 

Im sorry, I just needed to vent and have a good cry (which I did while writing this haha). ",2,1734137358.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I just couldn't chill out, this also coincided with a lot of diarrhea and some burps.

This happened last night and I almost called an ambulance. This morning after a coffee am getting that nervous in the chest and a little shaky, not as bad as last night.

I'm in desperate need of getting this off my chest.¬†

5 years ago I 35(f) made friends with another mum. Lets call her Sarah (40) ¬†

When we first met we got on like a house on fire. I had experienced a rough few years leaving a marriage and becoming a single mum, then starting a new relationship and dealing with a slew of health problems.¬†

After my marriage breakdown I had lost the majority of my friends and had a few years of just feeling generally distrusting of building new relationships. So after much loneliness it came as a lovely reprieve to meet Sarah and feel so at ease with someone so quickly. ¬†

At first our friendship was great, it was filled with days hanging out coffeeing and the occasional toke and hours of banter. Afternoons and evenings of joining our families together for occasions. Within a few short months we had become relatively attached at the hip. Things seemed to be pretty good.¬†

Although i noticed a few red flags. ¬†

For a little context I have been in therapy the last few years and now understand that for a long time I've really struggled with people pleasing. I have a terrible habit of even when someone shows me who they are I'll struggle to believe it and give endless chances. in the past I would willingly set aside myself in order to protect other peoples feelings or accommodate their needs and set aside my own. It's unfortunately a defense mechanism I habitually picked up through years of experiencing betrayal trauma in my childhood with one of my parents who during my younger years struggled with addiction and the false best friend narrative that was applied in that relationship meant I lost all sense of ever learning healthy boundaries around when it was ok to say no. Wasn't til the last few years I even knew I was allowed to set my own boundaries with people. If someone asked something of me I would have in the past just said ok. ¬†

¬†¬†

It became apparent early on that they're was a particular pattern that had¬† developed in our friendship dynamic, which was that Sarah had an inherent need to play a weird mother/sisterly role with me. At first I found it endearing as I had just thought it was the beautiful mothering nature that she seemed to exude and the way she had a gift for hospitality and always wanting to do things for people. I quickly started to realize that this had fallen into play based off her need for a sense of control over the way our friendship played out. Sarah had grown up with a¬† mother and sister who had bullied her and given her a Tonn of insecurities around her personhood that had meant that she had displayed¬† a strange need for control over things. At first it started out as little bits of advice here or there. Or wanting to invite me into feeling welcome to share what was going on in my life. But I had started noticing that it was¬†one sided.¬† I had started to feel¬†off about the way it felt like she only ever asked about super intimate personal details about my life but was extremely close handed with hers. I got the weird sense that she was using me as this really strange like tellanovella that she could use to fill her days. She was a stay at home mum that didnt work and every day was the same thing, come over, hang out, wanna get high? At first it had been ok but after a while It became exhausting and I had started to feel a little over crowded but didnt know how to express it so ignored my feelings. Maybe two and a half years into our friendship Sarahs¬† partner offered us an opportunity for my partner to take a job on the farm he worked on. This was an incredible opportunity for our family as we had recently had a new baby together and the financial security of the job and that it came with a home created a sense of security that we had been yearning for and desperately needed. ¬†

We got the job and home and now lived on either side of farm across from Sarah and her family and our men worked side by side. ¬†

¬†¬†

Once we were within close proximity things amped up. ( I should note aswell, that when sarah and I initially became friends I was in the midst of what my therapist described¬† as a trauma induced dissociative episode. It essentially just rendered me pretty blimmen flat for what felt like a really long time. I struggled to get out of bed or do basic tasks, I couldn't even bring myself to want to shower and tend to my own needs. The only thing that got me through those two years of deep depression was that every day I had to wake up for my kids and the encouragement of my partner. So When i made friends with Sarah i was just so thankful that someone wanted to be my friend again. The deep loneliness I had carried from the loss of my past friendships had blindsided me In to just being flattered to feel liked ) i started suspecting that her feeling like I was a constant cot case was feeding a need in her life that meant she was overly busy in mine. Her partner had been asking her to think about work or study or doing something now their kids were older and I had noticed that I had morphed into a weird convenience/distraction. I had younger kids so couldn't go back to work just yet and she was always using the needing to help me as an excuse and All of a sudden Sarah had taken it upon herself to make it her personal mission to decide she would fix my life.¬†

By the point we had started the transition to moving into our new home and job I had a change of councilor and had some massive progress with getting assessed, found out I'm neurospicy, I have ADHD, CPTSD, OCD, and a slew of sensory issues. Finding this out about myself actually was a massive relief as it made so much make sense. I was finally on a road to recovery and had started coming out of my depressive state and felt like myself for the first time in so long. So I was looking forward to the chance at a fresh start and relearning and setting new routines and just getting some semblance of my life back. ¬†

It began with Sarah insisting I needed help with setting my routines for me, she wanted us to do our fortnightly groceries together. She wanted to give me advice on how I should be parenting my kids, how I should be taking care of my house, how I should be handling things in my relationship and giving overly personal advice on things with my partner she was constantly niggling at everything. ¬†

At first I tried doing things like the shops together,¬† tried to be polite and take her suggestions as friendly advice. But it was getting out of hand,¬† it had started to feel like being constantly judged. She was constantly feeling the need to correct me. I know I'm responsible for tolerating and accommodating someone behaving this way, but for the first year we moved to our new home I battled with feeling like I wasnt allowed to say anything or even so much as complain as there were lots of digs about how lucky we were that they had helped hook us up with a job. that our life had gotten so much better since we had been friends, how she had helped me fix my mess. And it almost started to feel like a threatening undertone. Eventually a year into this happening and much encouragement from my councilor I had started attempting to express myself and my boundaries better. I still struggled at times in a moment when things would come up and happen I would go stun mullet and then walk away kicking myself for not speaking up. But I would always try to find a gentle and kind way to bring it up afterwards and then try to have some healthy conversation around the issue. However sarah has an incredibly avoidant personality style, when faced with confronting situations or anything that calls for any kind of ownership or accountability Sarah would just bounce and do this weird avoidant dance. It had happened on multiple occasions. There was a situation where her son had hit mine with a cricket bat across the arm and caused a pretty decent bruise and she up and withdrew her kid without even an apology or a conversation. After 7 days of not hearing from her which was very unusual I had to approach the conversation despite her being at fault and there was still no apology or reconciliation it was just gaslit and forgotten. This was just one of many situations.¬† ¬†

Her partner had also taken up the uncomfortable habit of despite the fact that I dont work on farm I literally just live here out of the good grace of the fact that my partner has a job that provides us a home, what happens for him at work is his responsibility as our provider and we have Established a boundary that I dont interfere in his work stuff so that it doesnt undermine his confidence as the leader of our family. So when Sarah's partner started coming to me to whinge about things my partner who was still at this point learning his new role, was doing wrong instead of talking to him and admitting that he didnt know how to tell him or deal with confrontation. This happened multiple times and to my partners discomfort I had to bring the things to him so that we had transparency because I wont lie to him.¬† There had even started being occasions where they had started to call him names. Would call him an oog oog neanderthal cos hes over 6ft and say hes just a bit slow. The hurtful part of this is that Sarahs aware my partner had learning difficulties as a child due to health issues. This created huge insecurity for him around feeling stupid or dumb as he used to get teased alot when younger. As an adult hes neurosoicy too, which sarah is also aware of and not only this, but has a son herself who is autistic and she constantly berates everyone on how noone understands how hard it is to raise a child that's different. And yet here her and her partner are always calling mine names. So I ended up bringing this up to Sarah. Which was met with her telling me I was overreacting and being sensitive and it was just jokes and that her partner was just coming to me because were friends.¬†

By this point I had started growing a pair and had on many occasions started approaching when things were happening with more ease so that I wasnt setting myself aside for her. ¬†this started rubbing Sarah wrong, she had started commenting on how I take offense to everything now and that I had become so confrontational, she even tried to blame my personality change on the fact that I had started going to church so I apparently was a judgmental christian now. Which by all means just cos i have a relationship with god doesnt make me perfect¬† I have no right to be judging anyone that's why I turn up to a hospital for the broken on a sunday. I get that my course correction and change in how I went from accommodating the behavior to learning to establish my own boundaries and then start to enact on them may have been hard for her. She had a¬† preconceived notion and narrative of who she thought I was and had started applying her own lens to everything.¬† At no point when addressing a problem have I ever approached her in a hostile manner but all of a sudden she had started making jokes about me being a bully.¬† ¬†

I've always been very open and honest about the fact that in friendship if I'm ever doing anything that's hurtful to you or in any way offends I would love for you to share that with me. I genuinely believe the only way to learn is to ask. So if I'm in the wrong say something. So I think my communication style and perhaps the way I am so open was perhaps confronting for her but I was overly mindful of that to the point where sometimes I had to pick my battles and wouldn't say anything at all put of fear of her thinking I was picking on her again. And the fact that it was the first time in our friendship where I had finally stepped back into the confident self assured part of my identity. With every day that I felt that little bit more progress the more I felt like the me I lost a really long time ago. But sarah never knew that person, and I had really hoped because she was my friend she would cheerlead for me. But she had started taking the progress I was making as a personal attack and became even more insistent that i take her advice or suggestions. It was like she liked it better when I was in an unwell mindset and was a mess. And it had started to feel like some weird competitive thing where I think she was only comfortable if she felt some kind of authority over me.¬†

I started to ¬†realise there were just a lot of ways we had very different perceptions of things but we were so entangled and ontop of each other and the more I tried to put in a little space the tighter she seemed to hang on, the more controlling she got. It started to feel like I couldn't get away as she was literally a hop skip and jump away from my home. I genuinely believe thats when the resentment and discontentment she began to secretly harbor towards me¬† had started seeping out in the way she had started to become really unchecked with her comments or snide digs. It's really hard growing up having to be in survival mode and learning to be extremely hyper aware and perceptive I had¬† developed good discernment for picking up on people and reading them and the vibe and tone of a situation to ensure my own¬† security and safety in an unstable environment and with a parent I had to be constantly vigilant with. So as an adult I'm very astute with people. I'm just unfortunately too willing to keep pushing forward if I think I can see the gold in them. And it was so hard, I genuinely cared about Sarah she has so many lovely qualities but I had realised the situation with my friend was starting to make me feel unsafe and¬† it had become a really toxic friendship.¬†

Things got hard when my partner and I got¬†engaged. I brought this to Sarah in a conversation at a later date to which she told me I've remembered wrong - But When I shared¬† our engagement with her instead of saying congratulations, she started spouting off about how annoying it is that she had been waiting for 10 years for her partner to want to get married. Several years prior to meeting her he had proposed but had no desire to rush into a marriage. Sarah had a complex about this and was a point of discussion and contempt throughout our friendship. I knew her heart just longed and had a desire for her partner and her to be bonded in marriage as they'd had¬† kids together and I knew it was important to her but I think not to him as much. So realizing it seemed to be a trigger I tried to keep my talk to a minimum. However Sarah would always instigate talk about what we were doing with our wedding at first, but it always turned into what she wanted for when she did it. Which I totally get. There were a few digs about how I was about to have my second wedding and she hadn't even gotten to one. I felt really awful. I didnt want my happiness to be her hurt. So I started to withdraw and tried to keep wedding talk to a minimum.¬† A few weeks into our engagement we had decided wed get married within a 7 month window. It worked out convenient as one of my siblings was home at this time from overseas. And we had decided on a small ceremony at home in our garden. When I initially told Sarah our plan again it wasnt met with excitement but the response ' oh great so now your stealing my idea of having a home wedding' again feeling awkward I withdrew. ¬†

A week or two later after minimal contact we caught up for coffee. I had started to try to initiate distance but Sarah made this hard as she would at times just turn up and this time when she did announced that her and her partner had set a date for a month after ours. I was so thrilled for her, I knew how happy she would be that there was finally the thing in sight her little girl heart hoped for. she had started turning up at my house more regularly for opportunities of talking¬† wedding plans together. But would always turn it into her talking about herself. Which was ok. If I'm honest I wasnt bothered. I was excited to get married but I knew it was different for her and i wanted her to feel celebrated. And this time i wasnt getting married for the sake of the marriage I was doing it for the person I fell in love with who values that commitment. And being his second marriage also we were playing it super lowkey. So I was happy to share in her excitement but it want lost on me how I had started to feel slightly resentful about how I couldn't really feel excited around her without it feeling like a thing. ¬†

About two months later after a few busy weeks and only brief interactions I had agreed to coffee. But in trying to protect my boundaries had decided I felt safer not inviting her to my home but going to hers. And as she had been home for a few months and on medication for a back issue where she wasnt meant to drive (although it never stopped her at times from coming to my place) but it had made it easier when I had insisted I come to her. I had noticed a pattern in how she had started to only come to my place. And it felt strange. So when I turned up this evening you know when you have just a strange feeling something's about to go down. Well boy was I right. ¬†

I sat with her and her partner in their lounge and we shared a coffee and smoke together. Sarah all the while sitting between me and her man and just seeming kind of off. ¬†

And midway through a conversation she no crap goes....¬†

' oh so I was saying mum that she cant tell my sister about the wedding as it meant to be a surprise'¬†

And then with a whole bunch of exaggeration¬† slapped her hands over her mouth. ¬†

Clueless I stared at her who was staring ahead avoiding looking at me or her partner, and I looked at him, who on the other side of her looked ropable. ¬†

I waited, and she removes her hands¬† looks at her partner¬† and says casually, ¬†

' I'm so sorry, I guess the cats out of the bag now'¬†

Looks at me, and proceeds to tell me like I haven't already known for a few months about her and her partners wedding plans, but how it's meant to be a secret. She slathered on for a bit.¬†

And after a while her man got obviously frustrated and stood up to excuse himself out to go to the garage. Bit before leaving passed a comment about how it doesnt matter because they wont be getting married unless shes had her surgery (which she was waiting on but anticipated would be done prior to their date)¬†

And then he walked out.¬†

Once the door closed she abruptly says.¬†

' like fuck if he thinks after making me wait this long that were going to put it off if my surgery gets delayed I'll walk down an aisle even if im a cripple'¬†

¬†¬†

I sat there stunned.¬†

I waited a minute ¬†

Then promptly asked her if the wedding stuff was meant to be a secret and if her partner was unaware I knew why didnt she tell me. And this woman no shit proceeds to blank faced stare at me and say ' I didnt tell you about it did I?'¬†

¬†¬†

Completely at a loss I immediately excused myself and left without much of a goodbye¬†¬†

I didnt hear from Sarah for two weeks¬†

¬†¬†

When I did it wasnt her apologising for having me sit complicit while she outright had me be apart of a lie to her partner without even so much as a heads up. But then she had completely gaslit me.¬†

I was fuming. But I thought maybe she might want to come round to talk about it. ¬†

It was super awkward she danced around avoiding things and I had to initiate the conversations. Perhaps it was unkind, but I was blunt and point blank asked why she lied.¬† ¬†

I've never in a conversation seen someone say something then rewind and erase it just as fast. But she in one breath admitted that he had wanted her to keep it to herself but she had been desperate to want to share it with a friend and wanted to be able to talk about wedding stuff ( which as a woman I get) so she had just told me. Then in the next breath said that I should know shes on so much medication at the moment that she had a bad memory and cant even remember saying any of those things. She then said she was sorry if that's how I remembered it and then when things got quiet and awkward she changed the subject and we awkwardly ended our coffee date. ¬†

After this I think she must have thought everything was ok as she went back to sending me daily memes and asking when we were hanging out next. I did the probably rude thing and¬† dodged her for a bit. School was ending up for the year. And xmas was approaching so it wasnt a lie when I said I was busy. Before xmas we had a shared work do and at the function their had been an altercation between one or her children and mine and just like always she had avoided aiding the situation and sat off in a corner pretending it wasnt happening. After that night I slowly just put more and more distance in. By the time the kids hit back to school we were now 2 months into only brief interactions and us conversing through memes without really addressing the awkwardness. I had come to the decision that if she had felt uncomfortable¬† in owning the truth and just being able to be honest with me about what happened then I was going to allow her space to approach me. I was done chasing her when¬† things happened and having to apologise for things that in reality were just boundaries. And I had started to have the wool pulled from my eyes. All the times I had a suspicion of the way that she would at times twist the truth or change a narrative to suit her needs. The way I had heard key statements time and time again that should have been an indicator that not only was she lying but she had been using me in lies for quite some time. I'm pretty positive now that all those times her partner had joked about things that she had done being my fault kinda confirmed that she was using me as a scapegoat. ¬†

I had started praying around the way I just wanted God to either come in and heal and mend this friendship or if it's not for purpose and isn't for me then to do the job for me. ¬†

Well boy did he ever. ¬†

This then ensued for the first two months of the year we had little to no contact. Eventually I reached out and offered a chance for us to try clear the air again as I didnt want to throw away a friendship or not be amicable when the boys still worked together and I think my heart still had hope that my friend was actually my friend. But I could¬† no longer deny the competitive nature and themes of control and resentment that were¬† coming up so I wanted to give her a chance.¬†

We organized for us to catch up in the early evening one night. I intentionally made it so her partner would be at work so she could have the freedom to be truthful and we could have an honest conversation without what had started to feel like him always for the last year being around us and surveilling what we would tall about. I think this had driven her need to share things in secrecy. Their relationship dynamic was unusual and she was always commenting on her partner being a warden and I had noticed that alot of her white lies derived from keeping small truths from him. I had also realised my dad has always said to me, how people talk about others in front of you is a good indicator of the ways they would be just as willing to speak of you in that manner. I had for a long time been¬† witness to how Sarah had negatively spoken, or bitched and moaned about others behind their back so I dont know what made me think she wouldn't have done it to me. I guess I was just ignorant.¬†

I went round there that night and ended up cornered with Sarah opting to rather than talk about it as friends she had taken the other route and decided to become defensive. She started literally screaming at me (which I also had shared in confidence that was an extreme trigger for me due to past experiences with my parent and her volatile fighting style of cornering me like an animal and screaming and hitting me) but sarah ripped into me about how shes again sorry that's what I think happened and that she didnt lie. That because of my response to her behaviour she thought I had abandoned our friendship and that I was just done with her so what did any of it matter. And how I should know that she has bipolar and mental health issues which makes her bitchy and mean and I know that sometimes it means her things come out sounding really awful but that I cant blame her for that. ( wanna note the entirety of our friendship¬†she said she has bipolar, but that she doesnt need medication. I don't presume to know the personal ins and outs. But always found it particularly odd that In 5 years she had claimed to never have gone to a councilor because they dont work for her kind of crazy) now by all means I can empathize with mental health struggles. But what I don't get is using it as a blanket excuse for poor behaviour and also having no intent of correcting that behaviour and continuously using it as a victim statement to excuse treating others like crap. She continues to scream at me about how hard her life has been the last year and how shes so tired of everyone treating her like a crazy person. Eventually after a while of her yelling at me I found my voice and tried to calm the situation and share my point of view about how I had felt bullied by her and that the nature of our friendship had turned into something competitive and ugly and that we were never meant to be in competition with one another but that we were suppose to support one another and encourage. That friendship is meant be filled with fun and joy. And that in the last few months I had tried to put a little space in place as I had felt alot of hostility and resentment towards me and wanted her¬†to feel welcome to approach it when she was ready. Essentially it kept going round in circles with her continuously lamenting that i was misreading things and being sensitive that I had remembered that night wrong and she never lied to me or her partner and that was end of.¬†¬†

Feeling frustrated i chose to excuse myself politely and exit.¬† A week or so later we had a run of bad luck, our son ended up in hospital with a concussion and during his stay got a viral bug that when we came home spread like wildfire within our family and we spent two weeks sick as heck. A week after that I was in hospital after slipping a disc, and within that same week my best friend from overseas had to bail on coming for our wedding, and our car had broken down. My partner and I were both run down and stressed with a wedding looming in 3 and a half weeks we decided to make a drastic change due to finances and timing we also could no longer get legally married at the dates my brother was available. So made the choice to scale everything back. Just have a commitment ceremony with our immediate family and get legally married¬† later with my mum and dad as witnesses. ¬†

This entailed us uninviting the few friends we had included, this also being Sarah and her partner. When I initially told her she seemed fine with it and had responded understandably. We still hadn't seen each other in person. The week of the wedding though she went radio silent. I had thought she had understood our choice wasnt a personal one, but that my partner and I had felt a huge need around that the day was for our kids and joining our family. So removing all the extra pieces and making it small wasnt because we didnt love our friends we had talked about a party at a later date. But i left it. We got married and went away. Everything went well and without complications and it turned out to be everything we could have imagine for the day. It was small and intimate and the kids had a blast. But i recieved no congratulations.¬†

After a few weeks Sarah slowly starting sending memes again, she had just lost her grandma so I reached out to express how sorry I was and I slightly uncertain but wanting to show up for my friend so went around to her place for a coffee. Turns out she had intentionally invited another friend over at the same time where he spent ¬†while I was their intimidating me by standing between myself and sarah with his back to me¬†during conversations and actively scoffing whenever I spoke. ( this man the entire time I knew him had always been one of those slimy guys who loved attention from any female. Everytime we had interacted in the past he had always been overly friendly to the point of discomfort) but this time it was completely different. You know when you have that moment were it clicks and you realise someone's been gossiping about you. I had started to put things together based off the things Sarah had said and had realised that foremost, after all our interactions I dont think she ever told her partner the truth of the situation of how she had me sit in on a lie. I'm also pretty sure that's when she started spinning a narrative that suited her lies. I genuinely think after our last altercation where she had lost her crap at me that she had realised that I wasnt going to let up. And I think deep down she had started probably panicking about all the times I had heard her lies or kept secrets for her and I think she was worried i would expose her to those around and her man. Personally I would never have said anything. She had been my friend i would never have broken her confidence. I just wanted an apology and acknowledgment so we could mend and move on. But I think it ran deeper for her. ¬†

Immediately starting to feel unsafe and realizing that I think she invited me over simply to intimidate me and prove a point. I excused myself and went home. ¬†

I ¬†didnt hear from her for 2 weeks, until everything changed for me.¬†

¬†¬†

I got a call on a a friday night from my mum to say my dad had collapsed and had a heart attack. I turned up to a pretty traumatic scene. My dad had to be airlifted to hospital and we had a four day wait before they confirmed he was brain dead and we made the decision to turn off the machines. It's by far the hardest thing I've ever experienced in my life. My dad was everything to me so I was absolutely devastated. ¬†

Not once while my dad was in the hospital did I hear from Sarah. My husband had even mentioned that he had told her partner and everyone at work. And i know they literally gossip about everything so there was no way she didnt know about what had been going on. And I was really hurt. ¬†

The day after he died i messaged her asking her where she was and saying my dad had passed. ¬†

Her response was literally,¬†

sorry i heard about your dad being in hospital and didnt want to bother you. ¬†

Um in the almost 5 years of friendship she had never not interjected or thought about bothering me but all of a sudden when I needed a friend most she had completely checked out. After years of bullying and me constantly tending to her I hit my brick wall and realised it was enough. I responded by saying I was really disappointed and that even if we had been in an awkward state and our friendship was strained that had the roles been reversed I would have turned up for her and that I was really hurt. ¬†

I got no response. ¬†

For three weeks I sat furious going through my dads funeral, and going through the motions of grief I made an impulsive decision to reach out one last time. But this time to have my say. To express some of the things I had been unable to express in person due to her avoidance and constant gaslighting and essentially called her out on her hurtful behaviour and then I politely ended by wishing her well hoping she could learn something from all this and try to be a more safe space for friendship in the future. Friendship isn't about controlling someone or something. It isn't about manipulating others for our own needs. I've had bad friend relationships before. But this had by far blown me out the water for the levels to which a person would go to protect there own lies. ¬†I never got any response. 5 years and she had inherently decided to take the cowards way and bounce

Strangely over time and continued silence. I started to move forward. I started to realise how much happier I was without the weight of that toxic friendship. And things have been really good. Been¬† a hard year but holy heck ive found so much of myself again. Through my grief I started painting again. My dad was a creative and I always aspired to explore joy through art. So I've really been learning to focus on my happiness again and remembering to just trust god with the finer details. ¬†

Turns out I didnt need to do the awkward fade away.¬† God had that person take themselves out the door. It hurt an awful lot.¬† I really had to work on my expectations of others and how once again to believe when someone shows you who they are. Over the last few months I've heard stories and little things that have been said about me. I'm trying my best to just keep my head down, stay in my lane and not let the bitchiness get to me.¬†i also had to work through alot of personal shame for having not stood up for myself earlier and feeling like i should have known better. But honestly sometimes you just dont see things coming. This year has definitely taught me that.

¬†¬†

But here's where I may be a little petty. Haven't done it yet.... so I may back up and just do the better thing. But the little gremlin in me also wants to have a slight dig. Just to let her know that while she may feel in some sick way like shes won. And I hope that her tarnishing my reputation has made her feel better about the stories she had to tell herself and others  about who I am. ¬†

But given we still have men who work together. Which means once a year I still have to see her face. I recently was made aware by a friend how she had noticed that Sarah and one of her other friends seem to be making petty comments online and that they seem pretty directed at me. But the funny thing was that she mentioned in passing that they seem to have developed a fun new nickname for me. But we think shes started calling me lord voldemort. ¬†

So in a moment of silly humor I made myself a tee with a print of he who shall not be named cackling in a pair of pixelated sunnies, underneath saying chillin like a villain. ¬†

Here's where I may be leaning into a slippery slope. But I think its cheeky and quiet enough that noone else would get it other than her and I. ¬†

¬†¬†

But would I be an asshole if I decided to show up at our work do in the tshirt of the nickname shes given me. ¬†

¬†¬†

Sorry mcmassive story just so I can get to the part where I justify wearing a snide top. ¬†

¬†¬†

But here's the thing. I dont hate sarah. She is who she is. And she simply responded to circumstances based off the capacity she has. I dont like the way things played out. But I dont wish her Ill. I just realised I have forgiven her for the ways she bullied me cos if I'm honest if she hadn't of always been making me feel so bad about myself I don't think I would have gotten a little fire in my butt to prove people wrong and that I wasnt a mess and that I could be a functional adult. So I am greatful for the lessons learned. But did I definitely know now to be more mindful, to trust my instincts, and that sometimes I need to listen to the red flags a little sooner. Haha YUP!¬†

¬†¬†

Thanks for the Ted talk, sorry it's so long. I am physically incapable of being more concise and to the point so thanks for humoring my inability to turn a novel into a short story. Hope this killed some time for whoever finds themselves reading it.¬†",1,1734136730.0,okstorytime,0,0.99,False
1hdqsrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1hdqsrv/scared_of_food_being_tainted/,Scared of food being tainted,"This has been a pretty bad issue the past few weeks and I've tried to manage it but its not going well. 

I'm terrified of drugs being put in my food. I know it is the stupidest thing and I know it's wildly irrational. But I'm scared of the what if.

I had a really bad weed trip (not even edibles, smoking) and have had constant anxiety and derealization. 

I've had it for almost a year and have managed it ok but about two weeks ago I had this thought that what if someone put shrooms or weed in my food. 

I eat, then I start to panic, then my derealization gets worse, then I question if I ate drugs or its just derealization (it's always just derealization, in my 21 years of life nobody has accidentally fed me drugs) 

But it still really freaks me out. I've lost weight because I'm scared to eat. Doesn't matter what.
Right now I'm trying to peck away at a BLT I personally made from taco leftovers my parents prepared for a party, and I'm still scared what if theres like weed oil or something in the vegetables my parents prepared. 

Then the other day I ordered hot chocolate with whipped cream and was scared whipped cream was code for them to put drugs in my hot chocolate like the busy ass coffee shop run by teenage girls has the time and money to be putting stuff in my $3 hot chocolate. 

Like I 100% know this is a stupid way of thinking. I don't eat food convinced believing there are drugs in. Like I rationally I know theres not drugs in my food or I would rather just starve myself. Its always that what if. The what if I pissed someone off or someone is pulling a prank or mixed up the food. Then I have existential panic after eating, waiting if I start tripping out. And I obviously never do. It's just hard to talk about and explain because it's sounds bat shit insane, like I sound schizophrenic but I know I'm not. 

I'm just so scared because my head is so fragile as it is that I know if I had weed or shrooms or something, I couldn't handle it. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I've don't eat out a lot anymore, I try to eat communal food (like my family eating dinner together), I make my own food, I use like raw foods. But I'm still scared and its just getting worse. 

TLDR; I'm scared theres drugs in my food but I know theres not drugs in my food, but I'm still scared to eat and feel bat shit insane. ",1,1734136709.0,Anxietyhelp,2,0.67,False

1hdqqgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1hdqqgd/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I woke up at 4 AM, I still haven‚Äôt fixed my sleeping schedule. Smoking does help it somewhat, makes me sleep sooner though. Also get me high faster these days ever since I‚Äôve gotten healthier, also hits me harder. Well, smoking isn‚Äôt really healthy? I honestly could cut back on it if there was more shit going on in my life. Smoking just lessens the boredom, especially in the morning. I‚Äôm sure my lungs would be happy the sooner I reach that point. 

I had work at 2 PM. As usual, I was running late. Barely made it in time. My uncle wasn‚Äôt working with us today since he was working at his other jobs. Wasn‚Äôt like we were going to need him since today was going to be the easiest money I‚Äôve made in months. Scratch that, I did make $200 a couple days ago from a class action lawsuit that I had completely forgot about until that $200 hit my PayPal.

Now, some would argue that the work we do is just catering. Today, we were just going to be doing that shit. Like all we have to do is just drop off food at the corporate offices and get out. It was for a Christmas party, shit, I bet that‚Äôs gonna be a way of rewarding their employees Christmas bonus this year.

Our last general manager did throw a Christmas party (we‚Äôve been through four of them since I started working). Yet my brother, uncle, and I still had to work that party as in the other events we usually do lmfao. I only got a Starbucks gift card of $5 out of it. I can barely even buy a decent drink at Starbucks with that money. I don‚Äôt even drink coffee that much either. But god damn, those mocha frappucinnos though. Oh, we boycotting Starbucks? Ignore what I wrote. 

Anyways, I knew we were going to be burning the clock the whole shift. The fucking event didn‚Äôt even began until 4. We were just sitting on our phones, not doing shit. The event for the next day was mostly set up, so we really had nothing to do. We‚Äôd have to wait until a small group was done using the room to finish up for tomorrow. Even mopped the floor because I was getting tired of not having shit to do.

My brother and I dropped the food off, took us less than five minutes. I was just happy that they didn‚Äôt want us to stick around to clean their shit up. Although, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll be happening soon once they have their yearly premium liquor night. The Mayor personally showed up last year, I still find it both hilarious and ridiculous that he apparently called off the cops from shutting it all down after people began making noise complaints‚Ä¶

We didn‚Äôt have to do anything at all until 8 PM, well, that‚Äôs what we had thought. We just fucked around the whole time. I even ordered a burger since I hadn‚Äôt ate all day, hey, I‚Äôve got to make use of that 50% discount whenever I can. I couldn‚Äôt even finish that shit. Not because I didn‚Äôt like it, but because my stomach couldn‚Äôt get anymore. 

My brother and I were talking about our Christmas plans. We were thinking of getting my dad and his partner a new TV. We aren‚Äôt really sure what to get my mom. I‚Äôll probably give her cash. Last time I gave her a pretty big gift was that YSL tote bag I bought her from Japan, I asked her about it on Thanksgiving, she tells me that she‚Äôs lost it or it was stolen‚Ä¶

Her and my dad would always just tell us the same two answers but with different words whenever we ask them what they would like for any special occasion:

‚ÄúOh, I just want some peace and quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing, you don‚Äôt have to give me a gift, save your money.‚Äù

As someone who likes to receive gifts, I like to gift them as well. That‚Äôs just apart of my love language. 

Im not even sure what to get my sister either, She‚Äôs been gifted so many toys now, she doesn‚Äôt even touch half of them. I might get her Lego but she doesn‚Äôt even clean up after herself. I‚Äôll probably just her some hello kitty, Barbie, or Pok√©mon shit. I want her to have the kind of Christmases that we weren‚Äôt able to have. 

I‚Äôll probably get my brother some goofy shit I‚Äôd find online that he‚Äôd like or some cash. Playboi Carti actually dropping his album would probably the best gift my brother could get. 

Once 5 PM rolled around, we were able to get the finishing touches done. Then we didn‚Äôt do shit until 6 PM. I just wanted to get home as soon as possible, get all the free time left in the day that I can. Our boss told us that we can go home early since corporate was gonna clean it themselves. Whenever I hear those magic words, ‚ÄúYou can clock out,‚Äù I know I have to get the fuck out fast before they change their minds. So that‚Äôs exactly what my brother and I did.

Back story: So I started a new job like 6 months ago and I go to this local coffee shop regularly on my lunch break and its like 1 min away. I kinda barley talk to the workers cause I just wanna relax/ don't wanna bother them and introverted as well but they say hi/know I take my coffee to-go. 

Recently I've notice this one girl who would give me my order sometimes( they don't ask for names (foreshadow) they just find you and give you your coffee), there would be heart(s) on the cup like a heart where the ""o/a"" goes or in replace for the dot of the ""i"". So one day when I go, we happen to look at each other I shot a smile at her and that was it. Now a weekish ago she was working the register (they rotate what they do during the day like ""running"" the coffee to people, making the coffee, etc.) and randomly she ask for my name, me being shy af, kinda froze, gave my name, nervous laugh. She gave me hers, kinda teased me about how when I told her to-go, she said ""I can't stay cause I told a girl my name."" I said no I just have work in 10ish laugh it off then went outside to contemplate life. They gave me the wrong order (kinda), they gave me my order cold not hot, but left cause I don't really mind/time is almost up. But the next day when I go when same girl brings me my order she ask if we gave you the wrong order yesterday. I nervous laugh again, told her yea but It was no big deal. She said next time just tell us, I said aright, then walked away. I'm in the car on the way back and was thinking to myself ""wtf who remember that sorta thing"". Now the most recent time I went I saw her working but didn't think she noticed me/looked busy doing other work stuff you do at coffee shops, but guess who brings out my order, she ask me about do you have to go to work, said yea, some other small talk I don't remember then went to work. 

So now I have a crush on her, I don't wear my glasses when I go out for lunch, but when I talked to her face to face I noticed she was really cute and is totally my type, extroverted but I like that. I don't know anything about her except a name and where she works. I'm guessing she is around my age (22), I know its kinda taboo to ask a barista out and/or personal information cause I agree no one wants to be hit on at work.

So idk, I just needed to vent cause why is a cute girl talking to me? Is she just being nice? but also want advice cause I never really had a crush/dated anyone cause I just trying to work on myself. So if something is there I would like to try it out.

If you are still here thanks for reading and any advice would be helpful. ",1,1734135999.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1hdqjgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1hdqjgz/turns_out_getting_tortured_daily_instead_of_being/,Turns out getting tortured daily instead of being cared for as a child can screw over one‚Äôs perception of love. Who would‚Äôve thought?,"Eri loves Kai (or Overhaul, as the men whose names she never bothered to learn call him). He cleans everything up and won‚Äôt let any of the nasty germs get to her. He‚Äôs even nice sometimes! Sure, he hurts her but she‚Äôs already used to it and it helps clean the world. Kai only wants to clean the world, he doesn‚Äôt actually want to hurt her. She‚Äôs happy to help Kai clean the world! Eri loves him very much. 

So when a green haired boy with sweaty hands tries to get her away from Kai she is less than amused. She bites him (and nearly gags). He doesn‚Äôt seem to get the hint. These disgusting and dirty heroes are, very rudely might she add, snatching her from her home and away from the closest thing she has to a father. But she‚Äôs a smart girl! Kai taught her (indirectly) to always grab an opportunity when one presents itself. So, tho it pains her to be away from Kai, she‚Äôll play along with the heroes for now so she can gather up intel and help Kai later when he comes to save her from this dirty disgusting place. Like a ninja! Or a spy! Kai will be so proud! 

Her excitement dies immediately and she nearly breaks character when they place her in the care of some greasy homeless-looking guy that smells like expired coffee and whose cat (or dog? She doesn‚Äôt know the difference and doesn‚Äôt care enough to ask) is allowed to get up on the table. 

Kai better come pick her up soon. ",1,1734135913.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,0.67,False

Alcoholic 2L of wine per day every day, withdrawal seizures without consumption. Caffeine use, 2 espresso shots per day, 1 large coffee, and 3-4 mochas. Drink around 1L of water a day. Non-smoker. Social ketamine and cocaine use, haven't used either in 2 weeks. No menstrual cycle in 13 months, lactating from high prolactin levels attributed to risperidone, but no sexual activity in that time frame. Did an std panel in case of a delayed or latent std, but clean. 

I haven't peed in over 72 hours. Not even a drop. I feel like I have to pee constantly and I'll sit on the toilet for 1-2 hours at a time but nothing comes out. Saw my pcp yesterday and he said it could be because of the start of a UTI and told me not to worry and I'll pee when my bladder is full. But I consume A LOT of liquids and feel like I'm going to burst, but I literally can't pee. 
Or sleep for that matter now. Should also mention I'm vomiting every few hours in the last 48 hours, took gravol which solved that. Should I go to the ER? My pcp is closed on the weekend and also gone until the new year for the holidays. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

I messaged a girl, she replied back TWICE before I even had time to respond, and then we chatted regularly for several days on the app. We really hit it off and had loads in common. I was starting to really fall for her. Finally I mentioned that we should maybe meet up sometime for coffee or something, making sure to stress that there was no rush. She promptly replied back and suggested talking on the phone first instead. I thought this was a great idea so I sent her my number and told her to call anytime she wanted. I figured she might want to wait a few days, but she immediately asked if she could call me later that night at a certain time. I agreed and she said she would call me later. She did not call and she has not sent any messages since this. I even sent her another message the next day reassuring her that we didn't have to rush into a phone call either, and that we could continue to just chat on the app for now if she preferred. Nothing. It has been a week.

Now I understand that if a girl isn't really interested, she will often suddenly stop replying (ghost). But what I don't understand in this case: SHE suggested the phone call, SHE suggested doing it that same day, and SHE suggested the time for it. Why set up all this if she had no intention of making the call? Another thing to consider, since she stopped responding, she rarely logs on at all (maybe once every 2 days).

1hdqcsu,https://i.redd.it/i7p9v6aqip6e1.jpeg,"Apartment floor plan, ideas for furniture placement? ","I'm looking at buying a high rise apartment in Melbourne and the building I want has multiple apartments with this floorplan that are going quite cheap but I'm struggling a bit on how to use the living/dining room. Any thought on furniture placement?

A main drawcard of the apartment would be all the windows and the gorgeous views. The plug for the tv is set in the tip of the living room so the idea is to place the tv front of the windows which I'm not keen on. 

My thoughts are to have a tv on the wall underneath the air con on a swivel/tilt mount and then have two chairs like this up against the windows with a coffee table ( I only need one chair but i think that would look odd and very uni student like?). So I can swivel to watch the tv, and then swivel back to the view

Capable of reaching pretty much anything left on the couch or recliner main seat, and half way up the coffee table. I am a SAHM and have adjusted to scanning the room pretty much any time I walk away for things in her reach that I don‚Äôt want in her reach, namely the aforementioned items. Phone, Roku remote, and my book are her big three go-to grabs. My husband works long shifts, 12+ hours 3-4 days a week, as a nurse, and he cooks dinner when he gets home by mutual agreement. I also usually let him have the remote in the evening, even if we do watch stuff together. 

This is a combination issue - he‚Äôs out of the living room to check on dinner, intermittently leaving his phone and the remote where she can reach them. 

For the most part, I just watch her play with them. She isn‚Äôt so coordinated that she can really do anything super harmful, the worst she‚Äôs done that I‚Äôve seen is stick them in her mouth or maybe lock me out of my phone for 5 minutes tapping the passcode aimlessly, maybe takes us to hbo max instead of Netflix where we were watching our show,  so like she‚Äôs not doing any harm. I make sure she doesn‚Äôt accidentally subscribe us to something we don‚Äôt use, and neither phone is unlocked when she grabs them, but sometimes he comes back out and gets a little frustrated that I‚Äôm not stopping her from having either thing. I don‚Äôt see the big deal, she‚Äôs not doing any harm, but I don‚Äôt always get to stopping her from nibbling on either remote or phone, so sometimes they have a little drool on them (I do catch her from soaking them, damage done from water in electronics is on my mind, but she rarely gets to eating them that long before I stop her). 

It‚Äôs starting to bother him more and more lately, and I really don‚Äôt see the big deal. He can just, yknkw, move the stuff before he leaves the room to be out of her reach, and when I tell him that, he gets more frustrated. He does have ADHD if that makes a difference.

1hdqbzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/situationshipsadvice/comments/1hdqbzt/what_should_i_do_here/,What should I do here ?,"So I (35m) and this broad I‚Äôve known since I was a kid (34f) have been in a situationship for the past  18 months. Previously I was in a 13 year relationship that ended in february 2022 and she was in a 9 year relationship that ended in June 2023. I would have considered her a friend before we began banging each other, because of that I helped her move after her ex cheated on her and made her move. She also has a kid with her ex who I sorta bonded with during this time. Like we‚Äôd play with nerf guns and stuff like that. My previous relationship did not end well and to put it mildly, I took it as bad as I could take it, twice. Because of that I told my friend that I wasn‚Äôt for a relationship but I would essentially be there for her if she needed any help with whatever and of course I‚Äôd bang her whenever she wanted too. She did eventually want an actual relationship with me but I would never guarantee it because in my previous experience, once a woman finds out what it is that you don‚Äôt want them to take away, you‚Äôre basically fucked in any kind of negotiation or power struggle and I was seeking to avoid putting myself back in a undesirable place. I assured her that I wasn‚Äôt banging anyone else and wasn‚Äôt looking to do that because I was happy with our agreement. After all she had the biggest set of natural tits in my graduating class, like some triple D mommy milkers, and she let me go all the way inside as deep as I could, which was a big deal for me because I could never do that with my ex. My ex was a virgin when I met her and I have 8 inches so I never wanted to hurt her and because of that I never really enjoyed what it was like to get to fuck someone like my friend.  Besides all that, I always thought she was hot but I never made a move back in the day because I was in 2 separate relationships and wasn‚Äôt the type of prick to violate a persons trust. I would often make her bleed if I went too far but she was always good natured and fine with it. It‚Äôs not like I was trying to do that though either. I realized she might be falling in love with me when I passed out drinking crown once and I woke up to her orally pleasing me and after I finished she had me steak and mashed potatoes cooked and ready. I still felt that I couldn‚Äôt give her a relationship, even though it was pointed out to me, by my one friend that lives with me (21f), that it‚Äôs not likely that I would get that with anyone else.  I just hadn‚Äôt quite rebuilt my life to be ready for another and wasn‚Äôt prepared for one, I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll ever be truly. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt my friend (34f) and told her that I cared as much as I could but I couldn‚Äôt love her like she wanted. I would stay for days at her apartment to try and make her happy but would always have to go back to my place because I did live there, and had pets and responsibilities. When I would leave she would say ‚ÄúBack to your (21f)s name‚Äù  I‚Äôve never banged my (21f) roommate,  I just let her and her cats stay with me temporarily after she got kicked out by her ex. She still lives with me and is just a friend. She‚Äôs like 5‚Äô and 90 lbs. total opposite of my (34f) friend. I told her that I get why she would think that, because my (21f) roommate is a beautiful young lady but she doesn‚Äôt like older guys and if anything in like a dad or an uncle to her. I even swore on my parents ashes at one point that I wasn‚Äôt and never did do anything sexually with my   (21f) roommate. Every so often I wouldn‚Äôt come over to my friend (34f)s apartment for a month or two to keep her from getting too clingy and trying to force me into a relationship where she would expect me to be there all the time, which I couldn‚Äôt do because I still had a life before her that existed. She didn‚Äôt bang anyone and neither did I during this ghosting phase  and we had an agreement early on that if we  wanted to  fuck other people, that we would let the other person know. I would give back my key to her apartment and get my things and we could end things on good terms. A couple months ago was the last time we talked and I think nothing of it because we had an agreement. A few Sundays ago the night before I start a new job, I get a Facebook message from some (53m) junkie, who I later find out is an rapist from a google search of his name,  telling me to stay away from my (34f) friend. Me being me and coming from a family of amateur boxers, I will fight anyone if they want to fight me, I‚Äôm in athletic shape, don‚Äôt smoke and have great cardio. I tell this guy if he wants to fight me and felt the need to call me out at 1 am from a local bar over Facebook messenger that I would fight him the next day after my workday if he had the same energy because I wasn‚Äôt getting arrested for assault 7 hours before starting a new job. Naturally the guy doesn‚Äôt have the same energy the next day and I go to confront my friend (34f) about what that was about. She says she‚Äôs sorry I was bothered and I tell her it‚Äôs ok and that I love a fight every now and again but we had an agreement and she violated it.  I tell her this though Facebook messenger after I let myself in her apartment with the keep she gave me and got my things. She comes home in the middle of this and finds me getting my stuff, after I tell her I need my clothes and coffee maker, that I just started a new job. After I get my things I just give her a look and hand her back her key and walk out. I then explain myself on messenger so her child doesn‚Äôt have to hear what I would say. I tell her that she fucked a junkie and wasn‚Äôt gonna tell me and never let me give the key back or let me know to get my stuff. I initially tell her to go get an std test if she wants my 8 inches again but then I sit and think about it and realize that if I forgive this, then there is nothing I won‚Äôt forgive out of this woman. I tell her this and she seems to accept it but then tells me that if I continue how I am then I‚Äôll miss out on the happiness of having someone to love me again. She seems to have genuinely loved me and I should forgive her on the grounds that collectively I‚Äôve hurt her more times than she‚Äôs hurt me by her recent actions but if I do then I‚Äôve  forgiven a major violation of trust. She says she‚Äôs not with the man she banged after me, and her and I weren‚Äôt in a relationship because that‚Äôs how I had it, but I don‚Äôt see how I could trust her. I‚Äôve been thinking about this for going on 2 weeks. My main questions are should I forgive her? Did I make a mistake in the first place by having it how I had it? And I also attempted to fuck her best friend with her knowledge  after I found all this out and I sent her a message, she was the girl my friend (34)f was gonna pair me with while she was still with her ex.  This woman is great looking as well but I still care about my (34f) friend and her kid and don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to them as a result of anything I may have caused.

I'm a business owner looking to open a fruit and vegetable market store, similar to Artichokes in Hampstead, London. Our focus will be on offering fresh fruit and veg, with as many organic options as possible. We‚Äôll also have a freshly cold-pressed juice bar, organic coffee, and freshly cut fruit and vegetable salad boxes available for breakfast, lunch, and early dinner options.
We would love to hear your feedback on this idea! The building is a Heritage 2 listed building, so we need to be careful with what we do. It's only around 520 sq feet, which is quite limited, but it will do for the time being. If the demand from our community increases, we‚Äôre open to expanding to a store similar to Whole Foods or Planet Organic, offering a wider range of products.
Please let us know your thoughts and any recommendations you may have.
Thank you!

We used to get regulars who would bring us treats (food, money, redbull, and homemade cookies) and we would be like feral animals over it. 

I‚Äôm a professional pastry chef and baker now, and I‚Äôm doing a massive cookie bake this year to teach my family at home how to make my generational recipes. 

But each batch makes like 3 dozen cookies, so we‚Äôre drowning in them. 

I go to my local spot, a dutch bros spinoff, every two days like clockwork. There‚Äôs only one barista there who knows me, and they‚Äôre super sweet to me always. I started bringing them cookies every other day, because who doesn‚Äôt like cookies? 

Not to be an asshole, but I‚Äôm a pretty decent pastry(it‚Äôs literally my job), they never seem like they like that I‚Äôm giving them the cookies? I don‚Äôt expect them to be falling over themselves in gratitude, because fuck that, but the last time I brought in thumbprints and chocolate chips and the barista literally rolled their eyes when I asked if they‚Äôd like cookies today. 

I felt so awkward sitting there in the window while they held the box and looked at it like it was the most disgusting thing they‚Äôve ever seen. And these look like cookies you‚Äôd buy at a nice place too, my grandmother had a thing about decoration. 

I tip every time I‚Äôm there as well, the cookies I bring are not a tip. 

I ALWAYS ask if they‚Äôd like them, they‚Äôre professionally boxed and labeled with allergens on the lid, and I never show up during peak times. 

The barista who knows me is stoked whenever she sees the white box in my passenger seat, but she‚Äôs not always there and is actually the only barista that‚Äôs shown interest to me outwardly. When I showed up today with no box she was sad and told me she had seen my insta story and was looking forward to today‚Äôs batch (pie cookies). She then asked if she could buy some so I ended up coming back with a box just for her. 

They don‚Äôt sell food minus prepackaged egg bites and these protein bars, I‚Äôm not bringing baked goods to a place that sells baked goods. 

What gives? I have severe anxiety and I‚Äôm autistic, so I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if I can go back to my favorite spot without being the weird creepy customer that gave them food.

### Embracing the Stranger: A Journey of Faith and Hospitality

**Scripture Reading: Hebrews 13:2 (NIV)**

‚ÄúDo not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.‚Äù

- - - - - -

**Devotional Thought:**

In our fast-paced and often fragmented world, the call to embrace the stranger takes on profound significance. Each encounter with another person is an opportunity‚Äînot merely to fulfill a social obligation‚Äîbut to live out our faith through acts of love and hospitality.

### The Heart of Hospitality

Hospitality is much more than offering a meal or a bed; it‚Äôs about creating a welcoming space where individuals feel valued and respected. In ancient times, hospitality was essential, especially for travelers who faced various dangers on the road. Today, it remains a critical aspect of Christian life, encapsulated in the spirit of openness and love.

When we consider the strangers in our lives‚Äîthose different from us in culture, belief, or lifestyle‚Äîwe are reminded of our common humanity. Each person we encounter carries a story and a heart that longs for connection. As followers of Christ, we are called to open our hearts to these stories, recognizing that by welcoming the stranger, we are acknowledging the presence of God among us.

### A Journey Worth Taking

Embracing the stranger is not always easy. It requires vulnerability and the willingness to step beyond our comfort zones. However, this journey is filled with potential for growth and transformation.

**1. Learn to Listen:**  
The first step in embracing the stranger is to listen actively. When we take the time to hear someone‚Äôs story, we cultivate empathy and understanding. Respectful dialogue fosters relationships and builds bridges.

**2. Extend Grace:**  
Remember, we all have differences. Extending grace means accepting one another‚Äôs imperfections and embracing our shared humanity. Christ exemplified this unconditional love during His ministry, frequently engaging with those whom society marginalized.

**3. Share Your Table:**  
Jesus often used meals as a vehicle for connection. Opening your home for a meal or even sharing a cup of coffee can break down barriers. It transforms strangers into friends, fostering communion that reflects the heart of God.

**4. Engage in Community:**  
Look for opportunities in your community to serve and welcome those who may feel out of place. Volunteer at shelters, participate in community events, or simply be present in your neighborhood. Your actions can create a ripple effect of kindness.

### Encouragement for the Journey

As you embark on this journey of faith and hospitality, remember that it is a divine calling. Each act of kindness, however small, can lead to significant change in someone‚Äôs life. You may not always see the fruits of your labor, but trust that God uses our efforts in profound ways.

Reflect on the encounters in your life. Who is the ‚Äústranger‚Äù you can embrace today? A neighbor, a co-worker, or perhaps someone you‚Äôve yet to meet?

### Prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of connection and community. Help me to embrace the strangers in my life with open arms and an open heart. Teach me to listen to their stories, extend grace, and cultivate hospitality in my home and community. May my actions reflect Your love and kindness, drawing others closer to You. Amen.

- - - - - -

As you go through your week, look for intentional ways to embrace those around you. The journey may be challenging, but it is one that reflects the heart of Christ and transforms lives in beautiful ways.

The room buzzed with excitement as the teachers explained. They set out a large mason jar, on top was a handle to churn what was inside. The teacher announced ‚ÄúWe will all get to turn the handle 5 times, and in the end, we will have butter! Then we will have snack time, and eat our butter on crackers!‚Äù¬†

Of course this was a big deal. We all chatted noisily as the line slowly moved. I was toward the end, so I had a long wait ahead. Just as I found myself about halfway to the churner, another teacher stepped into the room. ‚ÄúApril, you need to come with us, you are moving!‚Äù I looked toward her and saw my parents behind her. I obediently moved toward them. They had the packed U-Haul outside, the rest of my siblings were in the station wagon, and with that we were off to move states away.¬†

The scenery flew by as we drove but I was bummed. I didn't get to turn the handle and eat the butter. My thoughts were soon distracted by starting a new school and trying to make new friends, but at the back of my mind not turning the handle still ate at me. My confidence began to falter all because I did not achieve that one simple task.¬†

Time flew by, I graduated high school, went to college and began a new career in Graphic Design. I married at the age of 25 and had two children; they were the loves of my life. One day I went grocery shopping and headed down the milk aisle. I saw the heavy cream, the half and half, full jugs of milk and a massive panic attack began to hit. I instantly realized -this could be made into butter. I hadn't thought of the mason jar in years, and here it was slapping me in the face once more. I had to leave the aisle quickly and tried to collect myself. It was as if I had just walked through the most terrifying haunted house. Tears streamed down my cheeks, my heart was racing and my thoughts spun in circles so fast I had to brace myself on the shopping cart.¬†

I collected what I needed to fulfill my shopping list and exited the store quickly. Once I got in the car, I steadied my breath and moved on with the day. I have to admit, I didn‚Äôt think something so trivial would have such a huge impact. ¬†

As I drove home, I passed a field of cows. Their udders seemed huge, as if milk was about to explode out of them. I tried to look away, and pressed down on the gas to get me past the scene as quickly as possible. My anxiety was back up. This level of distress was all so new to me, I was unsure what to do. ¬†

When my second child was born, I couldn't even breastfeed.¬†I tried, but the moment I would engorge and the milk would leak through my shirt the panic would rear its ugly head once more. This went on for years. I am now 55 years old. My life is still a mess. I can't have creamer in my coffee, cereal is eaten without milk and I made sure to live in a city with no cows nearby. Recently I relocated to Wisconsin, home of cheese. So. Many. Cows. I still have issues with the milk aisle and low self-esteem, but I am working on it hard. All of this because I didn‚Äôt get to churn the cursed handle 5 times. ¬†

¬†

P.S. Cranking the handle is real, the rest might be a tad embellished.¬† lol",2,1734134619.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Never posted here before, excited to hear from a community of enthusiasts.

I love tea, and I've been drinking it since I was very young, despite being raised by coffee drinkers. My wife and I live in the PNW and usually order tea from either Taylors of Harrogate or Harney since we can't always get Taylors.  I also order from Hibiki when I need a sencha fix.  

In the States and in Canada we occasionally will try tea from a local company and I find the outcome consistently bad.  We just tried a new place in our home town that is all about high tea.  I wanted to like it.  But the tea was like water.  Weak, minimum body, flavor or aroma. Pretty sure they didn't put enough leaves in. 

My question is, is it me?  I might just be an elitist that likes overly strong flavors.  Most tea we find local in the States just seems weak.  I think most companies might just get away with it because in this part of the world, people don't know what good tea is and they just purchase novelty.  OR, I'm wrong, my palate is just weird, and I should keep my opinions to myself and brew my own.",0,1734134314.0,tea,18,0.38,False

I‚Äôm 25F and work as a Senior Research Associate in the biotech industry. This trip took place between jobs, where my partner and I took 3 months off to travel and move cross-country (will hopefully write up something for the move as well).

**SECTION 2: ASSETS AND DEBTS**

Felt comfortable enough to take a small break from working due to being ahead in retirement savings. Net worth at the time of the trip was \~$70k (401k $25k, Roth IRA $17k, HSA $2k, company stock $1k, savings $25k). No home equity but also no debt.

I started planning this trip around 8 months in advance, decreasing my retirement contributions to build up a good chunk of savings for travel, moving, and emergency fund. Everything was paid for directly (no payment plans or credit card debt).

**SECTION 3: INCOME**

I was previously making $85k but received a raise to $96k 3 months before the trip. Other sources of income included annual bonus, credit card rewards, gifts, and HYSA interest which total \~$5k. Take home pay after retirement, insurance, and taxes was $4,750/month. Expenses in Boston averaged around $3,100/month excluding travel costs.

**SECTION 4: TRAVEL EXPENSES**

Worth noting, I do not combine finances with my partner but we split costs for this trip. Prices below will be per person but may be slightly cheaper than a solo traveler due to shared rooms, groceries, etc. We were also both younger than 26 which got us student discounts on a lot of entrance tickets (ended up bringing our old college IDs as proof).

Did not have a strict budget for this trip as it‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing and did not want to hold back on the activity costs. Instead, we chose to save by picking cheaper lodging and transportation options along with switching off between cooking and going out for meals. Overall I spent $7,070 which works out to \~$110/day after the flights and train pass. Feels well worth it especially as it‚Äôs comparable to what I spend living in Boston.

*Transportation ($1705)*

* Flights (BOS -> BGO, BER -> BOS): $1165, booked 6 months in advance.
* Eurail pass (15 travel days in 2 months): $315, bought during the annual Black Friday sale. We purchased the cheaper youth pass. Allows for unlimited train travel for 15 calendar days. Some trips require separate seat reservations.
* Seat reservations: $60, for 8 seat reservations. We only booked if required but did end up sitting on the floor on the back of the train / standing in the aisle for a few legs.
* Public transit: $165, for buses, trains, ferries, and funiculars. We didn‚Äôt take a single taxi/Uber the entire trip which I‚Äôm pretty proud of. Lots of walking and figuring out local transport which was a ton more convenient than what we have in the US

*Accomodations ($1995)*

Stayed in a mix of hotels, airbnbs, hostels, and even 2 sleeper cars on trains. We are both young and not too picky so prioritized good locations over nice places to stay. We found that for the most part, a private room with shared bathroom was a better deal than hostels for us. The one exception was in Lauterbrunnen where hotels are insanely expensive so we went with a shared dorm there.

*Pre-vacation spending ($200)*

Bought a new 40L Decathlon Forclaz ($100) for this trip which worked well and held up throughout the whole trip. Also bought travel health insurance ($60) and loaded up on toiletries / first aid supplies ($40).

*Food & Drink ($1880)*

* Restaurants: $1075
* Groceries: $475
* Drinks: $240
* Treats (coffee, bakeries, ice cream): $90

*Entertainment ($895)*

* Activities: $555
* Sightseeing: $340

*Other ($395)*

* Souvenirs (postcard+magnet from each city + extras/gifts): $135
* Cash (not tracked, mostly on souvenirs, treats): $160
* Laundry: $10
* Misc (toiletries, batteries, lockers, fees, and film): $90

**SECTION 5: TRAVEL DIARY**

Going to break up by country to keep it from getting too long. Happy to go into more detail about any of the stops.

*Norway ($652.92 / 7 days = $93.27/day)*

* Accommodations ($250.97): City Hostel Bergen, 4 nights, private room ($173) // Airbnb, 3 nights, private room ($77.97)
* Transportation (23.87): train x2 ($8.38) // Floyen funicular ($9) // seat reservation Bergen ‚Üí Oslo ($6.49)

* Other ($15.98): souvenirs ($9.76) // sunscreen ($6.22)
* Travel notes
   * Managed to sleep for 14 hours the first day after arriving then decided to do a 9-mile hike from Ulriken to Floyen. Great views and contemplated purchasing one of the many lakeside mountain huts (emergency shelters).
   * The train ride between Bergen and Oslo had some seriously stunning views.
   * Determined to stay on budget, we took advantage of our hostel/Airbnb kitchens and cooked most of our meals. Standard grocery haul includes ramen, pasta, spinach, sausage/meatballs, a frozen meal or two, cheese and crackers, bread, eggs, and snacks.
   * The Nordic countries are impressively good about labeling allergens as someone coming from the US, I felt safe enough to try different pastries without fear of anaphylaxis.
   * Pingvinen (traditional Norwegian food) and Trekroneren (sausages) were the best meals here. Surprisingly affordable for how expensive we expected Norway to be.
   * We found Bergen super charming and better to walk around but the activities in Oslo were unique. Took the ferry around to go island hopping and spent time in a floating sauna where you could jump in the fjord.

*Sweden ($510.21 / 4 days = $127.55/day)*

* Accommodations ($246.50): Airbnb, 4 nights, private apartment
* Transportation ($17.77): seat reservation Oslo ‚Üí Stockholm ($5.61) // train x3 ($12.16)

* Other($16.52): souvenirs ($4.54), earrings ($11.98)
* Travel Notes
   * Found my second favorite drink of the trip in the form of Pistonhead Black Currant & Raspberry hard cider
   * Bunch of cool museums over here, Vasa has an old, salvaged warship with a bunch of information on how they did the recover and restoration. Skansen had a bunch of Nordic animals and old buildings but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend unless you have children.
   * We were randomly in Gamla Stan during the National Day of Sweden and encountered a surprise marching band with flags.
   * When we got tired of walking, rode the subway around to different cool subway stations. My favorites were Kungstradgarden and Radhuset
   * Checked out a Swedish Ikea just for fun but it was pretty similar to the ones at home
   * Also indulged in some activities that we would‚Äôve done at home: saw the Haikyuu movie and Troye Sivan in concert

*Denmark ($471.51 / 4 days = $117.88/day)*

* Accommodations ($158.46): City Hotel Nebo, 3 nights, private room
* Transportation ($21.76): seat reservation Stockholm ‚Üí Copenhagen, Copenhagen ‚Üí Hamburg ($9.21) // train x3 ($12.55)
* Food & Drink ($221.41): SSAM Korean Food Bar ($18.49) // Cafe Apropos ($26.15) // Pho Hanoi ($22.65) // Restaurant Under Uret ($15.78) // Maple Casual Dining ($44.57) // Espresso House ($13.23) // Cafe Oscar ($34.45) // hotel breakfast ($13.01) // liquor store ($5) // groceries ($20.74) // treats ($7.34)
* Entertainment ($66.38): Cisternerne ($13.16) // Round tower ($5.84) // Rosenborg Castle ($13.15) // Ruins under Christianborg ($10.23) // Canal tour ($24)
* Other ($3.50): souvenirs ($3.50)
* Travel notes
   * Didn‚Äôt have a kitchen here which led to killing our food budget but the restaurants we tried were so good. Favorites included SSAM (Korean fried chicken), Maple Casual Dining (despite the name, a pretty nice restaurant), Pho Hanoi (was desperately craving Asian food by this point), and Restaurant under Uret (traditional Danish food)
   * Copenhagen is probably the city I could most see myself living in, it was really nice to walk around and the summer vibes were great.
   * If we had more time/energy, could have checked out Tivoli Gardens but passed this time around.
   * Grundtvig‚Äôs Church is out of the way but I highly recommend for architecture fans/photographers (and free!). Rosenborg Castle was also really impressive but not free.

*Netherlands ($476.02 / 4 days = $119.00/day)*

* Accommodations ($236.67): Sleeper train Berlin Hbf ‚Üí Amsterdam, shared room ($42.15) // This Ho(s)tel, 3 nights, private ‚Äúcube‚Äù ($194.52)
* Transportation ($21.50): train Amsterdam ‚Üí Utrecht RT ($20.12) // train ($1.38)
* Food & Drink ($154.02): Pasta Pizza ($18.24) // Fiona ($17.24) // Foodhallen ($14.49) // Wau Malaysian Restaurant ($27.83) // Bar Jones ($16.33) // breakfast ($10.51) // liquor store ($6.57) // groceries ($36.98) // treats ($5.83)
* Entertainment ($38.91): Eye Film Museum ($10.77) // Van Gogh Museum ($11.86) // Bike rentals ($16.28)
* Other ($24.92): souvenirs ($6.05) // gifts ($10.29) // flip book ($4.28) // batteries ($4.30)
* Travel notes
   * Sleeper train surprisingly comfortable and a much better deal than our overpriced hostel.
   * Did not have the best impression of Amsterdam but probably would like it better if we stayed in a different area. We were in the very center of the city (with all the other tourists) and got harassed a few times outside our lodging. Utrecht and some of the outer neighborhoods were more my speed.
   * Like Copenhagen, also didn‚Äôt have a hotel here. However the restaurants we tried were pretty mediocre (EXCEPT Wau Malaysian Restaurant which was delicious).
   * Favorite drink of the summer: Radlers. Like a shandy (beer + lemonade) except with citrus soda, super light and refreshing, only 2% so perfect for a hot summer day. Found them throughout the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany.
   * Rented bikes to get around which was fun but stressful, you need to be alert and watch out for the other bikers on the road.
   * The Eye Film Museum has a booth for a DIY flipbook which makes a good souvenir.

*Belgium ($211.32 / 2 days = $105.66/day)*

* Accommodation ($76.49): Adonis B&B, 2 nights, private room
* Transportation ($26.01): seat reservation Amsterdam ‚Üí Bruges
* Food & Drink ($92.24): Mas Brugge ($14.51) // That‚Äôs Toast ($13.00) // La Cantina ($23.11) // fries ($9.02) // Le Trappiste ($10.48) // groceries ($5.86) // treats ($16.26)
* Entertainment ($8.60): Gravensteen Castle
* Other ($7.98): locker ($5.91) // laundry ($1.07)
* Travel notes
   * Had a ton of chocolate & liege waffles here.
   * Ghent was super charming and didn‚Äôt spend too much time on activities here because it was so nice to just walk around.
   * Le Trappiste is a cool bar where you can get flights of different local beers.
   * Bruges was great as a day trip, the castle tour is definitely worth it.

*Luxembourg ($171.14 / 2 days = $85.57/day)*

* Accommodation ($87): Auberge de la Petrusse, 2 nights, hotel room
* Transportation ($11): seat reservation Luxembourg ‚Üí Zurich
* Food & Drink ($64.03): Five Guys ($12.63) // groceries ($45.40) // liquor store ($2.50) // treats ($3.50)
* Entertainment ($6.98): Casemates du Bock
* Other ($2.13): souvenirs
* Travel notes
   * 1 full day here is really enough, it‚Äôs also expensive (even at Five Guys)
   * Casemates du Bock is the main attraction and has some nice views from the tunnels. We walked from all the way up here down to the Old Quarter.

*Switzerland ($990.29 / 8 days = $123.79/day)*

* Travel notes
   * We did a ton of cooking here because of how expensive everything was. There are also farm stands with cheese and bread which made for some really good picnic hiking lunches. We did try fondue (when in Switzerland) which was perfect for a rainy day.
   * Lodging is also really expensive here so we decided to stay in a shared dorm at Valley Hostel. It worked out well and we could see the waterfalls right from our room. It was nice to have a home base in Lauterbrunnen for 4 days, took the train to check out other nearby mountain towns like Grindelwald, Interlaken, Murren, etc.
   * Our main activity cost was the Jungfrau pass which gave us unlimited travel on the trains and most of the cable cars in the region. The sticker shock was pretty rough but ultimately worth it because it allowed us to do a ton of hiking.
   * Considered paragliding here but only ended up getting \~2 days with nice weather. We wanted to spend these hiking and take advantage of the cable car pass. Also helped with the budget, but may come back for it in the future.
   * It was 85-90F on our day trip to Zurich so we decided to swim in the river by Flussbad Oberer Letten with a lot of locals. The current is super strong so you can jump in and float along until you reach one of the ladders to get out, walk back, and repeat. Perfect way to spend a summer day here.
   * The trains were always perfectly on time here which we appreaciated (looking at you Germany).

*Austria ($541.42 / 8 days = $67.67/day)*

* Accommodation ($187.96): Holiday Inn Salzburg, 4 nights, hotel room ($32.50 + 30,000 points) // Airbnb, 3 nights, private room ($155.46)

* Other ($59.25): laundry ($6.43) // cash ($32.50) // hotel fees ($7.45) // souvenirs ($2.68) // shirt ($10.19)
* Travel notes
   * Beer hall is a must. I was struggling to carry the 1L mug with one hand but it was a fun experience.
   * Dining out was pretty affordable. My favorites were Yuen China (first Chinese restaurant in Salzburg), Hanoi Food, and Gasthaus Reinthaler
   * The Euro Cup was in full swing during our trip so spent a lot of evenings watching games at bars. In Austria, we found a couple outdoor beer gardens/outdoor bars that had the games which made for a nice night.
   * The Badeschiff pool was a great way to spend a day especially because it was in the 90s by this point. $5 for a wristband and access to a pool on a boat and the outdoor lounge areas.
   * Chose a more casual one-hour concert in an old church instead one of the more fancy shows. This was a good level of commitment for people who don‚Äôt know too much about classical music.
   * Took a day trip to Werfen to see the largest discovered ice caves (!!!) One of the coolest things we did during the entire trip and had great views of the mountains. You have a guide walk you through a bunch of stairs in the ice cave and see different formations.
   * Salzburg was more charming and interesting than Vienna in my opinion.

*Slovenia ($391 / 4 days = $97.75/day)*

* Accommodations ($115.99): Airbnb, 1 night, private room ($78.00) // Apartments Maria, 2 nights, hotel room ($76.99)

* Entertainment ($39.82): Velika Planina cable car and chair lift ($22.63) // Ljubljana Castle escape room ($17.24)
* Other ($102.70): cash ($96) // souvenirs ($6.70)
* Travel Notes
   * Bled was very pretty but don‚Äôt need more than a day or two here. We swam in the lake, took a pletna to Bled Island, and walked around the town. There‚Äôs also a summer toboggan ride that looks funa and a hike up to Bled Castle.
   * It was surprisingly hard to find a free place to swim here but we ended up at a public swimming area near Carman restaurant. As a bonus, Carman had good food and a great view of the sunset over the lake from the upstairs patio.
   * Got caught in the worst storm of the trip here, while we were on a pletna back from the island. The roads started flooding and none of the hotels would let us wait it out in their lobby.
   * We had an extra day in Ljubljana and decided to go to Velika Planina to see the old herdsman settlement. Very unique buildings, great mountain views, and tons of cows. Would highly recommend for a day trip that‚Äôs off the beaten path.
   * Dragon fire bread (chimney cakes coated in sugar and filled with sweet toppings) are tasty but ridiculously filling.

*Hungary ($222.65 / 3 days = $74.21/day)*

* Accommodations ($73.99): sleeper train ($15.99) // Airbnb, 2 nights, private room ($58.00)

* Entertainment ($47.75): Hospital in the Rock ($18.44) // Church of Saint Mary Magdalene Tower ($2.48) // Unlimited Prosecco Cruise ($26.83)
* Travel Notes:
   * Airbnb host accidentally double booked our stay so instead switched us to a bigger apartment in a better location at no additional cost (score!)
   * Really cool bar scene, really enjoyed 360 Bar (rooftop bar, especially nice at sunset) and Szimpla Kert (popular ruin bar). Passed a ton of other ones that we wanted to check out but needed to pace ourselves.
   * The unlimited prosecco cruise on the Danube was a great way to see the city at night, with all the buildings and bridges lit up. The waiters were aggressive too, making sure you didn‚Äôt have an empty cup for even a second.
   * Architecture was unique here, definitely felt the difference between Hungary and the rest of the European countries we had been to before (mainly Western/Central)
   * Spent one day in Buda and the other in Pest, lots to do here. Didn‚Äôt end up getting to the thermal baths.

*Slovakia ($10.72 / a few hours)*

* Transportation ($2.38): bus tickets
* Food & Drink ($8.34): groceries
* Travel Notes:
   * Okay this one doesn‚Äôt really count as we only spent a few hours here but it was cool as a stopover.
   * Did an expedited walking tour of the main downtown area and a few churches in the area.

*Czechia ($318.93/3 days = $106.31/day)*

* Accommodations ($101.14): Airbnb, 3 nights, private room
* Transportation ($1.72): tram ride
* Food & Drink ($152.66): Mlynec ($48.66) // Pork‚Äôs ($20) // Krcma ($14.05) // pub dinner ($15) // chimney cake ($6.03) // groceries ($27.65) // drinks ($21.27)
* Entertainment ($35.05): pedal boat rentals ($8.53) // ghost tour ($19.50) // photo booth ($2.71) // Vrtba Garden ($4.31)
* Other ($28.36): toiletries ($4.07) // cash ($8.74) // souvenirs ($3.75) // gifts ($7.54) // sunglasses ($4.26)
* Travel Notes
   * Love it here, one of my favorite city stops (as opposed to nature stops). It has a really beautiful downtown with cool architecture. Favorite views of the city were from Charles Bridge (most popular) and Vrtba gardens (less popular).
   * We celebrated our anniversary during this stop at Mlynec restaurant which was very classy and had great food. We also enjoyed Pork‚Äôs which was more casual but also delicious.
   * Recommend renting pedal boats, we circled Park Legii and saw a ton of nutria (beaver-like animals)
   * Had some good spooky activities: a ghost tour and Speculum Alchemiae, an old underground alchemist‚Äôs lab.

*Germany ($411.94 / 4 days = $102.98)*

* Entertainment ($22.92): Berlin Underworld ($14.19) // Teufelsberg ($8.73)
* Other ($15.23): cash ($10.92) // souvenirs ($4.31)
* Travel Notes:
   * Had a kitchen but ended up dining out a ton because 1. we wanted to treat ourselves for our last stop and 2. our Airbnb host spent hours at a time in the kitchen
   * Berlin was a lot bigger than most of the cities on our trip, ended up taking the train a bunch between different activities we wanted to do.
   * We are not really clubbers but Soda Club was fun with multiple rooms playing different kinds of music + cheap drinks.
   * We were pretty burnt out on museums/churches by this point so we opted for the more unique activities. Berlin Underworld took us on a tour of a partially demolished anti-aircraft flak tower from WWII. Teufelsberg is an abandoned US listening station from the Cold War on top of a mountain. Tons of cool grafitti and abandoned rooms to explore.
   * Tickets to the Euro Final were not in our budget so settled for watching the game in a beer garden nearby

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1734133835.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1hdptku,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hdptku/27_f_30_m_my_husband_is_turning_grumpier_as_he/,(27 F) (30 M) My husband is turning grumpier as he ages and it‚Äôs driving me insane. How can I get through to him?,"We‚Äôve been together for 10 years, but married for about 3.5. 

I‚Äôm naturally a really happy person. I just am. 

He used to be, too.

When we got together, it was so much fun. But now it‚Äôs just like I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it. Example from this evening:

During our coffees this morning we talked about him going out tonight and coming back around 8 PM and he mentioned he could get food on the way home. I said sure. I came home from work and before he left, he told me he was going to come back around 10 PM and *why didn‚Äôt I bring any food home?* I told him the 8 PM thing from this morning. He said he changed plans and we talked about it. And maybe we did and I forgot, and I told him that and said sorry. I‚Äôm a Chef, by profession. We don‚Äôt have a lot of groceries, but my job is to make stuff from nothing, so I told him not to worry about me, I‚Äôll whip something up and he can eat out since he‚Äôd be coming home after 10 PM. He just kept laying into me about *I told you I was going out until 10* and I don‚Äôt know how many times I can say *okay sorry I didnt remember* because I‚Äôm so serious when I say I don‚Äôt give a F when he comes home, as long as he eats dinner and gets home okay.

*I know what he‚Äôs doing, he‚Äôs not cheating on me, it‚Äôs just not relevant to the conversation I‚Äôm having with y‚Äôall so I‚Äôm not going to dive into it. I promise it‚Äôs boring.*

So, like, he‚Äôs fighting with himself in a way. 

And it‚Äôs like this at least once a day. 

During these bouts I keep my normal voice. I tell him I agree with him (when I do, I‚Äôm not a pushover), though I always tell him I‚Äôm not trying to fight. Lately, I‚Äôve been literally asking him why he‚Äôs turning stupid s*i* into something it doesn‚Äôt need to be. Like, we could just have a nice evening if he stopped freaking out over the most random of things.

I don‚Äôt know. I love him to pieces. He‚Äôs driving me crazy. Especially because I‚Äôm still a happy person and I feel like he‚Äôs smothering me.

Another example from this evening:

He‚Äôs currently out (until 10 PM). I‚Äôm having a fine time painting by myself at home. I saw a missed call from him 20 minutes ago. I called him back, voicemail. He called me back and I missed it by 2 minutes. I called him and he answered and I was like *‚ÄùHey, phone tag, I finally got you! How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù* and he was like *‚ÄôI called you because I was at Walmart and wanted the list but I‚Äôm not there anymore.‚Äô* I was like *‚ÄùOh.‚Äù* and he was just like *I have to go bye* and hung up.

I don‚Äôt know I guess I can‚Äôt pinpoint it.

But I do know it‚Äôs driving me *crazy*.

2 eggs 
2 tablespoons plain yogurt (I used cashew dairy free- trying to reduce sweetness of brownie mix) or sparkling water
1 tsp vanilla extract

These help reduce sweetness of Aldi mix - skip if desired - I use all 3:
1 teaspoon used coffee grounds
¬º teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cacao powder

Large bowl: mix  the wet ingredients and taste to make sure ok. Whip very well.  Leave out the extra cup of sparkling water until later if you‚Äôd like. 

Add in dry ingredients about ‚Öì of bag of mix at a time. Don‚Äôt overmix

Slowly Add and stir in the up to 1 cup of sparkling water until pancake batter thickness or so.   I use the full cup.

.
I was the main barista at the hospital coffeeshop throughout the pandemic. 12hr days, 7 days a week, the pandemic officially announced ON my 25th birthday, the whole situation was fucked. My dad had an accident two weeks into quarantine, broke his neck and talked about ‚Äúgoing home‚Äù and obviously didn‚Äôt want to be here. I found him, laying crippled and broken on his bedroom floor (parents sleep separate since they haven‚Äôt loved each other since I was 6) and then spent half the night hauling his ass to the ER and all that, then clocked in at 6am for my shift and heard all about everyone dying. I was 45 minutes north of a top 5 COVID hotspot the whole pandemic and listened to countless families torn apart by someone dying within a couple hundred meters of me. Like dozens, if not hundreds, of people in my little 80 bed hospital. I knew every person in there, I knew all of their coffee orders. I cranked out 400 coffees a day, easily, and when I was finally sick, finally got COVID, they shitcanned me after a couple weeks. ‚ÄúCome back by Friday or you‚Äôre terminated.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt been awake more than 4 hours a day?!? I crashed and still feel I let a lot of people down. I own my own little shop now, but it doesn‚Äôt make enough to cover my rent, shop rent, expenses, and loan value to my mom, who is a greedy..person.. who is divorcing my dad and is doing everything in her power of stripping him of everything he had worked for and built in their life together. I had to listen to her rattle the cell bars for like two hours today and I made her cry twice, cause sorry, you DONT get to keep your entire inheritance because YOU WERE MARRIED. All of those deeds on your properties have both of your names. Like you signed that paper you were in it 50% and like that sucks you don‚Äôt get to keep the entire $1.3MIL that your dad left you but you‚Äôre riding my ass about the $10k you loaned me so like FUCK man. My siblings are struggling too and I‚Äôm the oldest and supposed to shoulder the burden, but I‚Äôm fucking tired man, it‚Äôs been so much. So much. 
.
Thanks for listening. I hate complaining but it was a hell of a day. I hope everything works out in your favor and I love you and I KNOW there is good in this world, because everything I am is fighting tooth and nail to make fucking sure that there is. You are a good person, and you‚Äôre doing good things, and I hope everything works out for you. ",1,1734133555.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I see no point in continuing to get up every morning for myself, so I do for the sake of my responsibilities and commitments - for the people who rely on me. Sometimes I've even made excuses to not see people since I was feeling so insane and mood swing-y. My mood has been so volatile and incomprehensible on my luteal phases. I look at my biogeochemistry textbook on my coffee table in this little sublet apartment that I have to leave soon. The cover is a picture of earth from space. I remember that we're there. All of us. All of humanity on this tiny blue dot, and all of my problems and worries really don't matter in the grand scheme of things. I can miss a day or two of this and that. I can feel what I feel, and remember that we live on a floating rock - it's not so serious, is it? I'm grateful to be alive. And yet, I can't get myself to turn the first page. 

Just know if you're going through luteal at the same time, today on Friday the 13 and soon a full moon, I'm thinking of you. I love you, really. And we're all on this floating rock together. Please, hold on tight. ",3,1734133441.0,PMDD,2,1.0,False

I've been back and forth a lot this year for work and the pace, combined with the weather, is getting harder to resist. 

Work for me is hybrid; I'm either at home or wherever filming is as I work in the film/tv industry, alongside a remote b-job that I do from home a couple of days per week. 

Currently paying $4200 on a Manhattan 2 bed with zero natural light because that's New York for you. My budget is pretty much the same although ideally if I can cover my rent and monthly car payments like lease and insurance for 4200 that would be ideal. 

I live a pretty chill life when I'm not working as I just hang out reading with my cat (although I'd like to adopt a dog someday) so my needs for a neighbourhood are pretty simple; I like a decent coffee shop, a gym nearby, and a solid bar within stumbling distance. I should probably consider dating at some point soon so an area that's bustling with people would be ideal.

Currently I've stayed in Ktown and West Hollywood when visiting for work but I've checked out Venice, Ocean Park, Silver Lake, and DTLA. The European in me craves a walkable area but I'm happy with just a few things in the immediate area. 

Tl;dr: exiled Brit in New York is moving LA next year, but which neighbourhood is best for caffeinatinh, reading, occasional drinking, and infrequently dating?

1hdpjx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/1hdpjx8/annoying_situation_at_work/,Annoying situation at work,"I‚Äôm really frustrated with a situation at work. I work in a LTC facility, with all the normal ghetto LTC problems, but I like the people I work with and I thrive there and am generally well respected as I‚Äôve been there the longest and am a good worker. I have had the same group for 2 years, but if we are short I have a different group but most of the same people, just shifted down a little with a few extra people. 

Well, the other CNA who works on my hall is on the same rotation as me so we have the exact same schedule. She got a new guy in her group a few months ago. He‚Äôs fully cognitive and I have that room when we are short, so I‚Äôm familiar with him. We haven‚Äôt been short lately though except a couple random days. The resident has started to really dislike the other CNA, and had finally demanded that she not be assigned to him anymore. I know her and this resident and the situation well enough that I know for a fact that both of them are telling half truths - she‚Äôs not neglecting him like he says she is, but she is abrasive verbally with him. It‚Äôs just a bad situation from both sides and neither of them are right. 

So last night I go in (I‚Äôm night shift btw), and see they‚Äôve assigned me and the other CNA our usual groups, except they swapped 2 of our rooms - so I had this guy now who has the problem and his roommate, and she was assigned a room with 2 of my usual ladies. 

I don‚Äôt really have a huge problem with this in principle, but the swap they gave was super unfair. Both of the people I have now are very highly dependent and demanding, and the room they took away from me is 2 sweet ladies who don‚Äôt need much help. I am a bit salty about the unfairness of the swap. I feel that if I‚Äôm going to take 2 highly dependent people because of some other CNA‚Äôs conflict that she should take one of my rooms that requires similar amounts of work. I basically feel like I have all this extra work now and she‚Äôs getting an easier load when she is guilty in the whole problem to begin with. 

Am I justified in feeling this way? I don‚Äôt like to complain much since I‚Äôm never given a hard time at work like some others are, and my group is usually pretty chill over all. But I don‚Äôt like being walked over and something about it irks me. One of them on the room has some of the biggest blowouts regularly I‚Äôve ever seen in 7 years as a CNA, and the other one (who has the problem with the CNA) was touching himself when I walked in tonight and immediately wanted to be changed (he wasn‚Äôt wet). The most demanding thing the ladies in the room I lost ask for is a cup of coffee in the morning.

Idk, am I wrong for feeling a little irritated with this situation? Would you speak to the scheduler? ",2,1734133000.0,cna,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been together for 5 years and he's amazing. Like, the kind of guy who makes you coffee in the morning and listens to you vent about work. I‚Äôm so excited to marry him, but of course, my family is making it a whole thing.

For context, me and my dad have always had kind of a rocky relationship. My mom passed when I was 10, and he did his best to raise me and my brother (Sam, 30M), but the thing is, he started dating my mom‚Äôs best friend, ‚ÄúLinda,‚Äù like 6 months after the funeral. I know people grieve in their own way, but it felt so... *gross* to me, like he couldn‚Äôt even wait a year?

Anyway, they got married when I was 12, and Linda made it her mission to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù my mom. She would go through my stuff, tell me how to dress, and once she even threw out my mom‚Äôs old jewelry because she said it was ‚Äútoo sad‚Äù for me to keep around. My dad always took her side, and it really hurt.

Fast forward to when I was 19, I found out from Sam that Linda had cheated on Dad *multiple* times over the years, and he just forgave her every time. It made me lose a lot of respect for him. Like, how can you just let someone walk all over you like that? But whatever, it‚Äôs his life, and I tried to keep some sort of relationship with him.

Now to the wedding drama. A few months ago, Dad was supposed to meet Jake‚Äôs family at a dinner we planned. It was a big deal because they‚Äôve never met before, and I really wanted to make a good impression. But guess what? Dad shows up *with Linda*. I told him beforehand it was just supposed to be immediate family, but he said he didn‚Äôt want her to feel ‚Äúleft out.‚Äù She spent the whole dinner talking over Jake‚Äôs parents and making passive-aggressive comments about how our wedding was ‚Äútoo fancy‚Äù for our family.

After that, I sat him down and told him I didn‚Äôt want Linda at the wedding. He got super defensive and said, ‚ÄúIf Linda‚Äôs not welcome, then maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be there either.‚Äù I told him, ‚ÄúHonestly, that‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù He stormed off, and we didn‚Äôt talk for weeks.

Then last week, I found out from Sam that Dad has been telling people *he* won‚Äôt walk me down the aisle because I‚Äôm ‚Äúdisrespecting‚Äù Linda. I was LIVID. Like, first of all, that was MY decision to make, not his. And second, he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs the victim when he‚Äôs the one who brought all this drama into my life in the first place.

So I called him and said, ‚ÄúYou know what, Dad? Don‚Äôt worry about walking me down the aisle. I‚Äôll handle it myself.‚Äù He tried to guilt-trip me, saying how much it would hurt him, but I just hung up. Now half my family is saying I‚Äôm being heartless and ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù him for his past mistakes. But Jake and Sam are on my side, and honestly, I feel like I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for my mental health.

I come up with ideas for projects, but unless it's a more complex full stack app, where I feel like I can use UI kits to streamline the frontend part, I always get stuck in the design part.

I have been practicing designing websites in Figma recently, but they always look very amateur. I thought I'd post this as an example, as it's one I was fairly proud of, but know there are a lot of issues, especially with the hero section.

Any help and feedback would be greatfully apprectiated please.

**Burrs**: i189d

**Machine**: Oracle Jet

**Beans**: Fresh locally roasted beans - medium roast

**Dose**: 18g

**Basket**: IMS Competition (H24.5)

**Puck Prep**: Manual WDT 0.35mm. Normcore 58.5mm calibrated tamp (25lbs spring)

**Espresso Experience:** Basically none.

I'm seeking advice on dialing in my Mazzer Philos grinder, which I'm using alongside an Oracle Jet espresso machine. I'm experiencing some inconsistent extraction times that I'm hoping the community can help me troubleshoot.

With the Oracle's built-in grinder and auto-tamping, I consistently get 29-31 second shots with perfect double shot yields. However, with the Philos, I'm seeing dramatic variations in extraction. Using the Jet's espresso profile in the double shot setting:

* At grind size 21, I'm getting a 40-second shot
* At grind size 22, the shot drops to just 20 seconds

The difference seems extreme for such a small grind adjustment (approximately 6 microns per stepping). I've been careful with puck preparation, using WDT and ensuring a level bed. My tamping is calibrated, and the dry grinds appear consistent to the naked eye.

Specific observations:

* With the 20-second shot, I'm only getting around 30ml of espresso
* The 40-second shot yields a full 60ml double shot
* Occasionally, the coffee puck has stuck to the shower screen
* Typically, the pucks look wet, unlike the perfect pucks from the Oracle's auto-tamp

I'm hoping someone can provide insights into why I'm experiencing such significant extraction time variations and how I might improve my workflow with the Philos.",1,1734132145.0,espresso,17,1.0,False
1hdp8wa,https://i.redd.it/nvhxmgp29p6e1.jpeg,Issues with sound and signal all the sudden (330i),"So, let me preface that I literally just purchased this car a week ago. It's a 2024. Have had no issues but also haven't driven it much in the last week. 

This morning, it snowed and I ran up to the gas station to get some coffee but it's literally up the street and in a school zone so I was doing 15-20 MPH the entire time. No issues. Radio played, got total sound throughout the trip. I was in the car maybe five minutes from my house, to the store and back. Very mundane.

Well this afternoon, I decide to go to the gym. I noticed when I got in that it was very quiet. Screen boots up. The navigation map boots up but I have nothing showing on the radio screens. They're blank (both Sirius and FM). No music. But I have that no signal and no ability to turn up/ down volume as I get that message there's no sound.

I read it could be an idrive issue, and I did receive a message that said the driver assistance was restricted but it seemed to only be the sensors on the front.

I did a reboot as said (push and hold the volume control button 30+ seconds, though when I did that and then pushed it again to turn it in, I was still logged in so not sure if I'm doing it right)... but nothing. 

After the gym, it's still not loading. No music. I don't even hear the blinker. 

I'm guessing I'm hosed on this and something broke. I'm really sick to my stomach to boot because like I said, I just purchased this car. It was used but doesn't even have 10,000 miles on it yet. 

Could it just be storm related? A wet sensor or something? Anyone ever experience this and had a fix lol

Seeking emotional support, comfort, someone who understands what I'm going through right now ...

So, over the course of tis year, I spent a couple of thousand bucks on OF. Shame and guilt are killing me like big times. 

It started off as a way to explore some kinks anonymously, get into touch with kinky creators for guidance, input and I didn't spend that much. It was more like tipping someone a coffee or a drink from time to time to make it worth their time chatting with me. Then I quit OF because I felt like those kinks might not be for me after all. 

Couple months later, my mental health's not the best, lots of stress and pressure, I give OF another try because I crave attention, adrenaline and human connection and shit goes south. For real. Suddenly, I engage in really extreme kinks (don't try to blame anyone, just trying to describe what I did), I spend hundreds for a couple hours of sexting. And now, I'm lying in bed after reality hit me like a fucking train. I'm like, fuck man, why did you spent THAT much money on sexting and whatnot.

Hello!

I am planning to level up my set up by getting a better espresso machine.

At the moment I have a Breville (Sage) Bambino and a Mignon Manualle. 

I have been learning with them for some years now and I saved some money to level up. I thought to start with the espresso machine by now and later the grinder (seems quite consistent grinder for the price).

I was thinking of sth around 1000-1200‚Ç¨ (EU market); and I really like the Lelit Mara X design. I feel that its fast warm up might be an advantage (I am not sure how I feel about waiting 15 min or more for the boilers to get warm for 1 espresso or 2 in the full day). However I saw some comments no so in favor of it. 

In general I would like to ask:
- any better option at that price range?
- will I feel the difference in light roast coffee compared with my actual bambino, or is only slight (already the espresso I have at home overpasses almost any shop I visit locally or when travelling).
- Is it worth it to wait and invest directly ~2000‚Ç¨ in the future? Or with a machine like this I could sit happy for a long time? (I don‚Äôt need the best of the best, but I would like consisten good coffee)

We toured the neighborhoods of Wicker Park and Lincoln park a bit during a day trip and really enjoyed both of them, the impressions we had was that Wicker Park felt like there was more stuff around at a higher density (restaurants, coffee shops, stores, bars, etc) and Lincoln Park was stunningly beautiful and next to the lake but felt a little less dense.

I'm self employed and work from home, so for me having lots of good options for coffee shops or restaurants to work at in walking distance is pretty big. Ideally I'd love to be able to walk to everything I need like grocery stores and such, being able to ditch my car would be great! From my experience, it seemed like that would be harder to do in Lincoln Park, but maybe we just didn't see enough of the neighborhood to see how convenient it might be. My girlfriend is a waitress and part time wedding photographer, so she'll be looking for a serving job most likely wherever we end up living. She values a lot of the same things as I do! My job is in the creative field so having a good environment to help my inspiration to write is pretty important, and it seems as though all these places are plenty beautiful for that!

I'm looking to see if there are things we might be overlooking or not considering about these neighborhoods, or just looking for general advice as to which ones you all like more and why! I included Lake View as I had heard that recommended as well, but I don't know a whole lot about that one.

Picture this: you‚Äôre walking down a busy city street. Maybe you‚Äôre grabbing a coffee or dodging the occasional pigeon that insists the sidewalk is theirs. Suddenly, you see it ‚Äî a sleek machine glowing with futuristic allure. It‚Äôs not an espresso maker, and no, it‚Äôs not a teleportation device (we‚Äôre not there yet). It‚Äôs a **Bitcoin ATM**! This marvel of modern tech is here to bridge the gap between the crypto world and your pocket. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it wouldn‚Äôt be half as useful without the humble yet powerful QR code. And that‚Äôs where our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app comes into play ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)).

# What is a Bitcoin ATM?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics for anyone who might be new to the crypto world. A Bitcoin ATM, often referred to as a BTM, is a kiosk that allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin and, in some cases, other cryptocurrencies. Think of it as a traditional ATM but for digital cash. Instead of withdrawing a wad of dollar bills to buy snacks, you‚Äôre converting fiat money into digital gold (or vice versa) to buy...well, digital snacks?

These machines are popping up everywhere‚Äîfrom bustling urban hubs to small towns that seem like they‚Äôd sooner have a new cow than a Bitcoin ATM. And they‚Äôre making crypto transactions so much easier for everyday users. But how do these machines communicate with your crypto wallet? You guessed it: **QR codes.**

# QR Codes: The Crypto Whisperers

QR codes are the unsung heroes of the Bitcoin ATM world. They act as the middlemen, translating your digital wallet‚Äôs information into a format that the ATM can understand. You‚Äôre not typing in long, anxiety-inducing wallet addresses (seriously, one typo, and poof‚Äîyour crypto is lost forever). Instead, you just scan your QR code, and voil√†! The ATM knows exactly where to send your Bitcoin or from where to receive it.

This is where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) becomes your best friend. Whether you‚Äôre a Bitcoin newbie or a seasoned hodler, creating accurate, scannable QR codes for your wallet address is essential. Our app ensures that your codes are not just functional but flawless, saving you from the heartache of lost funds or failed transactions.

# How Bitcoin ATMs Work (With a Dash of Fun)

Let‚Äôs break it down into simple steps so you can see how Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes work their magic together:

1. **Locate a Bitcoin ATM**: You spot one of these beauties in your neighborhood. Feeling adventurous, you decide to give it a try.
2. **Choose Your Transaction**: Are you buying or selling Bitcoin? The ATM lets you pick your poison‚Äîer, transaction type.
3. **Scan Your QR Code**: Here‚Äôs where our app steals the spotlight. Open your crypto wallet app, scan the QR code you generated with our Bitcoin QR Code Maker, and let the ATM do its thing.
4. **Insert Cash or Confirm Transfer**: Depending on your choice, you either insert cash to buy Bitcoin or confirm the amount you want to sell.
5. **Transaction Complete**: In a few moments, your wallet gets updated, or the cash drawer pops open. Easy peasy!

Without QR codes, this process would be as clunky as using dial-up internet in 2024. Can you imagine typing your wallet address by hand into an ATM? Yikes. QR codes are the true champions of simplicity and speed.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs are Awesome (and a Little Quirky)

Bitcoin ATMs are like the cool cousins of traditional ATMs. They‚Äôre futuristic, a bit mysterious, and way more versatile. Here‚Äôs why they‚Äôre worth the hype:

* **Accessibility**: Bitcoin ATMs bring crypto to the masses. No need to navigate complicated exchanges or wait days for bank transfers.
* **Instant Transactions**: Many BTMs process transactions faster than you can say ""blockchain.""
* **Anonymity**: Some Bitcoin ATMs allow smaller transactions without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, offering a level of privacy.
* **Cool Factor**: Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîusing a Bitcoin ATM feels like you‚Äôre living in a sci-fi movie. Who doesn‚Äôt want to feel like a crypto rebel?

But they‚Äôre not perfect. Fees can be high, and some machines only support a limited number of cryptocurrencies. That‚Äôs why pairing them with reliable tools like our Bitcoin QR Code Maker is crucial. The fewer headaches in your crypto journey, the better.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Fits In

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the real MVP here: **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**. If Bitcoin ATMs are the rock stars, our app is the stage crew making sure the show goes on without a hitch. Here‚Äôs what it does:

* **Effortless QR Code Generation**: Input your wallet address, and the app spits out a perfect QR code in seconds.
* **Customizable Options**: Need a branded QR code for your business? We‚Äôve got you covered.
* **Accuracy Guaranteed**: Our app ensures there are no typos or formatting errors, keeping your funds safe.
* **Free to Use**: Yup, it‚Äôs free! Because everyone deserves a smooth crypto experience.

Whether you‚Äôre using a Bitcoin ATM, accepting crypto payments, or sharing your wallet address with friends, our app makes the process seamless. And hey, it‚Äôs way more fun than copying and pasting wallet addresses.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

As Bitcoin ATMs continue to spread, QR codes will remain at the heart of their functionality. But the technology is evolving. We‚Äôre seeing machines that support lightning-fast transactions, multi-crypto options, and even direct bank withdrawals. Imagine a future where you can top up your digital wallet in seconds, anywhere in the world, without worrying about fees or accessibility.

And QR codes? They‚Äôre not going anywhere. In fact, they‚Äôre becoming more sophisticated, integrating with NFC (near-field communication) and biometrics to offer even greater security and convenience.

# Wrapping It Up

Bitcoin ATMs are revolutionizing the way we interact with cryptocurrency, making it as easy as grabbing a coffee. But the real magic happens when you pair these machines with the right tools, like our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**. With its user-friendly interface and foolproof accuracy, our app ensures that your crypto transactions are always smooth, secure, and stress-free.

So next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, don‚Äôt just walk by. Give it a try! And before you do, make sure to generate your QR code at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Who knows? You might just become the crypto hero your friends never knew they needed. üöÄ",1,1734131094.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

I‚Äôm a cute, thicck, 33F looking for another romantic partner and connection - not looking for casual/FWBs/ONS etc. Ideally would like a LTR and a primary partner. 

I‚Äôm in grad school, enjoy films, music board games, cooking & baking, exploring new restaurants and coffee shops. 

I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm easy to talk to and a good listener. I love learning about people‚Äôs passions and hobbies, so feel free to share. I myself identify as a yapper, so be prepared! I like frequent communication, but no need for constant. I‚Äôm funny, an extrovert with introvert qualities. I‚Äôm an eclectic mix of nerdy and bookish as well as girly and bubbly. 

I‚Äôm an outsidey person, as in I like sipping tea or cocktails on a patio and going for walks. Not so much a full on outdoorsy person. I love to travel! Not opposed to booking a last minute flight and exploring. 

I‚Äôm a touch person. Cuddles, snuggles, hugs and kisses, hand holding, sitting right on top of each other, always in contact is my thing. I realize it‚Äôs not for everyone, but touch is important to me. 

I currently have one partner right now. We practice parallel poly. 

Ideally would like to meet irl 1-2 times a week. I‚Äôm located between Cleveland and Akron in NE Ohio. If anything here has caught your attention, send me a message and let‚Äôs chat! Will share pics over DMs!",1,1734130732.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Are Not Forceful Enough","I used to have a Normcore V4 tamper for a 54mm basket. I always felt that the tamping wasn't strong enough, even with the heavier spring. I made sure that I filled my basket to the brim, either switching to a smaller basket or adding more coffee beans.

I now have a 58mm portafilter and purchased a Normal Dose tamper, due to it's ergonomics. I want to avoid injuries while providing a reliable, level tamp every single time. I noticed that even after tamping twice (with both fingers on a full bakset), I use a regular mechanical tamper and further push the coffee puck more.

  
At this point I'm confused whether the issue is my technique (although I think I'm filling the basket correctly), or those tampers simply don't have enough force to give. Am I the only one seeing this?",0,1734130626.0,espresso,28,0.4,False

I have been making espresso for about a decade but never really took a deep dive till this year. So sometimes i would pull great shots, other (most) times they'd be okay or terrible, depending on a number of factors ( I was also roasting my own beans for many years). 

Anway, I started trying to find some consistency and starting fucking with my baratza to improve grind quality. So i made it stepless, added some shims under the conical burr and ALMOST purchased a new burr set when I noticed that a Timemore c3 esp was cheaper on aliexpress than the baratza burr set. So decided to buy the Timemore instead. It is fucking incredible. Like, I can't even believe how much of a difference it has made.

So here is my question: will the baratza virtuoso ever compare? in terms of quality, not convenience. I mean, if I buy a new burr set, will I be able to get as fine and even a grind as I am getting with the Timemore?

I am keeping the baratza because I can still get a nice shot if I am using darker roasts (can someone explain this to me?) but it is absolute garbage for light roasts.

for the record I have had techs at my local coffee gear store tell me the burrs appear to be fine and don't need replacing.

I went to the store, walked the dog, made coffee, cleaned the house, took a giant crap, a shower, and a nap...and the the player WAS STILL CHAINING. OK, not really. I did wait 5 minutes tho and decided to surrender. Anyone that uses a deck with nothing but link monsters is an instant surrender. Not even going to entertain them. When I last played the physical tcg, the only way to summon were normal, tribute, fusion, or special summons. XYZ and Synchro summoning is pretty cool, pendulum and linking not so much.

2) The animes made having cards like Exodia or Blue Eyes seem exclusive to anyone that was lucky enough to get a set. Honestly, I don't remember the success rate of getting Exodia in the TCG but I always felt a tad cheated being able to get Blue Eyes so easy, let alone Exodia. The devs missed a HUGE opportunity to copy this exclusivity into this game (where as a bit too late irl). Crafting has made rare cards not rare. Multiple sets of Exodia is easy to do. Is a card really all that rare when every player and their mother has it?

3) Kinda coupled with #1, but turn time is way too  long.

4) Surrending. I know what I said above, but I feel that surrendering should have enough penalties to make a player not surrender just because I manage to summon 3 Blue Eyes on the field.
