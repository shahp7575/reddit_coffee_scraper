So I‚Äôm a former barista and have been trying to upgrade my home espresso station. I‚Äôve been getting away with a cheap coffee grinder from target but I was wanting to upgrade to something more efficient. For context, I usually grind my beans 3 times which gives it the right fineness for my espresso machine, but I want something that will grind it in one go. I‚Äôm currently a college student so I can‚Äôt afford anything too expensive. Are there any grinders you can point me to that are affordable but relatively good quality?",1,1737389384.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Anyways I've been hooked on Feel Frees for about a year and a half give or take. It's draining my finances and I'm worried about my health. I average about 7 a day. But the past few days I've been doing 8-8.5. I have some ideas for how to quit and want to run them by you all and also hear ideas from you guys.

My first idea is to get prescribed vyvanse, which I used to take so could easily get back. They both pump your brain with dopamine and make you feel good so I figured it would help a lot considering it's cheaper and easier to quit than feel free. To any of y'all's knowledge would a feel free or a few interact bad with the Vyvanase? And I'm talking like death or seizure or heart attack kinda consequences. If it causes anxiety or irritability I'm cool with that. Just don't wanna damage myself terribly or lose my life. Both pump you with feel good chemicals right? So maybe that's offset some withdrawals and I could take less FF. 

That is honestly my main go to idea. Obviously I can taper off but it's so unbelievably hard to stop once I get one in my system. Another thought I had was using powder kratom to get off. But it doesn't seem to be working for me. I went to Thailand last year for 10 days, was withdrawaling hard on the way and on the way back considering it's as 24 hour trip. But when I got there and bought kratom, my withdrawals went away completely. Didn't even think about FF the whole time I was there. Not sure if it was because I knew I couldn't get them, or because the kratom there is much higher quality than the powder stuff here. Or a combination of the two.

Also something that helped me get through the withdrawals on the trip to get to Thailand was coffee in case none of y'all have tried that. Idk why but coffee made them more tolerable and honestly I need to start implementing that again to reduce how many I take a day. I really don't want to keep being broke and asking people for money, or even worse do irreversible harm to myself. Please help if you have any other effective methods and have any knowledge on the interaction of vyvanse (ADHD meds) and kratom/kava, specifically feel frees.

1i5tmue,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1i5tmue/pray_for_me_a_tale_of_accidentally_throwing_away/,Pray for me: A tale of accidentally throwing away my Vyvanse,"I get my meds filled somewhere between the 11th-13th, depending on the month. XR Vyvanse and SR Adderall. They got filled a week ago on January 13th. I usually keep my old, empty bottle out as a reminder to call to get it filled and toss it once I pick up the new one, because otherwise that type of thing flees my mind. This is the detail that will lead to my downfall. 

I take other meds, so there‚Äôs a pill organizer I use. Each Sunday night or Monday morning it gets filled for the week. This morning I went to restock my pill organizer, and found that the Vyvanse bottle that is with the other meds is empty. Huh. Figuring it‚Äôs just in some bathroom shelf or drawer, the hunt for the fuller bottle begins. 

I spent a full hour on this search and rescue. I pour out my purse, hunt through my office, kitchen cupboards, drawers. Never mind that it‚Äôs literally been a week since this happened and I would have come across it if I had simply misplaced it, I was sure I couldn‚Äôt have been *that* mindless. 

Eventually, a cold realization settles in: Recycling day was this past Thursday. All receptacles in our home get emptied and taken to the bin at the same time on recycling day. What if I tossed the mostly-full Vyvanse bottle?

I can easily see this happening. Very easily. Even though I couldn‚Äôt even tell you when it happened, nor do I specifically remember doing it. 

Fortunately, I keep my Adderall at my office desk instead of the pill organizer. Typically I combine whatever was leftover from my last month‚Äôs prescription into the new bottles whenever I get my ADHD meds refilled. So I *think* I have plenty of short release Adderall to last me until my next refill (2/12). In the process of counting them for rationing out now.

Of course, I live in the USA so there‚Äôs no recourse.

Just counting my blessings that I take maybe 1/5 of the Adderall bumper doses than I get prescribed, and that my partner‚Äôs SiL got me coffee **and** espresso for Xmas.",1,1737389239.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1i5tmr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1i5tmr7/i_swear_that_self_checkout_is_invisible_to/,I swear that self checkout is invisible to customers ,"So I work in a small convenience store, but it often gets busy, as it‚Äôs right next to metro station and multiple bus and tram stops. 

There‚Äôs one regular cash register and one self checkout. Because there‚Äôs only two people during shift (unless my boss comes in to help), I often have to leave the register to help out with unpacking deliveries, stocking shelves, cleaning the store etc. When I leave the register, I put up a large sign that says if you‚Äôre paying with card to use the self checkout.
 
But customers ignore it. Today it took me half my shift to even refill the coffee machine (pour milk and beans and restock the paper cups), because every time I left the register, someone would come in, stand in front of it and signal me to come back. 

Half the times those were people paying with card, not needing any of my assistance (with handing something from behind the register, preparing the food or weighing fruits). Multiple times I got told off that I‚Äôm too slow and that they‚Äôre going to miss their train/bus/whatever. What‚Äôs so hard about going to the self checkout if you‚Äôre paying with card for just one bottle of water? It‚Äôs way faster to use the self checkout than to wait for me to drop what I‚Äôm doing, come back, go through my script (asking for app and recommending a candy bar, it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôd get in big trouble for not doing if caught by the ‚Äúmystery shoppers‚Äù send by corporate) etc.

Then my shift ends. There‚Äôs a huge line taking up most of the store. My coworker can‚Äôt really help, because there‚Äôs only one register, I can‚Äôt leave until I count the cash in the till. I yell out that anyone not paying with cash should use the self checkout. Nobody even reacts. Then half the people proceed to pay with card and act annoyed that the wait is so long and I end up leaving 15 minutes later than I was supposed to (there‚Äôs no paid overtime). 

I don‚Äôt get it, what‚Äôs the problem? Is it invisible? Is this some kind of pride thing, that they don‚Äôt want to do ‚Äúmy job‚Äù of scanning the items? It wastes so much of my time and their time every single shift and I really don‚Äôt get what the problem is. ",3,1737389234.0,retailhell,0,1.0,False

1i5tm1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1i5tm1a/hilton_playa_del_carmen_review/,Hilton Playa del Carmen Review,"5 nights on points. 

Overall: We gave it 3.5 stars. Enjoyed our time but wouldn't pay to return. We've decided adults only is not for us, too many drunks and way too loud at night. Great location by 5th Avenue that we walked down after dinner most nights.

Room: AC was ice cold. Bed was comfortable enough for a good nights sleep. We asked about an upgrade but would have had to switch rooms after a few days so just kept the standard room.

Food: Was generally good overall. Our favorite restaurant was the Mexican. My wife said the grilled fish was inconsistent with one night being good and another overcooked but still ate it.  Coffee shop was heavily used. I loved the breakfast buffet and thought it was the best outnof the other Hilton AIs weve visited. Several different stations for freshly cooked food and had the pre made breakfast burritos and fried plantains every day.

Drinks: All the specialty drinks at restaurants were overly sweet. La Mejorada was our favorite place for cocktails and the bartender was amazing.

Service: Excellent. Everyone was very friendly and accomodating

Beach: Plenty of chairs and cabanas. The beach directly in front of the diamond section was very rocky to the point of being inaccessible but going 100 yards to the left was smooth sand. Seaweed was under control except for the last day after a big rain storm overnight. Saw enough fish to make snorkeling right off the beach interesting (sting rays, angel fish, and a hard to spot scorpion fish)

Pool: Was pretty crowded and we mostly avoided. There always seemed to be a chair available though, just not poolside. The smaller pool was much quieter and where we went the few times we weren't at the beach. Pool was cold when the sun went down but fine during the day.

Excursions: we did the salty and sweet tour through Rio Secreto and loved it. Small 10 person groups for snorkeling at puerto morelos and a cenote. Used flip tours for a cozumel catamaran and would not do it again. Wayyyy too many people (80+) which made the snorkeling awful. The private beach was amazing though.

Even when abusers pretend to be remorseful, their true colors always show through. 

They sent the letter in the mail with no return address, and had someone else write my address so the handwriting wasn‚Äôt recognizable. Being deceptive right off the bat.

I meet an amazing woman on a dating app, she gave me her number after the second day and we've had good, long conversations since. We talk about what we want in a relationship, express that communication is very important, normal getting to know you stuff and how we like to be shown attention/love/affection. After a week we meet up at a restaurant for a date, we eat, talk and ended up spending 2.5 hours there total, she gave me a good long hug, i asked if i could see her again and she agreed.

  
she had told me before our first date she was in an abusive 18 year marriage, and that after her divorce she met a guy, who she said she fell for hard, she even admitted she ignored all his red flags (she admitted he had  A LOT) so i knew she was guarded, which i understood. I've been divorced for 9 months at this point so i know moving on is... hard.

  
Anyways, the next day we meet up again, walk in the park, coffee then an early dinner. After dinner she tells me she doesn't think she's ready for a relationship, she reiterated how bad that guy hurt her and that she wanted to take things slow.  She told me she didn't want to talk to anyone else other than me, that she does like me and she doesn't want to hurt me or get hurt herself. I made it very clear that I am NOT like most men and tried to set her at ease and let her know I am conscious of others feelings and don't want to hurt anyone myself. Again she gave me a long hug and i reassured her we could take it slow.



So 3 days later i noticed she is kinda quiet, i know she has kids and a somewhat demanding job but she's more quiet than usual, and i ask if everything is ok. She replies with this.



""""NAME"" I know, I am sorry, Im just going through a rough spot gain and i dont know why i do this, i like you a lot and think are a great and handsome man, but i dont think my heart is ready to love again right now and its not fair to you. you deserve someone that can give you as much as you give. I am so sorry, i thought i was ready and i never wanted to hurt you. i am hurting myself too. but i think for now i just need to be with my kids and try to get in a better place mentally. i was laying in bed by my mom crying last night and she thinks i may need to see a therapist and i think shes right. I am a super broken person and you deserve someone that can love you without holding back. I wish i had met you before ""NAME OF ASSHOLE"" before my heart was in quite so many pieces. i hope you can forgive me and understand where i am coming from. please dont look at this as rejection because this is nothing on you. you are awesome and did everything right. I know people say that all the time and dont mean it but i am being completely honest. I am the one who has something wrong with her not you. I cant stand the thought of hurting you but i feel i would hurt you more in the long run if i dont take this time and let myself finish healing and maybe get some help. I really thought i was ready but i know i am not now, please dont hate me""

  
Half of me thinks shes lying as thats been my experience with women.... the other half is a hopeless optimist and wants to believe in time we could reconnect. When i came out of my divorce i had this exact same feeling and i had to find out the hard way i wasn't ready so I'm certainly sympathetic to her. 



I appreciate everyone who reads this wall of text and hope that some women or more experienced men could give me some insight....  Its been 5 days and I haven't texted and i wasn't rude or belittling when she told me this.

How are we expected to thrive in a big company when people don't even want to train you? and if you are provided training, its provided in the most vague, politically-motivated way.

They'll be fast when they teach you and if you ask to slow down they'll use that against you by speaking to your manager saying youre slow at catching things.

I don‚Äôt really know where to begin. The events of the last year are still all messed up in my head. I think I should start writing things down in chronological order, for some reason it makes sense to do it like that.¬†

The news came in during my favorite month - April. I really love April for many reasons. It‚Äôs spring, nature starts going wild, the temperature is really nice for running and the days are getting longer and longer. I hope the fact that I received this news in April won‚Äôt make me change on how I feel about it. I guess I‚Äôll have to wait a couple of months to see that.¬†

I was sitting at the office when the email with the results came in. I was oddly calm about what was coming up. Back pain is a normal thing after 30, right? I was definitely not waiting to hear anything important. Funny me. I opened the pdf and the first thing I realized was how big the description was. I thought ‚Äòok, something‚Äôs not right‚Äô. I started to read and I noticed the sentence¬†

‚Äò..rather large, space-consuming tumor..‚Äô‚Äô

I had to read this a couple of times before I continued to the next sentence

‚Äò‚Äô height 13cm, width 8cm, depth 9cm‚Äô‚Äô

‚ÄòF@ck. things are serious now‚Äô I thought. All this happened while I was still in the office - an open space office. I lost the world beneath my feet, but for some reason, I did not panic. I guess some sort of survival instinct kept me going. I started to text my significant other ‚ÄòNelly, I have something..‚Äô, then my mom, then my GP to ask for directions. At that moment I did not know if it was cancer for sure, but I was certain that it was something bad.

I decided to stay in the office for some time and let myself settle for a bit. I did not want to drive right after reading this news. I thought I might have a crash or some accident because of my foggy head. I don‚Äôt remember much more from that day, I think my parents and Nelly‚Äôs dad came by the same night but it‚Äôs really blurry in my head. I‚Äôm so grateful I have all these people around me. People I love and I know they will be there during hard times. But you don‚Äôt appreciate it until a time like this comes.¬†

The next weeks were very busy. I had to talk to all these doctors and have tons of exams. I had no idea what a PET CT was or why all the exams I went through were needed. After doctors took a sample for biopsy we had to wait for around 2 weeks until the results came in which gave me some room to breathe and prepare for the road ahead. We had some nice days. Had a family feast with the broader family. Not all of them knew, which was ok. It gave me a sense of normality and we talked about random stuff ‚Äì anything but cancer, that was great for me.



April ends

Results from the biopsy came in around early May, and when my doctor called she said it was something called Ewing sarcoma, a very rare type of cancer that unfortunately happens to kids and teenagers. And also strange men in their 30s as it seems.

At that moment I had to find the proper oncologist and then start chemotherapy.

*It still sounds surreal to me as I am typing this. ‚ÄòTo have chemotherapy..‚Äô. It sounds like a bad joke. Still, after going through 14 rounds over the last 7 months, it sounds like a bad joke that someone is playing to me. Like that movie with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn;  The Game.*¬†

We did our research ‚Äìand by ‚Äòwe‚Äô I mean me and my beloved crew, Nelly, my mom, her mom, and my cousins too- and eventually found a doctor who specialized in sarcomas here in my country. Thankfully, we still have a public healthcare system in Greece. I was thinking to myself ‚ÄòWhat if I lived in the US‚Äô. Nightmare. It is very positive to have the safety net of the public healthcare system in these hard times.¬†

The healthcare system is far from perfect, but it offers at least the care and medicine that someone needs in these hard times. I met a lot of committed and hardworking people - nurses, doctors, and more. It‚Äôs really bad that all these people are not supported by the government as much as they should. Makes me feel disappointed in how some decisions are made on a high level ‚ÄìI mean politicians. Hospitals are old and ugly, but honestly, I can live with that. The main problem I noticed was the pressure on the system. Too many patients are supported by too few doctors and nurses. That‚Äôs it. Plain and simple. And this at some level happens consciously. I guess it has to do with how certain dynamics are pulling towards private healthcare and how the insurance system works.. but I don‚Äôt want to get too political.

The oncologists indicated that I should find a surgeon too. That was a bit challenging. I feel that surgeons most of the time disassociate from any sort of feelings in order to cope with the difficulties of their job. But that wasn‚Äôt helping me. Hearing all these different approaches and details about a potential surgery was really terrifying at that moment. But at the end of the conversation, they all said ‚Äòdepending on the chemo outcome‚Äô, meaning that the scenario they were describing at that moment was according to the size and position of the tumor on that day. Positive chemo outcomes would mean an easier surgery.

I informed some close friends and my family about what was going on. Got so many different reactions. People are never ready to hear such news. I remember one of my friends was chewing when I started to tell the story. He got so stressed from the news that he kept eating faster and faster while trying to say sorry that he was eating and that it was a stress reaction. I wasn‚Äôt mad at him, I found it funny for some reason.

On May 20 I had my first chemo. On May 21 I had my last cigarette. I am not sure if I have officially quit smoking yet. It seemed so hard to quit until then. Some part of myself still craves for it. It was easy at the beginning. Somehow I managed to forget about it during the first months. I thought I should help myself and my therapy process with the things that I have some level of control.¬†

That‚Äôs why I started psychotherapy around the same time and also visited a clinical dietician. It was my way of fighting the cancer back, besides the chemo itself. Looking back at these decisions now I think I did the right thing. I started to read about mindfulness too as part of the psychotherapy. It was what I needed. Mindfulness taught me that the world around me can be as quiet as I allow it to be. It‚Äôs ok to have feelings and thoughts, but at the end of the day, they are just this (thoughts and feelings). The important thing is how we choose to react towards them. I started to notice a change after the first couple of weeks of the 8-week program. I was wondering ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt I try this earlier?‚Äô

I feel so grateful to have people around me who support me and are with me on this adventure. And Nelly was there in every way. She helped me adjust my diet according to the new standards, she gave the extra nudge every time I was hesitant about doing something, and many more things during my difficult and boring routine over the last months. So far she has been through a tremendous amount of stress and pressure.I will forever be grateful to her



Last summer was difficult for me. The heat and the sun did not match well with chemo and the exhaustion was enormous. I managed to go to the beach 5 or 6 times. It was early in the morning but it was nice. It was a chance to remember life as it was before. I did not have my usual summer vacations as I used to but we had some happy moments in the midst of all this.¬†

I remember I used to wait for the sun to go down before I got outside - like some sort of vampire (I also looked like one - funny me).

I enjoyed the summer movie theater a lot. Most of the time, the movies are not good but spending time outdoors with some popcorn and an alcohol-free beer was a delight.¬†

Seeing friends was also something I was looking forward to. I could not meet them as often as I‚Äôd like for many reasons, but I was left with a happy feeling every time we met.¬†

There were many moments that I thought ‚ÄòI‚Äôm grateful to have all these people around me‚Äô

And the time for my first exam came. I was nervous. I did not actively feel anxiety or something like that, but there was a certain ‚Äòedge‚Äô in my behavior a couple of days before the exam and until the results came in. Wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. What if the chemo did not have any effect? What if all my efforts so far did not have the desired outcome? Mindfulness training was handy during these moments.

The results came in. I was reading it on my phone and what it said was music to my ears. The tumor was nearly half as it was 2 months ago. Wow, I could not believe it. It took me some time to realize that it was good news. I got emotional at that moment. This news gave me the strength to keep going. I was not even at 50% of my planned chemo rounds and the road ahead seemed difficult. But now I knew I was doing something right. So I kept going. It was the sign I needed to give me strength and courage. And I did keep going.



The next months were business as usual. It was not easy, but we managed to find a way to live through that. I knew which days were good and bad, I knew when to stay at home and when to go outside. It‚Äôs one of these situations where you have to listen to your body. If your body tells you to rest, then rest. Go with the flow, don‚Äôt fight back.¬†

I particularly enjoyed going to nature. There is a mountain nearby with a small place to get coffee and snacks and we went there a lot. Nature has a positive effect on me. Makes me feel alive and that I am part of the creation. For me, it‚Äôs like going to church. Makes me feel closer to God. And all this time, I have missed my hikes and my adventures a lot. Looking forward to starting climbing my mountains again. I know I have to climb another type of mountain for now.



Months pass by and it‚Äôs December

My last chemo is near and I am too excited. I keep thinking ‚ÄòThe torture will end soon!‚Äô. I understand the benefit of it, but it still is a torture. My first cancer‚Äôs symptoms were a couple of times with fever and back pain (and some lower energy levels to be fair), but chemo‚Äôs side effects were going on and on for months. It was one of these situations where the treatment was more intense than the disease. That‚Äôs why I was looking forward to its ending. I imagined very differently my last day at the hospital than it actually was. It was very busy, and very hectic, but when I said goodbye to the nurses I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends. They knew me by my first name, and they helped me when I was feeling down or tired, and we chatted when there was an opportunity. I want to say a big Thank you to all of them.¬†



The holiday season is upon me and similar to everything else during the last year, it feels different. We had the chance to spend some time with family which was nice and fun. I nice warm break before the rest of the journey.

On the last day of 2024, I had a design session for radiotherapy. It‚Äôs expected to have some side effects too, but it sounded much more tolerable compared to chemo (and is so far)

On the 2nd day of the new year, I had another PET CT. Thankfully it was good news again, the size was difficult to measure, and it was much smaller, but the sarcoma was still there. ‚ÄòJust a bit more‚Äô I thought. And hopefully, radiotherapy will help too.¬†



And we come to today.

Currently, I am continuing radiotherapy and the plan is to complete by mid-February. Then I‚Äôll wait for 5-6 weeks (it seems that it needs some time to kick in), and the plan is to have surgery to remove any remaining tumor. The strategy so far was to help the surgeon by reducing its size as much as possible and to reduce the risks with the nerves and the spine.¬†



I know it's quite a long read (for a Reddit post at least) but I hope my story will help and give strength to everyone out there who is fighting cancer or any other serious life-threatening battle.

Stay strong, stay committed, and be mindful. Try to surround yourself with people you love!

Have you ever wondered, ‚ÄúHow does my neighborhood affect the value of my home?‚Äù In Halifax, the real estate market is as dynamic as its neighborhoods, and understanding local trends is key to a successful sale. Whether you‚Äôre in a bustling downtown condo or a family-friendly suburban home, neighborhood trends play a big role in determining your property‚Äôs appeal to buyers.

At The Pike Group, led by Sandra Pike, we specialize in helping Halifax sellers understand and leverage these trends to maximize their sale. Let‚Äôs explore how neighborhood trends can impact your home sale and what you can do to stay ahead of the curve.

**1. The Role of Neighborhood Trends in Real Estate**

Neighborhood trends reflect the changing preferences, demographics, and developments in a specific area. In Halifax, these trends are influenced by factors like new infrastructure, schools, local businesses, and community amenities.

**Why This Matters to Sellers:**

* Buyers often search for homes that align with their lifestyle preferences.
* A desirable neighborhood can increase demand and lead to higher sale prices.
* On the flip side, declining trends might mean you need to adjust your pricing or marketing strategy.

Understanding these trends can help you position your home more effectively in the market.

**2. Popular Neighborhood Trends in Halifax**

Halifax is a city of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own unique vibe. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the current trends impacting local real estate:

**a) Urban Living in Downtown Halifax**

The demand for condos and townhouses in downtown Halifax is on the rise. Young professionals and empty nesters are drawn to the area‚Äôs walkability, trendy restaurants, and cultural scene.

**Impact on Your Sale:**  
If you‚Äôre selling a downtown property, highlight its proximity to amenities like dining, shopping, and public transportation. Urban buyers value convenience and lifestyle.

**b) Family-Friendly Suburbs**

Neighborhoods like Bedford, Clayton Park, and West End Halifax are popular among families for their excellent schools, parks, and community feel.

**Impact on Your Sale:**  
Family buyers are looking for safety, space, and nearby schools. Emphasize your home‚Äôs kid-friendly features like a fenced yard or finished basement.

**c) Waterfront Living**

Waterfront properties in Halifax remain highly sought after for their scenic beauty and lifestyle perks.

**Impact on Your Sale:**  
Buyers looking for waterfront homes prioritize views, water access, and outdoor spaces. Professional photography that showcases these features can set your listing apart.

**d) Up-and-Coming Areas**

Emerging neighborhoods like Spryfield and Fairview are attracting first-time buyers and investors due to their affordability and potential for growth.

**Impact on Your Sale:**  
If you‚Äôre in an up-and-coming area, position your home as a smart investment with future potential. Highlight recent developments or planned projects that enhance the neighborhood‚Äôs appeal.

**3. How to Leverage Positive Trends**

If your neighborhood is experiencing a surge in popularity, you‚Äôre in a prime position to capitalize on demand. Here‚Äôs how:

**a) Targeted Marketing**

Work with your Realtor to create a marketing strategy that appeals to the typical buyers for your neighborhood. For example, if your area attracts families, focus on schools, parks, and safety.

**b) Highlight Local Amenities**

Does your neighborhood have a new coffee shop, upgraded park, or upcoming transit hub? These amenities can boost your home‚Äôs appeal, so make sure they‚Äôre mentioned in your listing.

**c) Emphasize Community Features**

Buyers want more than a house‚Äîthey want a lifestyle. Whether it‚Äôs a tight-knit community vibe or easy access to nightlife, showcase what makes your neighborhood special.

**4. What to Do If Trends Are Working Against You**

Not every neighborhood is on the rise. If your area is facing challenges‚Äîsuch as slower development or less buyer interest‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry. There are still ways to make your home stand out:

**a) Focus on the Property**

When the neighborhood isn‚Äôt a strong selling point, shift the focus to your home‚Äôs features. Upgrades, renovations, or staging can help your property shine.

**b) Price Strategically**

Work with your Realtor to set a competitive price based on market conditions. If your neighborhood is less in demand, pricing your home correctly is crucial to attracting buyers.

**c) Highlight Long-Term Potential**

If the area is expected to improve, position your home as a smart investment. Buyers are often willing to bet on future growth.

**5. The Importance of Local Expertise**

Navigating neighborhood trends requires local knowledge. As a trusted Halifax Realtor, Sandra Pike and The Pike Group understand the nuances of the city‚Äôs diverse neighborhoods and can help you make informed decisions.

**Why Choose The Pike Group?**

* **Data-Driven Insights:** We use market data to identify trends and position your home strategically.

1i5td7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5td7b/i_told_my_manager_my_coworker_wasnt_his_job_on/,I told my manager my coworker wasn‚Äôt his job on the overnight ,"I work overnights at my work. This one guy in particular I work with always slacks off so I‚Äôm always doing a bunch of his work for him or it won‚Äôt get done and still a lot of things don‚Äôt get done. I am the baker and he is out front and I don‚Äôt always have time to do everything for him. I asked him if he would be able to do some but he said fuck that, not in a mean way but still. He is always getting baked in the bathroom and he takes a long time to do the things he does do and I always come out to help him in drive thru when it‚Äôs busy and make sure to finish baking and cleaning up two hours early for the morning so I can help him out. He is a nice guy but im getting burnt out every shift. You can tell he doesn‚Äôt try and neither of us have time to have a break because he takes a long time and sometimes stands around and I am still doing all my work plus part of his. So at the last meeting at work I talked to my manager. I thought she would talk to him about it but instead she is only giving him one shift a week and now I feel bad because I just wanted everything to be fair. I go out front as well when he isn‚Äôt working that shift and it isn‚Äôt hard and I finish everything early when I do it and I make sure to clean all everything, machines, coffee pots, washroom dining room and wipe down all things plus I still have time to do extra things for the morning supervisor. So I don‚Äôt understand why I have to pick up his slack and do my job when I‚Äôm baking and he‚Äôs out front. He is a really nice guys but I feel guilty because stuff isn‚Äôt being properly cleaned and if I was a customer I would feel disgusted. The stuff he does he does fine but he is always late on taking orders too he will leave customers waiting there for like 30 seconds so I have to keep coming out and taking the order for him. So I just told my manager that stuff wasn‚Äôt being done and I thought she would talk to him about it but she doesn‚Äôt and now he is wondering why he is only getting one shift a week and now I feel like I should have just sucked it up instead of saying anything. Also I don‚Äôt care that he even gets high at work it just makes me mad that he is having a fine time while im stressing if I‚Äôll have time to get everything done because if I don‚Äôt do it it won‚Äôt get done and still some stuff isn‚Äôt done even then bc I just don‚Äôt have the time. He is a good worker but I‚Äôm stressed out. He is also like 26 and he started dating a minor but now she is legal but it kinda rubs me the wrong way. He also asked a girl at my work for feet pics once. But he is a chill guy and I feel bad but that makes me judge him too but idk his upbringing. This is not an organized rant but I feel bad bc they cut back his shifts before I said anything for 5 to 3 and then to 1 and then it was three and now it‚Äôs back to one. He lives with his mom tho and she came in the store mad bc he wasn‚Äôt getting enough shifts. I know this rant isn‚Äôt organized I just went off and can‚Äôt bother to rewrite it ",2,1737388597.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1i5tcgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1i5tcgp/i_feel_like_i_was_groomed/,I feel like I was Groomed. ,"So like circa 2002 I was like 12-13 ish & Our desktop computer was everything to me. I was in all of the Yahoo! Chat rooms, aol, msn.. I had a whole online life. I had friends all over, & dated dudes online in the US (I'm in Canada) cell phones were just getting big, MySpace is poppin, and Facebook was right around the corner..

So at one point I accidentally put a virus in the computer and was in this chat room like ‚Äúmy moms gonna flip, someone help me..‚Äù & I met a man online, who was good with computers, big IT guy, he can help! He was 23, and lived in Texas, but was also Canadian. He ended up helping me, I‚Äôm not sure if this is when he used the remote access? But it might not have been a thing yet.. But he fixed it, problem avoided. And now I have this nice new friend! He was always so polite too. 

At first it was innocent, because I also had a boyfriend, so he really just chatted me up and got to know me over the course of high school and beyond. But during my relationships we would disconnect, my current guy obviously wouldn‚Äôt want me talking to another man. So I would put him aside in my brain like, oh he's grown and busy, blah blah.. but the minute my boyfriend and I would break up, I‚Äôd get an email ‚Äúhey remember me‚Äù or some kind of communication from him. I always thought it was Devine timing. And sometimes I would have a computer problem he would fix. He‚Äôs in Texas, I‚Äôm in Canada, no harm. 

When we started to get more personal, we realized his parents & kids live in my city. And since we often disconnected, he was married & had 4 kids by the time I‚Äôm grown. Then I kind of realized he was married likely the whole time we had been talking, likely with a toddler early on‚Ä¶ & I remember him asking me  to flash him when I was younger years (not going to admit the age because all of it was too young) but I always thought he was so polite. So when I‚Äôm more like 16, 17, 18 years, he‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm his dream girl. He would marry me, blah blah. But I‚Äôm like dating dude from school on and off. 

Okay, so Let‚Äôs jump a bit, I‚Äôm, and now having my first baby. He pops up and says he‚Äôs driving up to my city to visit his parents, do I wanna meet? I went for a coffee, and then didn‚Äôt hear from him again for a bit as usual. Then around 25 I hear from him, he‚Äôs coming back to go to court, he getting divorced she took the kids and whatever, mind you he‚Äôs like 35 now. So for the next 5 years, he drives from Texas, to Canada on a monthly basis, sometimes flew, but not usually. 

Around 27, I‚Äôm pregnant with babes #3, he bio dad is gone wherever, and he says to me, and we are both single adults, he said ‚ÄúI like babies, and you know I‚Äôll be there for you.‚Äù 

So my brain was like wait, should I give the nice guy a chance? I really did have love for him you know. Knowing him, and anticipating his communication was part of my cycle of going through relationships. So I was like, you know what, let‚Äôs date then. I live in a border city, he got a trailer in Michigan so he had a place to stay with his kids on the weeks a he had them, and a place that we could meet mutually. 

Okay, so I‚Äôm 28, have 2 older kids, and a new baby, & a new man. He has a real job, he has real commitment (he drives from Texas to Canada monthly, saint! üôÑ) 

He ended up giving me a prepaid American card thing and always kept it loaded with like $100-$200 so when he came down at the end of the month, I could get diapers and groceries while I was stateside. & he let me use the van he had parked at his parents! I felt super just grateful, and like I‚Äôm awe of his generosity. I‚Äôm not used to generous people. 

Okay‚Ä¶ so Now I‚Äôm 30, I‚Äôve been in a long distance relationship with this man for 3 years, only seeing him a few hours at the end of the month, maybe I‚Äôll get to spend a night in Michigan, or pop over while the kids are at school for a bit, go for lunch or something. 

I meet some people, and I‚Äôm telling them about my man and they‚Äôre like.. ‚Äúwait, tell us again?‚Äù So okay? They said, you‚Äôve never met his family? He‚Äôs only met your mom? Not a single friend? He doesn‚Äôt have a lick of social media? My sister moved out of town and in the 3 years we dated and 5 years we spent time, she never met him. My imaginary man. I met his kids one time at the park with my kids, it was weird, and I was the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. But it was early days so I didn‚Äôt question it. 

He had remote access to most of my devices, I always thought it was cool to see my cursor move and know it was him (only if I needed help with something and asked) 


I‚Äôm trailing off‚Ä¶ so yeah, someone said ‚ÄúI think he groomed you‚Äù and my heart sank. & Covid hit, and we obviously couldn‚Äôt see each other, so I broke it off, but it felt mutual. But then my emails got hacked and passwords changed, people started getting texts about me and stuff, untraceable numbers. 

One time he told me he had charges against him once for moving a satellite 2 degrees a diff direction or something. 

It was also pointed out he looks like a serial killer, and that was enough to make me want to throw up, when I realized his childhood wasn‚Äôt even far off of that guy, and I used to go to Michigan to a random trailer park where I had no cell service in a tracked vehicle that isn‚Äôt mine, and not a single person would even know where to look. 

Anyway. I‚Äôm turning 36, and haven‚Äôt heard from him in at least 4 years. But I really had to get it off my chest. 

ETA-I‚Äôm engaged now and we are planning on going shopping in MI, it was a bit of a trigger. I haven‚Äôt been since pre Covid. ",2,1737388546.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

**Next chapter**

I predict next chapter will be negotiations between humanity (Yoshida and Fumiko) and Devils (mainly Fami, but Asa might back what she says). Basically, humanity will follow Fami‚Äôs plans, since all of their plans have basically been foiled. With Fumiko killing all of leadership, that makes the two defacto leaders of Public Saftey. They will ask Fami to minimize casualties. Fami will probably say maybe. We then hear Fami‚Äôs plan. **Devil recruitment**. She wants Asa, Denji, and Yoshida to go out and recruit devils, either around the world or in hell to come in the final fight against Death. Why those three? Trio. Asa will agree but Denji, now with a new will for live, might not be so hot on the plan. Some meat will probably be thrown his way. Two of the devils that they need to get are Blood and Control. This will both make excite and sadden Denji.

**Devil Recruitment Arc**

Basically the trio go around either Hell or the world, gathering devils, either willing or forcefully. Dynamics will shift between the trio, becoming more trusting. We see familiar faces of past foes. And we will get some sad shot involving Blood and Control. It will then cut to a

Some call it long covid but I think it really just changed my chemistry, somehow, I‚Äôm not sure how to explain. I had debilitating insomnia, aches, pains, tingingling, fatigue, hypnic jerks, anxiety. Lost my hair, starting going grey. I‚Äôm in my 30s. I was in worse health than my 70 year old parents. It was hell and I was having to take sleeping meds every single night. My quality of life declined drastically.

I tried a lot of different things to try to get back to normal. From supplements, sleep studies, prescription medicine, acupuncture, many things discussed on LC forums.

Eventually I decided to quit coffee and tea. Why? I listened to Pollan on Rogan. I‚Äôve drank coffee for 20 years at this point. And a lot I think, 3-6 cups a day.

This forum really helped me through withdrawal, symptoms and where to go next. I quit cold turkey and my crushing insomnia got better. It is amazing. Nothing else had helped. Now I sleep ok without medication which I will gladly take. However, even months later I was still having pretty bad fatigue, swelling, stiffness, inflammation, general puffiness. So I made more changes, and I knew I could after I was able to quit caffeine. Now I eat keto, I cut down my Ultra Processed Foods. 

I didn‚Äôt need to loose weight so I had never considered keto. Now I have amazing energy and I am able to do so much. I‚Äôve quit seed oils and now I am way less inflamed. I haven‚Äôt gotten a cold since I changed my diet (even when my family had a cold or the flu). I mean it‚Äôs absolutely amazing. I feel 15 years younger. 

A good book to read is ‚ÄúGood Energy‚Äù by Casey Means, it has really helped me to navigate towards feeling freaking amazing! The keto forum has also really helped me. 

Unfortunately some of this stuff has become political (like seed oils, keto, and Casey Means) but I don‚Äôt care because this whole journey has been to live and thrive again and I thank quitting caffeine as my starting point, not politics.

I quit coffee in JULY. It took a couple of weeks to start seeing benefits like the ability to ween off pharmaceuticals for sleep. I realized about two to three months in that I needed to do more and that‚Äôs when I started changing my diet in September. 

TL;DR : quitting coffee helped me realize it wasn‚Äôt just coffee that was dragging me down, it inspired me to change my diet and feel better than I have in 15 years!",9,1737388176.0,decaf,2,0.91,False

I've been instructed not to drink coffee anymore. The horror, I know! Something changed in my body over the last year or so and now I'm extremely caffeine sensitive. It's really quite tragic if I'm being honest. I only started drinking it after I turned 30 and now poof, my new hobby is gone. No more coffee and a bagel on the deck in the morning, no more runs to Dutch Bros. It's probably for the best though. I lately would get an inexplicable feeling of impending doom every time I drank a cup and would spend a couple of hours transfixed on that feeling. Occasionally I'd get lucky and just not be able to sleep at night instead. C'est La Vie as they say.

So where does that leave things now? Well I'm in Las Vegas on vacation and would love to at least grab breakfast or brunch this week if you're local to the area. I'm not expecting anything out of it, just like socializing and exploring new places in the city that I haven't been. I'm NOT local, but am here every few months so almost might as well be at this point. No, no I'm not a degenerate gambler or a party animal. I enjoy the food more than anything, people watching on the strip, going out to the canyons for hikes, etc. If you're not from the area and just find my post irresistibly entertain ing, don't be shy, send a message!

About me-I'm a late thirties professional working in the corporate finance field. No, it's not at all what I imagined myself doing at this point but I probably share that same feeling with a lot of people. I'm well educated and well traveled, an introverted social butterfly(There are at least 20 of us in the world) who loves to meet new people, experience new things yet is a little terrified of the process internally. I love all things sports and the outdoors as well as cooking, music, animals, writing, photography and a bunch of other stuff that I don't have enough time for. I'll go out on a limb and pretty much guarantee that if you know how to hold a conversation we'd have fun with each other in some capacity.

Physically I'm 6'3'', roughly 210 pounds and in relatively good shape. I could do better, obviously but I feel good about myself most days. Blue eyes, gingerish hair and a beard. Open to exchanging pics, and if you're brave you can send one in your reply! As for you-some common interests would be nice. I'm pretty active so it would be nice to find someone who's also into staying active, whatever that may mean to you. I don't have a specific location or age range that I'm stuck on, more just ask that you again be able to hold a conversation and have a sense of humor cause I'd love nothing more than to make you laugh.

# Mitolyn Reviews

I remember the day everything changed for me.

I was sitting at my desk, staring at the mountain of unfinished tasks piling up like a to-do list from hell. My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn‚Äôt focus, couldn‚Äôt think clearly, and the fatigue wasn‚Äôt just physical‚Äîit was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That‚Äôs when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who‚Äôd been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years‚Äîand stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I‚Äôd always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn‚Äôt just what I saw in the mirror‚Äîit was how I felt inside. There‚Äôs a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you‚Äôre living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn‚Äôt some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I‚Äôd been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised‚Äîand more.

Now, I‚Äôm not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it‚Äôs hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs low energy, brain fog, or the frustration of trying everything to shed those stubborn pounds‚ÄîI can‚Äôt recommend this enough. It‚Äôs not just a supplement. It‚Äôs a tool to help you unlock the best version of yourself.

And trust me, once you feel what it‚Äôs like to operate at 100%, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

# The Science Behind Mitolyn

What truly sets this product apart is the science behind it. This isn‚Äôt some gimmick or a trendy blend of random herbs. It‚Äôs a carefully formulated combination of ingredients designed to optimize one thing: mitochondrial health.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

Your mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells, responsible for converting the food you eat into the energy your body needs to function. When your mitochondria are operating at full capacity, you feel energized, focused, and alive. But when they‚Äôre sluggish‚Äîthanks to stress, aging, poor diet, or environmental factors‚Äîyou feel exactly how I used to: tired, foggy, and stuck.

The formulation is laser-focused on improving mitochondrial function and cellular energy production, and it does this with a blend of some of the most potent, natural ingredients out there.

Take¬†**Maqui Berry**, for example. This superfruit is loaded with antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress, one of the biggest culprits behind mitochondrial damage. By neutralizing free radicals, Maqui Berry protects your cells and keeps your mitochondria working efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**Rhodiola Rosea**, a well-known adaptogen. This powerful plant helps your body adapt to stress, reducing cortisol levels and supporting your energy levels in a way that feels natural and sustained. No spikes, no crashes‚Äîjust smooth, all-day energy that keeps you sharp and focused.

**Haematococcus Pluvialis**, or red algae, is another standout ingredient. It‚Äôs packed with astaxanthin, a compound known for its unparalleled antioxidant properties. But here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: astaxanthin doesn‚Äôt just protect your mitochondria‚Äîit actually enhances their function, helping them produce more energy at a cellular level.

And let‚Äôs not forget¬†**Amla**‚ÄîIndian Gooseberry. Rich in Vitamin C and other nutrients, Amla is a powerhouse for boosting your immune system and fighting inflammation. Inflammation is like kryptonite for your mitochondria, and by keeping it in check, Amla helps ensure your cells stay in peak condition.

Theobroma Cacao is another game-changer. Beyond being the source of chocolate (yes, chocolate!), this ingredient is loaded with polyphenols that improve blood flow and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your cells. Better circulation means better mitochondrial performance, and that translates directly into more energy for you.

Finally, there‚Äôs¬†**Schisandra**, a botanical treasure used for centuries in traditional medicine. It‚Äôs known for its ability to improve endurance, reduce fatigue, and even sharpen mental focus. Together, these benefits make it a key player in optimizing both physical and cognitive performance.

What I love about this formula is that it doesn‚Äôt just throw a bunch of trendy ingredients into a bottle and hope for the best.

# Mitolyn Reviews

I remember the day everything changed for me.

I was sitting at my desk, staring at the mountain of unfinished tasks piling up like a to-do list from hell. My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn‚Äôt focus, couldn‚Äôt think clearly, and the fatigue wasn‚Äôt just physical‚Äîit was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That‚Äôs when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who‚Äôd been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years‚Äîand stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I‚Äôd always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn‚Äôt just what I saw in the mirror‚Äîit was how I felt inside. There‚Äôs a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you‚Äôre living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn‚Äôt some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I‚Äôd been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised‚Äîand more.

Now, I‚Äôm not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it‚Äôs hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs low energy, brain fog, or the frustration of trying everything to shed those stubborn pounds‚ÄîI can‚Äôt recommend this enough. It‚Äôs not just a supplement. It‚Äôs a tool to help you unlock the best version of yourself.

And trust me, once you feel what it‚Äôs like to operate at 100%, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

# The Science Behind Mitolyn

What truly sets this product apart is the science behind it. This isn‚Äôt some gimmick or a trendy blend of random herbs. It‚Äôs a carefully formulated combination of ingredients designed to optimize one thing: mitochondrial health.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

Your mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells, responsible for converting the food you eat into the energy your body needs to function. When your mitochondria are operating at full capacity, you feel energized, focused, and alive. But when they‚Äôre sluggish‚Äîthanks to stress, aging, poor diet, or environmental factors‚Äîyou feel exactly how I used to: tired, foggy, and stuck.

The formulation is laser-focused on improving mitochondrial function and cellular energy production, and it does this with a blend of some of the most potent, natural ingredients out there.

Take¬†**Maqui Berry**, for example. This superfruit is loaded with antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress, one of the biggest culprits behind mitochondrial damage. By neutralizing free radicals, Maqui Berry protects your cells and keeps your mitochondria working efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**Rhodiola Rosea**, a well-known adaptogen. This powerful plant helps your body adapt to stress, reducing cortisol levels and supporting your energy levels in a way that feels natural and sustained. No spikes, no crashes‚Äîjust smooth, all-day energy that keeps you sharp and focused.

**Haematococcus Pluvialis**, or red algae, is another standout ingredient. It‚Äôs packed with astaxanthin, a compound known for its unparalleled antioxidant properties. But here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: astaxanthin doesn‚Äôt just protect your mitochondria‚Äîit actually enhances their function, helping them produce more energy at a cellular level.

And let‚Äôs not forget¬†**Amla**‚ÄîIndian Gooseberry. Rich in Vitamin C and other nutrients, Amla is a powerhouse for boosting your immune system and fighting inflammation. Inflammation is like kryptonite for your mitochondria, and by keeping it in check, Amla helps ensure your cells stay in peak condition.

Theobroma Cacao is another game-changer. Beyond being the source of chocolate (yes, chocolate!), this ingredient is loaded with polyphenols that improve blood flow and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your cells. Better circulation means better mitochondrial performance, and that translates directly into more energy for you.

Finally, there‚Äôs¬†**Schisandra**, a botanical treasure used for centuries in traditional medicine. It‚Äôs known for its ability to improve endurance, reduce fatigue, and even sharpen mental focus. Together, these benefits make it a key player in optimizing both physical and cognitive performance.

What I love about this formula is that it doesn‚Äôt just throw a bunch of trendy ingredients into a bottle and hope for the best. Each component has a specific purpose, backed by research, to support mitochondrial health and overall vitality. The synergy between these ingredients is what makes it so effective. It‚Äôs like giving your body a complete cellular tune-up.

But here‚Äôs the real magic: it‚Äôs not just about energy or weight loss or mental clarity‚Äîit‚Äôs about total well-being. When your mitochondria are functioning optimally, every system in your body benefits. Your metabolism speeds up. Your recovery time shortens. Your mood improves. Even your skin looks healthier. It‚Äôs all connected, and this product gets to the root of it all.

I had a lung infiction that needed 2 rounds of antibiotics and steroids to get on top of, a gallbladder infection that put me on IV antibiotics for four days, then oral for another week.
Then dental surgery that had me on another course of them for 7 days.

I noticed a lot  of problems after my last lot, (Dec 2nd).
Fatigue, on and off cough and reflux, massively I creased hunger, and weight gain. I gained 15lb in a month.

I didn't make the connection until I saw someone online talking about gut health and weight gain, so rather than diet, I've decided to focus on regaining gut health again.

So far, I've adopted a mostly whole foods eating pattern, and if it's not,  then its homemade.

Ditched white bread and started making my own rye bread sourdough.
I make my own yogurt, and have a couple of spoons of that along with my neighbours honey, every morning before anything else.

I already ditched coffee, I drink rooibos tea or plain water mostly.

I have a ginger bug and sauerkraut fermenting that should be ready next week.

I'm not fanatical, but I'm trying to make sure I'm adding gut friendly foods every meal, and in the last few days I've lost 3lb without trying, and I'm definitely less bloated and have more energy.

Does anyone have any favourite tips to share?

I CANT have things like green tea, citrus fruit, turmeric, or acv shots because of silent reflux, so none of those please!

‚ÄúStreet lamps‚Äù

Whose childhood curfew was ‚Äúwhen the street lamps turn on?‚Äù

Wasn‚Äôt that a bit arbitrary?
Like my mom knew The sun does not always set at the same time of day. 
Activated by the absence of light. 
A cloud dark enough could turn them on.

But. I‚Äôm a bit older now. And I think I get it. 
The light in her eyes when I was safe at home was the same glow that lit the streets where I‚Äôd trace the power lines back to the end of our driveway. Bumpy, filled with cracks and childhood scabs where there always seemed to be dandelions growing in the most inconvenient places. 

We‚Äôd sit at our kitchen table to eat and she‚Äôd tell me how everyone brings something to the table. These days. I‚Äôd rather just eat alone in my car

Is it just me
Or do dandelions smell different when you have someone to bring them to?

Darkness is everlasting as clouds blanket the sun. and And now that I can no longer hide my eyes from it. Even the street lamps can‚Äôt light my way home.

Believing I‚Äôm enough is not a destination like I was told it was. Oh Sweet naivety. I‚Äôm just a square peg in a round hole. I wasnt made to fit it. But I can be made to. Someone.  Come and Force me in place

Is it just me?
Or does coffee taste like shit after it‚Äôs been microwaved?

I was told to thrive off the monsters I slay in me
That it‚Äôs not what it is. only what it could be
But I digress and get lost in the details
That‚Äôs why
Ive always loved writing poetry. 

It pours out of me like cum filling my gas station condoms
Lips still stained from the woman before
Hands slathered with the scent of it

Reaching for the bathroom soap dispenser to wash my hands clean of it
Click click empty

How many poets have guns loaded with ammunition from the bullets theyve been sweating 
Click. Click. Empty

Panic strikes the moment my body starts to believe the stories I tell myself
Fighting or flying my body is trying to tell me we‚Äôre dying and I‚Äôm starting to believe it

This sunlight deprivation is not optimal too. 
But I did not die. When I was supposed to

The great nurses and doctors off medical center blvd dripped life back into my veins. My sights locked on the silent scent of an expo marking off every symptom that‚Äôs been trying to take my poetry away from me. 

Is it just me?
Or does a cigarette taste different after an overdose?

Again and again I‚Äôll just relight it as it goes out. Now the taste is less than satisfactory but like a good addict I‚Äôll take what I can get. 
So little time. For all the little things. Left to microwave my coffee again.
Good things grow from painful places. 
Dandelions still growing through the cracks in the pavement. 

It‚Äôs Thursday. And The sun is setting on a June evening in the suburbs of middle Tennessee. 

I did not die when I was supposed to. 
And My parents don‚Äôt deserve to have to decide where they‚Äôre going to bury me

Tell my mother I‚Äôll be home in time for dinner.

I was trying to pass between two of their cars, but before that path there was a wall of snow that I had to step over. I didn't see the floor was slated and once I made it with both of my feet on the ground, I immediately fell on my back, hit my head, my left butt cheek that took most of the fall, scratched my hands on the floor and ankle and most of the coffee went to my legs and some on my face since I can see it on my glasses. 

It was the closest path I could find immediate to my wife and I should have been more careful, but the question is... shouldn't the store put last night salt all over their streets and lots before it snowed a bit? Not only customers can get hurt but their own employees picking up a car to show it off.

1i5sxt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1i5sxt3/trying_to_figure_out_what_im_reacting_to/,trying to figure out what I'm reacting to,"This is technically an intolerance but I thought this group may be more knowledgeable about what the trigger actually is.

Some general background: I've been tested for some food allergies (specifically gluten, dairy, and beef) that have all come back negative. However, for over 30 years, I have had issues with some foods. Two have worsened with time. I'm not sure if it's because I've become more sensitive due to age or because I avoid them.

In regards to beef, it's actually beef and game. Within 30 minutes of eating, I start vomiting and don't stop for about 12 hours. When I was 5-10, I just started avoiding it naturally. About age 10, I decided to go pescatarian. It was difficult to keep that up so I started eating chicken and turkey again a couple years later and by the time I was in college, I also added pork back in.

With milk, I realized quickly that I needed fat to digest milk properly. When I was young, I couldn't do skim but could do 1%. By the end of college, I could do whole milk but nothing less. Now it depends on what I'm having with it whether I can have coffee with whole milk or with half&half. With yogurt and cottage cheese, I need to have full fat, not low fat.

With both those intolerances, I've had some people think it was psychosomatic and try to sneak beef or venison or skim milk into things. It becomes obvious very quickly it's not in my head. I'm at the point where I can tell if someone has switched brands of brats or if a company has switched ingredients to beef casing rather than artificial or pork.

On to the current issue: peanut butter. In 2020, because of COVID, once I touched something in the grocery store, I'd feel awkward putting it back. I wanted a small portion of ice cream and grabbed some H√§agen-Dazs cookie dough ice cream. Except it was actually a mis-stocked peanut butter something or other. So I shrugged and bought it. Ate it, felt nauseous and eventually threw up. Didn't think much of it, maybe even wrote it off to the dairy thing. A month or so later, I ate a crustable. Same thing. Huh, weird.

The next year, I was at an outdoor family reunion potluck. Had some peanut butter cookies. Same thing. A family member mentioned that her DIL had issues with certain types of peanut butter but could eat natural PB.

So, I've now gotten comfortable with the fact that I can't eat ""processed"" PB but can do natural. I'm still fine with all nuts and other processed foods.

When I look at Jif, I can eat the natural but not regular. Literally the only difference in ingredients is: Fully Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (rapeseed And Soybean), Mono And Diglycerides in what I can't eat and Palm Oil in what I can.

But I eat and use rapeseed and soybeans in other food no problem. I had heard of people having issues with palm oil, but that's what I can eat. Mono and Di Glycerides seem like a weird thing to be intolerant to, and I know I eat and cook things where those are used or naturally occur.

So I'm stumped. Obviously, I know what to avoid, but I'd like to know what specifically I'm avoiding in case I start to have issues with other things. Any thoughts? TIA",1,1737387534.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False
1i5sxsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i5sxsj/dear_mister/,Dear Mister,"Dear Mister,

Can I make you laugh? Well, I‚Äôm certainly going to try. Here‚Äôs the thing: I love your brain, and if I could take a jog around it, I would. I imagine starting at the top of the stairs, in awe of this peculiar architecture of your beautiful mind, and slowly working my down through the corridors of thought, memory, and emotion. Sorry‚Äîdid I knock something over? Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll pick it up. Your brain is a masterpiece; I wouldn‚Äôt want to mess it up. And sorry‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean to pull your hair. Here's my comb. 

Your cerebrum‚Äîso vast, so commanding‚Äîfeels like the high-rise penthouse suite of your mind. It‚Äôs where I‚Äôd linger the longest, tracing the paths that hold the story of us. Would you let me? Or would you call security and have me escorted out? I promise I‚Äôm just here to look around, I won't touch, just maybe open a drawer or two. Please, hold onto those memories of me tightly, as I hold onto you. Even the embarrassing ones‚Äîespecially the embarrassing ones. I treasure them all.

Now, which way should I go first? Left or right? Decisions, decisions... (Your brain could at least provide a helpful sign or a ‚ÄúYou Are Here‚Äù map. Just saying.) I‚Äôll try to read it, but knowing me, I‚Äôd probably get lost‚Äîeven with a GPS!

Let‚Äôs start on the **right side**, where intuition and creativity reside. Here, I wonder: Can you see me clearly, the way I see you? Or am I just foggy, like a face in a dream you can‚Äôt quite remember? Do I linger like a song in your temporal lobe‚Äîthe kind that makes you smile‚Äîor am I the awkward elevator music you wish would stop? I hope I linger. In the best way. Like a warm hug... or good coffee. I‚Äôll be your espresso shot, keeping your cup full all day long.

Are we energized yet? *The bunny is asking.*

Then, I‚Äôd cross over to the **left side**, where reason and logic rule. And oh, Mister, it‚Äôs so serious in here. What have you done?! A bit too much... I think it needs another espresso shot with added energy! I imagine tiny calculators and flowcharts working overtime. Do you have a pros and cons list about me stashed somewhere? (If so, please burn it‚Äîunless I‚Äôm all pros, of course.) Do you measure every word I say, every moment we share, as if love could be neatly quantified? Because here‚Äôs the thing: love isn‚Äôt math‚Äîit‚Äôs more like improv. Messy, chaotic, and oddly beautiful. God knows math isn‚Äôt my strong suit, so for the life of me‚Äîjust no math, please! 

But love isn‚Äôt safe, is it? It‚Äôs messy and irrational, defying equations and rules. So maybe let your left side take a day off‚Äîgive it a break. Let the heart take over for a while. After all, isn‚Äôt that what vacations are for? Even your neurons deserve one. *Sigh.*

The secrets that make you *you*. Your thoughts, your dreams, your quirks‚ÄîI want to know them all. Even the weird ones. *Especially* the weird ones. I want to get lost in the labyrinth of you and never find my way out. Honestly, I‚Äôd set up camp in there if I could. Well... maybe a trailer, just to protect myself from the occasional mental storm. A sturdy little trailer, fully equipped to handle the unexpected chaos of your brilliant mind.

So here I am, standing at the tip of your mind, asking for a backstage pass. Will you let me in? Will you let me love you‚Äînot just the polished, logical parts, but the wild, unpredictable, beautiful mess that makes up the rest of you? Even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Especially if it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Mister did I make you laugh yet?

1i5stqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i5stqu/you_cant_fix_america_by_posting/,"You can't fix America by ""Posting""","The presidential inauguration is right around the corner. For many, this means the start of a difficult and maybe dangerous 4 years. It seems likely that all forward progress on social, financial and health issues will stop. And it will take all of our combined efforts to minimize the back sliding. Which brings me to my point, if you want things to change, you need to start participating. And most importantly:

**You can‚Äôt fix America by posting.**

Seriously, you cannot fix America by posting. Upvoting Luigi memes won‚Äôt fix the healthcare system. Retweeting snarky one liners won‚Äôt stop Trump from appointing his loyalists to federal courts. Complaining about how both sides are bad and democratic leadership are impotent morons won‚Äôt change the direction of the party. If you want things to be different, you need to get involved.¬†

But how?¬†

Fair question! We often assume that you are either a victim of politics or you are a career politician who used their families wealth to buy a senate seat and there is nothing between those two options. But that‚Äôs not true. I see three major ways you can start getting involved right now.

1. Instead of reading posts. Start reading books and/or informational blogs. Get educated on the specific subjects that are near and dear to your heart. And keep an open mind. That doesn‚Äôt mean you should accept that maybe nazis are okay. It means you should accept that social media flattens and simplifies problems and solutions into whatever will be the most vital and fit into a single paragraph. So if someone presents a more nuanced and complex solution to a large problem, hold back the initial flinch and keep reading. And be extra critical of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just‚Äù solutions. Complex problems have complex solutions, only salesmen offer simple solutions.
2. Instead of posting, start emailing the members of your local/state government. Figure out who represents you. Are you in a city? Are you sure you aren‚Äôt just next to the city but actually in an unincorporated county? Who is your state rep and senator? What leadership roles do they have? Email them, call them, ask to meet for coffee. Figure out when they are doing town halls. I was at a town hall recently and I was one of 3 people under the age of 40 in a packed room. If you don‚Äôt feel like your representatives are actually representing you, it‚Äôs probably because gen x, millennials and gen Z aren‚Äôt showing up and participating. ‚ÄúShould my reps do what‚Äôs best for me without me having to ask and pressure them?‚Äù Yes, but they don‚Äôt. So let‚Äôs play the game rather than just complaining about the rules. They are more accessible than you think. They are just dentists that work for the government two or three times per month.
   1. Also your govt has full time employees like planners engineers and city managers. Talk to them too. They work at the behest of the elected officials. So ask them ‚Äúwhat would it take to get bike lanes?‚Äù And they might tell you that we need to county commissioners to ask for explicitly and add budget for it. Great now you know who to talk to next.
3. Be nice. This part sucks. Because you probably want to show up to a meeting of your local party chapter and throttle them and yell and call them idiots. That will feel great but get you and your cause nowhere. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be serious and forceful and pressure your elected officials. But complaints and threats of recall and general vitriol, won‚Äôt get them to agree with you. Start talking to everyone you can and see what you can do to support the good ideas and downplay the bad ones. Standing outside the capital with a cardboard sign is far less effective than building relationships with the people inside the building. There is a time and place for protests but protests alone won‚Äôt make changes¬†
4. Find friends. Here is the one place where social media can be useful. It‚Äôs hard to do this work on your own. It‚Äôs long and tedious and it‚Äôs much more tolerable if you have help. Find a local group of advocates. There is none? start a local group. Put out the word on social media and say something like ‚Äúdo you want safer bike facilities in our city? Meet me on the first Friday of the month at this coffee shop and let‚Äôs talk about it.¬†
5. Direct action. The most direct way to make a change is to start doing it. Do wish there was someone on the planning commission that would support townhomes? Apply. Do you wish your city council would take certain issues more seriously? Run for office. Do you wish the Democratic Party would choose better leaders and issues? Go to meetings and run for leadership roles. Millennials don‚Äôt hold as much political power because we aren‚Äôt taking it. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt have time!‚Äù
6. You probably do have time. Yes. A lot of young people work a lot and have kids and don‚Äôt have a spare hour each month. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. That is not how most of us are. We aren‚Äôt broke kids anymore. We just arent willing to make the initial sacrifices to make time for political action. Some people reading this genuinely don‚Äôt have the time or energy to participate. If that‚Äôs you then you know who you are. But I‚Äôm willing to guess that most people that have the time and inclination to read an embarrassingly long and earnest post on Reddit, actually do have the time to attend a city council and give 3 minutes of public comment. And if you have the time to write a snarky reply about how you don‚Äôt have time, then you actually do have enough time to write an email to your state rep.

We can enact change but it takes work. But the more people that get involved and start pushing in the same direction the easier it will get. I can‚Äôt guarantee that the steps that I played out will get you the outcome you want but I can guarantee that posting won‚Äôt get you results. Many of us are old enough to have been adults during the last trump presidents. We probably remember for four years there was an avalanche of snarky tweets about trump and how dumb he is and how bad he is. Every SNL skit. Every stand up routine. Every meme. Every gotcha article and lie exploded on every social media platform. And in the end all it got us is a second term with trump. So save your breathe. Save your energy. Deny musk and Zuck the engagement. Take your energy off of social media and put it into building real world power.

1i5stk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1i5stk4/dating_with_ptsd_my_experience/,Dating with PTSD - my experience ,"
I was thinking that I wish there was a resource or something I could have read before I got back out there that could have prepared me for the psychological thriller that is dating for first time since the events that caused my PTSD.

This isn‚Äôt going to be that resource. It‚Äôs just one man‚Äôs journey, what‚Äôs worked, what hasn‚Äôt and what I‚Äôve learnt along the way. Most of this literally happens in my head. I really wish someone (a therapist, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, anyone) that my brain on PTSD would be unreliable.

So spoiler alert üö® in my experience all of the dating difficulties I face as someone living with PTSD stem from shame, wanting acceptance, fear of rejection, impaired thinking, seeking external ‚Äòlove‚Äô in place of self love and a complete inability to sit with my feelings. Funnily enough the feelings most difficult to sit usually follow positive experiences.

A bit about me for context, I am in my early 40s, male and l spent most of my adult life in one relationship although remained childless. I have been out of that relationship for almost 2 years now (it was the PTSD symptoms that ended up putting a lot of pressure on the relationship). I haven‚Äôt worked since the events that caused my PTSD but have been financially stable through insurance related to how the PTSD occurred, this is also how I have accessed treatment.

I was in a major city for the first period of dating and have spent the past 4 months dating regionally. I have done almost all my dating exclusively via dating apps (tindr, bumble, hinge).

For added context, the events that caused my PTSD occurred 6 years ago, I was diagnosed a year later but by that time I was heavily drug addicted and spent about 4 years in addiction so I couldn‚Äôt really get my symptoms treated until I was clean and sober. It‚Äôs been almost 2 years that I have had my PTSD symptoms treated. There might be some overlap with the comorbidity of PTSD and addiction and definitely feels like a lot of baggage to bring to a relationship.

Treatments I have had include 3 three week inpatient stays at my countries leading trauma based psychiatric hospital, group therapy, weekly therapy (recently moved to fortnightly) and monthly psychiatrist (recently moved quarterly). Medication that I‚Äôm currently on is Mirtazapine (helps me sleep and is meant to be anti anxiety/depression) and clonadine (is a blood pressure medication but can be used for PTSD and has really helped in reducing my physical reaction and the intensity of flashbacks). I was on another medication called Prazosin which literally stopped nightmares. I only have nightmares now when I‚Äôm triggered or stressed. 

Additionally I have ADHD and I use stimulant medication as prescribed.

For the past 2 years I have done a daily mindfulness program. This includes reading affirmations, praying, writing a gratitude list and meditation. Every evening I journal about my day and my feelings.

I thought I was ready to get back out there way before I was. At 6 months clean and sober, 7 months out of a relationship and 4 years of PTSD I got on tindr. At this point I wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing my diagnosis so from the drop there was no chance of me forming any sort of authentic connection. I got a decent amount of matches and was able to organize a handful of hookups. Regardless of how well (or badly) the hookups went they wreaked havoc on my mental health. 

Looking back at now it‚Äôs clear I was seeking was some sort of validation. This was probably my lowest point emotionally since becoming clean and sober. Although most of the women were cool and some of the experiences felt very validating in the moment it wasn‚Äôt the connection I actually yearned for. My PTSD symptoms got to an all time high around here, my nightmares got worse, flashbacks and anxiety were relentless and I became almost obsessed with getting more matches. Around this time my ex was hitting me up for hookups but even with a women I was very familiar with they were ultimately very detrimental to my mental health.

The validation I sought from the hookups was related to some internalized  insecurity in my masculinity. It was related to my inability to accept that I had PTSD and why I turned to drugs and alcohol. I couldn‚Äôt accept that I had been a victim as  my life experiences/influences had taught me that victims were women or men who couldn‚Äôt perform masculinity. Not being a victim had become part of my persona as a child as a way to deal with the neglect, abuse and abandonment I experienced from all my care givers. This translated into having terrible boundaries and taking in way to much as an adult, getting all my self esteem from status, achievements and eventually put me in the position to experience the events that left me with PTSD.

I am really grateful that I had regular therapy at this point as well as mates I trusted. With support I was able to realize I needed to work on myself because no woman from tindr would be able to fix me. I also read a couple of books by Bell Hooks which helped me understand some of the shame I was feeling.

Around 6 months after my initial foray into tindr I was getting ready for my 3rd inpatient stay at a psychiatric hospital which coincidentally coincided with my only experiences with (nearly) dating women I knew from real life. 

A woman I knew from recovery started calling me and wanted to meet up for coffee. We had a couple of chats over the phone but I didn‚Äôt make myself available to meet up with her and eventually ghosted her. At the time I just couldn‚Äôt think of a more constructive way to manage it. I do regret ghosting her as it was just a shitty way to manage it. I did run into her a few months later and apologized and told her my anxiety was just out of control which was essentially true. Looking back now tho, we had nothing in common and the only reason I even contemplated meeting with her was because I found her attractive and she seemed to like me. Again, it was validation seeking.

On either side of my psychiatric hospital stay I met women through mutual friends. Both showed interest and made the first step in contacting me and asking me on a date. I didn‚Äôt take either of them up on it and eventually ghosted. 

There was a lot of fear, avoidance and lack of self love involved in this. Both of these women knew my story in terms of PTSD and addiction so I was able to convince myself they must be a bit emotionally unstable to want to date me. When the part of me that craves connection, acceptance and intimacy would push me to get back to them I would catastrophize with imagined scenarios about a disastrous relationship that ultimately destroys all my friendships. Seriously, this is where my PTSD mind took me when all that had happened was a nice woman asked me if I would like to go to an art gallery with her and another if I would like to meet for coffee. I have regret about being too afraid to go on these dates and I genuinely did want to at the time but my anxiety and impaired thinking just wouldn‚Äôt allow it. I wish I had understood how low stakes first dates are (intellectually I did but PTSD).

The reality is that the later 2 never dates was it only ever came up once with my friends. My mate asked me if the woman who asked me for coffee had rang me. I replied no (she texted) and we never spoke about her again and our friendship carried on. With hindsight being what it is I can see I was driven by avoidance, fear, unworthiness and being a bit disconnected from reality in general. 

For the next few months I was on and off bumble. I would create an account (sometimes paid) and would spend hours crafting the perfect profile to attract the type of women I‚Äôm interested in which would be validated by the metric of likes, matches and messages received. I would then be overwhelmed with the imagined pressure to respond, maybe message with a couple of women then delete my profile only to run the same loop again in a few weeks. 

I only had 2 dates throughout this period and both were pretty disastrous. My loneliness and desperation for acceptance made everything seem incredibly high stakes. I was also incredibly insecure about how I had spent the past 5 years of my life and trying to show up and be authentic and genuine was impossible. Pre PTSD my career had been central to my identity and I carried a lot of shame about addiction and having PTSD.

I spent the next couple of months off the apps as I was planning on leaving the city I was in and I was doing a lot of intensive therapy. I focused on friendships and getting out of my comfort zone in safe and playful ways.

When I relocated 4 months ago I got on bumble straight away. There has been a pattern of when my life circumstances are uncertain and/or I‚Äôm dealing with triggering legal proceedings and/or dealing with adversarial insurance companies I hit the dating apps the hardest. This definitely hasn‚Äôt been healthy and is more evidence of my complete inability to sit with my feelings. 

In the past 4 months I have had a total of 9 dates with 6 women the first 7 happening in late October and early November. In this period I have learnt the most about myself, modern dating, how my PTSD affects me and some much needed boundaries. 

I was pretty pessimistic about my chances of getting matches with my preferences after moving to the country but was pleasantly surprised.

I had 4 first dates in quick succession. What I learnt was that was I cannot book multiple dates in the same week. If I have a bad first date on a Thursday afternoon and have another booked for Saturday morning, I‚Äôm gonna bring that same bad date energy to Saturday morning. I also felt somewhat disingenuous having multiple dates booked with different women. I realize it‚Äôs a reality of modern dating but for me to manage my PTSD symptoms I can only date one person at a time even if I‚Äôm talking to more on the apps.

The first woman I went on multiple dates with was really lovely. When I gave her a hug at the end of our first date I experienced butterflies in my stomach that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since the late 90s lol. It was unexpected, nice and hasn‚Äôt happened since.

I still wasn‚Äôt comfortable to share about my PTSD diagnosis or my addiction history. I framed my PTSD symptoms as burn out from my career and said I didn‚Äôt drink because it made my anxiety worse. It turns out when I‚Äôm being inauthentic it makes my anxiety worse.

With hindsight I would have canceled our 2nd date as I was completely triggered for it. That day I had received a summery of facts from my barrister and seeing the incidents that caused my PTSD in dot points felt incredibly reductive. I actually talked about it on my date and described some of the events which was so much more triggering for me. In my experience trying to avoid the whole story just makes what I share worse and more triggered. The woman I was dating was a real trooper tho, she worked as a medical specialist and I feel like she used her professional skills to save the date.

The 3rd date we played board and card games at her house. I genuinely believe she was screening me to make sure it was anxiety that had me acting weird and not an intellectual disability. At this point I really wanted to be upfront about my history but was in avoidance mode. She initiated intimacy which I initially went with but then freaked out, apologized and left.

I can‚Äôt say for sure what was going through my head in the moment. I had a realization on the way home that I want real intimacy where I feel known and I was the one withholding it. In effect my shame had me abandoning myself when all I wanted was acceptance but I wasn‚Äôt allowing my authentic self to be seen.

I drafted a couple of texts explaining that it didn‚Äôt feel right as I had withheld information etc but never sent. A couple of days later she sent me a message wishing me the best but she wasn‚Äôt feeling the spark. I felt sad but also incredibly relieved. I was shocked with how relieved I was. 

The following days I deleted my bumble account and ruminated on how amazing she was. Maybe she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet etc. I did some embarrassing stalkerish shit I would have never expected from me. I googled her, found her work and community organizations she was on the board of. One of the organizations was in a walking route I did with my dog‚Ä¶ I genuinely was already walking that way and continued to but I would day dream about running into her and explaining everything etc. 

I still feel embarrassed thinking about those dates and how I obsessed in days following. I am grateful for the experience as there were some really nice moments and I learnt I need to be authentic and vulnerable for a chance at the intimacy I want.

I had a psychiatrist appointment in December and he told me he wanted me to go on one date a month. I honestly can‚Äôt remember his rational but it seemed achievable so on 4 Jan I went live with my hinge account. I purposely chose hinge as I have anxiety around sending likes and receiving none back. Because of this anxiety and a tendency to be pathological I kept notes on my activity.

On the 4th of Jan I sent 2 likes with messages and got responses to both of them. 1 woman was 2 hours away and the other 1 hour. There was a lot I like about the woman who was an hour away, she had done a lot of work on herself and healing from past relationships, she was curious, passionate and used language that demonstrated emotional intelligence. She was also conventionally stunning, I remember thinking that she was probably out of my league. 

I asked her for a date on the 7th and we met halfway on the 10th. We walked and stopped for coffee and ended up spending around 4 hours together. Over the course of the date I told that I had been diagnosed with PTSD and shortly after the incidents that caused my PTSD I went into addiction. She was much more interested in what I was feeling emotionally at those times than what had happened and what I was doing. It felt like a really natural way to discuss it. She discussed her passions and some of her trauma and her journey to heal it. 

She initiated a hug when we rapped up and said a bunch of nice things and that she would like to do it again. I was on a real high.

On the drive home I got incredibly triggered. I started having flashbacks of trauma, the PTSD trauma as well as childhood trauma. I got into a really dark place thinking if anyone knew everything that had happened to me that would never be able to see me as a worthy partner, they would just pity me. I was in a real spiral. I wanted to call her and tell her all my darkest traumas‚Ä¶ at least I was able to see that thought for the madness it was.

I arrived home and she had sent me a really lovely message saying how much she had enjoyed the date and she would like to do it again. In my triggered state I did way too much. I have a general rule of text that I only use 2 emojis ever which are üòéüòÇ because I feel self conscious otherwise. I was using all the emojis and just couldn‚Äôt contain myself.

Emotionally I was going from elated thinking about the woman to complete despair thinking about how damaged I am. It was maybe the most triggered I had been in dating life since my hookups stage. 

We had one more date but I couldn‚Äôt tell my communication was concerning her. I could feel she wasn‚Äôt that into it when we next met up and we didn‚Äôt spend long together. I can imagine her position as well we have 1 pretty good date but I drop a lot of heavy stuff then she has this addict with a mental health diagnosis acting completely over the top trying to move to a relationship. 

She sent me a really long, kind and clear message explaining that where she was at in her personal journey of healing she had realized she couldn‚Äôt give herself to a relationship. I felt like I had definitely put to much pressure on her and I was honestly shocked with how easily I abandoned my curiosity to get to know her to just desperately wanting to be in a relationship with her. 

Again, I had a real deep sense of relief when I got her ‚Äòit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Äô message. I was disappointed but I had been really aware that I was doing too much. I had been unable to sit with a feeling whether positive or negative. There‚Äôs a concept called emotional sobriety where you are comfortable being present with all of your feelings without any one of them defining or controlling you.

I‚Äôm aware of emotional sobriety. I practice mindfulness daily. All of this goes out the window when I have a strong feeling tho.

I messaged her back to say that I understood and appreciated how clear and kind the message was. I also said just was grateful to have met her and thanked her for the space she held as it had been very easy to show up and be authentic and vulnerable. She did hit me back with a message along the lines of ‚Äòaw that‚Äôs so sweet‚Äô so I deleted the message thread from my phone as I could feel the rumination coming on.

I got triggered again when I saw she had unmatched me on hinge. I completely overhauled my profile to (what I imagine would) speak to a woman just like her. That was on the same day, I have since paused my account. No cyber stalking this time so some growth.

I think dating and what it brings up for clearly shows me where I‚Äôm at. Unfortunately where I‚Äôm at is not where I want to be at. I want to be more healed. I have to accept where I‚Äôm at tho. Acceptance will get me closer to healing.

I think I‚Äôm going to try my psychiatrists advice and go on a date a month. I need to be really aware that I am going to be triggered and that I will have to sit with my feelings if I am going to get the acceptance and intimacy I want. I  am worthy of love and self love is where it starts.

I realize this might be more of a manic rant than a useful resource. The inspiration for this manic rant was the idea if I had just know that these emotions were possible or likely I could have perhaps sat with them and not had them control me at every turn. 

I‚Äôm too tried to edit this atm but gonna post regardless as probably won‚Äôt when I‚Äôm rested.

Final thought, if this comes across as red pill or disrespectful to woman I will delete as its definitely not the intention.

Please be kind as this is my first international trip and I know NOTHING!! and thanks in advance <3

I am traveling to Italy with two of my friends from July 13 to 19. (I know, I know, peak tourist time. Unfortunately, this is the only time that would work for everyone's post-grad schedules, so keep me realistic here!) Due to our post-grad nature, we are traveling on a tighter budget but are saving money to be able to splurge in areas where it's necessary.

A little backstory: My two friends and I decided we wanted to do a big post-grad trip, and each chose a country to make an itinerary for. I chose Italy because I have some family ties and for all of the other obvious reasons! I think I would want to visit either two cities for three days each or have a ""home base"" and be able to do some day trips to other must-see cities (we have the train passes). 

I am looking for destination recommendations, and then I can do some heavy lifting in research for places to eat, visit, and relax (but if you have those recommendations I would love those too haha!)  


**This is what I am looking for in terms of a destination recommendation:**

\-Somewhere with history; walkable, explorable history 

\-Food, food, food; ideally some authentic spots, cheap spots, coffee spots a mix of everything  

\-I am a huge fan of a good view, somewhere scenic would be so nice, but not necessary

\-No car needed, we are relying on taxi, bus, and train .... and our feet! 

\-Places we'd be silly if we missed 

  
Some logistics about our trip:  
**Flying into Rome-** Although it would be cool, staying in Rome during this time of year looks intense and I may want to go a little more north (though everywhere will be very busy; I know this!) 

**Flying out of Pisa-** Preferably stay somewhere nearby the last night or two to make for an easy airport day. (Was thinking Livorno (?)) 

  
Some cities I've already looked into/would want to hear more about:

\-Cinque Terre 

\-Florence (Where I was originally planning on staying)

\-Livorno 

\-Pitigliano

\-Valdarno

I used to get so many genres, especially in the fantasy, superhero and sci fi genres but now those genres are practically as extinct as dinosaurs and its just pages upon pages of ""small town rp"", ""reality tv rp"", ""regular university"" or ""outer banks rp"" (I hate this one the most in particular cuz why tf does it need to be so many?? What the hell makes it so damn special that everyone is basically copying each other's outer banks rp???)

**Boring.**

**Lame.** 

**Unoriginal.** 

Basically the coffee shop meet cute au of discord rps. AI has more creativity and originality than that!

If I want to 'roleplay' any of those, I'd either enroll at an actual college, sign up for big brother or start a business instead of flooding the discord roleplay tag with such unoriginal and basic plots and settings. Heck, why the hell do you even want to roleplay any of those??? Those happen irl! There is no fantasy to it, whereas in magic or superhero settings, I can fantasize the scenarios and be creative.

And no I will not take ""why dont you make your own rp then"". I am busy working. I only have time to roleplay as a member, not run a roleplay group. 

And no I will not move to Tumblr or Jcink, especially fucking jcink. I should never have to learn to code just to fucking roleplay! That is so fucking unnecessary. Tumblr has its own issues but at least it's not as convoluted as fucking jcink.

Heck, thats what I hate most about this. Tumblr and jcink all have the genres I want yet my preferred platform can only offer me the most boring settings ever! Like so boring, a beige mom's house suddenly looks so creative.

So for fucks sake, I hope the discord roleplaying community will stop being so goddamn basic and unoriginal and make something interesting for once! ",1,1737386758.0,rant,0,0.67,False

I always had flowers and thoughtful gifts. we could talk for hours. it was perfect. 
we started dating the very first day of college. he was a part of a 5yr abroad program and I was aware of it. at the 4 year mark he would be leaving for 12 months to go to europe. we both agreed that we loved each other and would make it work. 
2 years into dating, he took a gap sem as his mother was dying after a very brutal fight with cancer. he has no other family aside from his mother and this hit him hard. as soon as she died he stopped talking abt marriage and kids, saying that he can‚Äôt picture a future without his mom. I was very concerned and tried to get him to see a therapist, but he refused and this drew a wedge between us. he became very depressed, but we still had good moments. the reluctance toward the future never went away. 
fast forward, he‚Äôs going to EU and I get a teaching fellowship to be with him. we aren‚Äôt in the same country but we are close. while he is away everything is fine. we have virtual dates, promises of a future, sign next years lease, etc. 
there was a girl a couple of months ago that I saw some pictures of that made me uncomfy. he told me he stopped talking to her. come to find out, on christmas day, he had been texting her the entire time. he said he was venting to her abt his mom and that he didn‚Äôt want to go to me bc I was very close with his mom and didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. I am heartbroken. I told him if he blocked her and got help, we could work thru it, so he did. 
the next day, I check his email looking for our train tickets and see emails with her. he tells her he loves her and that he hopes he can say a proper goodbye because she means so much to him. I booked an early flight back home. 
after a couple weeks of ‚Äúthinking about it‚Äù he told me he doesn‚Äôt want to try anymore in our relationship. we broke up last week, we are no contact, and he has unblocked her on everything.

I met her in February 2024. The day after I turned 30 years old.

She was 27yo asking for political signatures as her main job in the streets of the city. She was sweet and caring, dark humour and we vibed.

2 weeks into getting to know each other I spent time with her. She told me she had an abusive father who was completely ostracized from her family. She also told me her previous exe's were abusive. She told me they isolated her, raped her, made threats of suicide if she didn't come back. She told me about her exe's wanting to kill her in the streets of her home town. Told me she had to carry scissors in her jacket.

She told me she was epileptic since age 13 because of a drowning incident. She told me her best friend (a guy) committed suicide in 2020 and she is now carrying a medallion in his memory. (I saw the guy's picture inside the medallion and also checked his social media accounts).

As the first two weeks passed I felt like I met an angel, the person I had waited for my whole life. Traumatic childhood just like me, lost my father and I also have an incurable medical condition...a match made in heaven.

She told me she liked domination, I thought she seemed very confident about her sexuality. Turns out she was outright telling me what was going to happen to me in the coming months in an inverted subtle way...

She told me she wasn't going to be here for long, claimed she needed to go back to her home town to get a new job there. I was disappointed of course and gave her confirmation that I was now ""binded"" to her. (I didn't know she was manipulative at the time of course...)

A day after that statement she made, she wanted me to meet her male friend. I agreed since I'm not possessive and don't get overly jealous. As I shake the guy's hand in the pub we sit down and my ""girlfriend"" goes to the bar to order beers. I politely asked the guy friend what was my the nature of their relationship. The guy tells me ""it's for pleasure"" And boom, just like that she tried to ""use"" me or coerce me into having an unconsenting threesome. By using triangulation, cunning two people against each other, male competitiveness and so on she loved to see me anguish that night.

I know I should have walked away and never talk to her again. But boredom of my life, might as well get to experience something and perhaps help this epileptic girl? Why would she spend her time to get to know me for two weeks straight?

I stayed in the relationship for a total of four months.

She was a parasite, asking for money, favors, meals. She had two cellphones. She told me about cults late at night while I smoked weed and she didn't. I had been off from weed prior of meeting her. She reintroduced weed into my life because she claimed it would help her prepare for sodomy (something I didn't ask to do in the first place...)

Late at night, while I thought she was being thoughtful and while I was on weed, I heard phrases like:
""tell me one good thing about your mother or father""

""Your father who left you when you were four, do you think he loved you for abandoning you? Why are you still keeping in touch with him?""

""I really feel sorry for you, it looks like your family didn't give you enough love""

Fellow readers, if you had to ask these questions to your partner directly, what would be the intention or purpose?

Isolation in progress, while she took advantage of my trust. I gradually stopped talking to my friends and family. I was also too damn busy fixing her curriculum and dealing with her horrible job and medical condition.

One day I had an eye infection and went to the ophthalmologist, there my eyes were spread open and held firmly tools. She was in the room because she wanted come along and support. When we got home she told me about a movie we should watch. She said it had a ""scene"" in it that I would like very much.

Turned out the ""scene"" is a woman who goes to the ophthalmologist and gets her eyes openned by claws (very similar to what I experienced 2hrs before..) The lady gets her eyes burned by laser as she is unable to close her eyes. She dies horribly falling from the building, from the shock of impact, her burned eye rolled out on the road and ends up smashed by a car passing by. I paused the movie and saw that she was smiling. A smirk of satisfaction. I asked her: ""why are you showing me this?"" Her answer: ""I don't know üòã""

Scene: https://youtu.be/oJGlE1S99tw?si=POXCuPjthk1okcfS

She burned a dog who was resting between chairs on a terrace. She spilled the coffee on top of the dog as she was passing over him. I didn't know it was sadism at the time and the dog owners believed it was an accident. I know she saw the dog there and greeted him as she was about to order coffee. She saw that dog but yet was able to fucking trip over him and spilling hot coffee.

She flirted very subtly with men while humiliating me when I wanted to get physically romantic with her in public.

She introduced me her boss very early on into the relationship. I did tell her that it's not a very ethical thing to do but she didn't seem to care. So one day she asked me to go get her paycheck directly from the boss hands and I did it. Her boss was a witness of my devotion for her throughout the 4 months of this insane relationship.

She had a family of two sisters and a mother. The family was calling her frequently to see how she was doing... Or maybe to check if I was still breathing lol. I thought if the family is still supporting her then it's not hopeless.

But then one day she went too far at a bar and started to flirt way too much with a guy. She made sure her sentence mentioned her ""ass"" so that all the drunk guys would turn their heads. As one of them whispered something in her ear I knew the relationship was no longer sustainable.

I called her sister the day of the breakup and explained the behaviors I saw and the things that she does. The sister called me insane and mental. She hung up on me. We broke up, she stalked me for a month by gravitating close to my apartment. She made sure id see her flirting with other men as I'd walk by.

Then I typed ""narcissist"" on Google out of frustration. (She called her exe's narcissists) And to my shocking discovery I notice that narcissism is filled with images of a white ""mask"". A mask that I see is included my partners profile picture. All her social media has a picture of her with a mime in a costume wearing a white mask. She stands next to him making the heart shape with her hands.

Turns out my whole relationship is based on a strategy, lies, deceit, profit, emtional rape, psychological torture and sadism.

Her very first words when I met her ""I checked your Instagram to make sure you weren't a psychopath""

I realized that the medallion she was carrying was someone that she had pushed to suicide. I realized that all she told about her exe's and what they did to her had happened to me. I realized that she was a sadist and that she used love as a weapon to make me fall hard so she could better abuse me.

Upon realizing that my girlfriend is a nymphomaniac sadist who could potentially give me HIV I panicked. The humiliation was so strong. I felt like jumping out of my apartment just to end the suffering.

I spent a full week not sleeping nor eating. I left messages late at night to her boss who was probably witnessing weird shit from her as well. I knew it was immoral to do such a thing. I ended up calling the boss as I had been driven by ambulance to the hospital for suicide attempt.

I told him everything on the phone. He told me I was the confirmation he needed. He explained to me that she was tyrannizing the whole team, humiliating them, belittling them, flirting with men, lying to create chaos between coworkers, making highly inappropriate sexual suggestions or innuendos. He told me she had sex with a coworker of mine.

She filed a complaint against me for calumny and death threats as I mentioned to her boss my will to kill her. No wonder all her exe's wanted to kill her.

Her boss fired her about two weeks after we broke up. She was still stalking me at the time. Our last conversation at a caf√© near my apartment, she slapped my face and and threw water in my face in public as I was asking for an explanation for her mad ways...

She blocked me and disappeared never to be seen again. Her boss saw her a month later dragging a new insecure guy, likely her next victim, vulnerable people.

Obviously she just jumps from men to men while abusing them altogether.

Moral of the story I dated an antisocial personality disorder individual. Her psychopathy was so high on the spectrum that she needed domination and sadism in order to feel good about herself. She cannot attach to any living thing. She will hurt anyone, even her family or the family's dogs.

It is extremely scary to come across such an individual. It made me grow up but I feel like I've been given a glimpse of what should never be seen. Her torture movies, the lip sewing while the lady screamed. The sadistic pleasure of seeing someone in pain. The proudness of having killed someone and wearing a medallion as a trophy. Knowing that she's a dead man's trap.

She doesn't feel remorse for what she did to me or other living beings before me. I do feel remorse for contributing into her getting fired. I feel like I had no choice, I believe she wanted to deceive me and hurt me so fucking hard I'd kill myself. Like in ww1 germans used gas, so what did the french end up doing? retaliating with gas. I became like that but I had no choice. She wanted confrontation because it makes her feel good. A very sad wasted life.",0,1737386117.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,0.5,False
1i5sdjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1i5sdjx/i_m18_am_starting_to_reconsider_my_relationship/,I (M18) am starting to reconsider my relationship with my GF (F18) due to money and certain statements she repeats. ,"So me and my GF have been dating for 2 years now, and are currently in the same University (but not colleges). 

Over the past couple of months, I've been going through a rough patch, partly due to the college environment and how I don't fit in. I thought I would have my GF to lean on during these times, but it doesn't seem to be working that way. 

While we had some differences before, it feels like college has turned the dial up. Jealousy, money matters and other such things constantly make me resent her. 

Firstly, any time we meet, she checks my phone, in a semi-joking manner. Any time a girl from college texts me for whatever reason, she flares up for a short while. Any conversation about my day in college, which involves contact with a girl gets flagged by her. I get it, I'm in a co-ed, while she's in an all girls, so there's bound to be jealousy, especially as teenagers, but I already am struggling in college, and having her flag any girl who happens to make conversation for whatever reason with me as a threat doesn't help. She's always been a bit like this, while I'm not really the jealous kind.

  
Secondly, I'm a bit tired of the differences between us. I'm from a middle class family that manages to cover its expenses for the most part. I know I can't afford to spend exorbitantly, and that my hobbies deserve more money than casual outings. I get a certain amount of money for commute and going out, and my parents cover most other expenses and give me extra, but I don't take advantage of that, and save as much as I can every month. 

She on the other hand, goes out to fancy restaurants and events like concerts and comedy shows with her friends. Her parents are better off, with strong investments and earnings, so she doesn't have as much to worry about. She gets a good amount of money even if she exhausts her budget and then somehow manages to exhaust the extra as well. I try and get her to realize that student life is about saving more, but she's of the opinion that I don't live enough. I get it, she doesn't have as many financial worries as I have, but then it gets dicey when she comes over to my place for a lunch, and starts ordering stuff from swiggy that costs wayyy too much (I know brownies are good, but for now, they're not 650 for 6 typa good). She also often passes remarks, which sorta weird me out? 

We've agreed to dig in for the long run, and she often talks about how great of a provider her dad is, and how I have to match up with him. How I should be like him, when he sends her money after she's exhausted her budget. Just fucks with my mind. 

Not just that, but we have major lifestyle differences. I'm someone who hikes, walks, runs, cycles. I keep myself in shape. I'm not a fitness freak. I love eating out and I don't shy away from a third cup of coffee for the day. But I try and stay active. She on the other hand, never makes an effort to get into these things, and it reflects in her health. Multiple doctors have told her to switch to a healthier lifestyle and exercise, to no avail. I've never directly told her this, but its reaching the point of being unattractive. Not purely physically, but the idea of being with someone who doesn't ever want to go for a walk instead of going to a restaurant scares me. 

Thirdly, I wasn't the best student in school. She was nice enough to help me and I was grateful for it. At the end despite repeated setbacks in school, I cracked an entrance exam and got to one of the best colleges in the country. I appreciate the help I had from her, but she rubs it in my face, weekly, how I got there because of her, how I was a failure at school, how I wouldn't be where I am without her. 

I know it sounds like I should've seen this coming way back, not 2.5 years into the relationship, and honestly I'm starting to think I was just dumb and ignored these remarks for so long. I'm not a great person. I have my flaws. I am at a low point in life despite the successes I've had (you can read my previous post to see the state of mind I'm in). But I'm someone who thinks twice about everything before saying it, so no one is hurt. I have few friends, but I know their financial limits and I always ensure that if I'm inviting them somewhere, it is not out of their budget. 

I don't even remember if she was always like this or if she changed after college. I love this girl, but I just am at a point in life where I need someone who understands me, doesn't add to my troubles. I make sure to keep in mind her work and her problems, but I feel like she's not considerate about mine. I don't even know what to do at this point. 

I will have this conversation with her, like I have before, and I will try and work on things, but if they don't work, I don't know how I'll figure things out. I've introduced her to my mum, my friends and she's a big part of my life.

I tried normal to-do lists, but they‚Äôd quickly get lost under a mountain of other tasks or I'd forget about them.

So I hacked together a tool that turns quick voice notes into organised tasks and tags. It started as a personal sanity-saver, but my friends and family jumped in too and said it was worth paying for.

I call it mmbl (mumble) ‚Äîbasically, it transcribes your ramblings, auto-detects tasks and notes, adds tags, and syncs them to your calendar.

My brother uses it to rattle off his daily to-dos while making coffee, and by the time he‚Äôs done, his day is fully mapped out. Another friend uses it to generate tweets from their ramblings.

I also started using it to whip up content like tweets and blog posts by using it to draft something based on my notes‚Äîit‚Äôs surprisingly good at saving me from blank-page syndrome. And if I need to find that random idea from last month, I can just search in natural language instead of scrolling through endless lists.

If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs the link: [https://mmbl.io](https://mmbl.io?utm_source)

Would love any thoughts or feedback. It‚Äôs still rough around the edges, but it‚Äôs already making life easier for me (and apparently a few others). It's free to try so give it a shot, there's a one-time fee too for unlimited usage.

If anyone likes it and wants to subscribe to premium - here's a discount code for 20% off your first month: `K1NDK3O -` it's totally free to try too.

I posted it on r/sideproject and had some really nice feedback from people saying how useful it is which is great to see and I've been able to make improvements pretty quickly from that which is great.

Features currently in the works:  
\- Sorting tasks by duration, due date and more

\- Heat maps to show you how you spend your time with the app over time

\- Ability to edit tasks

\- Improvements to the asking / creating to utilise more context about your notes.

\- Considering an iOS app 

Let me know what you think - I'd love to make this as best as it can be so very open to feedback! You can give me it here or there's an inbuilt way in the app via the burger menu!

Im not against putting a lot of effort into courting a woman at all, but I find it super weird/disingenuous to put that much effort into a girl I've only exchanged a few messages with. Like I don't even know who you are, let alone whether I like you.

Historically I just keep first dates simple - coffee, drinks, a walk, food in a casual setting, whatever allows for us to just focus on getting to know each other with low pressure. I usually do fine with that, but I have had some girls complain about the first date not being a real date as well.

The only thing people want to see is you being a present mother, and by that, I don‚Äôt mean that we want to see Preston all over your Instagram and to be reminded everyday that you‚Äôre ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with him. She should take a page out of Allie Hunter‚Äôs book and continue her Amazon shilling (if she wants to) but STOP posting about her life. That‚Äôs where she gets the most hate. And you can tell it‚Äôs all starting to eat at her. I think back before Preston when she continuously posted ‚Äúwhat do you want to see from me‚Äù and the consensus was ‚Äúeveryday stuff‚Äù she thrived on going to appointments and showing her bopping around time getting coffee, hair done, nails done, lunch with friends, etc. I think she was convinced that THAT is why people follow her and what they want to see. So much so that she decided she needed a nanny so she could continue to bop around and ‚Äúgive the people what they want‚Äù. However I followed her because I genuinely liked seeing her ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù stuff. We always seemed to be in the same season of life: engaged, planning the wedding, bachelorette, wedding, honeymoon, pregnant, mom life. I assumed that ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù stuff would naturally transition into everyday mom stuff. But she stuck with the everyday pre Preston stuff. That‚Äôs not what people want to see and most people cannot relate to that. I‚Äôm a full time stay at home mom and my husband and son have a ‚Äúboys day‚Äù on Saturdays so I can get stuff done, which includes errands, nails every other week, hair every other month, and whatever other stuff I need to get done for self care of personal maintenance. The difference between Janelle and I is that I don‚Äôt make those appointments my entire personality. I am home 99% of the time so I really don‚Äôt even need to be getting my hair and nails done, but my husband encourages me to get out of the house and do things that feel normal to me and help me feel more like myself. Pre baby the most important things to me were my relationship with my husband (obviously) and my appearance. I can definitely admit I was shallow and selfish but becoming a mother has changed me SO much. My priorities have changed and the most important things to me are my husband (still), my baby, our health, and our happiness. Nothing else even comes close. Sadly it is very obvious that Janelle‚Äôs priorities have never been reshuffled. For her mental health and the future of her family, I genuinely think she needs to rethink her presence on instagram.

[Glass](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) is a versatile material, offering endless possibilities for creating stunning interiors. However, it requires careful handling and thoughtful placement to make the most of its beauty and functionality. This article explores the dos and don‚Äôts of decorating with glass accessories, backed by stats, facts, and expert advice.

https://preview.redd.it/885klya8y5ee1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb9d2fdf3070626bb65fbe4f104dd92ce6b11c1f

**The Appeal of Glass in Home Decor**

Glass accessories bring a unique sense of openness, light, and luxury to any living space. Its transparency and reflectivity can transform even the smallest rooms, making them feel larger and more airy. A 2023 survey conducted by the Home Decor Association found that 65% of homeowners believe that glass elements enhance natural light, creating the illusion of spaciousness. This makes glass a popular choice among interior designers, as it not only brightens up areas but also adds a touch of sophistication to both modern and traditional aesthetics.

**Dos of Decorating with Glass Accessories**

**1. Incorporate Glass to Amplify Light**

Glass accessories, such as mirrors, vases, and pendant lights, have the ability to reflect both natural and artificial light. Strategically placing glass mirrors in key locations can help bounce sunlight into darker corners, while soft glass lighting fixtures can create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Studies have shown that homes with adequate lighting‚Äîachieved through glass elements‚Äîhave a 20% higher resale value, underlining the importance of proper lighting in home decor.

**2. Choose High-Quality Glass**

Investing in high-quality glass accessories can significantly extend their lifespan and maintain their pristine appearance. Cheaper glass options are often prone to scratches and breakage. By opting for tempered glass‚Äîmade four to five times stronger than regular glass‚Äîyou ensure durability and safety. Tempered glass is also less likely to shatter upon impact, making it a safer choice for homes with children or pets.

**3. Layer with Other Materials**

Glass pairs beautifully with a variety of other materials, like wood, metal, and stone, adding depth and texture to your decor. For instance, a glass coffee table with a wooden base blends modern and rustic aesthetics seamlessly. Layering different materials helps create a visually interesting and tactile space, offering more complexity to the overall look of your room.

**4. Use Glass in Functional Decor**

Glass can serve functional purposes as well as decorative ones. Items such as glass jars, organizers, and shelves combine both style and practicality. For example, using glass jars for kitchen pantry storage allows you to organize food items while keeping them visible. This functionality makes glass not just an ornamental piece, but an essential part of everyday living spaces.

**5. Experiment with Colored Glass**

While clear glass has timeless appeal, colored glass accessories can add vibrancy and personality to your decor. Stained or tinted glass items, such as vases or bowls, create visual interest and can serve as statement pieces in a room. A well-placed colored glass lamp, for example, can act as a focal point and spark conversations in your living space.

**Don‚Äôts of Decorating with Glass Accessories**

**1. Avoid Overcrowding with Glass Items**

While glass accessories enhance elegance, too many in one space can lead to a visually overwhelming and reflective environment. Excessive glass decor‚Äîlike using too many vases or mirrors‚Äîcan create a cluttered look that feels chaotic rather than stylish. According to design experts, limiting glass to 20-30% of a room‚Äôs decorative elements helps maintain a balanced and harmonious appearance.

**2. Don‚Äôt Forget About Maintenance**

Glass surfaces require regular cleaning to keep their sparkle intact. Dust and fingerprints can quickly dull glass accessories, especially in high-traffic areas like living rooms or dining spaces. To ensure your glass items remain pristine, use streak-free cleaning products designed for glass surfaces to keep them looking flawless.

**3. Steer Clear of Fragile Pieces in High-Traffic Areas**

Fragile glass items, such as delicate sculptures or thin vases, are best avoided in areas with frequent activity, such as hallways or family rooms. High-traffic zones pose a significant risk of accidental breakage‚Äîespecially if children or pets are present. Instead, reserve these pieces for more protected display areas, like glass shelves or display cabinets.

**4. Avoid Ignoring Safety Precautions**

Safety should be a top priority when incorporating glass into your home decor. Sharp edges and unstable placements can lead to accidents, such as cuts or falls. Always ensure that glass furniture and accessories are securely placed and, if necessary, use edge protectors to minimize the risk of injury.

**5. Don‚Äôt Neglect the Surrounding Decor**

Glass accessories should complement the overall theme and design of your space rather than clash with it. For example, placing a sleek glass centerpiece in a room that is predominantly rustic might feel out of place. Aim to create harmony by choosing glass pieces that enhance, rather than compete with, the existing decor.

**Creative Ideas for Decorating with Glass**

**1. Glass Terrariums**

Glass terrariums are a beautiful way to bring nature indoors. These clear containers can be filled with succulents, moss, or miniature fairy gardens to add greenery to any space. According to a 2022 report by the Urban Gardening Association, homes with indoor plants in decorative containers are perceived to have a 38% higher overall room quality. Terrariums provide a low-maintenance way to enjoy nature's beauty inside your home.

**2. Statement Lighting**

Chandeliers and pendant lights made from glass can serve as stunning focal points in living rooms or dining areas. Whether featuring intricate glasswork or sleek, modern designs, glass lighting fixtures add a touch of glamour and sophistication to any room. These statement pieces create visual drama and draw attention upward, enhancing the overall elegance of your space.

**3. Glass Wall Art**

Decorative glass panels or etched glass pieces offer a unique and artistic element to your home decor. Abstract glass designs, etched patterns, or stained glass windows can transform plain walls into captivating visual displays. These pieces not only add texture and dimension to your walls but also act as conversation starters.

**4. Glass Dividers**

Glass dividers are ideal for open floor plans, as they provide separation without making the space feel confined. Frosted or textured glass dividers can offer privacy while still allowing light to flow between areas. This subtle touch can create defined spaces without compromising the open feel of your home.

**Interesting Facts About Glass Decor**

* **Historical Significance**: Glassmaking has a rich history, dating back to around 1500 BCE in ancient Mesopotamia. Over time, it has evolved from a basic material to an art form used in home decor worldwide.
* **Environmental Impact**: Glass is highly sustainable‚Äîit‚Äôs 100% recyclable. By using recycled glass, homeowners can contribute to a greener, eco-friendly lifestyle without sacrificing beauty.
* **Market Trends**: The global glass decor market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2023 to 2030, demonstrating the ongoing popularity of glass in interior design.

1i5rzea,https://www.reddit.com/r/JunesJourney/comments/1i5rzea/clubs_10_lessons_learned_from_a_newbie_to_newbies/,Clubs - 10 Lessons Learned from a Newbie to Newbies,"I'm been playing JJ for around 60 days and this is intended for newbies regarding clubs. I'd highly recommend playing JJ solo for around 30 days to ""get the lay of the land"" and then join a club that's right for you and the club. As a newbie, energy is your most precious commodity and with the right club you can achieve an endless flow and never have to ""play and wait"" again.

1. Shop for a club but don't do it within JJ. Go to the recruitment thread here on Reddit or FB and PM the president to discuss. If you find a large club where all members commit to a specific meeting time/coffee hour and always offer up an energy drink, your energy worries will be a thing of the past.

2. Never ""ghost"" your club. Attend coffee hour regularly and be prompt.  Life gets in the way but just message the group if you can't attend.  If the club is no longer a good match for you hit ""leave"".  Don't wait to get the boot for non participation.

3. For newbies, a club that's easy going/low pressure on club competitions will probably be best. (ie  do all you can, when you can).

4. At first I was apprehensive entering club competitions fearing I'd ""fumble the ball"" and screw up the outcome.  That doesn't happen. Everything you do helps the team and even mediocre scores can increase the standings resulting in higher rewards for the overall team.

5. Don't enter a competition unless you can give it all you got.  Entering just for one play so you get a team reward is pretty poor ""sportsmanship"".

6. Don't fritter away diamonds.  Now that energy is not a concern you'll need all your diamonds to buy daily energy drinks. That will require 56 diamonds per week.  Save them for buying drinks and don't spend them on other silly things thru out the game. If you need more, a full vault at $2.99 is not a bad deal.  Buy the vault on the last day because they sweeten the pot by adding more rewards to it.

7. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I wish I hadn't bought the energy boost package that cost for 799 precious diamonds.

8. Use your coffee hour tips to buy energy sharing upgrades.  You'll help your teammates if you can gradually get your energy drink level to 15. 

9. Bushes can yield diamonds.  If you get a bush, always return a bush to the sender at equal or greater value. Let JJ place the bush on your teammates island.  Don't move it for them or they might not find it.  Don't use diamonds to buy bushes.  That would be very poor ROI. Whenever a bush appears on my island I leave it there to remind me to reciprocate to the sender and I don't dig it up until the return is complete.

10. Have fun. Having club team mates scattered across the planet is pretty cool IMHO.

1i5rymx,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i5rymx/jura_impressa_xs9_help/,Jura Impressa XS9 help,"Hi,

I've taken on the quest to try to fix a faulty coffee machine
..! Without no former experience, that is.

So I've more or less disassembled the covering parts of the machine. Checked the brewing module and cleaned it.

The issue now is that when trying to brew an ordinary coffee, the backvalve starts sprinkling water on the back of the machine.

I see a lot of bubbles in the transparent hoses on the back of the machine.

Making a cup of hot water takes a lot of time but works.

Making an espresso just ends up with nothing coming out on the front, instead  brown water flows out of the lower part (some kind of relief route?) of the brewing module (just left to the water intake on the bottom part of the brewing module) and ending up in the bottom of the tray.

Anyone that can give any advice on how to proceed or fix?

Edit: when making espresso, also some water is sprinkled on back side from relief valve, not as much as on ordinary coffee/americano though.",1,1737385018.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

A few weeks ago, I launched [tezy.in](https://tezy.in/), a simple, no-frills tool to make job hunting a little less painful. The initial response was slow, but after sharing it with the right people (like this community), it finally picked up!

Fast forward to today:  
üìà **700+ active users in 30 days**  
üíå DMs from users saying they found relevant job posts that actually helped them land referrals.  
üè¢ Referrals already going for companies like HashedIn and American Express.

**What I‚Äôve Learned So Far:**

1. **Communities are everything.** Sharing the project on Reddit and listening to feedback completely changed the game.
2. **Iterate fast.** Every piece of feedback I got made the tool better. The search bar, pagination, and regional filters? All added because someone suggested it.
3. **Stay true to the mission.** No ads, no signups, no fluff ‚Äì just a tool to help people.

**What‚Äôs New:**  
I recently added a **‚ÄúBuy Me a Chai‚Äù** button (because chai > coffee any day ü´∂). This is still a completely self-funded side project, so every cup of chai helps me keep it running.

üíª Check it out: [tezy.in](https://tezy.in/)

If you‚Äôre building something of your own, my advice is simple:

* Put it out there, even if it‚Äôs not perfect.
* Listen to feedback and iterate like your life depends on it.
* And most importantly, keep the love for your project alive ‚Äì people will feel that passion.

To the side project warriors here: I‚Äôd love your feedback, tips, or just a chai-related joke. Let‚Äôs keep building cool stuff together.

**Stay awesome,  stay chai-powered.**  
Cheers üôå

 We have that scratching post and a little coffee house for them to scratch. We are going to invest in a cat tree but Im not so sure that will fix the issue! Also every time he scratches the bed for long enough, lynx will show up and start licking him/play fighting him and he stops.

When we do these, the sauces are compared side-by-side as applied to actual food (which is typically both fried chicken and pizza), lined up in order according to the closest group consensus on which sauce was most satisfying (heat, quality, deliciousness, etc.), and then grouped loosely into tiers. 

Note: the food piece is important. Some of these sauces would rank differently if just tested on the spoon.  

Of those tested this round, we decided that the best of the best were Karma's Funken Hot, Burns & McCoy's Exhorresco, Queen Majesty's Red Habanero & Black Coffee, and Hot N Saucy's Black Garlic N Peri Peri.

**Part 6: The Slithy Toves**

I wake up a few minutes before my alarm goes off at 2am, and I feel alert. Nowhere near as groggy as yesterday. And I feel like I could eat. So I head downstairs with my bike, eat a proper ‚Äúbreakfast,‚Äù then hit the road.

It is dark, and a bit cold, maybe 12C. There are still lots of riders on the road, though not like it was last night, and there are people asleep in ditches everywhere. Including in some questionable places, like with their heads less than a foot away from the edge of the road. 

My recollections here are few and far between like every other time I‚Äôve ridden in the dark. 

I remember looking up at the stars at one point.

5am comes along and it is noticeably colder, especially in the valleys between hills where the fog is collecting. I‚Äôm uncomfortably cool for the first time and have to do-up my jersey and vest zippers, and would almost prefer something on my arms. As the sky starts to turn grey on the horizon the fog deepens, and I can barely see twenty feet in front of me. Glasses mist over. Red lights rise ahead, front lights fade behind. Just the sounds of my breathing, drivetrain purring. 

Then it‚Äôs Tinteniac at the grey-part of dawn, where I get a bowl-full of coffee, soup, and hamburger steak and potatoes. Apparently the perfect thing for breakfast. Stomach is less angry at me today in general and is tolerating maltodextrin-drinks again. I can tell I‚Äôve been on the bike too much these past two days because I struggle to walk when I‚Äôm off the bike now. Not due to pain or stiffness, but due to balance, like with sea-legs. I‚Äôm liable to fall over if I‚Äôm not careful, and have to hold onto the railing to not suddenly sway while standing. Even doing that I lose my balance once or twice while in line.

I‚Äôm cold now from not biking but warm up quickly once I start pedalling again. The sun is on my side of the horizon now and the fog starts to break. No time for pictures, I‚Äôm in a flow state (or delirious) and all that exists in my world is riding. Shortly after leaving Tinteniac I notice a French rider from the wave after me and we‚Äôre riding at similar speeds, so we continue together. A couple other riders briefly hang with us, but they all seem tired and can‚Äôt keep up for long.

Left Achilles‚Äô starts to hurt though. 

Like problem hurt. 

It‚Äôs worse with standing, harder efforts, and pedaling while on the aerobars, so I deliberately slow down and have to leave my French friend. End up in Fougeres and it‚Äôs late morning and sunny. Time off the bike and a Tylenol make my Achilles feel normal, and I start riding again. Soon I‚Äôve run into French dude and we‚Äôre back riding together‚Ä¶ but nope, Achilles comes back with a vengeance. I slow down and he slows down too ‚Äì no don‚Äôt do that! 

‚ÄúVous allez! Je ne pas rapide! (Gesture at ankle).‚Äù 

He understands and is concerned whether I‚Äôll be ok. 

‚ÄúI will be ok. It‚Äôs only 300km. Allez, Allez!‚Äù and laugh and wave him forwards, so he smiles and goes on his way. 

In my mind I can get through 300km of anything, but my Achilles has other ideas. 

I‚Äôve never had problems with it before, but it is loudly proclaiming dissatisfaction with this situation. I start to wonder whether I‚Äôm simply causing pain versus actual damage. And how much damage I‚Äôm willing to do to myself to finish this thing. Start reflecting on the natural history of Achilles tendon injuries and in a worst case scenario how I‚Äôd feel about having to seek medical care for a tear while in France. Consider whether stuffing some leaves or something under my heel might help. Or maybe I can splint the ankle in plantar-flexion with some sticks and zip-ties.

Pain is worsening and is so much worse with climbing. Unfortunately there are still endless hills. 

Unbearable. 

Thinking more about it, I think some of the toe flexors span the ankle joint too, so maybe if I flex my toes when I pedal that will help. It actually does, but only for maybe 15 minutes. Now it‚Äôs even worse. 

Do I need to just quit at this point? 

I still have over 24-hours in hand, and maybe 250k to go, so I could always stop early, take the rest of the day and night off completely, then ride the last bits tomorrow. 

But I‚Äôd promised my kids that I would be back by Thursday.

‚Ä¶I still need to get to the control at Villaines at least though. I guess I can limp there at like 10kph. But now I can‚Äôt pedal at all with the left leg, it hurts too much. So I spend the better part of an hour with my left leg unclipped, pedaling only with my right leg.

As this is going on my shifting has been deteriorating. It still works, but the front derailleur is sad and sometimes takes 5 minutes to change gears. And the rear derailleur drops the chain a bit while shifting sometimes.

Then while climbing a hill at like 7kph there is a loud clunk and I physically can‚Äôt pedal forwards. I unclip rapidly and manage to avoid falling over. The chain has dropped completely so I put it back on and get back on the bike. 

I try to pedal but now my jersey has somehow gotten stuck on my saddle, so I have to stop again and unhook it. 

I get on yet again, and there is another loud clunk and I can‚Äôt pedal at all.

This is a sign. 

I should take a rest for a minute and just think and focus. I am so far down into my own mind I am being stupid and not paying attention. 

Looking at my chainring I finally realize what‚Äôs happened. The chain has somehow ended up on both chain rings at the same time ‚Äì it starts on the big one, then does a ‚Äúzed‚Äù going back on itself for one link, then starts on the little chain. That‚Äôs fucking weird. Try and pull it off but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stuck really good like this. Try with two hands but it‚Äôs still not working. 

Stare at it for a few seconds, then decide to use the old hack of just kicking the stupid fucking thing, and it gets unstuck. 

The shifting is‚Ä¶ even somewhat worse after this, but still not a huge issue.  Take a minute to collect myself. I just need to get to Villaines and then I can rest and make some decisions. That‚Äôs about two hours of riding. I can do that. But I‚Äôm in a really bad mental space, so it‚Äôs time to put on some tunes. 

Let‚Äôs go.

The music makes a big difference and things start to feel much better. The ankle hurts less too ‚Äì that‚Äôs suspicious. How much of this was just in my mind? But this is taking a long time. How far away is Villaines? There‚Äôs just climb after climb after climb‚Ä¶ and this particular climb is fucking hot. And long. Holy shit. I‚Äôm almost there though, just keep going. This is the second time I‚Äôm hearing this song‚Ä¶ that means it‚Äôs been over two hours‚Ä¶ but finally there is Villaines. But where is the control. Why is the control so far away from the sign saying I‚Äôm in Villaines? Oh there it is. But wow is it busy. It‚Äôs full of local people. It‚Äôs loud, someone is saying something on a microphone, there‚Äôs music, I can‚Äôt focus. Where do I put my bike. I‚Äôve been here before why am I lost. Oh there‚Äôs a spot. Careful getting off the bike. Oh it‚Äôs hard to stand. Right take things out of the saddle bag. Where am I. Where am I going? Right those stairs are familiar, go there. What am I doing. Control. Need stamp. Almost fall over. There go that way. Get stamp. *(Volunteers staring at me with concerned faces.)* Are you ok? Smile. Yes I‚Äôm ok. Food. That way. I know this routine. Croissants. Coke. Orangina. Sit down. Drink Coke‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Oh‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶This is not normal‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶I‚Äôm really hot. 

My faculties start to come back a little bit and I take in my surroundings. 

It‚Äôs really fucking hot out. I am really hot, too hot. That‚Äôs the problem here. 

I continue to drink cold fluids and continue to feel better and my thinking and concentration improve. I legit really need to cool down a lot and ASAP. 

I chug my drinks and stand up to go outside to the water station where I can soak myself and lie down in the shade. I can stand and walk again without balance issues at this point. I completely douse myself in cold water, then lie down in some grass in the shade and close my eyes. I tell myself it‚Äôs ok if I fall asleep here for a bit if I need to. I drift off for maybe a minute, but then I‚Äôm wide awake again. I can‚Äôt fall asleep, so I just keep lying there to cool down and rest, but eventually I‚Äôm shivering and it‚Äôs time to get going.

It is absolutely boiling out, why hadn‚Äôt I noticed this earlier? Like more than 35C in the shade, let alone on the tarmac in the sun. I know the early signs of heat stroke in myself very well, having had issues with it on a number of occasions. I get into a really bad mood and start to get a headache‚Ä¶ oh right. I‚Äôd taken Tylenol earlier for my Achilles, so I never got a headache. And then I‚Äôm just less aware of everything due to sleep deprivation.

I continue on, being cautious to regularly douse myself with water now. I‚Äôve lost several hours today due to my Achilles and needing that extended rest in Villaines, but whatever ‚Äì I‚Äôll change my goal to finishing in under 70 hours. It‚Äôs late afternoon and I‚Äôm in some treeless French countryside, riding into a faint headwind‚Ä¶ that is if anything acting like a convection oven and just heating me even more rather than cooling me off. But I‚Äôm on top of things this time and being careful to stay cool. My Achilles is also not hurting much now either. Thanks to that extended rest in Villaines? Or change in mental state? I have no idea but I‚Äôll take it. 

I pass through town after town and they all seem the same. Hundred-year-old buildings. Names are all four words hyphenated together, one of which is usually ‚Äúsaint.‚Äù No people, no cars, no signs of life. Just sun and heat. Some early thunderstorms look to be forming around me, and there was supposed to be a risk of them today‚Ä¶ but they don‚Äôt really look like they‚Äôll turn into anything that will rain. They do provide some reprieve from the sun though.

Soon, I‚Äôm in Mortagne and its supper time. The control is also not that busy ‚Äì this fits with my observation that there have been fewer riders on the road recently ‚Äì I‚Äôve gotten ahead of The Bulge. It is still scorching hot out, and I am sitting in a scorching hot dining hall in Mortagne eating scorching hot pasta. And I am OK with that - I have become one with heat. I don‚Äôt think either of us particularly likes it but given our shared circumstances we have come to a truce for the time being. I‚Äôm feeling physically good, and not tired (somehow?). I briefly chat with a rider sitting near me ‚Äì he had just gotten into rando this year, apparently after being convinced by a friend. He‚Äôd missed the 200 and 300k rides, so ended up just doing four different 400/600k‚Äôs instead!

I hit the road again and I‚Äôm still feeling good. There is some climbing for the next 20-30km, but after that there are really no significant hills at all until the finish, and there are only 120km left. I have this in the bag. I am by myself and the evening is approaching. I am thinking about how good I am at riding my bike and how awesome I am. 

That‚Äôs kind of weird. I think this might be a sleep deprivation thing. I tell myself to just keep being cautious and don‚Äôt take risks. Shortly after this I make a left turn going fast at the bottom of a descent, but take it too wide, clipping the edge of the curb on the right and almost crash. 

Yep. Sleep deprivation. 

Be careful. 

Around this time I start to notice that my head and torso are feeling really heavy. My postural muscles have become exhausted and I‚Äôm struggling a bit to keep upright on the bike. Fuck that I‚Äôm not DNFing due to Shermer‚Äôs neck with under 100k to go. With only a few hours of riding left it should be possible to push through, and I eventually find a new position that depends more on my triceps to stay upright.

Night continues to approach, and soon it‚Äôs time to put the reflective vest and lights on. I‚Äôm riding strong and cruising at just under 30kph on the flats. In the distance behind me I see a collection of lights approaching quickly ‚Äì it‚Äôs a group of riders going pretty hard. As they pass me, they seem to be going at a pace I could probably maintain, so I join on to them, and yes, this is sustainable. 

It is a bunch of French and European riders again, including the French guy I‚Äôd ridden with for a bit earlier in the day! I hang at the back for a while to get a sense of what they are doing and their riding styles, but then take a few turns at the front. We are going fast, and this includes a few hard pulls at ~300w/40kph. 

I wonder if maybe this isn‚Äôt the smartest thing to do in the dark when I am tired but decide to continue with them. I feel more alert now from the adrenaline of going hard.

We arrive in Dreux, the last control, and I still feel really good, energetic even. I get my stamp, eat an apple pastry and Coke quickly, and message my parents to let them know I only have 42km left, as they wanted to meet me at the finish. 

Then I jump back into the night.

And I immediately go the wrong way at a roundabout; but recognize it and just do a circle and continue in the right direction. The signs leaving Dreux seem to be hard to see, and sometimes I‚Äôm paranoid that I‚Äôm missing them. People have stolen signs near the end in previous editions of PBP so I wonder whether I should switch to navigation with my Garmin. 

Soon, I‚Äôm riding down a very dark and quiet road, and a cyclist passes me going the other way. I stop immediately this time to check Google Maps, and yep, I‚Äôve missed a turn. I turn around and go back the other way. Other riders are also circling around in this area, seemingly lost, but a German rider is calling out to them which way to go. I ask him if he‚Äôs sure that‚Äôs the right way, and he says yes, so the group of us follows him. They are all going too slow for me though, so I take off ahead. But as I‚Äôm watching them in my mirror they yell, and I realize I‚Äôve missed a turn again. This is getting ridiculous, so I load the map in my Garmin and start navigating with that. 

I pass the group of riders again and keep going, but this time the German rider keeps up with me. We take turns pulling for a bit, but there‚Äôs no conversation, only silence. Eventually he drops back after pulling again; but oddly, I don‚Äôt see his light behind me. 

I slow down to look back and no one is there.

There‚Äôs nowhere he could have gone‚Ä¶ so did I hallucinate him? 

I think so, but I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I actually noticed the direction signs but didn‚Äôt consciously process them, and then hallucinated this whole thing as a way to tell myself which way to go? I‚Äôm not completely convinced, but I wonder now if I‚Äôm reaching my limit and going a bit crazy. 

But there‚Äôs only 30km to go, so I keep going. My triceps are starting to fail in this new position and every time I go over a bump I feel like my left elbow is going to dislocate.

The night is dark and quiet and there are few riders on the road. 

No lights, no sounds, no people: just me and my thoughts. 

I am still ruminating on whether I am starting to go a bit crazy, or maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid that I‚Äôm going crazy. But if I‚Äôm paranoid that suggests I‚Äôm going crazy‚Ä¶ 

hmmm‚Ä¶ 

I pass through a small town and there are more lights, and my thinking seems to improve a little bit given the increase in sensory input. But then it‚Äôs dark again, and my thoughts go even more squirrely. 

As I pass other riders I worry that maybe I‚Äôm hallucinating them as well. I laugh to myself a little bit, but I‚Äôm also scared that none of what I‚Äôm seeing is real. 

I catch up to a group of three French riders, and I decide that maybe I should just follow them given my mental state. My perception of time has failed, and it has stopped passing - there is just a continuous night. I can‚Äôt tell the difference between minutes and hours. This confuses me, but I accept it. 

Soon I am worried that these riders are not real either. I‚Äôm not sure if I should continue following them or not. 

There are lot of shadows around me being cast by my light on the side of the road. That one from some grass looks like a rabbit‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably from a shadow rabbit. When people get really sleep deprived they often start seeing terrifying shadow people‚Ä¶ 

I probably shouldn‚Äôt look at any more shadows in case there‚Äôs shadow people there. 

>That‚Äôs dumb, there‚Äôs no such thing as shadow people. 

But what if I look and I see them, because of my mental state? 

>So don‚Äôt look. Just don‚Äôt look at the shadows. You don‚Äôt want to see something and get terrified. 

But now all the hair on my body is standing on end because I‚Äôm unwilling to look at any shadows because I‚Äôm afraid I might see shadow people.

I know they will be terrifying. 

>Just focus on the riders in front of you

 ‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶the backs of their knees look funny. 

That‚Äôs not what normal knees look like. They have The Virgin Mary in their knees. 

These people are hallucinations for sure. 

Their knees are actually portals that lead somewhere, and that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs three riders, because there are three portals. 

>This makes no sense, you‚Äôre actually getting psychotic from sleep deprivation. Just go hard and get ahead of them, and finish this thing ASAP. 

And I‚Äôm on my own again in the dark silent night. 

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶there‚Äôs some more riders, they‚Äôre probably not real either. 

>Maybe go take a quick nap on the side of the road. 

No, the forest here is too terrifying, too many shadows. 

It‚Äôs not safe. 

You know what, what‚Äôs probably happening is that part of my brain is actually asleep right now and that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs real anymore, or make sense of anything. 

Yeah, I‚Äôm just sleeping right now. Everything will be OK once I wake up again. 

Wait if I‚Äôm sleeping, then who am I right now, who‚Äôs thinking? 

>This is insane, you‚Äôre being ridiculous, you just need to finish this thing and go to bed

... Maybe I should talk to some riders and tell people about what I‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶No that‚Äôs a bad idea, if someone finds out about this they‚Äôll have to report me to a hospital or the government or something and then they won‚Äôt let me finish the ride. I‚Äôll just keep going and keep to myself. 

>No, talk to someone, or sing out loud, or do something that provides sensory stimulation. 

No I‚Äôll just keep to myself, you shouldn‚Äôt talk to hallucinations.

‚Ä¶

If my parents are at the finish line, how will I know they are my real parents and not shadow parents? 

>That‚Äôs ridiculous, they will be your real parents

‚Ä¶  

An older French rider catches up with me and talks to me. 

This guy‚Äôs real because I can hear him talk. I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre talking in French or English. I don‚Äôt understand the conversation yet I‚Äôm still having it. 

But then suddenly he‚Äôs gone. Was he a hallucination too?‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶but there‚Äôs the finish line. 

And it‚Äôs bright and I can see things. And there‚Äôs music. 

And it‚Äôs over.

A Case For God's Non-Causality (by a Hindu as a fun thought experiment üôÉ)

Since time immemorial there has been an unending clash between Thiests and Athiests regarding God and multiple statements the thiests make.

One such statement that gets a lot of Thiests in hot water is

‚ÄúIf God (let's assume there's one) created everything and everything requires a Cause, who or what caused God?""

Now, thiests sometimes don't know how to answer but mostly just say ;

‚ÄúNo one. He's self existent, cuz of the way he is‚Äù

Now, athiests mostly dismiss this by saying how such a ‚Äúcop out‚Äù of an answer that is and thus it doesn't make sense that a Being have no cause yet cause everything else. But here I decided to formulate a counter argument to this objection with logical implications and scriptural quotations.

Note: This theory aims to serve the purpose of a ‚Äúcounter argument‚Äù to a common objection to God's non causality. It's not meant to ‚Äúprove‚Äù God's over all existence or any of his other attributes like (all loving etc,.). Just a counter argument and a fun thought experiment, Okay? Ook. So just breathe, take a sip of coffee or tea and let's go, shall we?


The Existence of God or ƒ™≈õvara or Brahman as been described by the ShƒÅstras multiple times as beginningless and non dual.

Now, it's been established that this Brahman makes the unmanifest world manifest by dissolving the Universe prior and making a new one, unlike the Abrahamic Religions which state the theory of Creatio- Ex Nihillo ( Creation from Nothing)

Obviously, this concept has been rejected by modern scholars and Philosophers as something can't come from Nothing.

Thus, it's more reasonable that A God would simply recycle the matter and energy dissolved in the previous ones.


Now this one Primordial God creates the world by letting out all his ≈öaktis, His aspects, Time, ƒÄkƒÅsa etc,. in the event of Srshti. This Non Dual Brahman gives rise to the world of Duality by power of his MƒÅya.

""The Lord on account of his MƒÅya is perceived Manifold ""

[Brihadaranyaka upanishad. II. v. 19]l

Bhagavad Gita 7.14

daivƒ´ hy e·π£ƒÅ gu·πáamayƒ´ mama mƒÅyƒÅ duratyayƒÅ |
mƒÅm eva ye prapadyante mƒÅyƒÅm etƒÅ·πÅ taranti te ||

‚Ä¢ Translation: This divine MƒÅyƒÅ of Mine, consisting of the three gu·πáas, is difficult to overcome. But those who surrender to Me alone can transcend this MƒÅyƒÅ.

The Prak·πõiti itself is MƒÅya. Sometimes MƒÅya is also defined as something which deluded by the use of Tri-Gunas (Sattva, RƒÅjas and TƒÅmas ). Another lesser known yet apt definition of MƒÅya is VƒÅyu-purƒÅ·πáa (IV.30-31) says:‚Äî‚ÄúTo measure (mƒÅ) is to make a thing by giving shape to it and existence‚Äù. The denotattion and connotation of the word MƒÅyƒÅ and the principle underlying it expound the same truth. ‚ÄúMƒÅyƒÅ or manifestation means division of the hitherto undivided principle; on itself it performs this operation and as Puru·π£a it henceforth thinks of itself as composed of parts.‚Äù

Regardless, all this Power and energy of Prak·πõti, as well as the aggregate of Chit (Souls) called Puru·π£a are present in the form of a Golden Egg Hiranyagarbha. With the help of KƒÅla ≈öaktƒ´ and other catalysts this point of singularity begans to spontaneously expand rapidly. Then Brahma's born and he moulds the Universe as per the Command of BhagavƒÅn and all that stuff.

OK so, we've discussed the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù of the creation as per the world view of ShƒÅstra which seems to align quite well with the idea of The Big Bang. Yet, here's the problem that one will ask,

‚ÄúSure bro, fine. Let's assume there's a God who's the cause of everything including the Big Bang. But who in the Goddamn Heck, Caused God?!‚Äù


This is where I'd like to present my theory.

To understand this first we need to know what exactly is causality, time and space and Big Bang.

Time and Space:
Time and space or space time owe their existence to the Big Bang as per Scientific Observations and deductions. We also know Time and Space are inter-dependent and thus one can't exist without the other. And it's by the interaction of Space (Matter) and Time by which things are caused.

Let's Speak of Causality;

Causality:
Causality, at its core, is the principle that an event (the cause) brings about another event (the effect). However, whether causality itself depends on space and time to exist is a nuanced question.

1.Causality and Time:

Time as a Framework for Causality: Causality is fundamentally tied to the concept of time because the cause must precede the effect in temporal order. For example, striking a match (cause) must occur before the flame appears (effect). This temporal sequence is central to the very definition of causality.
Dependence on Temporal Flow: Without the passage of time, it becomes impossible to distinguish between ""before"" and ""after."" In a timeless framework, the notions of cause and effect collapse into simultaneity, making causality meaningless in its conventional sense.
2.Causality and Space:

Interaction in Space: Many causal relationships involve interactions that require spatial proximity or a medium. For instance:Gravity requires the presence of masses in space to exert force.Sound waves need air or another medium to transmit vibrations.Chemical reactions depend on molecules interacting in space.
Dependence on Spatial Connectivity: For a cause to influence an effect, there must often be a spatial connection, either direct (e.g., physical contact) or mediated by forces or fields.
This means that the very Principle of Causality owes it's origin or is atleast super-intertwined with Time and Space to function. Modern physics, particularly Einstein's general relativity, suggests that time and space themselves started with the Big Bang.

Asking ""what happened before the Big Bang"" may not make sense because ""before"" assumes the existence of time, which did not exist prior to the Big Bang.

Something needs to be caused, and there needs to be a Where (space)and a When(time). But spacetime themselves owe their origin or manifestation to the Big Bang. Meaning prior to the Big Bang, if as you have said ‚ÄúFor the sake of the argument let's assume or accept‚Äù A Being or Force or God existed then it logically cannot be caused as that would require the Principle Of Causality and as I said, that requires a ‚ÄòWhere‚Äô and a ‚ÄòWhen‚Äô, both of which don't exist as that depends on Spatial Connectivity and Time both which haven't been manifested or present yet ,meaning the question is Logically Invalid on whether God can be ‚Äúcaused‚Äù. (This can also apply to any physical concept of the material universe of which to speak because they also rely on spacetime)

Now, there are however a few nuances to the Principle Of Causality which I'll present here:

Quantum Exceptions: In certain quantum phenomena, such as entanglement, the classical sequence of cause and effect appears ambiguous or instantaneous but still occur within the‚Ä¶fabric of spacetime.

( Entanglement:

At the quantum level (the tiniest particles like electrons or photons), particles can become ""entangled."" This means their properties (like spin or polarization) are connected in such a way that whatever happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are.
Scientists aren‚Äôt sure how this instant connection works. It‚Äôs not like the particles are sending a signal to each other. Instead, it‚Äôs as if they are two parts of the same ""thing,"" even when separated. This is why Einstein called it ""spooky action at a distance."")
Non-Locality in Quantum Mechanics: In quantum physics, phenomena like entanglement (again) suggest that spatial separation might not always constrain causality. However, even in these cases, the concept of spacetime as a whole is necessary for understanding them interactions.

Abstract Causality

Logical and Mathematical Causality: Outside the physical realm, causality can exist in logical or mathematical systems where time and space are not factors. For example: In mathematics, if A=B+C we can say B and C ""cause"" A, but no temporal sequence or spatial interaction is computer science, an algorithm's output depends on its input, a causal relationship independent of time and space.
Both of these nuances however don't really challenge the theory here as;

Our theory states that:

God exists beyond time, space, and causality because these dimensions (and causality itself) arise only after the Big Bang.
As God transcends these constraints, He cannot be ‚Äúcaused‚Äù or subject to causality, since causality depends on time and space.
This is not a cop-out but a logical conclusion that God, as a transcendent Being, is not bound by the laws of the universe.
I'm pretty sure we had the attributes of God established or assumed in the beginning.
Does Quantum Entanglement Challenge This?

At first glance, quantum entanglement might seem to challenge the theory at hand because:

Entanglement shows that particles can interact in ways that don‚Äôt seem to respect the classical rules of time, space, and causality.
The ""instantaneous connection"" between entangled particles might make it seem like causality isn't bound by time and space.
But we say not so, on account of the facts that;

A. Entanglement Still Depends on Spacetime

While entanglement shows instantaneous ""connections,"" it doesn‚Äôt exist outside of spacetime. The particles are still part of the spacetime framework, and their entangled state was established within spacetime when they interacted initially.
B. God Is Beyond the Universe, Entanglement Is Not

Entanglement applies to particles that exist in the physical universe. These particles are still subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, which operate within the framework of the universe. God isn't as I've established thanks to that whole Spacetime laws crap
C. Entanglement Supports the Idea of a Reality Beyond Our Understanding

If anything, entanglement strengthens the argument that the universe operates in ways that go beyond human logic.
If quantum mechanics can reveal phenomena like entanglement, where classical causality seems to ""break,"" it‚Äôs not unreasonable to believe in a transcendent Being that operates outside all known laws, including causality.
3. Reconciling God‚Äôs Non-Causality with Entanglement

To reconcile this theory with entanglement you should

Recognize that quantum entanglement doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for time and space entirely, As It just shows that the universe has deeper, more complex connections than we understand .
God, as the origin of all reality, could be seen as the source of the laws that govern quantum phenomena, including entanglement. However, being beyond the universe, God is not subject to those laws Himself, as he pervades the universe and possesses them as his body or modes and is basically A Universal Soul-ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. Indeed, the Universally Pervading Soul God isn't subject to all this as said in (Chanddhogya Upanishad. VIII.i.5): ‚ÄúThis Self is free from evil, old age, death and sorrow, without hunger, and thirst, with true desires and true volitions‚Äù.
Same with Abstract Causality

1.Abstract Causality and Its Domain

Abstract mathematical causality operates purely within the logical and conceptual domain. It doesn‚Äôt involve time, space, or physical causation.
It‚Äôs simply a set of rules or relationships, like saying A=B+C .These rules don‚Äôt require physical existence or temporal progression‚Äîthey‚Äôre just logical truths.
2. Why It Doesn‚Äôt Apply to God:

Our theory is about God‚Äôs transcendence over physical causality, which is tied to time and space. Abstract causality, being a conceptual framework, is unrelated to physical

God, exists beyond all frameworks, including both physical and conceptual as said in ( Brihadaranyaka upanishad. III. iv. 2): ‚Äú You cannot know the Knower of knowing, or think the thinker of thinking‚Äî‚Äù.
Abstract causality is a human construct, a way for our minds to describe relationships. God, as a transcendent Being, is not limited by or dependent on human concepts like mathematics or logic.
Abstract causality might explain logical systems within the universe, but it doesn‚Äôt apply to God because God, by definition, is beyond all systems‚Äîphysical and abstract.
3.This too strengthens the Theory:

Abstract might even be taken to support the argument! How u might ask?

Abstract mathematical truths (like 2+2=4) exist independently of time, space, or causality. They are eternal and unchanging.
If abstract truths can exist outside physical causality, it‚Äôs reasonable to argue that God, who is far beyond any abstract concept, can exist without being caused.
Just as mathematical relationships don‚Äôt require a ‚Äúcause,‚Äù God‚Äôs existence doesn‚Äôt either.
Thus, God's Non Causality has a Logical implication and is not merely a cop out.


And to those who start whining about;

""OH U DIDN'T PROVE GOD EXISTS! WHAT ABUOT OTHR RELIGIOONSS REEEE!!""

My dear brother read the note, matter of fact, lemme repeat

This theory is not meant to prove God's existence or address other attributes (like all loving etc,.)or religions; or a standalone statement. It‚Äôs simply a counterargument to a common objection to God‚Äôs non-causality‚Äîa fun thought experiment. I mean it literally begins with the Assumption that ‚ÄúGod exists"" and has words like ‚Äúfor the sake of argument‚Äù. So relax, grab a coffee or tea and chill the hell out.
But yeah, that's my theory for y'all. I'd like to know how it's received and how correct it is cuz I ain't no mathematician or quantum physicist I'll tell you that üòÖ.

Let me end this off with a prayer to Lord Hayagriva, the Lord Of Knowledge:

1i5rlgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i5rlgu/multiple_emotional_affairs/,Multiple emotional affairs,"This is quite long, please please bear with me. 

I‚Äôm seeking some marriage advice. My husband and I have been married for 13 years, and we have two children together. Over the course of our marriage, I‚Äôve caught him in multiple emotional affairs, and it‚Äôs been incredibly difficult to process. The first time I found out was when I was pregnant with our first child. He was supposed to fly to the U.S. for business and asked me to send an email from his work laptop. Normally, I trust him completely and don‚Äôt open his personal devices, but I found myself curious and checked his emails and chats. That‚Äôs when I found flirtatious exchanges with a female coworker. They were calling each other ‚Äòbabe‚Äô and sending flirty messages. I was devastated.

The second time, I had a gut feeling something was off when I saw the name of one of my in-laws‚Äô neighbors at the top of his Facebook messenger list. I searched for their conversation, but everything was deleted. I confronted him about it, and he admitted to exchanging flirty messages with her. Again, I was pregnant with our second child at the time.

The third time, it was with our own neighbor‚Äîsomeone who lives just a few houses away. She‚Äôs married and experiencing marital issues, and I feared that if he made a move, she might reciprocate. Luckily, she didn‚Äôt. This only happened last year.

This year, it‚Äôs been with a coworker from his office, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôve had enough. He insists that he‚Äôs just being friendly and there‚Äôs nothing wrong, but I‚Äôm struggling to accept that explanation. Here‚Äôs why:

He consistently praises her physical appearance, telling her how pretty she is and making other compliments about her looks.
Just last week, when he brought his car to work, he insisted on giving this female coworker a ride to the office, even though they have shuttle service available.
They chat each other often, even during office hours. Sometimes it‚Äôs about work, but sometimes it‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs in the HR department, and he works in IT, so it‚Äôs not like their roles require that much communication.
He told me he was going to treat her to coffee, but only her‚Äînot anyone else at work. Isn‚Äôt that strange?
In one of their chats, she mentioned she was going to buy something, and he offered to go with her. This just feels off to me.
If you're a married woman and a coworker is constantly complimenting you, wouldn‚Äôt you feel weirded out by that? I can‚Äôt imagine it would be comfortable for her, especially since he‚Äôs married.
This feels like the last straw, and I don‚Äôt know how much more I can handle. I‚Äôve always confronted him about these situations, but every time he dismisses it as harmless. I‚Äôve shared everything with my in-laws, and they‚Äôre offering me their full support. I‚Äôm seriously considering leaving him, but I‚Äôm unsure if I should try to work through this or walk away. I want to start working again, save some money, and get myself in a position where I can leave him if it comes to that.

Any advice would be appreciated, especially if you‚Äôve been in a similar situation. Please don't judge. I just need some advice and maybe, assurance that I wasn't being crazy calling him out and confronting about the most recent one.",0,1737384029.0,Marriage,2,0.5,False

Fifty-seven years ago‚Äîon March 18, 1968‚ÄîMartin Luther King, Jr. delivered his speech ‚ÄúAll Labor Has Dignity‚Äù at Bishop Charles Mason Temple of the Church of God in Christ in Memphis, Tennessee. The church was overflowing with sanitation workers on strike and their supporters. In his speech, Dr. King connected their strike to the plight of all workers, especially those in the service economy. Thousands of the Memphis sanitation workers had walked off the job on February 12, 1968 to bring attention to years of poor pay and dangerous working conditions. At that time, Dr. King was on road garnering support for his Poor People‚Äôs Campaign. The Memphis sanitation strike would become a major part of the campaign. To commemorate the anniversary of his speech, we share selections of it with you here. You can read it in full in ‚ÄúAll Labor Has Dignity‚Äù and The Radical King.

***

As I came in tonight, I turned around and said to Ralph Abernathy, ‚ÄúThey really have a great movement here in Memphis.‚Äù You are demonstrating something here that needs to be demonstrated all over our country. You are demonstrating that we can stick together and you are demonstrating that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that if one black person suffers, if one black person is down, we are all down. I‚Äôve always said that if we are to solve the tremendous problems that we face we are going to have to unite beyond the religious line, and I‚Äôm so happy to know that you have done that in this movement in a supportive role. We have Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, members of the Church of God in Christ, and members of the Church of Christ in God, we are all together, and all of the other denominations and religious bodies that I have not mentioned.

But there is another great need, and that is to unite beyond class lines. The Negro ‚Äúhaves‚Äù must join hands with the Negro ‚Äúhave-nots.‚Äù And armed with compassionate traveler checks, they must journey into that other country of their brother‚Äôs denial and hurt and exploitation. This is what you have done. You‚Äôve revealed here that you recognize that the no D is as significant as the PhD, and the man who has been to no-house is as significant as the man who has been to Morehouse. And I just want to commend you.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been in a situation like this and this lets me know that we are ready for action. So I come to commend you and I come also to say to you that in this struggle you have the absolute support, and that means Ô¨Ånancial support also, of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

You are doing many things here in this struggle. You are demanding that this city will respect the dignity of labor. So often we overlook the work and the significance of those who are not in professional jobs, of those who are not in the so-called big jobs. But let me say to you tonight, that whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for the building of humanity, it has dignity, and it has worth. One day our society must come to see this. One day our society will come to respect the sanitation worker if it is to survive, for the person who picks up our garbage, in the Ô¨Ånal analysis, is as significant as the physician, for if he doesn‚Äôt do his job, diseases are rampant. All labor has dignity.

But you are doing another thing. You are reminding, not only Memphis, but you are reminding the nation that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages. And I need not remind you that this is our plight as a people all over America. The vast majority of Negroes in our country are still perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. My friends, we are living as a people in a literal depression. Now you know when there is mass unemployment and underemployment in the black community they call it a social problem. When there is mass unemployment and underemployment in the white community they call it a depression. But we find ourselves living in a literal depression, all over this country as a people.

Now the problem is not only unemployment. Do you know that most of the poor people in our country are working every day? And they are making wages so low that they cannot begin to function in the mainstream of the economic life of our nation. These are facts which must be seen, and it is criminal to have people working on a full-time basis and a full-time job getting part-time income. You are here tonight to demand that Memphis will do something about the conditions that our brothers face as they work day in and day out for the well-being of the total community. You are here to demand that Memphis will see the poor.

And I come by here to say that America, too, is going to hell if she doesn‚Äôt use her wealth. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God‚Äôs children to have the basic necessities of life, she, too, will go to hell. And I will hear America through her historians, years and generations to come, saying, ‚ÄúWe built gigantic buildings to kiss the skies. We built gargantuan bridges to span the seas. Through our spaceships we were able to carve highways through the stratosphere. Through our airplanes we are able to dwarf distance and place time in chains. Through our submarines we were able to penetrate oceanic depths.‚Äù

It seems that I can hear the God of the universe saying, ‚ÄúEven though you have done all of that, I was hungry and you fed me not, I was naked and you clothed me not. The children of my sons and daughters were in need of economic security and you didn‚Äôt provide it for them. And so you cannot enter the kingdom of greatness.‚Äù This may well be the indictment on America.

What does it profit one to be able to attend an integrated school when he doesn‚Äôt earn enough money to buy his children school clothes?

And so we assemble here tonight, and you have assembled for more than thirty days now to say, ‚ÄúWe are tired. We are tired of being at the bottom. We are tired of being trampled over by the iron feet of oppression. We are tired of our children having to attend overcrowded, inferior, quality-less schools.

Hi everyone.
I've been breaking my head about this and thought I'll get some solution here. 

I met Jay a couple of years back and we went on a couple of casual coffee/movie dates. On the third date, I opened up about some trauma I had from the abusive past. He was just silent/normal for the rest of the date and then called me in the middle of the night, told me this is too much for him to handle and that I should have shared this from the beginning and that I blindsided him. Mind you, all this happened within 2 weeks and we met on a dating app. It wasn't a conversation but just him going off. I said it's if he doesn't want to continue dating me and cut the call. He had already unfollowed me on socials by this time and I blocked him everywhere. 

Fast forward to now, I went back on dating apps after a looonnnggg break and guess who found me. Jay had sent me a message stating that he is sorry about how things went ended and that he needed time to process and all that. And asked if we could start afresh. I mean, I did like Jay when we went out but again, his reaction and response (to end things and run away) didn't really sit well. It would be good if I can move past this and probably start building the trust again. But, I'm also scared what if he just runs again when I open up about something else. 
I am just confused and would appreciate any advice here. Do I give Jay another chance or risk myself getting hurt again? ",0,1737383471.0,relationship_advice,6,0.5,False
1i5rdpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1i5rdpg/trigger_foods_logic/,Trigger foods logic?,"I read a lot from peeps with DV about there particular food ""triggers"". Its not sitting well with me as I can't understand the basic logic. 

My understanding regarding diverticulitis flare is that it is likely either the pouches hetting stuck with waste and then getting infected, or the diet in genneral is causing constipation or psyical stress on colon wall due to over eating. This can then lead to waste hanging around and getting infected somehow. The infection causes the inflamation..so we need to stop the infections. 

Is it that certain food get more stuck in the diverticula pouches or is it these trigger foods cause an infection/inflamation because they cause constipation. I just don't see how salad, or blue berries or coffee can cause a flare unless we are talking about foods that cause constipation, get stuck in pouches or cause inflamation as you are semi allergic? 

Can someone put me straight. I've always considered the trigger food idea part of the gluten intolerance or ibs range of issues not diverticulitis. As diet relates to DV it's more a case of maybe avoiding foods tht get stuck in pouches, avoid constipation and over eating to keep the colon as clean as possible. A single food being a trigger sounds odd to me. ",2,1737383428.0,Diverticulitis,6,1.0,False
1i5rcjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1i5rcjd/stressed_and_spiraling_over_new_neighbors/,Stressed and Spiraling over New Neighbors,"Hey, first post here. I'm sorry for the length. A little background: I'm formerly PDD-NOS, diagnosed in first grade reclassified as Aspberger's in my adult life. I was diagnosed with ADD, mixed presentation, at the same time. I have an SO, long time, though never married. We've been together for 20 years. He's on spectrum himself, and is generally a sweet and empathetic person. 

Right now it's just past 6 AM my time. I'm staying for a second night at my SO's parents, bless their kind hearts. I've probably gotten two hours of sleep, if I'm being generous, and not all of it in one block.  My head hurts and I'm absolutely sore and burnt out, I just can't sleep,even after taking double my usual Melatonin dose. Not that I'm prescribed a specific amount, just advised to take what's comfortable for me, and usually it doesn't take much for me to fall asleep. 

My new duplex neighbors are driving me full on batty. They smoke tobacco super casually, which is fine, except it gets into my place through my heater's furnace, which is in my garage, and is part of a shared driveway where they have parked their trailer.  The smoke absolutely escapes their closed trailer, and they will spend entire afternoons just smoking in there. 

It absolutely *reeks*.  Like the worst pot of coffee ever brewed, then left to fester for decades, and the smell is the least of my issues. I intentionally live a smoke-free life, partly because it's awful for my health, partly because many of my family, including my SO, suffer from asthma. I'm anxious because, or that, if I can smell it, I'm breathing in the nasty stuff with it.  Nevermind my mind having nightmares of third hand smoke. 

There was attempts earlier on, a few weeks ago, to negotiate with them per my landlord's advice, but I've since received a pretty nasty message accusing me of putting their tenancy in danger from when I was trying to call the landlord earlier on when we couldn't get ahold of them, so that's now out. 

My landlord says they can't do anything if they aren't smoking indoors, but my lease says no smoking on the premises period. 

My SO can't smell it, either, and while he is supportive and worries about me burning out from stress, he also thinks I just need to get used to the smell so we can go home.  I think he isn't seeing my full issue, and wonder why he'd care so little for his own health, let alone mine. I think COVID might've messed with his sense of smell, or just being around his no-longer-chain-smoking grandma earlier in life, but that's just my hypothesis.

What's odd is that earlier on he fully supported reporting their smoking, but seems to be too nice and doesn't want to bother them any further. 

I know a lot of this is anxiety, and my brain getting stuck on one thought, but I feel like I'm drowning and can't shake my brain lose from it. 

I'd love to move and just make it a non-issue, but I'm having medical issues that prevent me from working at the moment. I'm only living on my SSI right now, which really limits the places I can rent.

My SO's between jobs, so yeah, no money from him. He's dealing with his own health, so I'm not faulting him.  It just is what it is. 

Sorry this became an epic length screed of me yelling into the void. It's just I have a lot on my mind and I don't know how to handle it.",3,1737383339.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

1) It hasn't snowed in my area in at least a week, and it was a dusting that literally blew away. My son's snowman is a tiny lump of snow in our brown yard.

2) We don't park our cars in the garage - we use it for yardwork storage. That large door has not been opened in months. Not only that, but it's super loud. You'd hear it anywhere in the house.

3) We smoke cigarettes in the garage. I went out at 5:30 when I woke up, and THERE WAS NO SNOW. I went BACK out at 7:30 and SNOW. Literally on the seat of the chair I had sat in which has - and I had used - a heated seat.

4) It wasn't just a little bit, like some had blown from a tree, landed on the garage, and a bit had come through the roof. No. CHUNKS. Some looked like it had been thrown against a small table. Snow splatter was across the rug. The only other door to the garage that leads outside is shitty and gets an entire piece of plywood nailed over it from November to March. There is no way that snow should have been able to get in there.

5) I've been in the goddamn living room (the only room in the house with a connection to the garage) drinking coffee since I got up. For 5 minutes, I left to go to the bathroom.

6) There are 3 other people in my house. One is my husband. He is not quiet. The bathroom I used is attached to our bedroom. He definitely was and is still asleep. The two children in my house are both special needs. Not only are they very much not quiet once the sun is up (house rule) they cannot lie or act for SHIT. You know EXACTLY when they're not telling you EVERYTHING. They tell ON THEMSELVES. They are still asleep in bed. I checked.

Fifty-seven years ago‚Äîon March 18, 1968‚ÄîMartin Luther King, Jr. delivered his speech ‚ÄúAll Labor Has Dignity‚Äù at Bishop Charles Mason Temple of the Church of God in Christ in Memphis, Tennessee. The church was overflowing with sanitation workers on strike and their supporters. In his speech, Dr. King connected their strike to the plight of all workers, especially those in the service economy. Thousands of the Memphis sanitation workers had walked off the job on February 12, 1968 to bring attention to years of poor pay and dangerous working conditions. At that time, Dr. King was on road garnering support for his Poor People‚Äôs Campaign. The Memphis sanitation strike would become a major part of the campaign. To commemorate the anniversary of his speech, we share selections of it with you here. You can read it in full in ‚ÄúAll Labor Has Dignity‚Äù and The Radical King.

As I came in tonight, I turned around and said to Ralph Abernathy, ‚ÄúThey really have a great movement here in Memphis.‚Äù You are demonstrating something here that needs to be demonstrated all over our country. You are demonstrating that we can stick together and you are demonstrating that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that if one black person suffers, if one black person is down, we are all down. I‚Äôve always said that if we are to solve the tremendous problems that we face we are going to have to unite beyond the religious line, and I‚Äôm so happy to know that you have done that in this movement in a supportive role. We have Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, members of the Church of God in Christ, and members of the Church of Christ in God, we are all together, and all of the other denominations and religious bodies that I have not mentioned.

But there is another great need, and that is to unite beyond class lines. The Negro ‚Äúhaves‚Äù must join hands with the Negro ‚Äúhave-nots.‚Äù And armed with compassionate traveler checks, they must journey into that other country of their brother‚Äôs denial and hurt and exploitation. This is what you have done. You‚Äôve revealed here that you recognize that the no D is as significant as the PhD, and the man who has been to no-house is as significant as the man who has been to Morehouse. And I just want to commend you.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been in a situation like this and this lets me know that we are ready for action. So I come to commend you and I come also to say to you that in this struggle you have the absolute support, and that means Ô¨Ånancial support also, of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

You are doing many things here in this struggle. You are demanding that this city will respect the dignity of labor. So often we overlook the work and the significance of those who are not in professional jobs, of those who are not in the so-called big jobs. But let me say to you tonight, that whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for the building of humanity, it has dignity, and it has worth. One day our society must come to see this. One day our society will come to respect the sanitation worker if it is to survive, for the person who picks up our garbage, in the Ô¨Ånal analysis, is as significant as the physician, for if he doesn‚Äôt do his job, diseases are rampant. All labor has dignity.

But you are doing another thing. You are reminding, not only Memphis, but you are reminding the nation that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages. And I need not remind you that this is our plight as a people all over America. The vast majority of Negroes in our country are still perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. My friends, we are living as a people in a literal depression. Now you know when there is mass unemployment and underemployment in the black community they call it a social problem.

And they are making wages so low that they cannot begin to function in the mainstream of the economic life of our nation. These are facts which must be seen, and it is criminal to have people working on a full-time basis and a full-time job getting part-time income.

I was worried a lot about fatigue and nausea. As a mom for an active 3 year old toddler I cannot afford to be sick. So, took the chance and that is what I noticed so far: 
1. no cravings or the slightest hunger feel. I literally made myself eat small amounts of food so I don‚Äôt get sick from not eating. 
2. Thirst. That is a good thing for me because it makes me drink more water. 
3. Lots of energy (even in the morning). I really woke up and felt ‚Äúawake‚Äù. It felt so weird driving to work feeling awake and alert without even needing my coffee. 
4. Just overall good mood.

Hope it stays that way so I can finally get rid of the baby weight. ",9,1737382881.0,Semaglutide,17,0.81,False

i quit my job this week. the anger, anxiety, and relief of making that decision is something that normally would've lead me to binge uncontrollably. however now that i've been sugar free for a few weeks again, my mood swings aren't as intense as they once were, i'm better able to regulate my emotions without the constant sugar highs and crashes, and i no longer feel the need to numb my every emotion with excessive amounts of food.

usually if i even just think about food i'm consumed with thoughts of eating until i let myself binge. last night after dinner i decided to eat some more, just because the thought popped into my head. i took one bite of my snack and realized i really, genuinely just didn't feel like eating in that moment. so i put it back. that's something i could never do before.

i just had some oatmeal and black coffee for breakfast and i feel genuinely full and satisfied. the sensation of being full would've once trigger me into wanting to eat ever more until i was in pain, but now i really have no desire to do that. 

i'm very happy and excited with my progress. i don't expect this means i will never binge again and that i'm ""cured"" of my BED for life, but i'm incredibly proud, motivated, and optimistic about the future. i hope if you struggle too you're able to keep going and keep trying, because there is hope and you absolutely have it in you too!",7,1737382674.0,sugarfree,2,1.0,False

My wife and I have booked a trip in April for our anniversary and we‚Äôll be in Seoul for 6 nights, but I‚Äôm not sure what area we should book our hotel in. While I see most people recommend Myeongdong for first timers, I don‚Äôt think it would be our best option.

While it would be nice to see some of the more famous sights, they‚Äôve never been our main interest. We were interested in visiting primarily due to food and movies/shows, are quite chill in traveling (no huge itineraries, no early wake ups) and are mostly interested in wandering around, grabbing a coffee, eating good food (mostly street food/typical restaurants and probably something more upscale for the actual anniversary dinner), shopping (not necessarily malls but smaller shops, skincare). We live in a large city so we don‚Äôt have any issue using public transport to get around, nor really with crowds, though I think being in the middle of Myeongdong for 6 days would probably be too much at that point.

Therefore I‚Äôm mostly considering Insadong or Hongdae, but wanted to know which people think would be better, or if there is another neighborhood you would recommend based on our interests?",0,1737382536.0,koreatravel,12,0.33,False

Your perishable goods two days from too old.

Your WiFi too weak and coffee too strong;
Your break times short and queue times long.

Your traffic lights always turning to red,
and your phone battery perilously close to dead.

May you catch your hips on every corner, 
and late or on time, may it be the former.

May your feet meet carelessly discarded Lego, 
your voice chat sessions plagued by a persistent echo.

May your toilet roll be one-ply and no higher,
and your clothes somewhat damp when pulled from the dryer.

Inconveniences many and God rolls few,
Those who abuse Armanz, this poem's for you.
