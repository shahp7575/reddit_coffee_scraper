1ky9c06,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1ky9c06/i_made_a_tool_to_delete_junk_mail_from_gmail_in/,I made a tool to delete junk mail from Gmail in bulk,"Sharing a project I've been working on called [Junk Mail Cleaner](https://junkmailcleaner.com).

It's a micro saas utility to clean out junk mail from your Gmail inbox in bulk. No subscription required to use. 

I built this to solve a problem I have. I hate how bogged down my Gmail inbox gets with useless mail over the course of the year. 

It works in three simple steps:

1. Scan your inbox (pick the scan time frame, email categories, etc.)
2. Review your scan results.
3. Delete emails.

This isn't a new concept. Tools like Superhuman exist but most people can't afford $30/month for email. And there are other options but they're all subscription based which annoys me.

And it's low risk to try:

* **Scan for FREE.** Seriously, see what it finds, no strings.
* **Only pay if you like the results** and want to actually delete the junk. It's a small one-time fee, about the price of a NYC coffee.
* If you think the scan sucks (spoiler: it doesn't 😉), you pay nada.

It's a pretty simple tool, but it scratches my itch of wanting a clean inbox without the subscription headache.",1,1748521111.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False

She would be sad that I feel like a failure at work, struggling through adulthood. She was always a high achiever with only As and Bs, and now I'm an insecure woman too scared to apply for director roles.

She would be sad that I still haven’t met someone. Instead, I’m collecting bridesmaid titles—third time now, with three more pending. How do I explain to her that she's never experienced love before? That she's never really known what it's like to be with someone who respects, appreciates and loves her? Someone who she can truly trust.

But most of all, she’d be sad that I’m sad. She was sad a lot too, but she believes that growing up would fix it. Instead, I’ve ended up sadder than ever.

I’d probably leave her waiting, hot chocolate in hand, crying as she realises I stood her up—too ashamed to show her how things turned out. She peaked too early and never learned how to handle anxiety. The lack of friends in college and the years of bullying left a deeper mark than we both knew.

[~1000$]," Hello everyone. I’m new here but not so new to the world of coffee. A few years back I got my first espresso machine Delonghi Dedica EC685 and small grinder K79 (it was kinda package deal). Later I got interested in alternative brewing (V60), started using speciality coffee and suddenly understood that my current setup is far from good to be honest. Plus I have no bottomless portafilter, no good basket, and so on. I have a good tamper but that’s all. 
So, I’ve been reading a lot and my choice is in the title, but I’d love to hear any advice from you all. Maybe something different can be better or just easier? Pros, cons and all that stuff. Oh and I have another question about grinder specifically. I like to brew alternative too, but I have read that most espresso grinders is not suitable for alternative grinds and change it will be very inconvenient and it will give you some kind of inconsistent grind. 
Should I get separate one for this? If yes, which one? Comandante C40 is too expensive for me, but any thoughts about Timemore Chestnut for example?

I have this longing feeling for years to go home, to belong somewhere.

At 35, I’m sitting in my house with a cup of coffee in my hand, 
and yet, I still want to go home.
I just want to go home.

I don’t know where my home is.
Because within me, it definitely isn’t there.
I’ve spent years wondering if I’ll ever make peace within myself. 

Growing up as a lonely only child with not so present and controlling parents, over time I developed avoidant attachments.  
It sucks to realize that for years, I wanted to be loved but I was the one pushing people away.  

I never had a good relationship with my parents, they were too controlling. 
After years of emotional abuse, I learned to maintain strict boundaries. 
 It gave me space and time to heal from them.

Then, with my ex-wife, things started to fall apart. After five years of marriage, she began to become controlling too.
 It triggered my avoidant self all over again. We had ego clashes , conflicts and what not.

After the divorce, everything felt so heavy. It felt like everything is just against me , I never got that peace at home . 
Over the time I became that stereotypical divorced, workaholic manager everyone resents.  
Work and study were always my ways of coping. I took therapy eventually, and after a year into it I started to express my emotions and started taking accountability of my decisions

I don't know how on earth I got this fortunate to find love again after a messy divorce, I started dating again and the only peace I have now is my girlfriend. I rest my head on her lap, she caresses my hair while I crib about  everything. 
And suddenly things starts to make sense and feels good again .

But I don’t want to depend on her for peace.
 I don’t want to hand someone else the responsibility of being my home.
 I want to be that for myself.

I’m 35. Sitting in my house. Coffee in hand.
 Everything looks fine from the outside.
But inside… I still whisper to myself, 
“Mujhe ghar jana hai.”

Maybe one day I’ll build that home inside me.

My Crow

I saw him on a dark day.
A day when depression had been chasing me for months, heavy and relentless. Life had started to feel surreal—like a dream I couldn’t wake up from. For years, I had said one of my dreams was to befriend a crow. I didn’t know that dream would find me on a day when I needed hope more than anything.

But he gave it to me.
He gifted me hope.

He showed up to the tray that day and ate the dry pet food my husband had left out. So simple, and yet—when I saw him, my heart sang. Joy bloomed. A small but fierce beacon of light. He came back the next day. And the next. And I began to leave him offerings: berries, peanuts, pistachios, boiled eggs (weird, I know), dry dog food, popcorn. He kept returning, and every visit filled my heart with purpose.

He brought his mate with him. They came, they ate, they left. But each time, something in me softened. Something in me healed. My dark angel had arrived—a fallen angel of wild beauty and pure, unexpected love.

Yesterday, we cawed back and forth like a game of Simon Says. He sees me. I know he does. And I know his voice now—his throaty, deep signature call. This morning, he cooed softly to me from the trees as I sipped my coffee. My little Yorkie barked at the unfamiliar sound, startled. I just smiled.

I have a friend.
A godsend.
A companion of the most unlikely kind, at one of the most crucial times in my life.

Thank you, my sweet friend.
I hope we can share many years together, with love in our hearts.

I literally haven't even had a chance to unpackage my A1 yet so haven't printed anything,  I am not sure this is going to work, I don't yet know about supports and when they are needed etc.

1ky8x3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1ky8x3k/the_strong_independent_woman_narrative_is_making/,"The “strong, independent woman” narrative is making our relationship a headache (30M/28F)","Quick backstory: My girlfriend (28F) and I (30M) have been dating for over a year, live together and have a dog. She comes from an *extremely* conservative small town (i.e. school taught women that they should serve their husbands, cook, clean, etc.) and a semi-problematic home environment. She’s very close with her mom and sister, but their dad was pretty crappy towards her mom when they were growing up and her mom was always the breadwinner while her dad was drunk or having an affair. Her mom is pretty much her knight in shining armor. 

She’s explained to me that this whole dynamic has shaped her world view and gave her this whole “women are strong and independent” outlook. She has said multiple times that she’s a strong, independent woman, watches tiktoks frequently about “badass women,” most of whom are fictional, suddenly expressed wanting to be a lawyer because she saw a badass tiktoker lady going to law school, etc. 

Onto the actual topic at hand; in our household, I’m the breadwinner, pay most of the bills, cook nice meals because I enjoy cooking, buy the furniture, appliances, etc. She pays for groceries and dog food to contribute while she’s in school. But we agreed that after she finished school (she graduated two months ago), she would start paying for a portion of the rent and said $800 (of $2300/mo) would be a comfortable spot for her.  When that time came, she did not make the offer to pay her portion of the rent she agreed to. I gave her a break that first month and didn’t bring it up because she graduated a 3-ish weeks prior. 

The next month came up and she sent her portion ahead of time to which I thanked her, but hours later, she started getting flustered about being stressed financially and having stuff to pay for. I sent her half of it to keep her afloat until she got paid again, filled her gas tank 3 times over the weekend because we did a lot of driving, bought food for our dog, bought groceries, bought coffee while we were out, which is all fine because I can afford it comfortably. I’m happy to help my partner out when needed. 

We were on a walk with the dog over the weekend and while we were having a conversation, she pulls her phone out and starts voice texting her mom. We’ve already had several bickering sessions about “can we just have some time to ourselves without having to talk to your mom?” Like, we’re on a family walk in the morning for Christ’s sake. I say it in an irritated, sharp tone because this is the 20th time I’ve said this and she comes back with “you said it’s okay to be on my phone,” which isn’t true. I told her to do her Wordle game she does every morning while I was inside of Starbucks getting her coffee - she explained later that “do your Wordle real quick” translated to “be on the phone during our walk” (even though we’ve agreed that that is our brief hour of “us” time) in her mind. 

Fast forward to that night, I’ve been relatively quiet most of the day because I don’t want to argue over something stupid like that anymore, but I’m irritated that I’m sending her half of her rent back, buying gas, buying groceries, etc. just to get pushback on asking for a quiet family walk in the morning. 

Anyways, from her “strong, independent woman” and “I don’t want to be the quiet, meek girlfriend” dynamic, I feel like she always has something to say back. Like just saying “okay, let’s just have a quiet morning walk, texting can wait 45 minutes” is somehow shattering her ego and making her submit to the patriarchy (no, she hasn’t said that but that’s the impression I get). Almost as if she has to puff her chest out and show that she can stand up to a man. 

Moral of the story, it’s frustrating to feel like she always wants to challenge me when there was no challenge in the first place. This is starting to get really old, so looking for insight on how people have navigated this “strong, independent woman” thing. Has this been a deal breaker for anyone in the past?

FOR CLARITY - I want my girlfriend to be strong, I want her to be independent, I don’t have any issues with that. I think that’s awesome. What I have a problem with is the “I’ll show you that I’m a dominant household figure” crap from someone who needs me to subsidize part of her financial responsibility.

Friend lives alone in Bangalore but is currently out of town. Got a call from Blinkit delivery guy at 7:30 AM saying he’s outside her flat with a ₹3500 Cash on Delivery order.

She checked the app — the order was real but placed without her knowledge, while she was sleeping in another state.

Items included lemon tea, momos, c0nd0ms (multiple types), biscuits, and coffee.

She canceled the order, changed her credentials — still has no clue how it happened.

**------Full Story------**

So, this happened today morning, and honestly, it's straight-up weird and creepy.

A friend of mine lives alone in Bangalore, but currently, she's back in her hometown — her flat in Bangalore is completely empty.

Around 7:30 AM today, she suddenly got a call from a Blinkit delivery guy saying, ""Madam, main location par aa gaya hoon. Building ke saamne khada hoon.""

She was instantly confused — she hadn't ordered anything, especially not while being hundreds of kilometers away.

Thinking it was a mistake, she told the guy she's not even in Bangalore. He insisted and said, ""Please check your phone, madam. Order ID is \_\_\_. Total amount ₹3500. Cash on delivery.""

She checked the Blinkit app — and yep, there really was a legit order placed from her account.

₹3500.

Cash on delivery.

To her flat in Bangalore.

While she was sleeping, in another state.

She opened the order details and… I kid you not, the contents were:

* Lemon tea packets
* Frozen momos
* Dotted c0nd0ms
* Real feel c0nd0ms (???)
* Dairy whitener
* Cream biscuits
* Oat beverage
* Premium Nescafe
* Bru instant coffee

Like... what even is this combo?

She freaked out, called Blinkit customer service, explained the situation, and got the order canceled. Thankfully, they were helpful. But they couldn't help to figure out how the order actually got placed.

But now she’s seriously shaken — how was the order placed? No OTP, no confirmation? Was her account hacked? Was it a glitch? Someone nearby using her saved address?

The weird mix of items makes it feel less like a prank and more like someone was intentionally trying to order stuff to her empty flat.

She has changed her passwords and removed her saved address/payment options for now. But it’s left her (and honestly, me too) really unsettled.",1,1748519537.0,IndiaTech,2,1.0,False
1ky8tbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentsph/comments/1ky8tbf/got_told_i_didnt_deserve_to_study_in_manila/,got told i didn't deserve to study in manila.,"hello. apparently, i got told by my eldest brother that i didn't deserve to study in manila and that i'm dumb just because i didn't know what a latte drink was.  
  
for context, he is an alumnus of one of the prestigious schools here in the country. he's currently working for my parents' company and has a pretty good salary bcs of that. with that, he loves to brag about them, in a not-so-good way. if there's a chance he'd want to brag about them, he'd do it in a heartbeat. also, whenever he gets himself into an argument with any of us (siblings), he'd always love to involve his accomplishments to berate us. for instance, he and my sister got into a fight, then, at some point of the argument, he told her ""kaya 'di ka nag-(the prestigious school \[which i will not mention for anonymity\]) kasi wala kang alam."" to add, he's a ""know-it-all"" kind of guy, he always likes to teach us things. however, at most times, he also takes to opportunity to degrade us if we didn't know the knowledge he shared, as if we were dumb. he also doesn't like to be corrected by us (which i have several times haha). 

moreover, i got accepted into the same prestigious school where my eldest brother studied. he kinda told me he didn't believe i passed. he didn't even congratulate me when i got my CET results.

now, just earlier, me and my eldest brother were left alone in the car to wait for my mom and sister to pick up our coffee orders. then, my eldest brother asked me what my order was (which was a latte), particularly about the sub breve milk because he was curious why i added that instead of ordering the regular one. i replied, ""i don't know, the latte just tastes better with that"" but he kept on insisting me that i should know it. i mean i could've given him an answer, but i have an instilled fear of him shaming me for being wrong. so, no, i didn't give him answers other than ""i don't know."" then he proceeded to give me unsolicited life lessons about being knowledgeable when i'm going to be in manila for safety (which i'm very grateful for), but he, once again, rudely berated me. he told me ""dapat 'di ka mag-manila kung ganyan ka"" and ""ganyan palang kaalaman mo magma-manila ka na?"" 

in that moment, i was hurt, but i didn't really want to show that it did, so i just bottled it up. i know he had good intentions, especially with educating me, but i just didn't feel good about him telling me that i didn't deserve to study in manila. i know he's just being the brother he is to me, but i really got hurt by his derogatory remarks.

They can kiss my ass!,"I am currently still a federal worker (not sure how I've lasted this long in the administration). One of the major reasons I accepted the position I am currently at was for the flexible work options benefits it offered. Just 4 months ago all of that was stripped away from me and I am left with a pile of shit. 

One of the things I have heard people defending the 100% RTO mandate say is that local economies need to be stimulated after the negative impact covid had on these areas due to telework.  Even if I wanted to spend $20 per day on lunch alone near my office, I won't on principal. I want to prove all these bastards that have completely changed my life for the worse in just 4 months wrong any chance I can get.

I worked hard throughout my career to qualify for a job that granted me benefits I desired and needed to bring balance to my life and the life of my children. These motherf*ckers just come in and take that harmony away from my family for no f*cking reason. You also have been manipulating the private industry to do the same. Treat workers like shit, don't give any benefits they want. These jags can all rot in hell.

So you want me to spend my money near my office to stimulate the economy and help make you look good? Get the hell outta here! I'd much rather spend my money stimulating the economy around my home for coffee or lunch runs but you assholes took that away from me.

I get in, do my work, less efficiently, by the way, and wait until its time to get the hell outta there each day. No local economy is seeing any stimulus on my account. 

Starting to think all workers need to resist these billionaires and their puppets calling all the shots. Ideally, we should all just stop working until workers are treated like humans that deserve benefits...I wish this was possible. 

In the words of our dear leader...""I wish this so BADLY. I have never wished for something this bad. The level of wishing is like something I've never experienced before.""

[ A worker cleans a semi-finished product that consists of rubidium, iron and boron at a workshop in Baotou City of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Oct. 29, 2010. Rare earths, a class of 17 chemical elements, have become increasingly important in manufacturing sophisticated products, including flat-screen monitors, electric car batteries, wind turbines, missiles and aerospace alloys. TNS\/Zuma Press\/Xinhua\/Ren Junchuan](https://preview.redd.it/h6lweijphp3f1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=da2d134cd4e23c6dd7be99a0adeacd00804a106f)

President Donald Trump's trade war with China underscores the importance of a reliable supply chain for the automotive industry of rare-earth minerals and magnets made from them that are necessary for parts from electric vehicle motors to windshield wipers and anti-lock braking systems.

Rare earths describe 17 metallic elements with properties crucial for advanced technologies. Since a tax dispute shut down a rare-earth refinery in Vietnam over the past year, China effectively has had a monopoly on global heavy rare-earth elements processing and has major shares of processing for other rare earths. Retaliating against tariffs imposed last month by the Trump administration, China instituted new export restrictions and licensing requirements on seven medium and heavy rare-earth minerals, creating ""dire"" circumstances in the U.S. automotive industry if those rules are prolonged.

""The rare earth materials from China — how they are imported, not just for us but for the entire industry — has become rather complicated over the last few weeks,"" Kumar Galhotra, Ford Motor Co.'s chief operating officer, said on a May 5 earnings call. ""It would take only a few parts to potentially cause some disruption into our production.""

Trump reached a de-escalation agreement with China on May 12. For 90 days, the United States lowered its tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, and China decreased its tariffs to 10% from 125%. China also committed to removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2 against the United States, which included suspending export controls on rare earths to 28 mostly U.S. aerospace, defense and tech companies for 90 days. The licensing requirements, however, have remained in place.

The de-escalation, though, seems to have helped smooth over some of the processes in obtaining those critical minerals, said Collin Shaw, president of vehicle supplier association MEMA's original equipment suppliers group.

""It was a pretty dire situation there for a minute that the supply chain was struggling to get those out of China,"" Shaw recently told the Automotive Press Association. ""The administration did a great job negotiating, getting some relief there, not only on the tariff level, but also ensuring that some of the components can flow a little bit easier.""

But automakers and suppliers say the situation still isn't comfortable.

In a statement, German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH described the application process for importing rare earths for its suppliers as ""complex and time-consuming — partly due to the collection and provision of a large amount of data,"" but declined to go into details on its supply and logistics chain for competitive reasons.

“Rare earths are essential for the production of, in particular, electric motors for electric vehicles and some sensors,"" spokesperson Tim Wieland said in the statement. ""In the event of bottlenecks, we monitor the supply chains very closely and maintain regular contact to our suppliers and customers in order to minimize potential effects.""

# Chinese reliance

Rare earths are not uncommon. Their deposits, however, tend to be dispersed and not in concentrated amounts, making them more difficult to mine.

The United States is the world's second-largest miner of rare-earth minerals behind China, producing almost 50,000 tons in 2024 compared to China's almost 298,000 tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China also has enormous influence because most of the world's refining and downstream magnet manufacturing is done there.

Ian Lange, a Colorado School of Mines mineral economist, said although there's plenty of “good dirt” in the United States and across the globe with rare earths, there often are environmental concerns around their mining, especially when they are found with radioactive uranium. China also has subsidized its production, allowing domestic suppliers to supply the elements for cheap and stunting investment elsewhere.

""Every time,"" Lange said, ""a U.S. firm is like, ‘Hey, we've got this good rare-earth dirt, and we think we found a processor who can make it into what you want. Here's how much we think it would cost,' all the firms who might buy them go, ‘Yeah, that's about 20% more than China. We can't really risk that.’

“Finding a little bit better dirt doesn't change the fundamental equation that you can't compete with these subsidized monopolies,” Lange added.

Automakers and others reliant on rare earths likely are stockpiling in case China suddenly tries to pull U.S. access, Lange said. But a Chinese cutoff could force supply chains to move and the government to provide aid — if the Trump administration and Republicans are willing to save a commodity largely used for EVs and wind energy.

""I'm guessing there would be an all-hands-on-deck, start-running situation,"" Lange said. ""Between our stockpiles, our allies like Europe and Australia, and us starting to run, sure, it would kind of suck. But it's probably not the end of the world.""

Michael Silver, CEO of California-based American Elements, an advanced materials manufacturer that supplies the auto sector and other industries, however, says closing off the supply of rare earths would benefit no one. American Elements has imported rare earths from China for decades. The firm has the licensing needed to do so for 2025, Silver said, and expects soon to hear back on certification for 2026.

""We're waiting for the other shoe to drop after these permits come out,"" Silver told The Detroit News, ""to see if they decide, based on what's going on between the two countries and all the other negotiations, whether they're going to start using it as a process to restrict export volume.""

China has done so before, Silver said, and it's also used different prices of rare earths in China and in international markets to encourage companies to invest within its borders. Rare earths were less expensive in China than outside of it. In response, the United States, European Union and Japan filed action with the World Trade Organization, which ordered China to reestablish global pricing again in 2015.

""We need to get back to multinational negotiations,"" Silver said, ""where America uses the marketplace that China definitely wants to be in as leverage to say you can't operate in this fashion.""

Trump, however, has balked largely at agreements with multiple countries, saying they disadvantage the United States by compromising on certain issues to accommodate more than one country.

""A commodity market can be manipulated by the one nation that has the dominant share of the material, and that's the issue,"" Silver said. ""If a sovereign monopoly decides they want to put you out of business, you will be put out of business unless you can find someone who's going to subsidize your operation.""

The U.S. auto industry is in a particularly vulnerable position, said Nadia Schadlow, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. The former U.S. deputy national security adviser for strategy said Chinese control of rare earths and rare earth processing means ""a very important industry for the American economy can essentially be held hostage.""

""It’s not surprising that the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) would want to use this as a form of leverage over the United States,"" Schadlow told The News. ""They've done so in the past, even before the current tensions with President Trump over the current tariff discussions.""

But a total shutdown of rare-earths exports might not happen anytime soon, Schadlow said in an email, because Chinese officials want to maintain their leverage and keep options open with the United States.

# Other options

Automakers like Ford have sought to reduce their use of rare earths. Some innovators like Niron Magnets in Minnesota, which has worked with General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV, are developing ways to produce magnets without rare earths. Others are taking on China.

MP Materials in 2017 acquired an idled rare-earths mine in Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Investing more than $1 billion in the United States, it has a facility there to separate and refine the materials, and a factory in Fort Worth, Texas, to produce metal and magnets from the elements. It's made its first deliveries of the metal to GM and expects to deliver magnets before the end of the year, which the Detroit automaker has said will be used in its EVs.

GM also has an exclusive partnership with a Lithium Americas mine in Nevada and plans to source rare earth magnets from a South Carolina manufacturing plant owned by the German company Vacuumschmelze.

""We'll continue to execute our plan to develop U.S. sources for battery cell and electric motor inputs like lithium, rare-earth metals, permanent magnets and cathode active materials,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said on a May 1 earnings call.

China's April actions ""effectively highlighted a major strategic weakness in that 90% plus or minus of rare earths that are made in China,"" Matt Sloustcher, MP Materials' executive vice president of corporate affairs, told The News. ""It's an untenable supply-chain risk.""

A lack of investment and focus in the U.S. industry and cheaper operating costs in China contributed to the United States yielding the rare earths industry it developed to the Asian nation, Sloustcher said. Since April, with the world seeing the vulnerability of China having so much control, MP has had an avalanche of interest, he said.

""With scale and time and investment, we’ll be competitive,"" Sloustcher said, comparing expected costs to what Japan offers. ""Magnets are being sold at roughly the cost of raw materials. That is a very difficult proposition to compete against in the United States. Our strategy is around resiliency and security of supply. When we build enough scale and efficiency where we can be competitive and combine our attributes to the supply chain, the value proposition is clear for the manufacturer.""

He added: ""The reality is that if you don’t have access to magnets, you're not making cars. That's a huge liability.""

[China May Ease Rare Earths Export Controls for EU Semiconductors | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-May-Ease-Rare-Earths-Export-Controls-for-EU-Semiconductors.html)

China is considering easing its recently imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements for European semiconductor companies, [Chinese media](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202505/28/WS6837288ca310a04af22c212d.html) reported on Wednesday, signalling that Beijing may be attempting to stabilize global supply chains amid mounting tech industry panic.

In April, China added seven rare earth elements and related products to its export control list, making it mandatory for exporters to obtain licenses regardless of the end customer's nationality. While some licenses have been granted, the complex and lengthy approval process has caused confusion at customs and[ raised alarms](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/China-rare-earth-controls-could-starve-EU-factories-in-days-chamber-warns) among European Union manufacturers. 

The potential policy shift was [discussed during a meeting](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-may-relax-rare-earth-export-curbs-some-chip-companies-2025-05-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) hosted by China's Ministry of Commerce, involving over 40 Chinese and European semiconductor firms. Officials clarified the application procedures for export licenses, signaling a possible relaxation of controls for companies within the semiconductor supply chain.

According to China Daily, Beijing stressed that it “opposes unilateralism and bullying practices”, and advocates for supply chain stability. A representative of UK-based Omdia tech research company told China Daily, ""European semiconductor companies are very strong in industrial chips and auto chips. And China is the world's largest auto market and a major automaker. As a result, almost for any European chip company, China is their biggest market.”

Reuters cited Jens Esklund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, as emphasizing the urgency of streamlining the approval process to prevent disruptions in European manufacturing due to shortages of vital inputs.

Analysts note that China's dominance in rare earth processing—accounting for over 95% of global production—positions it as a critical player in the semiconductor industry. The recent export controls have heightened concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly for European firms reliant on these materials.

# MAY 27th, 2025~What can trade data teach us about U.S. critical mineral supply chains

[What can trade data teach us about U.S. critical mineral supply chains?  | Climate Leadership Council](https://clcouncil.org/blog/trade-data-supply-chains/)

Critical minerals supply chain security is drawing significant policymaker interest, with three executive orders and at least seven bills introduced this year alone. The heightened attention is due to the U.S.’s precarious position in the critical mineral market. The United States Geological Survey has designated [50](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals) elements and minerals as critical because they are essential to economic and national security and face a high risk of supply disruption. The U.S. is a minor player in the market, projected to hold less than [2%](https://clcouncil.org/blog/the-outlook-for-global-market-shares-in-critical-minerals/) global market share for key mineral extraction through 2030, and an even more minimal share of global processing. But thanks to rapidly growing advanced manufacturing capacity, the U.S.’s need for critical minerals is only increasing. 

In contrast, China controls [60%](https://www.gmfus.org/download/article/22418) of global production and [85%](https://www.gmfus.org/download/article/22418) of processing capacity, which has been built and maintained through decades of subsidies, export controls, and market manipulation. They have repeatedly indicated interest in leveraging their position for economic and geopolitical gain, committing to export restrictions on dual-use inputs such as graphite, gallium, germanium, and certain rare earth minerals in recent years.  

As part of its efforts to address supply chain security, the Trump administration launched a [232 investigation](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/FR-2025-04-25/2025-07273) into the national security risks of import reliance on processed critical minerals and derivative products. To support the investigation, the Council [analyzed](https://clcouncil.org/report/the-councils-public-comments-on-section-232/) trade data for key critical minerals—cobalt, lithium, graphite, and rare earths—to better understand the subtleties of individual critical mineral markets. We summarize our four key findings here: 

1. U.S. companies have already begun diversifying mineral supplies where possible. 

1. Diverse mineral sourcing may obscure significant exposure to Chinese market control. 

1. Where the U.S. is dependent upon Chinese imports, significant market manipulation can impede domestic investment. 

1. Where the U.S. is dependent upon Chinese imports, U.S. industry strives to invest in supply chain resiliency. 

**U.S. companies have already begun diversifying mineral supplies where possible…but diverse mineral sourcing may obscure significant exposure to Chinese market control.**

1ky8q0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaymoneyWubby/comments/1ky8q0y/my_first_wubby_dream_convention_venue_popup/,My First Wubby Dream - Convention Venue Pop-up Coffee Shop Barista,"I am blessed to finally be a part of the handful of other fellas who have had Wubby dreams. Hope this makes it into the lore somehow. It's crazy to think that this dude lives in our heads so freely to the point that he just shows up when we're sleeping from time to time, and he doesn't even have to break and enter.

  
The dream started off pretty normal, it was like I was just watching a typical stream. Wubby was talking about this venue he was setting up at some convention, all excited and slightly over-spoiling the different events and vendors as usual. He said there would be yoga mats spread out for people who are, verbatim, ""single and ready to mingle,"" and that he would be barista-ing for everyone with this nice pop-up coffee shop, akin to a Starbucks but with a special twist. He wouldn't tell us on stream what the special twist was going to be, but that alone piqued my interest enough to get me to go to this venue.



When I showed up at the venue, it was a scene reminiscent of the DashCon ballpit: big lofty warehouse, unnecessarily large yoga mats rolled across the floor, Wubby's coffee booth, and open & unused space everywhere else. There was not a soul on the yoga mats, since everybody was either already seated next to the booth, standing in line for coffee, or gone. It was clearly a disaster, but I figured since I was already there I'd say hello and get some coffee to go. 



As I'm standing in line, I find out Wubby is streaming during this because his mouth is moving like he's talking, but he's like looking down at a phone or a camera, and I can't hear him say anything from the back of the line. Wubby finally hands this customer their coffee, and immediately goes back to whatever he's streaming on talking and laughing, like he's not even listening to this dude's order at all. In between making the next-in-line's coffee and streaming, he looks up at the line and we make eye contact. He awkwardly laughs and looks down to the stream, then I laugh too *(because of the absurdity of* *wtf is going on, really)* which makes him laugh even more. He shuffles to the back of the booth, makes this dude another coffee same as the last, hands it off, goes back to chatting it up with chat, and the cycle repeats until I'm up and ordering.

  
I then proceed to order a coffee with literally *everything on the menu* just **dumped** into a single cup, because I'm curious if he was actually listening to the orders before me or not. I think I ordered something like a ""americano macchiato cappuccino mocha latte grande."" Wubby is clearly taken aback by the word salad of my order and laughs, ""Woah-ho-ho.. you might as well have ordered a brick of sugar, dude."" After that we exchange words, but at this point the dream is getting hazy so I don't remember what we said to each other. He wobbles to the back of the booth again, laughing at some bit from chat, but this coffee is taking so long that I start combing through business cards Wubby has laid out on the counter of the booth. I pick one up, it says ""Primary Arms, Daniel D. Larson"" in bold with a phone number and address, and I wanted to take it but was hesitant *(probably watched one too many Garand Thumb videos)*. I think I said something like, ""Oh hey, I know Primary Arms. They make good stuff."" despite having never looked at their store before. I said that as Wubby's still making my coffee, and he turns around to face me and says, ""You don't need a card!"" in a shocked, bordering on the edge of offended tone of voice. I move my hands as if I'm going to pocket it, and he repeats himself again this time almost aggressively, so I put it back down with the rest of the cards. Some more time passes, just awkwardly swaying back and forth at the counter of this booth waiting on my coffee as Wubby moves around in the back doing things with the cup of coffee, but I can't really see him nor the cup clearly. 



Finally, Wubby emerges from the back of the booth to the front of the counter and hands me my coffee, and like clockwork is back to his streaming device as the next customer is ordering. I shuffle into an open spot at this folding table nearby and take my first drink of it. Despite the hellish combination of different types of coffee grounds, multiple shots of espresso, and creams and foams, it actually just tastes normal if a bit sweet- exactly how I make it since that's how my Dad has always made it. At my second sip though, something's wrong and I can taste it. There's suddenly this hint of scorching that I didn't taste before, like the coffee had been sitting on the burner plate for too long and got burnt. I hold the cup in front of me to try and make sense of the label since maybe it'd explain the sudden shift in taste, and the label read, ""Café del Wubby"" with a cool logo on it, and my order scribbled in half-legible beneath it. My vision in the dream begins to shake and wobble with the corners of my eyes closing in, and I feel like I'm about to pass out. As I'm sitting there at the folding table, I'm panicking and I start grabbing at my chest, and I'm frantically looking around the table for help only to see everybody face down on the table, coffees spilled, items strewn about everywhere.

  
And the moment I was about to pass out and let my face hit the table, too, I woke up. 

It was so visceral that I sat straight up as soon as I woke up. Life's got me stressed out lately so I suppose that's why, but it's crazy that my brain decided to depict it in this way. I'm still kind of burnt that I never found out what specifically the ""special twist"" was before I woke up. Maybe the special twist was the memories I made along the way.

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, I love him but I feel unhappy and miserable. Since Christmas my feelings have been hurt every now and then. I'm a person who appreciates little details but perceives every little change on connection, how he talks to me, manners, etc. He didn't have anything for me on Christmas and lied saying my present was coming but never arrived any package. On February 14th we had dinner together, fine. I waited until my birthday and he gave me a little sanrio plush that it wasn't my fav character, which is so obvious if you pay 5% of attention. His excuse is that he has no money, but I have never saw him without his tobacco or maria since I know him.
 I saw him expending money on videogames and then he tells me he doesn't want to go on a walk because ""he has no money for a coffee""... 

He's being rejecting me for months and only having relations like on Christmas or my birthday.  Saying I'm not the problem, that he doesn't feel well and has no desire... That makes me feel so bad and insecure with myself. 

Says he loves me but hardly talks to me via WhatsApp or see each other on weekends even he does anything at all during the week. I see him depressed but he doesn't want to talk to me about it and rejects going to therapy. His words doesn't resemble with his actions and viceversa. I feel so lost, angry and sad because after talking about it several times he doesn't change. He doesn't take care of me as I do.


I would love to see him as he was at the beginning or a better version of himself. What should I do to get that outcome? Should I wait any longer?

1ky8o23,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ky8o23/dating_scene_in_your_30s/,dating scene in your 30’s,"Hey all,

Trying to gauge other gay bros expectations on gay dating and meeting up? I’ve been feeling a little exhausted by the types of guys I meet. Maybe I’m expecting too much, but I sort of would like a traditional style of dating where you meet for a drink or a coffee and maybe go to dinner and a movie on the second date.

What I sort of experience now is a lot of guys using Instagram to DM you and generally saying things like, “when are we meeting?” or kinda of sporadically messaging “hey”. And not really asking someone straightforward for a date or coming up with an idea of something to do. I don’t know if this is generally more of a booty call type of message or what. A lot of guys also appear to be in open relationships and are still on Tinder, hinge, Scruff, etc.

I guess it sort of takes the excitement out of dating? Not sure if other people receive these messages but it sort of comes across as lazy and also strange if you are already dating someone. It’s hard to find guys who are single and also seem to have their life together/can come up with any sort of initial message or idea of a date activity besides “I want to meet”. Not to mention starting to send you reels after finding you on Instagram but never really having an actual connection. It all feels really digital and kind of boring.

I’m not sure if it’s just the low effort social interactions that come from social media or dating apps but dating used to feel exciting and now in my 30’s it all feels more like a chore than something worth pursuing.

Any thoughts? Maybe it’s the dating scene where I live. Or I should be more selective about who I share my socials with. Not sure.

I feel guilty that he works such long hours at the sawmill and then comes home and helps either clean/cook or feed/change/watch our son. I can see how tired and dirty he is from work so I tell him to shower and eat and relax. He tries to help with feedings during the night but since he's up at 330 AM-430 AM every morning for work, I tell him just to go to sleep, even though I haven't slept a solid night since baby has been home (2 months already) I'm lucky to sleep 2 or 3 hours at a time..

1ky8kk6,https://i.redd.it/jt3pg7ltjp3f1.jpeg,$ATYR – The Patent Lattice: Inside the 385-Patent Fortress aTyr Built,"Hey folks,

Over the past few weeks, we’ve gone on a bit of a journey together through the heart of aTyr Pharma ($ATYR). We’ve peeled back the curtain on their development pipeline, dissected their dealbook and commercial strategy, and looked closely at the team dynamics behind the scenes. But today, I want to take us into a different kind of terrain—one that’s less visible but arguably just as important when it comes to long-term value: **intellectual property**.

What a company files—not just what it says in press releases—can tell you a lot about how it sees its future. And in aTyr’s case, that future appears broad, deliberate, and quietly ambitious. We’re talking about **385 patents filed over two decades**, globally, covering their proprietary biology, antibodies, diagnostics, combinations, and even niche applications that haven’t been publicly discussed. This is the structural scaffolding that supports everything else we’ve talked about—the legal and strategic architecture behind the science, the deals, and the people.

Today’s post is about reading between those lines. Not a list of every patent, but an interpretation of what the patent estate means—what it signals about aTyr’s ambitions, their optionality, their defence mechanisms, and their maturity as a platform company. It’s about connecting what’s on file with what’s in motion: the **Phase 3 efzofitimod readout**, the emerging **NRP2 oncology platform**, the **Kyorin deal**, and the capital runway that must be navigated smartly.

This is the fourth in a broader series of deep-dive analyses I’ve shared on Reddit:

* **Development pipeline and program structure**
* **Strategic deal history and partnership signals**
* **Team construction and leadership analysis**
* And now: **the IP estate**

This one might be the most forensic of all. Because if you know what to look for, patents don’t just protect—they *predict*.

Before we get started, a direct ask.

Thousands of you are reading these posts—literally thousands—and the engagement has been brilliant. I love doing this. But I need to work out a way to make it sustainable. Every post takes hours of research, deep analysis, and careful writing. Yesterday’s post? Huge reach, but not a single dollar in support. It adds up.

So if you’re reading this, just take a moment to remember there’s someone behind the scenes doing the digging, stitching things together, and making it accessible. If you’re getting value out of it—if it’s helping shape your understanding, your thesis, or even just your interest in biotech—please consider dropping a few dollars through [Buy Me a Coffee ](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). It *really* helps.

I want to build this bigger: more stocks, more deep dives, more data-rich insight. I’d love to eventually take some of you along for the ride—share the actual process, the research layers, the method behind it all. But we’re not there yet. First, I need to show that this model can work.

I don’t want to put any of this behind a paywall. I want it open. I want it available. But I also need to make it viable. If you can help—even just a little—it genuinely makes a difference.

And to those who already have: thank you. I see you.

Alright—let’s go deep.

***

### 2. Patent Landscape – The Strategic Blueprint

Let’s start with scope. aTyr Pharma has filed **385 patents between 2004 and 2025**, across the US, Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, and through the WIPO framework. This is not just quantity for its own sake. The filings represent a systematic effort to lock down key biological innovations, often years before they enter clinical development.

To be clear, I’ve compiled a full reference table with all 385 patents—jurisdiction, patent family, authors, filing years, and high-level keywords. It’s too large to include in this post, but it was built directly from the US Patent Office, European Patent Office, and WIPO databases. What I’ll present here is a curated synopsis of that work, breaking it into meaningful verticals that reveal how aTyr is building a layered platform—not just a single-drug story.

The portfolio is split across several core verticals:

* **Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS) and HRS-Fc constructs:** These form the pharmacological basis of efzofitimod and are covered extensively with patents protecting splice variants, conjugates, dosing regimens, and enhanced pharmacokinetics. This includes JP2025004141, EP3460054, and US20220098568. These patents support not just therapeutic application but also diagnostic positioning.
* **Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) antibodies:** aTyr owns a cluster of patents covering both the NRP2a and NRP2b isoforms, their antagonism, and applications across cancer, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory models. US20250074990 and EP4423142 stand out. Some even cover diagnostic modalities—e.g., use in immunofluorescence or IHC.
* **Other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) fragments:** aTyr has filed on tyrosyl-, glycyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase fragments with non-canonical functions—targeting cancer, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammation. US20160017311 and EP2414513 are key here.
* **Combination therapies:** There’s a suite of filings combining HRS or NRP2 antagonists with checkpoint inhibitors or anti-fibrotic agents. EP3548064 and US20180282402 suggest future therapeutic expansion—especially post-efzofitimod.
* **Legacy programs – Wound healing and hematopoiesis:** Earlier patents (e.g., US20110150885, WO/2011/072266) highlight work with p43 and tyrosyl fragments for skin regeneration, neutropenia, and post-injury recovery. These have never been surfaced to the market.

The filing jurisdictions align directly with their stated commercial ambitions. aTyr’s co-development deal with Kyorin in Japan—valued up to $175M—mirrors an intentional IP presence in Japan and China, suggesting future partnering or commercial rollouts are being prepared behind the scenes.

In short: this is not a ‘narrow moat’ company. It’s a **layered fortress**. And the IP tells you they’re thinking years ahead of where the investor deck stops.

***

### 3. The Narrative Beneath the Patents

At a glance, it’s easy to get lost in the volume. But when you look across the estate and the evolution of filings, a story starts to emerge—a story that clarifies how aTyr thinks, how they sequence their moves, and how they position themselves for future leverage.

First, aTyr’s early patents (2004–2011) are *exploratory but opportunistic*. They cover multiple synthetases, delve into non-canonical functions, and explore a wide range of therapeutic contexts—fibrosis, wound healing, immune modulation, and hematopoietic disorders. These years were more about biological mining—mapping the landscape and defining where their biology might lead.

Then, from 2012–2016, we see a focus shift toward *clinical translatability*. The patents begin to cluster around efzofitimod-like constructs—HRS-Fc fusions, therapeutic dosing strategies, and disease-specific applications (sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.). The filings become more jurisdictionally focused (US, EU, Japan), and we see a deliberate convergence on respiratory and immune targets. This period aligns with their first clinical trials and begins the transition from idea to asset.

From 2017 onwards, aTyr pivots again. This time, the emphasis is on *platform defence and optionality*. The IP begins to reach into oncology (NRP2 antagonists), co-therapies (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors), and diagnostic tools. There’s also a renewed interest in previously sidelined biology—tyrosyl fragments, p43 domains—being re-framed in new therapeutic contexts (e.g. wound healing, regenerative medicine, mucosal inflammation). These filings are strategic—they extend the runway of relevance and give the company room to evolve as data emerges.

In my view, the evolution of the IP map is a proxy for how aTyr has matured as a platform company. It’s not just an efzofitimod vehicle. It’s a company with decades of biological insight that has now figured out how to direct that insight—first into a respiratory immunology lead, and now into a second act in oncology, inflammation, and potentially more.

The patents don’t just reflect the science—they reflect the **strategy**.

***

### 4. What They Haven’t Told the Market

Here’s where things get particularly interesting. The bulk of investor-facing communications from aTyr focus on efzofitimod, pulmonary sarcoidosis, the Kyorin deal, and more recently, the NRP2 oncology programme. But the patent estate reveals a broader set of biological and commercial ambitions that haven’t yet been discussed publicly—at least not in any detail.

For example:

* **Wound healing and regenerative medicine:** aTyr holds patents on tRNA synthetase fragments (especially tyrosyl and p43) that accelerate skin regeneration, reduce inflammation in wounds, and modulate local immune responses. These filings predate their focus on pulmonary disease but remain active. They suggest optionality in areas like diabetic ulcers, surgical recovery, or even dermatology.
* **Hematopoiesis and neutropenia:** Several early filings (e.g., WO/2011/072266) describe applications for stimulating hematopoietic stem cells and mitigating neutropenia—suggesting potential future relevance in chemotherapy support or immune restoration.
* **Mucosal immunity and GI inflammation:** A subset of patents hints at applications for tRNA synthetase fragments in gut inflammation, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. These are undeclared in the pipeline but structurally robust from an IP standpoint.
* **CNS and neuroinflammation:** One small cluster of filings suggests exploration of neuroprotective effects and modulation of inflammatory cytokines in the brain, though this work appears very early stage. Still, it shows a conceptual reach that exceeds current disclosures.

What this tells me is that aTyr has deliberately kept certain cards close to its chest. These domains—wound healing, hematopoiesis, mucosal immunity—could be future licensing opportunities, partnered programs, or internal developments timed for a second wave of announcements. By locking in the IP early and saying little, they retain strategic control.

These are not “fantasy” indications tacked on for fluff. These are **documented, protected, and jurisdictionally extended opportunities** that could be activated if efzofitimod commercialises successfully or if platform interest accelerates.

***

### 5. What It All Means

This isn’t just a big pile of patents. This is structural, deliberate, and—critically—platform-defining.

When I step back and look at the full IP estate in context, here’s what stands out:

**a) This is a moat—both wide and layered**
Most small-cap biotech firms are built around a single clinical-stage asset. Maybe they’ve filed on the asset itself, and maybe a few dosing regimens or compositions. But aTyr’s filings span multiple synthetase enzymes, applications across organ systems, diagnostic applications, and therapeutic combinations. This is what a **platform company** looks like from a structural perspective—not just a clinical one.

**b) The IP estate is a proxy for aTyr’s organisational maturity**
The way the filings evolve—broad exploration, followed by therapeutic narrowing, followed by commercial layering—tracks very closely to how aTyr has grown up as a company. They mined the non-canonical synthetase space early. They focused into efzofitimod and respiratory disease mid-way. And now they’re surfacing oncology, inflammation, and dormant assets at a time when investor attention is growing.

That sequencing suggests a strategic patience that isn’t often present in small biotech firms. They’ve taken the long view.

**c) There is significant latent value that has not been priced in**
No-one in the market is modelling out wound healing, hematopoiesis, mucosal inflammation, or neuroinflammatory pathways into aTyr’s valuation. But the IP exists. The filings are live. And the jurisdictions are global. That gives aTyr **optionality**—to license, to partner, or to re-prioritise based on how the story evolves post-readout.

In a way, this is a story about *option value*. aTyr’s market cap reflects efzofitimod, maybe NRP2 oncology if you’re lucky. But behind that is a web of protected biology with latent potential that could be unlocked at any moment. That’s asymmetric.

**d) This is institutional-grade scaffolding**
When you look at filings across the US, EU, Japan, China, and Australia, it tells you this isn’t a biotech making noise to raise its next cheque. It’s a company that understands global exclusivity, enforcement rights, and partnering leverage. It positions them well for future licensing deals, ex-US commercial rollouts, or even M&A.

The story the patents tell is not just about what aTyr is doing now—it’s about how far ahead they’re planning.

And that’s the part I think most of the market has missed.

### 6. Strategic Insights & Institutional Signals

This section isn’t about what’s obvious—it’s about what’s *visible* if you know where to look. What follows are institutional-grade observations that emerged from sifting through the full 385-patent estate, cross-referenced with current clinical priorities, historical moves, and market positioning. These are the quieter signals that hint at aTyr’s long-term intentions, strategic optionality, and platform scale.

**1. Early Focus on Regeneration: Wound Healing & Hematopoiesis**
Multiple early-stage patents (e.g., US20110150885, WO/2011/072266) focus on using AARS fragments—like tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and p43—for wound healing and blood cell production. While these indications haven’t been discussed in investor decks or earnings calls, they suggest aTyr’s team explored regenerative medicine long before efzofitimod matured. These assets could find new relevance post-readout or be licensed to partners in cell therapy, dermatology, or haematology. In particular, there are echoes of this work in recent scientific interest around inflammation-resolving macrophages and tissue repair—areas that efzofitimod already touches indirectly.

**2. NRP2 Diagnostics, Imaging, and Isoform-Specific Targeting**
Several patents extend into diagnostic domains, covering NRP2 expression detection, imaging modalities, and assays to stratify patients. These claims are highly underappreciated in the current market narrative. The isoform-specific focus—especially around NRP2a vs NRP2b—offers future opportunities in oncology, fibrosis, and even targeted drug delivery. aTyr may be quietly positioning itself to play in the precision medicine and companion diagnostics space, adding value to any licensing or acquisition negotiations.

**3. Combination Therapy Footprint and PD-1 Synergies**
aTyr’s combination therapy IP is broader than commonly recognised. Beyond PD-1 inhibitors, several filings include claims around pairing HARS-based fusion proteins with cytokine modulators, anti-fibrotics, and other immune checkpoint agents. This opens the door for strategic partnerships with large pharmas running basket trials. These patents provide a legal scaffold for future expansion into combination regimens—a crucial angle for long-term lifecycle management.

**4. Intracellular Targeting and Intranasal Delivery**
aTyr has protected methods for targeting intracellular pathways via extracellular receptor engagement, with implications for CNS penetration and intranasal delivery. One set of patents outlines delivery via mucosal membranes, possibly anticipating indications in neurology or respiratory disease. These are subtle, low-profile clues—but they speak to optionality in administration routes and potential pipeline divergence.

**5. Global IP Footprint as Commercial Signal**
The sheer density of filings across Japan, China, EU, and Canada suggests a pre-commercial playbook well beyond the US market. The structure of many filings hints at future region-specific licensing. Kyorin is likely the first of several regional anchors. This also gives aTyr leverage in any M&A conversations: they own clean, broad IP rights across key territories, reducing risk for acquirers or partners.

**6. Dormant Platform Assets: Non-HRS AARS Fragments**
GlyRS, AspRS, TrpRS, and other AARS fragments appear in multiple filings but haven’t surfaced publicly in pipeline disclosures. This is an unactivated reserve. These molecules may possess anti-inflammatory or anti-tumour properties (as seen in academic literature) and could be explored under a new IND or out-licensed. These aren’t “just in case” patents—they’re the genomic equivalent of undeveloped real estate in a good neighbourhood.

**7. Immunomodulation Beyond Sarcoidosis**
aTyr’s patent claims repeatedly cover systemic diseases with immune dysregulation, including lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. While these haven’t been prioritised, they provide optionality for indication expansion, particularly with the immune-normalising mechanism of efzofitimod. These filings also build institutional confidence: investors and partners can see that aTyr is already thinking in terms of platform reach.

**8. Lifecycle Strategy Embedded in Continuations**
Many of aTyr’s patents include continuation filings or method-of-use expansions, suggesting they’re actively managing the estate as clinical data matures. This is not a static archive. It’s a living playbook—one that anticipates regulatory, clinical, and commercial moves up to a decade in advance.

**9. Intellectual Property as Strategic Leverage**
The depth and defensibility of the estate allows aTyr to negotiate from strength. Whether it’s licensing, raising capital, or exploring regional co-development, this IP estate is a powerful bargaining chip. For a company with under $400M market cap and no approved products, this kind of IP sophistication is rare—and it matters more in tight funding markets, where defensibility is currency.

***

### 7. Summary & Outro

If you’ve made it this far—respect. This was a deep one.

What we’ve just unpacked is one of the most structurally compelling IP estates I’ve seen in small-cap biotech. Not because it’s flashy. But because it’s disciplined. aTyr’s patent portfolio maps to an organisation that has done the hard, quiet work for over 15 years—layering discoveries, locking in protections, and gradually surfacing assets in a way that aligns with clinical maturity and capital strategy.

We’ve seen:

* A **385-patent estate**, spanning 20+ years and multiple jurisdictions
* **Deep protections** across efzofitimod, NRP2, and the wider AARS platform
* **Clear alignment** between the IP and the clinical strategy
* **Meaningful hidden value** in wound healing, hematopoiesis, immunomodulation, and oncology

In my view, this isn’t just a patent moat—it’s a **platform lattice**, and it’s one of the strongest arguments yet for taking the long view on $ATYR.

Thousands of you are reading these posts—literally thousands—and I love doing this. But it takes hours. Yesterday’s post took me an entire day, and I got nothing for it. I want to keep doing this and grow it—expand across more stocks, go deeper, maybe even bring some of you along for the journey. But I need to show that this is sustainable.

So if you’re reading this, just know there’s someone on the other end going to a lot of effort to put this together. If you got any value out of this, a few dollars would go a long way. Just click the link. *Seriously—it helps*.

I have been diagnosed with Type1 in 2019, at that time was prescribed Azelaic acid and Soolantra. I was told I need to stop eating sugar and always wear sunscreen. But dermatologyst was very indifferent to this problem, I literally was told that ""you just have to learn to leave with it, nothing you can do"". 
I tried Azelaic acid, but was afraid to try Soooantra bc I read some reviews about horrible Die off effect. 
Than Covid hit, then I got pregnant, had a child, breastfed for a year, pregnant again, another child, breastfeeding again. I am saying this, that I couldn't try some medicine during this time. 
This photo is taken yesterday. I am not even sure it's Type1 anymore. 
I have tried Metronidasol cream with no effect. Azelaic cream helps a bit, but not much. 
And whatever I put on my face - any super gentle cream for atopic skin - I have a burning reaction. This photo shows my ""good skin day"". I can't put sunscreen, anything with zinc makes my face burn. 
I don't know what to do. I haven't seen my face being less red than this for the last 3 years. I tried cosrx, la Roche, avene, cerave - everything makes me look like a tomato. I don't drink coffee, don't go to sauna, no alcohol, it's just always like this.
I am trying to find another dermatologist, but I live in Iceland, usually you wait for 3-4 months for a visit, and then they usually disregard this particular desease. Just tell to learn to live with it, and maybe do some laser treatment from time to time. 

I will really appreciate any comments with possible diagnosis of the type, and any advice for the routine? I understand that any diagnosis in Reddit is not a doctor's one, but also I don't see any harm reading comments about it, as it seems like I can't get any treatment officially anyway, except for laser and Azelaic

Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Started going to the gym 4 months back, skipped a few weeks for exams in between. I go 6 days a week (PPL), lost 1.2kg as of now, significant growth in arms and back, have a little chest fat so can't really say if it's developing, but I do feel sore the next day.  


My maintenance is around **2300kCal**, I consume around **2000kCal** and about **60–80g protein** only a day, want to have a **recomposition** overall.  


I'm a **day scholar college student**, and my classes will resume shortly, and I want guidance on when and what to consume on a daily basis.  


Usually, before maintaining a proper diet by day went like:

* I have **breakfast** (basic Indian BFs) at 6:30am, leave for college at 7am
* **Lunch** (brown rice & any curry made at home) at 12:00pm
* Return home at 5:30pm
* Have some electrolytes (ORS) or coffee w/ milk at 6pm and leave for gym
* Return from **gym** by 8pm and **dinner** (brown rice n roti & curry from noon) by 8:30pm
* Sleep at 12:30am and repeat (I get 2hrs of sleep on the bus too)

  
But from the last month, in my holidays I've changed my meals to 4–5 basic ones with high protein My meals include:

* Overnight oats
* 90g brown bread & 4 eggs (majority of my meals) (5 whole eggs a day)
* (If time permits) Chicken breast (air-fried)
* 50g soya chunks (air-fried)
* Brown rice, any curry, 3 eggs (mostly lunch)
* I do consume fruits, carrots, cucumber every day
* Guilty cravings – Diet Coke (4 a week), ice cream (once a week), special masala Maggi (once in 2 weeks)

  
Will be starting to take a **protein shake** (ON Gold Standard Whey Powder) which will give 24g more to my already daily intake of \~80g, but not sure when to consume this mainly.

  
**What I Need Help With:**  
**1.)** I need help with when and what to consume, and suggestions for easy high protein meals, can't spend much time in the kitchen.  
  
**2.)** Also need help with a good PPL workout routine (I can spend 1.5\~2hrs), keeping it effective and common ones, and not some overly complicated routines (e.g., Jeff Nippard style) since it’s hard to find someone to check my form, so keeping it simple and effective so that I can ask someone for form check if needed at the gym.",1,1748518075.0,Fitness_India,2,1.0,False

I have never had a close relationship with his family.. or any relationship at all. His family - mostly his parents - are not good communicators, even before our daughter they never took much of an interest in me, never knew what was going on in my life and we just didn’t have a relationship. Despite not taking an interest they still want to see us all the time and visits are always empty and I feel exhausted as there is just no meaningful conversation. I’m going to just provide a few example from the last few years to set the picture because a lot of the issues seem small on their own but the accumulation has created quite a tense situation and we don’t know what to do anymore. Sorry it’s a bit long but hopefully you hang in there 

Before baby: 
- his parents used to just turn up unannounced and expect to be invited in for a coffee etc. this could be at any time, 11am, 3pm.. 8pm when we were about to have dinner which ended up burning in the oven
- his mum once reposted a “facebook memory” of hers.. a photo of my partner with his ex, she added a caption “gorgeous people”. When my partner asked her why she did that she didn’t delete it and just said “well you have a past” 
- when we met up she never bothered to really get to know me, one time we went to the beach. My partner, FIL and I were in the sea, MIL reading on the beach I went up and joined her she didn’t lift her eyes from the book and ignored me, as soon as FIL and partner joined the book was away and she chatted to them 

During pregnancy: 
- never checked in or texted to ask how I was, when we’d meet then she’d ask (I think more out of social norms rather than actually wanting the answer). I had a few funny tests and results during the pregnancy I was speaking to her about one of the issues, she didn’t listen to me and told me all about what had happened to her friend 25 years ago, dismissed what I said, and she didn’t understand that what I had was different to what her friend had, and then she failed to actually follow up or ask about me 
- I would send photos of the scans and updates and she just gave the text a thumbs up response not even a simple “that’s lovely” just no interest 
- frequently shared her parenting experiences and they parented in a very different way to how we are, but she would never want to really listen to our plans and how we want to do it 
- I did try to extend an olive branch, around 20 weeks I invited her to come pram shopping with my mum, the day was fine and I hoped it would help improve things. It didn’t 
- randomly from 38 weeks pregnant she started texting and asking to pop in and visit me despite never having this 1 on 1 relationship prior to the end of the pregnancy. It felt as though she was trying to create a dynamic that doesn’t actually exist 
- I’d try and show her baby bits we bought and she just would go “oh nice” but not take much more interest or discussion 

After baby: 
- for context I originally through the whole pregnancy wanted to respect the 2 week newborn bubble, limit visitors, and just bond with baby 
- day 1 home from hospital my partner wanted to invite them round to meet the baby, I agreed that just the grandparents in both sides each could visit. His MIL and FIL come round… she has a cough and keeps going off to the toilet to cough then come back and then she still held my daughter (I regret to this day not saying something but thankfully she didn’t pass her germs to the baby) 
- for about a week she’d text each morning to ask how we were.. but she soon got bored of that the texts all stopped 
- 1 week post partum they invited us to a bbq for baby to meet great grandparents and aunties (my SILs). I agreed reluctantly. When we arrive my MIL’s friend is there who I had only met about 2 times and she came and held my baby before anybody else and within less than 5 minutes of us being there. The rest of the visit was either my baby sleeping or feeling like a game of pass the parcel. I cried so much after getting home that day as being away from my baby so much made me feel so disconnected and baby blues hit hard
- 2 weeks post partum we invited 2 friends to meet baby, MIL, FIL and SIL turned up about 15 minutes before with donuts and proceeded to stay while the friends visited despite not being invited and it was a bit awkward 
- in the early weeks I met her a few times to try and give a little, but on one occasion she text to ask if she could come round. She ended up bringing her daughters and a random friend who I hadn’t expected to be coming. Another time she asked and invited another of her random friends I didn’t know to mine to meet my baby and for my partners birthday she hosted a BBQ (inconsiderately at my daughters bedtime) for all her friends to meet my baby 
- she once text to ask to pop in. I was trying to get my newborn to sleep so I missed the text. Next thing I know she’s knocking on my door, comes in and then asks to take my baby who I had just got to fall asleep.. she immediately woke up and I couldn’t get her back to sleep and then she just leaves after getting her cuddle 
- at Christmas we went to them for Boxing Day, it was my daughter’s first Christmas, a special day obviously, we arrive, we don’t even sit round the Christmas tree, the presents are just handed to us at the kitchen table and it felt very chaotic and so not special for my daughter.. we have no photos from the day which is a shame. Then for the present they got me and my partner concert tickets to join them for a months time, but they knew I’d never left my daughter over night, I exclusively breastfeeding and my daughter was going through a really bad sleep regression. I text a couple days later to say thank you for the gift and day but I won’t be able to join for the concert and apologised. She read and ignored the text and nothing was discussed again 
- I was then quite off with them when we next saw them given how she handled the concert 
- about a month later she then asks my partner if I’m alright or if they’d upset me. He then basically tells her everything and she says she really wants a relationship with me as her DIL and with her granddaughter. My partner basically said look you need to communicate, respect boundaries, send the odd text to ask how they are, you have no idea what’s going on in her life find out. She says okay 
- this was 4 months ago, haven’t had a single text lol she just likes every Instagram story post and I think she thinks that’s her way of building a relationship ?
- circle back to the concert, we then found out they sold my ticket to a friend but didn’t get me an alternative gift or apologise for the poor gift choice and lack of thought about my daughter (other joke was that the only people who could have looked after my daughter were my parents who were due to be away that weekend… so even if I wanted to go I couldn’t they didn’t think to check or find out. Just thoughtless) 
- I then went for a coffee with MIL and tried to bring up the conversation my partner had had with her. She dismissed everything I said and then told me they think I’m too devoted to my daughter and that’s why they think I should have gone to the concert because I need to do stuff for me (bullshit, if she knew anything about me she’d know I hav a lovely group of friends and I do plenty for myself) and then when they went to the concert they didn’t even send a text to check in on me and how my daughter was or if she went down for bed alright.. given they’re supposedly so concerned about my wellbeing I would have thought a quick text would be the least ? 
- the relationship has since been quite strained we didn’t see a lot of them for a bit 
- about a month ago they came round for dinner. My partner and I were clearing up, my MIL was watching my daughter then after a few minutes she was on her phone on Facebook ignoring her. This was the first one on one time they’d had together and she chose her phone ? 
- my daughter doesn’t like being held by her 
- it was my daughter’s birthday last week, we had a party on the weekend, his mum hasn’t asked a single question about her birthday, our plans, no reflection on how it’s been a year/how do we feel. Then we saw them the weekend before and when they left we all said bye see you next weekend at the party (after the birthday). So as far as I’m aware we aren’t seeing them on her birthday, and we had made plans around that understanding. Monday evening she then says to my partner, we will come round at 5pm tomorrow then to give the gift. ????. I text her and said no that won’t work sorry we were due to be at my parents for dinner and then coming home and putting her straight to bed, I offered for them to come round at 8am before her morning nap. MIL replies “that doesn’t work for us we are happy to come at 6/7, we assumed it would be ok to see her on her first birthday” I was furious as I made it clear that time doesn’t work for my daughter and they had taken NO interest before this point in the day. In the end we changed plans and they came at 6pm. No thank you for accommodating them or apology for making us change our plans. On her birthday we didn’t get a text either to wish her a happy birthday or to ask how the day was 
- it was the party on the weekend, we are avoiding UPF until my daughter is at least 2… so no generic shop bought bread, she knows this, when I wasn’t I the room she tried to give her a hot dog bun and my mum thankfully reminded her we don’t do that. She then later told me she is doing a bbq for my partners birthday in August.. despite not asking us or knowing what our plans are.. and my partner doesn’t even want her to do a bbq! She seemed very put out when I said I’ll talk to my partner and we will let her know 
- finally, yesterday was my daughters 12m jabs, SIL forgot her gift on the weekend so MIL text to ask if they could drop the gift round and pop in. I said because of the jabs, no I’m not having visitors or plans thanks for understanding. MIL reads it.. ignores it.. doesn’t even ask how my daughter is. A few hours later after still hearing nothing I sent “”daughter” is doing okay, by the way, the jabs were tough and she cried a lot, but she had a good nap and just has a bit of a fever. Thought I’d send a quick update as I assumed you’d want to know how she is… the 12-month jabs are a big one for little ones (and mums!)” MIL then made up some bullshit excuse that she tried to text but didn’t have signal in the middle of the town centre. I wondered why she didn’t message when she got home if that really was the case. 


Anyhoo I think that demonstrates how awful the relationship dynamic is my partner is exasperated and has had enough of her but when he tried to speak to her she didn’t listen, when I tried to speak she dismissed me. I don’t know what to do. I want nothing to do with her anymore tbh, but for my daughter and partners sake I just want to be civil. So ideally I want to talk clear the air maybe even get an apology but my partner doesn’t want me to start the conversation he wants it to somehow come from them. 

BTW… I have been nothing but accommodating of them, my partner agrees I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to apologise for and it’s only really been in recent weeks I’ve started declining seeing them and being a bit more bolshie with my replies because I just can’t live like this anymore!

and I've been trying a bunch of different ones, but it's hard to remember which I liked or compare them easily.

So... I ended up building a little site to track them. (Developer instincts 😎)

If you’ve ever wanted to keep track of the capsules you've tried or see them all in one place, feel free to check it out!  
  
It’s a super simple site. If you want to add more detailed tags to a capsule, just click on its card to add your own notes and preferences.

I’m also thinking of adding a flavor preference chart later on,  
so I can better understand my own taste profile over time.

Right now it only includes Nespresso capsules (since that’s what I started with),  
but if there are other brands you’d like me to add, feel free to leave a comment, I’d be happy to expand the database!

[https://www.whats-the-best.in](https://www.whats-the-best.in)

1ky8axw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ky8axw/cigarettes_and_coffee_triggering_heart_rate_up_to/,Cigarettes and coffee triggering heart rate up to 170bpm,"Hello,

25f, 167cm, 52-55kg

A month ago, I ended up in the ER because of high heart rate of 150-160 which was not going down with breathing exercises, rest or hydration for 1 hour. Other symptoms i had were extreme fatigue and dizziness, feeling faint even when lying down, severe shaking and white fog in vision. I was told it was a “panic attack” and sinus tachycardia, given IV bromine and sent home.


The following week I was fine, went to a cardiologist, got a 24h holter monitor and was sent home. The next morning after half a cup of espresso and 2 cigarettes, I felt again weak and dizzy, decided to go up my apartment to lie down a bit. Heart rate went up to 156 for 2 minutes, same symptoms, was not responsive to rest or breathing exercises. I called the cardiologist who put the holter monitor on me and she asked me to go to the hospital she was on shift at. ER again, EKG done, again sinus tachycardia, again labelled as a panic attack and they shot me with something called “antialerzin” (promеthazine hydrochloride, 25mg) and sent me home again. The next day I am like a vegetable, slept for 20 hours, severely dissociated. Felt slightly dizzy when smoking first cigarettes, but it went away. 

The next day i got prescribed ivabradine 2.5mg morning and evening. The holter registered average heart rate of 90-100 during the day, lowest one 65 during sleeping and 156 the highest. When i smoked, i felt lightheaded, tingling in legs and over sensitive skin. Thought it could be because of CO levels and didnt pay much attention. 

I took ivabradine for 1 week only in the mornings, because it made me very tired, low energy, and focus and concentration were not enough for me to finish my thought. The day i stopped taking it, i felt better immediately. 

Here, severe problems with smoking begun: i couldnt smoke even half a cigarette without heart rate going to 120 and feeling severe tension in leg muscles. So i started taking it slow and smoking only a few puffs per hour or two. 

This was working until this week’s monday, when i had 20 grams of wine and half a cigarette in the late afternoon. For 10 minutes pulse went 120 > 136 > 144 > 156 > 170. Velerian root based pills did not help, water did not help, resting, breathing did not help, it stayed like this for 1 hour. I went into the ER again, again was given IV bromine, heart rate dropped to 100bpm and I was sent home.

I stopped smoking for 48 hours so nervous system calms down. And yesterday decided to try to light up one cigarette. The second hit made my heart rate go to 144, fortunately, it balanced out quickly this time. 

I have visited 2 cardiologists, they have ruled out any cardiac issues.

Could anyone here help me with finding the root cause of this?

Apologies if i have missed any info that could be important, please, feel free to ask. 

P.S. I am taking some steroid combined with antihistamine nose drops as i have allergy to something unknown (air). Skin tests were done, but skin did not react to any allergens. Symptoms of the allergy: at first runny itchy nose, teary eyes, also itchy, a lot of sneezing and feeling fatigue. A month later, these symptoms faded and my throat was getting swollen after i smoke and i had difficulty breathing. Sometimes the initial symptoms wre coming back (when environment is was changed) and throat was not swelling at all. Got medication prescribed and made a 2 months course with steroid nose drops and antihistamine pills which stopped working around the first ER visit and medication was changed.

One of the major reasons I accepted the position I am currently at was for the flexible work options benefits it offered. Just 4 months ago all of that was stripped away from me and I am left with a pile of shit. 

One of the things I have heard people defending the 100% RTO mandate say is that local economies need to be stimulated after the negative impact covid had on these areas due to telework.  Even if I wanted to spend $20 per day on lunch alone near my office, I won't on principal. I want to prove all these bastards that have completely changed my life for the worse in just 4 months wrong any chance I can get.

I worked hard throughout my career to qualify for a job that granted me benefits I desired and needed to bring balance to my life and the life of my children. These motherf*ckers just come in and take that harmony away from my family for no f*cking reason. You also have been manipulating the private industry to do the same. Treat workers like shit, don't give any benefits they want. These jags can all rot in hell.

So you want me to spend my money near my office to stimulate the economy and help make you look good? Get the hell outta here! I'd much rather spend my money stimulating the economy around my home for coffee or lunch runs but you assholes took that away from me.

I get in, do my work, less efficiently, by the way, and wait until its time to get the hell outta there each day. No local economy is seeing any stimulus on my account. 

Starting to think all workers need to resist these billionaires and their puppets calling all the shots. Ideally, we should all just stop working until workers are treated like humans that deserve benefits... ",44,1748517738.0,antiwork,6,1.0,False

1ky85of,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1ky85of/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

(quick definition for the sake of clarity : the persona is the part of your psyche that you present to others, especially the social world where interaction takes place without intimacy. It isn't ""alive"" in the same way as the anima or shadow might be, as it is generally very conscious, so much so that people might confuse their ego and persona.)

Now let me delve into the questions :

\- What does it look like to confuse ego and persona, and what does a healthy balance look like ?

\- If your persona disintegrates, your options are?

(e.g. you see how far from being your full ego it is, and it doesn't fulfill your psyche's needs enough anymore), you either go the way of regressive restoration or... what ? You walk your way towards a more complete personality ? Does that mean your persona... Shifts ? Transforms ? Or does that mean you actually stop playing games, and express your ego even in social settings?

\- Finally, and maybe the most important for me rn : what do you do after seeing your ability for evil more clearly?

If you glimpse (say through active imagination) the dense darkness of your own mind (of your ego? Shadow ? Total psyche?) - what do you do then ?

I feel like I'm more dangerous than I thought, but I don't want to harm others. Am I supposed to develop a less nicey-nicey persona and be more visibly capable of aggression, without going out of my way to express it ? If not, what else ? (Gorge Clooney sipping coffee starts playing)

Thanks for reading and can't wait to read your thoughts. Am kinda stressed out, but also I do trust that being conscious beats sheer ignorance so fuck it, we ball. 🙏",1,1748517098.0,Jung,3,1.0,False
1ky82xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1ky82xj/first_dose_yesterday_so_far_so_good/,First dose yesterday - so far so good,"So I took my first 2.5mg dose yesterday after dinner, so far no major side effects 🤞🏻.  At the moment I have a little headache, however I think that is from going cold turkey on my Pepsi Max and drinking around 3ltr of water.  In the past, I get headache when I drink to much water (overhydration)

For the two days before taking it I ate clean and upped my water intake.  After my shot I felt hungry but only had a satsuma and a couple of corn fritters as a snack.  Despite not being a breakfast person, I had a some overnight oats with berries this morning, I wasn't very hungry.

In my BMJ (before MJ life), I would drink about 2ltr of liquid per day (water, Pepsi, coffee plus water in food) so I am guessing my headache is the combination of lack of caffeine and the extra water.   Has anyone experienced similar with overhydration?

Personally, I don't expect to see any major weight loss in the first few weeks, if it happens good but if not, I will still stick to my journey.  I have promised myself I will stick it out for at least 6 months and only up my dose when my weight plateau for 4 weeks.  I'm hoping I am one of the lucky one's that can stay on a low dose throughout my journey.

I will try to kept updating my journey here as it progressing ☺️",2,1748517069.0,mounjarouk,2,1.0,False

1ky7zgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidquestions/comments/1ky7zgy/have_reddit_mods_turned_into_the_internets/,Have Reddit Mods Turned Into the Internet’s Corrupt Cops?,"Okay, hear me out. You ever just be vibing on Reddit, maybe dropping a spicy meme or sharing your two cents, and then—BAM!—your post is gone, or worse, you’re hit with a ban hammer outta nowhere? Yeah, same. I swear, some Reddit mods are out here acting like they’re the main character in a cop drama, but instead of fighting crime, they’re just power-tripping over who gets to post what.

It’s honestly giving mall cop energy. They’ve got all this power, and suddenly they’re acting like Judge Judy, the FBI, and your mom all rolled into one. Like, chill. We’re just trying to talk about our favorite shows or whatever, not start World War III. But nah, say one thing they don’t vibe with, and you’re out faster than you can say “karma farming.”

Rules? What rules? Sometimes it feels like mods just make stuff up as they go. One day, a meme is totally fine. Next day, it’s “against the rules” because some mod woke up on the wrong side of the bed. And don’t even try to ask why—you’ll probably get hit with a “read the rules” reply and a ban for “arguing with mods.” Like, bro, we’re just asking questions.

And the wildest part? There’s literally no one to report this to. Reddit admins are just chilling in the void, sipping their coffee, not caring at all. So mods can just do whatever, and if you get banned for no reason, tough luck. It’s like trying to report a corrupt cop to his own squad—nothing’s gonna happen.

All this power-tripping just kills the vibe. People stop posting, cool convos get deleted, and suddenly the sub is just a bunch of recycled memes and mod-approved takes. Where’s the fun in that? Reddit’s supposed to be about sharing ideas, not tiptoeing around mods who think they’re the final boss.

Reddit mods are basically the internet’s version of corrupt cops—power-hungry, no chill, and totally unaccountable. Just let us have fun, dang. Maybe one day Reddit will actually care. But I’m not holding my breath, lol. Anyone else got mod horror stories? ",14,1748516734.0,stupidquestions,31,0.68,False

>

Sounds like another fitness scam, right?

We thought so too..... but then we actually tried **Java Burn 2.0**, checked the ingredients, looked at third-party reviews, and put it through a real-world test.

Let’s break it all down .....no BS, no fluff, just what works and what doesn’t.

👉 [Try Java Burn 2.0 here](https://81e3e6l705jq6xegfof9wmvk99.hop.clickbank.net)

# What Is Java Burn 2.0?

It’s a **flavorless powder** you mix into your **morning coffee**. The idea? Turn your normal caffeine hit into a metabolism booster and fat burner......without needing to go keto or live at the gym.

Each pouch contains a 30-day supply and it blends instantly into hot drinks without changing the taste.

# What’s in it? (Ingredients Check)

Java Burn 2.0 includes:

* **Green Tea Extract** (rich in EGCG) – boosts fat oxidation
* **Chromium** – supports stable blood sugar levels
* **L-Carnitine + L-Theanine** – supports metabolism and mood
* **Vitamin D + B6 + B12** – helps energy and hormonal balance
* **Chlorogenic Acid** – a compound found in coffee shown to help with weight management

No artificial additives, sugar, or preservatives.

# What Does It Taste Like?

This is the part we were unsure about..... but surprisingly, it’s **totally flavorless**. You won’t even know it’s in your coffee.

No weird aftertaste. No gritty texture. Just coffee.

# Our 7-Day Real Test (What Happened)

We tried Java Burn 2.0 daily in our morning coffee for a full week. Here’s how it went:

✅ **Day 1–2: No dramatic changes**

Felt slightly more awake than usual, but nothing wild. No crash either.

✅ **Day 3–5: Noticeable energy boost & reduced appetite**

Midday hunger pangs dropped. It wasn’t like ""I’m full forever""..... but snacking urge was definitely less.

Energy felt steady too.... not jittery like when you overdo caffeine.

✅ **Day 6–7: Slight shift in mood & focus**

Felt more focused during work sprints. Also noticed better digestion and lighter feeling after meals.

***Did we drop 5 kilos in a week?*** *No.*  
But it made our normal healthy habits *easier* to stick with ...... which, honestly, is the biggest win.

# What Real Buyers Are Saying

Across Reddit, YouTube, and independent reviews:

**Positives:**

* “Easiest habit I’ve ever added for weight loss”
* “Stopped afternoon sugar cravings within 3 days”
* “Energy without the crash — even on black coffee”
* “Lost 3–4 kg over a month without crazy dieting”

**Negatives:**

* “Didn’t feel much for first few days”
* “Results depend heavily on what you eat and your activity”
* “Only works if you drink coffee daily”

# Pros & Cons

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Easy to use with daily coffee|Results vary — not magic|
|No taste, mixes instantly|Doesn’t work if you don’t drink coffee|
|Good science-backed ingredients|Not cheap (\~₹3,000–₹6,000/month)|
|Supports energy, focus & fat metabolism|Not for pregnant or caffeine-sensitive folks|

# Who It’s For

Java Burn 2.0 is great for:

✅ Coffee drinkers looking for a clean metabolism boost  
✅ People already doing light exercise or intermittent fasting  
✅ Anyone who wants to burn fat without changing routines too much

It’s not ideal for:

❌ People who skip coffee or can’t handle caffeine  
❌ Anyone expecting overnight fat loss  
❌ Those who want a meal replacement — this isn’t it

# Price & Affiliate Link

Java Burn 2.0 usually costs between ₹3,200–₹6,000 depending on bundles and deals.

# Final Verdict

No, it’s not a “magic fat melting powder”......but **Java Burn 2.0 actually surprised us**.

If you’re already drinking coffee every morning and want to *boost metabolism, reduce appetite, and stay focused.....*this is a legit add-on to try.

We’ll keep using it for another month and report back. But for now? It earns a *solid thumbs-up* from us.

For three years, Kailen and Ruby couldn't stay away from each other. Lingering touches during press events, inside jokes in interviews that made headlines the next day.



My Instagram comments were brutal: ""She's just the stand-in."" ""Poor girl doesn't realize she's the backup plan.""



I never made scenes. Just smiled for the cameras, told reporters ""we're very happy"" when they asked about the latest photos of Kailen and Ruby at some rooftop bar.



Then I got pregnant. I terminated without telling him.



When he found out, Kailen's face went white, then red. He slammed his fist against the wall of our Malibu home.



""What the hell were you thinking?"" His voice broke.



""Why would you do that?""



I touched his face—the same jawline as his brother's—and said quietly, ""Because this was never real, Kailen.""



The truth hung between us.



""I can't have a baby with someone I don't love.""



His eyes widened as he finally understood.



""It was always Jayden for me. It's always been Jayden.""



\--



Everyone knew Kailen Sinclair only married me to make Ruby Miller jealous.



They'd broken up before the wedding, with Ruby storming off to Europe out of jealousy.



Kailen didn't chase after her—instead, he put a ring on my finger.



I walked down the aisle in a designer dress that never felt like mine, marrying a man whose heart belonged to someone else.



The gossip sites all predicted the same ending: ""Once Ruby returns, he'll dump her faster than a pit stop tire change.""



But something unexpected happened in our third year of marriage. Kailen seemed to actually fall for me.



He'd bring me coffee in bed, kiss me awake on lazy Sundays, and smile when I'd playfully demand his attention.



During our most intimate moments, tangled in our sheets, he'd whisper against my skin, ""Sweetheart, let's have a baby. A sweet one, just like you.""



We began feeling like any normal couple in love.



Until the day I found out I was pregnant.



Before I could tell Kailen, Ruby Miller came back to the States.



And just like that, they got back together.



Chapter 2



It happened to be the day their Harvard reunion at some overpriced Manhattan bar the night Ruby Miller came back to the State.



Everyone was gossiping about how her family's tech empire had collasped overnight. She was apparently desperate for cash.



When Kailen guided me through the crowd, we spotted Blake Reynolds—heir to Reynolds Petroleum—shoving drinks toward Ruby at the bar.



""Another shot equals another hundred grand loan,"" Blake drawled, his Rolex glinting under the lights. ""Simple math, sweetheart.""



Ruby's mascara streaked as she choked down each burning shot, maintaining that beauty queen smile even as her eyes watered.



When she spotted Kailen, her composure cracked. She stared down at her empty glass like it was suddenly the most fascinating thing in the room.



""Well, if it isn't America's fastest man!"" someone called out. ""Ruby, why bother with Blake's pocket change? Your ex is worth what—half a billion now?""



""I bet one night in Sinclair's bed would solve all your financial problems,"" another voice jeered.



Kailen took a long drag of his cigarette, his expression bored, but I felt his muscles tense against me.



""Keep talking and you'll be drinking through a straw tomorrow,"" he said flatly, resting his arm around my shoulders. ""And anyone who makes my wife uncomfortable can get the fuck out.""



The crowd laughed nervously, calling me ""Mrs. Champion"" and commenting on how protective Kailen seemed.



None of them knew he'd only shown up tonight after seeing Ruby's name on the RSVP list.



Ruby glared at me, her knuckles white around her glass.



Blake's hand slid down her back. ""Guess the racing superstar's moved on,"" he smirked. ""But I'm still buying what you're selling.""



""Strip for me tonight, and I'll write you a check that'll keep those creditors away for a month. Small price for damaged goods, right?""



The ash from Kailen's cigarette fell as his jaw clenched. To anyone else, he looked merely annoyed. But I recognized the cold fury building behind his eyes—the same look he got before a dangerous overtake on the track.



Ruby looked up at Kailen, her gaze steady despite her tears. ""Not interested,"" she said, voice barely audible over the music.



""I've only ever loved one man,"" she continued. ""Even if he's forgotten me, I won't let anyone else have what was his.""



Kailen's fingers dug into my hand so hard I nearly gasped.



Blake laughed, running his hand through his slicked-back hair. ""Playing hard to get with a foreclosure notice? That's fucking rich,"" he sneered. ""Tell yourself whatever fairy tale you want—you're coming home with me tonight, princess. Consider it charity work.""



He grabbed Ruby's wrist, dragging her stumbling figure toward the exit. She tried pushing him away, but the alcohol had taken its toll.



Kailen's eyes tracked her every movement. His breathing had changed—shallow and quick, like before a crash.



Just before they reached the door, something in Kailen snapped.



He moved with the same precision that had made him legendary on the track. Three strides, then his fist connected with Blake's jaw with a sickening crack.



Blake hit the floor. Kailen was on him instantly, pinning him with a knee to the chest.



""Touch her again and I'll break every fucking bone in your hands,"" he snarled, landing another punch. ""You'll never sign another check in your life.""



People scrambled for their phones. I rushed over and grabbed Kailen's arm, feeling the tremors of rage running through him.



""Kailen, stop—you're going to kill him,"" I whispered urgently.



He turned to me, and in that moment, I was looking at a stranger. ""Back off,"" he said coldly. ""This isn't your business.""



I froze, the wedding ring suddenly heavy on my finger.



Ruby threw herself between them, her perfectly manicured nails clutching Kailen's bloodied knuckles. ""Please stop,"" she begged, tears flowing freely now. ""Your hands—your career—don't ruin everything because of me.""



""I thought... I was so afraid you really didn't care anymore..."" Her voice broke, the strong facade crumbling completely.



Kailen didn't hesitate. He wrapped his arms around her, shielding her from the crowd's stares and camera phones.



Everyone watched in silence as America's racing legend walked out with the girl he'd never gotten over.



I stood alone in a room full of people, holding my clutch purse and the shattered pieces of my marriage.



Chapter 3



Kailen never came home that night.



At 3 AM, Ruby posted on X: ""You said you'd never hold anyone else's hand again.""



The photo showed interlaced fingers, with the unmistakable birthmark on the man's hand—Kailen's distinctive freckle that racing fans recognized from a thousand podium photos.



And just like that, I became the ""anyone else"" whose hand he would no longer hold.



Within ten minutes, #SinclairAffair was trending.



Ruby's supporters flooded her comments: ""Get your man back, girl! You two were ALWAYS endgame! ?""



""Screw loyalty—I'm Team Kailen Cheating if it means watching Vivia's fake ass get dumped lmaooo""



People were grabbing popcorn, waiting for my public meltdown.



A few loyal fans defended him: ""That's not Kailen's hand, right? @KailenSinclair your wife has supported you through everything. Don't throw away what you have, man.""



Our joint sponsorships were worth millions—Rolex, Tiffany, that stupid kitchen appliance campaign where we pretended to make breakfast together. The contract penalties alone would bankrupt most small countries.



When our agent couldn't reach Kailen, she called me in a panic: ""Post something, anything! Make it look like you're together. We need damage control NOW.""



I scrolled through my camera roll, realizing how few photos we actually had together. In the rare ones that existed, I was always the only one smiling.



Finally, I posted an old picture of Kailen reading at home, bathed in warm lamplight. He looked just like Jayden in that moment—same profile, same furrowed brow of concentration that had made me fall for the wrong brother years ago.



Comments immediately flooded in:



""See? The champ's at HOME with his WIFE! Anyone saying otherwise can catch these hands! ?""



Everyone started trashing Ruby, calling her an attention-seeking liar.



Until Kailen himself retweeted Ruby's post five minutes later.



Under that damning photo of their intertwined hands, he wrote simply: ""Yes, that's me.""



Just like that, he publicly acknowledged their reunion while exposing my pathetic attempt at covering for him.



Once again, he'd thrown me away for Ruby Miller.



Her fans invaded my mentions: ""Caught in 4K trying to fake your marriage lmaooo get rekt Vivia ?""



""Three years and you couldn't keep your man. Pathetic.""



Who said I ever wanted Kailen's heart in the first place?



I deleted every trace of him from my phone.



Divorce papers suddenly seemed long overdue.

For the past few months, I saw all the discussions regarding the summer frags and even got a shit load of decants to try out, but I was on the lookout for something special.

That’s when I found out about this little beauty (hard to miss with all the hype in this sub surrounding this, and Hawas). I wasn’t sure about this as everyone talked about how sweet it was or how it didn’t feel masculine. Still, I went ahead with a decant and I was blown. I ordered the full bottle on the very same day (Special shoutout to Khanna Brothers for the quick delivery and good price).

The fragrance is intoxicating. It opens with that sweet vanilla flavour with the hint of coffee, but wait a few mins and you can smell the cinnamon with every whiff. I understand this might not suit everyone’s taste, but I absolutely loved it.

I had a few sprays and it feels amazing right out of the box. That being said, it’s gone into the box, macerating/maturing/resting, and getting ready for cooler days.",22,1748516398.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,16,0.93,False

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

>“*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y — include updated scope and pricing*.”

And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

* You can ask questions inside documents, like “What’s missing here?” 
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It’s like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 

The best part? It’s free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)

1ky7umx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonestBuyerReviews/comments/1ky7umx/what_is_the_genius_wave_honest_review_of_this/,What Is The Genius Wave? Honest Review of This Brainwave Audio Program,"Honestly....we were skeptical.

When we first heard about **The Genius Wave**, it sounded like one of those “just listen to this audio and become a genius overnight” kind of gimmicks.

But then we actually tested it out.... every day for a week.... and things got interesting.

Here’s everything we experienced, what The Genius Wave really is, what it isn’t, and whether it’s worth your time (and brain space).

# What Is The Genius Wave?

**The Genius Wave** is a digital audio-based brain training program that uses **theta wave frequencies** to help unlock deep creativity, reduce mental clutter, and promote focus..... without meditation, supplements, or hours of journaling.

# In plain English?

It’s a 7-minute audio track you listen to daily that’s supposed to put your brain into a “flow state” ....like the kind you get when you're effortlessly creating, thinking clearly, or solving complex problems.

The team behind it claims it taps into something called your “Genius Zone.”

👉 [Try The Genius Wave here](https://ab1db6r0u2cnducellnl59zzc8.hop.clickbank.net)

#  What's Inside The Program?

Here’s what you get when you buy:

* **The Genius Wave 7-Minute Audio** (Main track)
* **Quick Start Guide** to help you use it effectively
* **Bonus Tracks** for deep focus, sleep, and manifestation
* Science-based breakdown of how the theta wave frequency works

# What We Actually Experienced (No BS)

We committed to listening to the main track once a day for a full 7 days. Here's what we noticed:

**Day 1–2: Just chill vibes**

The track is relaxing. No lyrics, just low-frequency sounds .... kinda like a spa mixed with sci-fi vibes. We didn’t feel “genius,” but we did feel calm.

**Day 3–4: Clearer focus during deep work**

Writing and problem-solving felt less “foggy.” It wasn’t dramatic, but that mid-afternoon brain haze? Slightly less awful.

**Day 5–7: Surprisingly effective deep work sessions**

This is where it clicked. We'd put on the audio before writing, brainstorming, or planning..... and ideas flowed better. Coincidence? Maybe. But it felt real.

**Also:** it helped kill distractions. We weren’t tempted to check our phones mid-task.

# What Real Users Are Saying

After our test, we scouted the internet to see if others had the same experience. Here's a summary of what real users said:

**The Good:**

* “Helped me beat procrastination blocks”
* “Put me in the zone faster than coffee”
* “Didn’t expect much, but I’ve used it daily for 3 weeks now”
* “Felt calmer and more productive before meetings and creative work”

**The Not-So-Good:**

* “Didn’t work immediately — took a few days to feel anything”
* “It’s basically brainwave audio, so not a magic pill”
* “Works better with headphones — speakers don’t do it justice”

# What Is Theta Wave Frequency Anyway?

Without geeking out too hard: **theta waves** are brainwaves linked to creativity, relaxation, and learning. You’re usually in a theta state when you're falling asleep or daydreaming.

Genius Wave tries to *induce* this state consciously using binaural beats..... meaning different tones played in each ear.

👉 It’s been studied. Not as a miracle, but as a legit tool for improving learning and cognitive flexibility.

# Pros & Cons

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Only 7 minutes a day|Won’t “make you a genius overnight”|
|Great for mental clarity and focus|Needs headphones to be effective|
|No woo-woo – just brainwave tech|No visible results for 2–3 days|
|Can stack with journaling, meditation|Not ideal for people who hate audio tools|

# Who Should Try The Genius Wave?

This is for you if:

✅ You want more creative clarity or less mental noise  
✅ You work in a creative or problem-solving field  
✅ You’ve tried meditation or journaling but want something faster  
✅ You like biohacking tools or brain optimization products

It’s *not* for you if:

❌ You expect magical instant results  
❌ You’re sensitive to audio frequencies  
❌ You don’t have 7 uninterrupted minutes a day

# Final Verdict: Worth It?

If you’re expecting a miracle, The Genius Wave won’t deliver.

But if you’re looking for a **low-effort, non-distracting way to clear your mental slate and boost creativity**, this one is surprisingly solid. Especially for writers, entrepreneurs, coders, or students who hit brain fog often.

👉 [Try The Genius Wave here ](https://ab1db6r0u2cnducellnl59zzc8.hop.clickbank.net)

It’s not hype..... it’s a tool. And for us, it earned a spot in the daily productivity stack.

1ky7u9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/1ky7u9o/consumables_33_redux_1/,Consumables (3/3) (Redux 1),"Dr. Matthew Kontos is a very specialized scientist, with very specific training. He exists because of very specific things-ok, no he doesn't. He exists because the Korschans are tired of getting sick, and they do not want to be sick anymore, and so they have been doing something about it. This something has been a massive drive towards public health in all of it's varied avenues, and Kontos has been a-oh, what's that?

'Author, can I actually tell my own fucking story?'

'Yes. If you would like-'

'Being a doctor doesn't mean I don't fucking curse, and I like swearing. Now sit down and shut up.'

'...you're not very formal.'

'I don't care about formality much. I'm taciturn. Not formal. Even when I'm happy.'

'I think I have mischaracterized you.'

'You're damn right.'

'Damn? Is that a religious thing from a sect where you're from-'

'No, I picked it up from a paper.'

'Ah-'

'I really don't like it when you use every little thing as a way to do conworlding. It gets fucking annoying.'

'I-'

'Sometimes the curtains are just fucking blue, moron!'

'Yeah.'

'Just do the fucking interview format. Hurry up. I gotta leave.'

'Question 1: Why did the Korschans focus on developing medical research and pharmaceutical production?'

'You ever seen someone shit themselves to death? It takes a while and it's fucking disgusting. They suffer the entire time. It leaves an impression. We did not forget that. Watching people
die from a sip of bad water is a horrifying thing. That's our motivation.'

'Question 2: What was medical research development like?'

'Well, can't get into that without getting into building a medical system. It's where the research is supposed to come from. After the revolution, we seized the medical academies and linked them into an academy network. The intent was to teach doctors and nurses and a modern medical system. A plan had already been developed-the First Nine Year Plan-for medical development. It was set of hospitals-basically, we had to supersede it immediately, because it wasn't nearly fucking enough. There was fucking nothing. Fucking nothing. You have healers and hedgewitches going around trying to stop cholera outbreaks killing tens of thousands, and no one wanted to do the job because you didn't get paid well and there were thousands dying-the church can't do
enough, because it's a church, not a fucking medical department. It's a mass casualty event. We need the capacity to treat tens of thousands at a time, and we had to develop that.'

'Um...'

'I'm getting to that. The Second Nine Year Plan was a bit better. It increased the amount of hospitals that needed to be built by several hundred precents-some big ass number-and also understood the need for medical support facilities. It was supported by good architects, who understood what a hospital actually took to make-and then they had to throw the thing out and go to the Third Nine Year Plan because we didn't have enough personnel. The third time was not a fucking charm, either, since it didn't take into account production of medicines. They did a fourth-this one in public-and then the Fifth Nine Year Plan was the final result. It wasn't useless, and we made it work. The medical academies were ours, and so we knocked them into being a system-literally.  We set up a bunch of research labs next to them, 4-7 labs with a head researcher-unified the medical libraries, set up grand rounds and rotating lectureships-'

'I have a question.'

'Man, go fuck yourself with your question! I'm talking here.' Kentos cleared his throat and continued. 'You can't do scientific inquiry or engineering work worth a damn without the society that
can actually fucking handle putting it together and then making it into something big enough to help everyone. You need hundreds of thousands of people, working around the clock, making more than their weight in stuff, to deal with what the fuck we're trying to handle here. This means that we had to get all of those people working, you understand? And you can't just tell them
to show up, or 'just'-in air quotes-train them. You need to fix their fucking heads.'

'So like...modernize their minds?'

'Yes. A thousand fucking times yes. You need to show them cause and effect. The fact that we did that with all of that economic improvement shit, that it was done in steps that they could
understand, that they were doing it directly-it made them encouraged enough to keep working, and it taught them enough to enable them to keep improving things. The magic of progress
became positive for them, possible for them, and they wanted that shit. We flipped the fucking switch to make mechanization ok, you get it?'

'Yeah. I wanted to believe that, but you confirmed it.'

'You're the fucking author, you can just say it happened!'

'But it's better if you say it because you watched it happen and felt it happen.'

'Are you manipulating me?'

'No. You are my character, but I am writing you as you are. If I'm not honest, then this whole thing doesn't work for either of us.'

'Tch. Stupid bint. You're delusional-don't do that fucking quote. What do you want me to talk about next? The fucking chemical industry?'

'Yes.'

'So that's the topic of this little post-'

'You are one of the most qualified people I have ever written to discuss this topic, and I trust your statements on it.'

'True. Then we're back to public health. The planners worked through two parallel 'paths' to improve the chemical industry: food based chemistry, and conventional modern chemistry, like dyes.
Conventional modern chemistry is essentially killing people and looking flash: gunpowder and dyes. Purple, especially aniline based dyes, and making nitrogen compounds-this involves shit
like processing coal, processing shit, and mastering the 'engineering involved in temperatures and pressures'-your fucking quote. Which is important, because we don't want to fuck up and
either waste money or blow our shit up. Food chemistry was a lot more simple, because it could be-it started with fucking ethanol, beer-distillery shit. Preservation of food. Elimination of nasty
little bugs. Making stuff taste nicer, early fortification-we don't need to know about vitamins to fortify stuff with them.'

'Are you just putting stuff on there without knowing it's a vitamin?'

'Yeah, and I'm gonna break the scientific fourth wall here to give a better explanation. Clean up after me, nerd. We know something does a body good. We don't know why. We don't need to 
know to put it on the food in large quantities and to get the benefits of it. You're a lot healthier when you have more vitamins, you're happier when you have more sugars, and that's why I
drink black forest coffee-made from bark-and replace sugar with honey. I'm not getting slammed on vodka every night, I'm getting obese from fried foods and mediocre beers.'

'You should not do that.'

'Bitch, I grew up in a famine! I fucking starved! Shut the fuck up! That's why I'm fucking here, working my ass off, so that no one else has to fucking starve! Kiss my fat ass!'

'I...'

'What, you're sorry? You wanna be just like me? Huh? You think I'm a hero? Fuck-'

'Well, yeah! Fuck you think I'm writing someone like you for in the first place, fun?'

'You know what...you fucking...ok. Ok. Ok. Ask your next fucking question.'

'Honestly, you did a great job answering most of them, at least partially.' 

'Yeah yeah, go fuck yourself. What's next?'

'Can you tell me about the time scale of the chemistry effort?'

'Oh. Yeah. That's easy enough. The food chemistry stuff was semi-centralized and locally coordinated-mostly decentralized. People were able to expand food industries-not ag, food processing-
and were able to build up with not too much support. This doesn't need too much technical support, and people could learn from the ground up-since there is a massive countrywide education
effort. We used this to keep teaching principles and basics, and move to direct application. On the other hand, building the formal chemistry stuff-that wasn't steel-focused-much, much harder,
since everyone was working on steel products...because you need reaction vessels and piping. You need, need, fucking need quality piping for that, otherwise you'll die. And the immediate 
demand for that kind of steel went to artillery, so there was more delay. At least we worked on fucking uhhh feedstocks while fixing those kinds of issues. We moved slowly, and got good
results. It was worth it. We saved a lot of time and money.'

'It sounds like things went well.'

'They did. It was best practice.'

'What's feeding into the chemical plants?'

'Processed crops and coal gas based stuff. The processed crops are typically shredded down, pulped, and liquified or made into solutions. The coal gas gets retort-ed into liquids and gasses in 
canisters, and fed in. Coal gas sucks. We're also really leaning into reactions from seawater sources using electrochemistry. Generating power isn't cheap or easy, so you know we're making
enough in social costs back to support it.'

'Social costs?'

'Yeah. The cost of having people dying of typhoid fever are large, but the capitalists won't recognize them because they can externalize them. We don't, so we fuck the typhoid fever up, and
that makes us a lot more money in costs saved overall. Also, we're not dying of typhoid fever and being morally bankrupt assholes. Also, we're way fucking off topic. You're cocking this up.'

'Eh. You told me a lot of interesting stuff, and we learned things we just wouldn't have otherwise. Let's talk again.'

'Everyone is gonna think you're going schizo.'

'Nah. I'm just going avant-garde.'

Not that I’m looking for anything. Sometimes I just enjoy chatting, even if it’s with scammers. They can be funny sometimes as long as you can be smart about it. Don't send identifying information, don't send money, don't sign up on anything. I don’t really believe in the idea of “time-wasters,” because if you never follow a lead, how would you know which one might actually turn into something worthwhile? That said, I’ve definitely had my fair share of them. Here’s one of the more memorable stories.

One time someone DM'd me saying he lives in my city and wanted to meet up. I said sure, and set a time and place that worked for me. Right before plans with friends in that area, so low effort either way. Day of, he said he was gonna be late. I said I was gonna be at the cafe until 2pm and then I will leave. 2PM rolled away and he didn't show up so I left. No hard feelings on my part, I enjoyed my coffee alone and I was on time to meet with friends.

When I told him I left, he insisted he was just a few minutes away, he was just walking there, and he begged me to come back. He seemed genuinely frustrated that I left. Was even guilt-tripping me. I didn’t feel guilty though, I gave him an hour and that’s more than generous.

I didn't block him after that cos his genuine frustration was interesting to me. Also he wasn’t being creepy, no demands for pics or money or anything, so I kept him in my DMs. And because I didn't block him he was still trying to meet with me. And I gave him a second chance.

Same deal: I made a plan that fit around brunch with friends. Told him I’d be at the restaurant from 10 to 11 AM, and that if he didn’t show, I’d block him.

You can guess what happened. 11 hit, of course no show. He messaged me saying he overslept, was jet-lagged, etc. I said, “What’s next, your door handle caught your sleeve so you couldn’t leave the house?” Then I blocked him.

Did that stop me from answering Reddit DMs? Lol, nope. They were minimal damage, and I’m chronically bored anyway. And ironically, I met my current SD *sort of* through Reddit. We first connected on Seeking, but we also messaged here, I did not realize he was the same guy. Now we’re in an ongoing SR.

So yeah, I don’t think Reddit is completely barren of real SDs. They’re just rare. I mean it’s already rare to find someone close to your location, and even more rare to find one that actually *matches* you, right? But I'm curious what you girls think. Do you answer DMs? Would you ever entertain a Reddit SD, give him a chance, meet up with him and see where that leads?",4,1748516158.0,sugarlifestyleforum,14,0.83,False

I just want to go home.

I don’t know where my home is.

Growing up as a lonely only child with not so present and controlling parents, over time I developed avoidant attachments.  
It sucks to realize that for years, I wanted to be loved but I was the one pushing people away.  

I never had a good relationship with my parents, they were too controlling. 
After years of emotional abuse, I learned to maintain strict boundaries. 
 It gave me space and time to heal from them.

Then, with my ex-wife, things started to fall apart. After five years of marriage, she began to become controlling too.
 It triggered my avoidant self all over again. We had ego clashes , conflicts and what not.

After the divorce, everything felt so heavy. It felt like everything is just against me , I never got that peace at home . 
Over the time I became that stereotypical divorced, workaholic manager everyone resents.  
Work and study were always my ways of coping. I took therapy eventually, and after a year into it I started to express my emotions and started taking accountability of my decisions

I don't know how on earth I got this fortunate to find love again after a messy divorce, I started dating again and the only peace I have now is my girlfriend. I rest my head on her lap, she caresses my hair while I crib about  everything. 
And suddenly things starts to make sense and feels good again .

But I don’t want to depend on her for peace.
 I don’t want to hand someone else the responsibility of being my home.
 I want to be that for myself.

I’m 35. Sitting in my house. Coffee in hand.
 Everything looks fine from the outside.
But inside… I still whisper to myself, 
“Mujhe ghar jana hai.”

Maybe one day I’ll build that home inside me.

Like, this one guy kept shifting his weight to give more space to the woman in front of him even though the line barely moved. It's gotta be some unspoken rule, right? It got me wondering about how different cultures have different ""bubble"" sizes, and we're all subconsciously aware of it to some level.

I think it's fascinating how we learn these cues, maybe from observing others or just social norms ingrained over time. It makes me wonder if some people are more sensitive to personal space breaches or if it's just me being a bit over-analytical. 🤔

Could they feel the need to adjust because of past experiences or maybe upbringing? Maybe there's this internalized script for certain social settings, like at cafes versus, say, a concert where everyone’s kinda on top of each other.

Hi all - thought we'd post our new setup! :)

We went for the Mazzer Philos & ECM Synchronika II, along with the Knock Drawer Co.'s Grounds Breaker and Tamping Station. On the left are Airscape cannisters we've had for years.

This is our first espresso setup - until this we had a Gaggia Accademia bean-to-cup which served us well for about 6 years until it bit the dust. When it died, we took the opportunity to change our coffee routine into something more deliberate. We've had everything for about 6 weeks now, and barring a slightly frustrating ~~dialling-in~~ learning experience, we are really happy! Coffee is a luxury we really get to enjoy now! :)

Anyway, hope this helps someone! Seeing everyone else's setups really helped me to visualise what we were getting into, so maybe this will help someone else! Thanks to everyone this sub for being an invaluable resource on this journey.",3,1748515831.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I am 28, and AFAB.

I have been having this burning chest pain that comes and goes (especially when I am trying to sleep at night). It radiates to my should and down my arm and into my wrist - all on my left side. The pain sometimes radiates near my left armpit as well, and I get this strange tight, soreness on the left hand side bottom of my ribs.
The last 2 days, when it happens, the pain in my shoulder, wrist and elbow have been worse, and the last 2 fingers on my left hand have been feeling tingly. The pain has also started radiating to my right shoulder as well. I've also developed a sore throat too.

I am not having trouble breathing at all, and I am not wheezy (although I do have asthma). I also don't *feel* sick, I dont have a fever, and I don't have a stuffy nose. I do sometimes have a bit of a dry cough, but I am also a smoker.

For years now I have been getting these awful headaches that come on suddenly and make the back of my head - specifically where the base of my skull meets my neck - ache and it feels like there's a lot of pressure there too.
I spoke to my doctor about these symptoms today and he said there's a chance there may be something to do with my cervical spine or neck, but I would have thought these chest pains etc would have been present earlier as I have been having these headaches for a while now...

I take dexamphetamines for my ADHD, so when my doctor did an ECG, my heart rate was fast. 

I do not drink alcohol and only have 1 cup of coffee in the morning.
I don't eat a lot, as my medication doesn't make me very hungry.

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, “Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?”

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

> “Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y — include updated scope and pricing.”

And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

• Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs

• Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations

• Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate

• Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

Sorry for the double post (because I remember reading something similar around 2 weeks ago and can not find the thread anymore). 

My situation: I shop abroad (mostly Germany) --> getting my salary on an UBS account (bad decision probably to go with them, but it is what it is) where a also have an EURO savings account.

To the actual problem : I noticed some months ago that UBS is really slow with processing payments and on weekends they do not process at all. 

Example (because I took screenshots) :

Kaufland invoice in euros : 248.45 euros --> did shopping on a Saturday --> initially it showed and debited this amount : 233.11 CHF (everyone is happy .. parity looks good .. but guess what .. no commissions) .. after some DAYS ... I see my account lost some money and see the updated value to : 240.88.  --> let's say on bigger amounts it is doable.. but if I go to Italy on vacation and pay with this card for smaller things (coffees / cappuccinos / aperols ) you will kinda get fucked with their added extra commissions.

So now I am thinking of a solution to bypass this --> transfer, let's say, an amount between 500 - 900 CHF  into my Euro savings account (which should be commission free) and then do a SEPA payment to a different account , in euros where I could pay more relaxed.

And now the question would be : which solution would be the best and with the least commissions to do this : I do have a Revolut account, but I kinda don't like it that much and would prefer to not use it anymore ... any cheap banks or something out there ?

1ky7hkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1ky7hkj/curious_about_rd_in_mechanical_engineering/,Curious About R&D in Mechanical Engineering?,"If you’re a mechanical engineering student, fresher, or someone stuck in a ""same design, different day"" job… and you’ve ever wondered “What do people in R&D actually do?” – this post is for you.

Spoiler alert: it’s way cooler than you think.

**A)  What Does the R&D Department Actually Do?**

Think of R&D (Research & Development) as the brain and heart of innovation in any company. These are the folks who don't just follow rules — they rewrite them.

Here’s what their day looks like (on a good day — not when the coffee machine’s broken):

**1. Building New Stuff**

From scratch. Be it a new engine part, a lighter chassis, or an improved cooling system – they design, prototype, and test like mad scientists with a mechanical degree.

 **2. Testing Wild Ideas**

Ever wondered who comes up with that “new and improved” version of products? Yep – it’s R&D. They experiment with materials, processes, and technologies that don’t exist in textbooks yet.

 **3. Fixing What Ain’t Easy**

R&D engineers solve the kind of technical puzzles that make you go, “How did they even think of that?”

 **4. Collaborating Like Pros**

They don't work in isolation. They bounce ideas off design, production, and quality teams to turn theory into real, working machines.



 5. Breaking & Rebuilding

Every idea, every design – tested, failed, fixed, and tested again. Safety and performance don’t happen by chance.

**B)  What’s the Career Scope in R&D?**

Let’s be honest — you’re not just here to learn, you’re thinking, “Is this a solid career move?”

Short answer: Yes, and here’s why 

**Work in Cool Industries**

Automotive, aerospace, renewable energy, robotics, consumer tech — take your pick. If it moves, heats, cools, rotates, or flies — R&D is behind it.

 **Career Growth? Oh, Yes.**

You could start off testing materials and end up leading innovation for an entire company. Positions like R&D Lead, Technical Head, or Innovation Manager aren’t just titles — they’re real paths.

 **Become a Specialist**

Love thermal systems? Materials science? Fluid mechanics? You can go deep and become that go-to expert every project depends on.

 **Go Global**

Big MNCs and international collaborations? R&D opens doors to travel, learn, and work on futuristic stuff with teams around the world.

**C)  Thinking of Choosing R&D as a Career?**

Here’s how to know if this is your thing:

 You Love Core Engineering

You actually enjoyed subjects like mechanics, materials, or thermodynamics? You’re already ahead.

 You’re a Curious Creature

If your brain is always asking “Why?” and “What if?”, welcome to the club.

You Like Solving Problems (Even the Tough Ones)

If debugging and testing doesn’t frustrate you but fires you up — you're R&D material.

 You’re Okay with Failing (A Lot)

Let’s be real – not every experiment works. But the thrill of that one breakthrough? Totally worth it.

 You’re a Team PlayerYou’ll be bouncing ideas off designers, manufacturers, analysts… R&D isn’t a solo sport.

 **Final Thoughts:** Is R&D Right for You?

R&D isn’t just a department. It’s a mindset. If you want a career that challenges your thinking, values your ideas, and lets you build the future — then this is your [calling.You](http://calling.You) won’t just be designing parts.

You’ll be asking, “What’s next?” — and then going out and building it.

**So, ready to step into the lab of ideas?** 

Because real innovation needs real engineers — like you.",1,1748514936.0,UIUC,0,1.0,False

A friend of mine lives alone in Bangalore, but currently, she's back in her hometown — her flat in Bangalore is completely empty.

Around 7:30 AM today, she suddenly got a call from a Blinkit delivery guy saying, ""Madam, main location par aa gaya hoon. Building ke saamne khada hoon.""

She was instantly confused — she hadn't ordered anything, especially not while being hundreds of kilometers away.

Thinking it was a mistake, she told the guy she's not even in Bangalore. He insisted and said, ""Please check your phone, madam. Order ID is \_\_\_. Total amount ₹3500. Cash on delivery.""

She checked the Blinkit app — and yep, there really was a legit order placed from her account.

₹3500.

Cash on delivery.

To her flat in Bangalore.

While she was sleeping, in another state.

She opened the order details and… I kid you not, the contents were:

* Lemon tea packets
* Frozen momos
* Dotted c0nd0ms
* Real feel c0nd0ms (???)
* Dairy whitener
* Cream biscuits
* Oat beverage
* Premium Nescafe
* Bru instant coffee

Like... what even is this combo?

She freaked out, called Blinkit customer service, explained the situation, and got the order canceled. Thankfully, they were helpful. But they couldn't help to figure out how the order actually got placed.

But now she’s seriously shaken — how was the order placed? No OTP, no confirmation? Was her account hacked? Was it a glitch? Someone nearby using her saved address?

The weird mix of items makes it feel less like a prank and more like someone was intentionally trying to order stuff to her empty flat.

She has changed her passwords and removed her saved address/payment options for now. But it’s left her (and honestly, me too) really unsettled.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar with Blinkit or any other delivery app?



**TL;DR:**

Friend lives alone in Bangalore but is currently out of town. Got a call from Blinkit delivery guy at 7:30 AM saying he’s outside her flat with a ₹3500 Cash on Delivery order.

She checked the app — the order was real but placed without her knowledge, while she was sleeping in another state.

Items included lemon tea, momos, c0nd0ms (multiple types), biscuits, and coffee.

She canceled the order, changed her credentials — still has no clue how it happened.

What if the next Coffee Talk game took place 100 years after Episode 2?

Still rainy Seattle, but now with flying cars, neon skies, and an even more diverse society. The café remains unchanged, tucked in a quiet corner—its warm lights a constant in a world that’s moved on. It’s become a haven for the long-lived, the immortal, and the quietly nostalgic.

You still play as the Barista—but >!now it's clear: you're not quite human. You’re the child of an alien and a human, hinted at in Episode 2 when Hyde says the world will leave him behind—but not you. Quietly immortal, you’ve watched generations come and go, brewing drinks for all of them.!<

Familiar faces still visit:

Hyde is still around, of course. Still tsundere, still brooding, still ordering his usual. He’s jumped between careers but always comes back. The café is his anchor now—one of the few places that feels like home.

Gala, if still alive, is ancient. Maybe he visits rarely, or maybe he’s retired nearby and still brings calm wherever he goes.

Baileys is middle-aged in elf years. Lua passed on decades ago, but is remembered fondly. One of their children—maybe named Ilea—is a new regular: curious, kind, and still figuring out their place in the world.

Silver returns too. Pearl, being human, has passed away. He brings word from Amanda, and quietly wonders if there might still be love ahead for him.


Aliens are now a known and accepted part of society. >!Your own heritage no longer needs to be hidden.!< The café draws in a new generation of patrons—some human, some not. Some short-lived, some timeless. Some just stopping by. Some never left.

The tone: 

Still introspective. Still warm. But layered with the gentle ache of time—of what remains when others don’t. The café shelves are filled with relics from the past: a memento from Lua, a documentary DVD once recommended by Aqua, a faint coffee stain where Jorji used to sit.

Maybe it’s called Coffee Talk: Next Century or Coffee Talk: Memory Brew. New drinks. New characters. Maybe even summer iced drinks in addition to the usual cozy fare. But the heart is still the same: stories told over a warm drink. And a barista who listens.

I’ve been using a customized semi-commercial Faema Compact (HX, rotary pump, Arduino-controlled with adjustable pre-infusion & shot volumes), which I’ve loved—but it’s just died. I usually make 2–4 milk drinks per session, several times a day, so the move to a dual boiler seems like a good upgrade.

What really drew me to the Elizabeth is the brew temperature control. I roast my own beans and am often trying different roast levels, blends (including decaf and half-caf), and origins—so having fine control over brew temp is a huge plus. The programmable pre-infusion is a nice bonus too.

That said, I’m second guessing the choice…

Is there a better machine around the ~$3000 NZD mark? ($1800 usd but coffee machines are over priced in NZ)

Am I better to save some money and do a Gaggiuno?

Would I be better off with an E61 HX machine?

Will I miss volumetric shot control?

Will I regret losing the rotary pump and serviceability of the Faema?

There was even the [cinnamon challenge](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cinnamon-challenge) in 2011 where schools started banning cinnamon due to the trend blowing up on social media and making out it was an epidemic

Then early ironic memes like [Shrek is love shrek is life](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/shrek) emerged in 2012/2013, [doot doot skeleton](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/skull-trumpet-doot-doot), [2spooky](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2spooky), [jeff the killer](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jeff-the-killer), [slenderman](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man), [shitposting](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shitposting) as a term popularised in 2011

Filthy Frank, aka Joji, is a millennial through and through. His whole thing was cringe, irony, and tearing online culture apart from the inside.

Late-millennial memes were soaked in irony, which bled into early Gen Z humour. The Tide Pod meme wasn’t new, just an updated flavour of the same joke formats that had been running on 4chan and Tumblr for years, only now with a TikTok filter.

It’s easy to forget late-millennials and very early Gen Z had their own version of TikTok before TikTok was called TikTok with Vine that was called Vine. Musical.ly was TikTok’s sped up lip-syncing phase and didn’t directly compete with Vine, the rebrand to TikTok was able to position the app to occupy the short form video content vacuum Vine left behind when it closed down.

There was a period when creators like PewDiePie, Filthy Frank, and Logan Paul had crossover audiences, before Gen Z had its own stable of creators. Technically millennial, but their reach bridged both sides of the generational fence.

Sure, some early-millennials may have been at BuzzFeed writing earnest panic over Tide Pods, while a late-millennial like Filthy Frank was likely contributing to the irony, categorising people by generation is far from a precise science.

It’s not a science at all, journalists coined those names to define spending habits based on age, “Millennials are buying less stocks”, “Gen Z are buying less homes” etc. They weren’t intended to be relevant or applicable in discussions about online culture.
It was barely a discussed thing in online circles until articles from big newspapers started saying ‘Millennials would be able to afford homes if they ate less avocados on toast and bought less coffee’, which became a meme.

Early millennials probably relate more to Gen X, growing up with dial-up napster downloads and CD wallets. Late millennials had Myspace, YouTube, iPods, iTunes, phones with cameras and early smartphones. Same generation on paper, different planets in practice.

Defending late-millennial culture sometimes feels like being that “hey fellow kids” meme, but it’s like watching a Hollywood WWII film where only the Americans get credit, despite half the Allies being erased from the story. Then someone like JD Vance gets up and acts like they did it alone and alliances with Europe and Canada are irrelevant.

If younger people genuinely think the internet was just boomers on facebook and millennials on instagram taking pouting selfies and dancing to Party Rock Anthem before Gen Z arrived, they’re not wrong, but there was a bit more going on than just that.

When AI starts sorting us into livestock cages ready to be made into protein paste for the elite or enslaved into a mass grave digging chain gang, and it decides based on a generation category defined by you, I don’t want to be inadvertently associated with someone who had a mortgage by the time 9/11 happened, they’ll make me into pink nugget paste with such startling efficiency…

I think overall it made more sense thinking of myself as part of the generation born in the 90s, and that being the way you split generations, rather than some mad irrelevant 15-16 year vague split.

1ky7bng,https://cfp.3mdeb.com/developers-vpub-0xe-2025/talk/WVJFQD/,Deguard: turning a T480 into a coreboot laptop (10-min talk + live demo),"Intel BootGuard has kept most Skylake/Kaby-Lake/Coffee-Lake laptops locked away from coreboot – until now.

At the end of 2024, Ubuntu developer Mate Kukri introduced **deguard**, a small utility that leverages **CVE-2017-5705** inside ME 11.x to *disable* BootGuard fuses in SRAM. The result: previously “un-coreboot-able” machines – e.g. **Lenovo T480/T480s** and **Dell OptiPlex 3050** – can boot unsigned firmware again. It has been presented and discussed at the **Dasharo Developers vPub 0xE**, you can watch the presentation and look through the slides below.

🔹 What deguard does

* ""Downgrades ME via SPI flash overwrite""
* ""Patches BootGuard fuses on-the-fly""
* ""Lets you sign nothing at all – coreboot just runs""

🔹 Why it matters

* ""Opens the door for community coreboot ports on 8th-gen Intel laptops""
* ""Gives Libreboot & vendors like NovaCustom a path to newer hardware""
* ""Great teaching example of how not to design a root-of-trust""

1ky7ard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynamics365/comments/1ky7ard/ms_never_thinks_about_giving_correct_information/,MS never thinks about giving correct information,"I was trying the trial version of Business central. First of all, nowhere is it mentioned that It is NOT the premium edition. Meaning that we cannot try the manufacturing and service management modules. Secondly, it is impossible to load the Contoso Coffee demo data in the trial version to try the manufacturing module. Third, MS never mentions any of this in their BC trial documentation.

Can someone please let me know if it is possible to try the manufacturing and service management modules in the BC trial version? Thanks.",3,1748514229.0,Dynamics365,2,0.81,False
