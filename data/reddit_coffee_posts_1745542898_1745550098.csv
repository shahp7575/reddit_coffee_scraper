1k7aoz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1k7aoz1/if_you_desire_to_have_kids_dont_prolong_it_too/,"If you desire to have kids, don't prolong it too long waiting till you're ready","It's like driving a car... you don't really know you're ready until after you've actually driven.

My wife and I are older millennials and our kids are younger gen z. Even though we always wanted kids, if you asked us if we were ready back then, we would've said ""no.""

My wife was 25 when our first child was born and we barely started our career. Also, she didn't even go back to work immediately so she can spend time with our child until she was about 3 years old. Even then, she eased into work, working only part time to start. That is to say, our finance was tight, but we made it work. We continued to rent our small place and we were very frugal with money: rare vacation trips (mostly just camping and day trips), minimize eating out (I always packed lunch to work), no frivolous shopping, always looking for deals, etc. This became normal to us.

However, we always wanted 2 kids and we've been told repeatedly it is best to have them close in age but we were reluctant as we have gotten accustomed to our lifestyle. So we gave ourselves a deadline and we just barely hit it. In hindsight, they were right - the benefits of having kids closer in age outweighs the ordeal of having 2 young ones driving you crazy, and this ordeal would be shortened as well. Also, my wife barely got back to work only to go on a leave again for our second child.

At this time, we have saved up enough for a downpayment on a house because of our frugal living. Side note: I always find it interesting when coworkers were complaining that they're unable to afford a place while seeing them buy lunch, coffee, and snacks all the time, as well as frequently going out drinking after work. You need to prioritize and sacrifice. Anyway, even though this was 12 years ago, the house we bought was still pricey at $625k (+ $50k for updates) because we wanted to stay in Metro Vancouver. When we got our mortgage, the bank still considered us dual income since my wife was still technically in maternity leave with the assumption that she would go back to work. However, my wife wanted to stay with our 2nd daughter until she was 3 years old, just like the previous time. Which means, I had to get a second job to support the family and pay the mortgage. I was working 70+ hours per week. But just like the last time, we found a way to make it work.

Fast forward to now... both kids are teenagers, with the older one having just a year left of highschool. My wife and I have moved up in our careers so we've become financially stable. My wife even took some college courses after reevaluating her career path during her work pauses, and I did some certifications to get better pay/positions. As such, we can splurge on hobbies and travelling. This year alone, we went on a cruise in the Bahamas, I went on a trip to Mexico City with the boys, my wife went to multiple concerts in California with her friends, and we'll go on another cruise plus to Disney world in the summer. Last year, we had trips to Asia, Cancun, and Vegas. The year before that included trips to LA, Cabos, Asia, and so on. It's actually more fun to travel with older kids and easy to leave them if necessary. In addition, we have enough for investments. This is due to the fact that we are still very frugal generally speaking: we still do not eat out often (we like cooking and eating meals at home), still no frivolous shopping, still looking for deals, we keep the same stuff (like cars, clothing, furniture) for a long time, and so on.

Barely in our 40s, we can still keep up with the kids, and we're always playing and working. With the kids being older, they are more hands off so we can concentrate on our careers. Another nice thing, at least for my wife is that she has been mistaken as being the older sister of our kids, which she finds hilarious. Other times, people find it hard to believe she has teenagers. OTOH, My grey hair gives away my age; must be all that stress from before.

Therefore, if it's your desire to have kids, don't delay it for too long. Remember, the time to have kids is limited (especially for women), but you can always work more. Also, a younger body can cope better with the stress of parenting and hard work while the immature mind can quickly adjust.",2,1745549816.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

I’ve only played around 3 hours, but boy, that's all it took to realize this is, unironically, **ABSOLUTE CINEMA**.

Haha! I heard the devs previously worked under Ubisoft and left them... well well well, look what happens when you escape the corporate shithole: you make art. What does that tell you?

Seriously, recommend this game to everyone. Grab a fucking megaphone, yell it from rooftops, whisper it to strangers in coffee shops (not in a creepy way), whatever it takes. Just get people to buy this game. And of course buy it yourself if you haven't already, what are you stupid?

It slaps from the very first frame, and it keeps slapping.

The visuals - Gorgeous. It's directed like an artsy Oscar nominated movie, and I say that in the best way possible.

The soundtrack - Like chocolate milk but for my ears and without the constipation.

The storytelling - Respects your brain cells. I love when the story is told elegantly and not shoved in my pie hole.

The characters - Layered and interesting.

The voice acting - Chef’s kiss, fucking MUAA! especially when playing in French with English subtitles (feels like the intended vibe, and it just sounds romantic and sexy).

Welcome to part 4 of my FD series for young investors. Today we're talking about Recurring Deposits (RDs) – the unsung hero for inconsistent savers!

# What's an RD and Why Should You Care?

A Recurring Deposit is basically an FD where you invest a fixed amount every month instead of a one-time lump sum. Think of it as a forced savings plan:

* You commit to depositing a fixed amount every month (as low as ₹500!)
* The bank compounds interest on your growing balance
* At the end of your chosen period, you get everything back plus interest

# Why RDs Work for Your First Saving Tool

1. **You don't need a huge amount to start** – Even ₹1000/month is enough
2. **Automates the saving habit** – Set up auto-debit and forget it
3. **Can't easily withdraw and blow the money** – Impulsive shopping trips averted!
4. **Steady, disciplined approach** – Like going to the gym regularly vs. one monster workout
5. **Great for short-term goals** – Like saving for your first bike down payment or that iPhone 16 Pro Max in 12 Months

# The RD Advantage: Real Numbers

Let's say you want to save ₹1 lakh in 2 years:

**Option A: Promise yourself you'll save up over time**  
Reality: You'll probably blow half of it on Swiggy, Amazon sales, and random trips 😅

**Option B: ₹4,000/month in an RD at 6.5% for 24 months**  
Result: ₹1,03,380 at maturity!

That extra ₹3,380? It's basically like getting a month's worth of coffee for free!

# The ""But..."" Questions Answered

**""But the returns are low compared to stocks!""**  
Yes, but can your stocks guarantee you won't lose money before your sister's wedding in a year that you're saving for?

**""But what if I miss a monthly payment?""**  
Most banks charge a small penalty (₹50-100) for missed payments. Not the end of the world, but why to miss?

**""But I'm not sure I can commit for 1-2 years!""**  
You can still withdraw early with a penalty. You'll get less interest, but your principal is safe.

# Some Tips from My Experience

1. **Set the auto-debit for 1-2 days after your salary date** – Avoids timing issues
2. **Start small and increase gradually** – Success builds confidence
3. **Have a clear goal in mind** – RD works for your super priority goals in less than 2 years where you don't want to take even a minute of risk!

# The RD Success Formula

RD + Clear Goal + Automation = Financial Discipline Unlocked 🔓

# What's Next?

Coming up in \[FD Series #5\]: **Sweep-in/Flexi FDs** – The smartest way to handle your emergency fund without sacrificing returns!

I legit couldn’t figure out why for the longest time, but then in November I went to go get a coffee from where he worked (praying he wasn’t there) but guess what he was! He unblocked me and sent me a huge paragraph basically saying he realized he had feelings for me and it scared him. I accepted him back into my life because I missed him too, so we started talking again. Then in December we were supposed to hang out, but he ghosted me for a couple days. I told him to figure out his shit, 2 hours later he replied saying he was busy with work and hasn’t been “handling our relationship well” and that I was an amazing person etc. I told him I was fine with being just friends and I didn’t want to rush him into anything. Then he ghosted me again, this time for good. Something else I want to add is that I’m on the bigger side and he is not, so I had some insecurities surrounding that but never voiced them to him. I guess the fact that he just ghosted me with no clear answer has bothered me for a long time now (it’s been a year since we last talked) and I just want to know how to move on and get him out of my head. Sorry for the long post, any advice is appreciated, thank you!

# How the Most Infamous Villain in Movie History Finally Got Paid Using a Bitcoin QR Code

It’s been decades since Dr. Evil last graced the silver screen, demanding ransom money with his signature pinky-to-the-mouth gesture and an over-the-top, “**One… MILLION… dollars!**”

Back in the '90s, that was a ridiculous amount of money (and still kinda is). But today? Not only is 1 billion dollars feasible in the crypto world, it's downright **practical**—*if* you know how to get paid properly. And thanks to [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), our favorite bald baddie is finally in the digital age.

Let’s rewind and take a look at how this villain made a comeback—not with sharks with frickin’ laser beams—but with Bitcoin QR codes, sleek payments, and no bank manager in sight.

# Cryogenics, Catch-Ups, and Crypto

After thawing out from his frozen lair beneath a volcano (or was it the moon?), Dr. Evil found the world had moved on. His evil plans? Outdated. His fashion sense? Questionable. His ransom methods? Laughable.

Gone were the days of wire transfers and duffel bags full of cash. Now, people were getting paid in **Bitcoin**, storing fortunes on USB sticks, and paying for coffee with QR codes. Even Mini-Me had an NFT collection.

Dr. Evil needed a reboot. Stat.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker

In a desperate attempt to modernize, Dr. Evil stumbled upon a curious tool online: [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). At first, he scoffed. “Pfft. QR codes are for petty criminals and overpriced coffee shops.”

But then he saw it:

* **Generate instant Bitcoin payment QR codes**
* **Create buttons and payment links**
* **No KYC, no banks, no henchmen needed**

**Perfect.**

His eyes lit up (one more than the other—it was a rough cryogenic cycle). “This... this is what I’ve been waiting for,” he muttered, rubbing his hands together.

# The Big Announcement: “One Billion Dollars… in Bitcoin, Please.”

With a freshly minted Bitcoin QR code proudly displayed on his evil website, Dr. Evil went live to the world.

He popped up on screens globally with the same old flair:

“Ladies and gentlemen of the world… I am back. And unless you want me to unleash chaos upon the entire internet—I'm talking TikTok getting even weirder—you will send me…

**One BILLION dollars...**

…**in Bitcoin.**

Please scan the QR code now.”

And just like that, the QR code (generated effortlessly using the Bitcoin QR Code Maker) glowed ominously on-screen.

# How It Worked (Because Villains Like Simplicity Too)

Behind the scenes, Dr. Evil was floored at how easy the process was:

1. He visited [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
2. Entered his Bitcoin wallet address.
3. Chose the amount: *1000000000 USD worth of BTC* (he even got to use real-time exchange rates).
4. Clicked **Generate**.
5. Boom—instantly got a scannable QR code and a slick payment link.

No coding. No minions needed. No awkward calls to Swiss bank managers named Klaus.

Even Number Two was impressed.

# Unexpected Side Effects

Of course, things didn’t go *exactly* to plan. For one, a surprisingly large number of crypto fans thought Dr. Evil’s stunt was a *performance art piece* and started sending him tips.

He got:

* $12.34 in Bitcoin from a fan in Canada
* 0.002 BTC from a DAO called “EvilDAO”
* And even an NFT titled **“Laser Shark #404”**, which he now keeps framed in his lair

He even started his own blog called “Evil & Decentralized,” where he shares thoughts like:

“Smart contracts are great… but what about evil contracts?”

# The World Reacts

Media coverage was all over the place.

* **BuzzCoin**: “Dr. Evil Accepts Bitcoin. Banks are officially done.”
* **TechCrunchy**: “QR Code Maker Helps Supervillain Go Viral—And Get Paid.”
* **The Onion** (probably): “World Reluctantly Considers Evil Genius Less Cringey Due to Tech Savvy.”

Even Austin Powers, now semi-retired and making groovy TikToks in Venice Beach, commented:

“Bitcoin, baby? Yeah… that’s sort of my bag too.”

# The Future Is Evil (and Peer-to-Peer)

Today, Dr. Evil has pivoted from world domination to web domination. With the help of Bitcoin QR codes, he’s launched:

* [**EvilMerch.io**](http://EvilMerch.io) – Selling hoodies that say “1 Billion or Bust”
* **EvilCon** – A villain-themed crypto conference (think DefCon meets ComicCon with way more lasers)
* **EvilPay** – A side hustle helping other villains accept Bitcoin easily (using—you guessed it—[BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com))

As he says:

“Decentralized crime is the future, baby. Muahaha.”

# What We Can Learn From Dr. Evil (Surprisingly… a Lot)

Okay, so maybe don’t threaten the world. But do learn from his playbook:

* **Make it easy for people to pay you.** QR codes are universal, slick, and instant.
* **Skip the red tape.** With tools like [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), there’s no need for banks, logins, or approvals.
* **Have fun with it.** Even a villain knows that humor + good tech = viral success.

Whether you're a small business, an artist, or an evil mastermind with a lair to fund, QR codes for Bitcoin just make sense.

# Final Thoughts

Dr. Evil didn’t change overnight. But with a simple Bitcoin QR code and a bit of flair, he brought his world of chaos into the 21st century. Now, he’s proof that even the most outdated villain can make a comeback—with a little help from blockchain and a great app.

So the next time you need to collect Bitcoin (or demand ransom—we don’t judge), remember the legend…

Hi here thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

PLEASE READ THIS POST IN FULL! 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

1k7agqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1k7agqf/warning_american_travelers_prepare_for_a_rough/,WARNING: American Travelers - Prepare for a Rough Ride,"Greetings, fellow travelers. I’m an American who recently visited New Zealand, and I feel compelled to share my experience to warn others from the US planning a trip there. Buckle up, because this is going to be a long one. Spoiler alert: I was excited to explore NZ’s stunning landscapes, but the way I was treated as an American left a bitter taste that overshadowed the beauty. From subtle shade to outright hostility, I encountered a surprising amount of anti-American sentiment, and I’m not talking about friendly banter. Worse, I was repeatedly dragged into political ambushes by indignant Kiwis demanding I justify Donald Trump, someone I don’t even support. If you’re American, you need to go into this with your eyes wide open.

First off, let me say I had high hopes for my visit. I’d heard it was a welcoming, laid-back country with friendly locals and jaw-dropping scenery. The scenery delivered; Fiordland, Tongariro, Abel Tasman, all incredible. But the “friendly Kiwi” stereotype? Not so much, at least not for me. From the moment I arrived, I felt like my accent was a scarlet letter. It started small: eye rolls when I asked for directions, curt responses at cafes, and a general vibe that I was an inconvenience. I’m polite, I tip well (don't tell me Kiwis don't tip when every cafe has a tip jar), I respect local customs (I even learned a few Māori phrases to show respect), but it didn’t seem to matter. The fact that I was American seemed to be enough to earn me a cold shoulder.

The real kicker, though, was the political gauntlet I was forced to run. I’m not exaggerating when I say I was cornered multiple times by Kiwis who wanted to grill me about American politics, specifically, Donald Trump. I’m not a Trump fan, never voted for him, and I’m happy to have a civil discussion about policy. But these weren’t discussions; they were interrogations. One night at a pub in Christchurch, a group of locals overheard my accent and immediately launched into a tirade about Trump’s policies, demanding to know why “you Americans” elected him. I tried to explain that I didn’t vote for him and that the US is diverse with complex political dynamics, but they weren’t having it. It was like they wanted me to personally answer for every decision made in Washington. One guy even said, “You lot are all the same, ruining the world,” and stormed off when I wouldn’t take the bait.

This wasn’t a one-off either. In Wellington, a barista overheard me chatting with my wife about our itinerary and decided to lecture us on how “America’s foreign policy” was the root of global problems. I just wanted a coffee, not a geopolitics seminar. Anyways, encounters like this left me feeling like I had to apologize for existing as an American, and it was exhausting.

I get it, Kiwis are passionate, and many have strong opinions about global politics. I’m not saying they can’t criticize the US; we’re not perfect, and I’m open to hearing different perspectives. But the aggression and assumptions were way over the line. It felt like Kiwis saw me as a walking stereotype, not a person. They assumed I was some MAGA-hat-wearing caricature without bothering to ask who I was or what I believed. And the Trump obsession? Bizarre. I don’t go around asking Kiwis to justify their government’s policies, so why was I expected to defend a politician I don’t even like? It’s not my job to be America’s ambassador, especially on vacation.

It wasn't just us either, I talked to another American couple in Rotorua who had similar experiences, like they were rudely told to “go back to Trump-land” when they complained about a getting a cold meal at a restaurant.  So yeah, this isn’t just my imagination; there’s a clear undercurrent of resentment toward Americans that you need to be ready for. Maybe it’s because of media portrayals or political differences, but whatever the reason, it’s real, and it stings.

My advice to American travelers? Brace yourself. Do your homework on local customs to avoid being “that tourist,” but don’t expect it to shield you from judgment. Keep your accent on the down-low if you can as sadly, it’s a target. If someone brings up politics, shut it down politely but firmly; don’t let yourself get dragged into a no-win debate. Stick to tourist-heavy areas like Queenstown, where locals might be more used to Americans, though even that’s no guarantee. And if you’re sensitive to feeling unwelcome, maybe reconsider your destination altogether - Australia is way more chill in my experience.",0,1745549072.0,newzealand_travel,10,0.11,False

We should get in around 9am and will be heading out around 8pm (by bus, from Port Authority).

I figure we’ll probably get coffee and bagels and find dinner somewhere along the way but other than the pop up we have no idea what to do! We’re from Philly and haven’t spent time in NYC for a few years but definitely have seen and done some of the regular tourist things.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming more demiromantic with age. In a digital/online context, I'm much more graysexual** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1745549030.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False

\-------------------------

The Eurostar slowed as it entered St. Pancras International Station, its brakes sighing against the rails as if ending a long confession. Declan stepped off the train with the strap of his leather travel valise over his shoulder and fatigue in his bones. He’d barely slept an hour since discovering Annika had skipped Paris for London. His overcoat was uncharacteristically wrinkled, his mind clouded with what-ifs and self-reproach.

Outside the station, the mid-morning London air was crisp and dry. He hopped into a taxi, directing the driver to go to Russell Square. Less than ten minutes later, he spotted Tommy sitting on a public bench across the street from the hotel, hands in the pockets of his peacoat, cigarette between his lips. Tommy was a big guy, at least three inches taller than Declan and built much stronger.

“She’s in there,” he said without preamble, nodding to the hotel across the road. “Checked in immediately after arriving from the station under the name Julia Reiss. Used a German passport and a matching credit card. Neat as a pin. She’s a pro.”

Declan exhaled. “Are you sure it’s her?”

“Same as the woman in the photo you sent. Same hair, same face. She’s good, but not invisible. At least not to me. She had no idea I was waiting for her.”

“What’s she done since she arrived?”

“She’s been up there for a few hours. Went out about an hour ago to a coffee shop around the corner and used her laptop for less than five minutes. Then she hit a mobile shop on Gower and bought a new burner phone. Afterwards, she came back here and hasn’t left since.”

Declan nodded, jaw tight. “Are you up for sticking around for a little bit longer?”

Tommy arched an eyebrow. “Depends. Do I get to follow the femme fatale or knock some sense into an old friend for being sloppy?”

Declan managed a small grin. “I may need both.” 

A few minutes were spent discussing strategy. They crossed the street and Tommy flicked his cigarette into the gutter, taking up post on a bench where he could see the entrance. Declan continued on into the lobby.

The hotel was better than most and discrete, the sort of place catering to visiting mid-level bureaucrats and sales executives. He took a seat in the lounge, back to a wall, eyes to the lobby, and ordered a coffee he wouldn’t drink. 

Time passed. He checked his watch. Then again.

Seventy-five minutes later, the elevator chimed and Annika stepped out.

Declan nearly stood on instinct, but caught himself. It was her, carrying a laptop bag over her shoulder; unhurried, poised, and beautiful. She passed unconcerned through the lobby without noticing him, and turned left out onto the street.

He gave her five seconds, then followed.

The sky had dulled to pewter and traffic hummed like low conversation. She walked around the corner and entered a narrow café with moss-green tiles and copper fixtures; the same one as earlier. Declan followed, heart beating loudly in his chest. He queued behind her as she studied the chalkboard menu and took a deep breath.

“May I invite you for a coffee Julia, or do you prefer Annika?” he said smoothly.

She turned. With the slightest of flickers, her eyes betrayed her. Surprised and impressed. But it vanished just as quickly, replaced by the smile of a woman who’d just run into an old acquaintance by chance, nothing more.

“Declan,” she said lightly. “How serendipitous.”

“I didn’t get a chance to properly say good-bye” he said in the friendliest of tones. “I wasn’t feeling well last night, but I’ve made a miraculous recovery and couldn’t wait to pick up where we left off.” He gestured toward the chalkboard. “Pick your poison.”

She ordered a flat white. 

He paid. 

They took a corner table.

She stirred sugar into her coffee with the ease of someone who still believed she held the upper hand. “Was it something I said, Declan? I thought we were having a good time… until you blew me off. I assumed you had to get back home to your fat, unhappy wife. So I left Paris. Can you blame me?”

His face registered nothing.

“I’m no longer interested in pursuing any form of relationship with you,” she continued. “What are you hoping to accomplish by following me here? That’s beyond creepy. The police will no doubt conclude it borders on stalking.”

He folded his hands on the table. “I’m not here for witty repartee. I underestimated you and made a mistake. I’m here to correct that.”

She took a sip from her coffee cup, hands steady, eyes playful.

Declan smiled. “I want a name.”

“You already have mine. Annika Weiss. I’m flattered you remembered.”

His tone sharpened. “You’re not going to charm your way out of this. You used me.”

She shrugged. “And you let me. You enjoyed it and I didn’t hate it.” Pausing, she smiled cruelly. “Don’t tell me I hurt your feelings?”

Declan leaned forward. “There’s no need for this to get… unprofessional.”

Annika gave a small, mocking laugh. “What are you going to do, rough me up, slap me around?”

“No,” he said, and smiled. “That’s not my style.”

Then he gestured out the window. Tommy was leaning against a car, hands in his coat again, watching them without expression.

“But he’ll make sure you never make it back to your hotel.”

Annika’s smile faded. Her fingers paused on the cup. She glanced once at Tommy, then back at Declan.

“It was just a contract. One of many. Nothing personal.”

“I know. I work by contract too.” His eyes never left her. There was no sympathy, no warmth, and no patience in them. He waited a moment, but she said nothing.

“I’m not here to play games, Annika. I’m quite serious.”

“Fine,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Elise Ross.”

“From Geneva?” asked Declan.

“Yes.”

“And what exactly did she hire you to do?”

“My instructions were simple: find out who you are working for. Other than that, I don’t know anything. I never spoke to her; never even met her. But the job paid very well.”

Declan filed away each piece of information Annika offered.

“Will you be meeting with her?”

“No,” Annika said. “I reported in earlier. I’ve been paid. I’m already thinking about the next job.”

Declan leaned back, coldness blooming behind his ribs. He needed nothing more from Annika.

Standing, he tightened the knot of his tie and adjusted his jacket. “Here’s hoping we never cross paths again.”

Annika tilted her head. “Pity. You were better than I expected.”

Declan turned and walked out without a reply. Tommy joined him and they stopped around the corner.

“Did she talk?”

“Yes.”

“Do you still want me to get her phones and computer?”

Declan’s jaw set. “Yes.”

“Politely?”

“No.”

Tommy smiled. “I’ll be in touch.”",1,1745549014.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Dang girl you are covered in sweat!   Speak for yourself papi, i'm not the only one covered in it but i'm surely not washing your sheets, that's definitely your job not mine.  Denova said to me leaning on her side facing me with a smirk expression across her face, a mix of mischief and satisfaction can be seen ….. And smelt in all honesty.  I flipped up on my butt looking around for my cell phone which somehow made its way across the bedroom floor from the bed.  You're too used to having Chorizo and now experiencing the full impact of a Polish Kielbasa, you know what they say, once you go white….

She laughed and simply replied, “don't be so full of yourself, it was only 15 minutes and I did most of the work”.  I lowered my head as I stood up. Well… you can't say it wasn't the best 15 minutes you ever had now can you? I replied sarcastically, raising my head with a playful smile plastered across my face.   Ima have a smoke, now where the hell did i leave my briefs?



I actually gotta get going Ben, Denova said as she hopped off the side of the bed getting dressed.   I wanna try to pick up a Latte, wanna come?   As much as I did crave that delicious iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts, which happens to taste just as good as Starbucks and at half the cost, those bloodsucking tweens i thought to myself before replying ‘nah i'm actually going live with Gary and a few friends on that game i just picked up.   ‘Is that the open world horror one you were talking about? she replied. ‘Hell yeah it's hella fun, and scary AF if you play it alone in the dark too but don't tell nobody haha….. Now you see your average woman more than likely wouldn't know what the hell a Cryptid is, let alone a lot of guys too I'm assuming in all honesty, but she wasn't any ordinary chick… Denova was a horror movie junkie, Hellraiser 1 & 2 “the originals are her fav’s, not any of these remake reboot crap.  Rest in Peace Patrick Swayze, the Hollywood Gods have failed once again with no new ideas or originality and keep wanting to remake classics once again and failing miserably. 



Once Denova bounced, I got my phone, put in my screen lock code and I hit up Gary on Facebook messenger, making sure he was still down to team up for pound town on these beasts and maybe get past the dang Dark Forest.  I keep getting my butt killed there every time, I feel ill need to bring some KY with me just for comfort.   About 10 minutes later I was in front of my TV screen with the system turned on and the VR headset atop my head and ready for some all night monster kicking action.  

This game was not only addictive but hard as hell. I've had it for about a week, played it daily and barely got through half the game map..  You start off in this open patch of land at the forest entrance which is called The Knoxdale Forest.  Then there's this bridge with a Bigass Troll, then the Dark forest full of fricken Dogman creatures that always tear my ass up harder than a fresh fishs be’hind at San Quentin.  I haven't gotten past that yet, but I know there's more on that map once the gray areas open up.  Here goes nothin…..



(Video Game Console Startup sound)



“Welcome to the Land of Horrors, Do you think you have what it takes to survive?”



Was written on my face screen as the game started to load.



Once the font disappeared from my vision a small white circle appeared in the center of the pitch black space i was now in and the hole was slowly getting larger….and larger… The it got extremely bright, then my head started to burn and this loud electricity noise exploded in my ears and I grabbed my VR headset trying to pry them off with my hands but the damn shit wouldn't come off.  If i wasn't in so much agonizing pain I would have compared it to Carly Beth in Goosebumps where her dang Halloween mask wouldn't come off… But this was real… this was really happening, i'm getting fried like an egg in my own damn living room and there's no one even here to help me or call for help.   The noise kept buzzing, a mixture of an electrified fence with a bug zapper multiplied by 100 and that's what was ringing through my ears, and the pain I can't even explain how much that crap was hurting… again i felt like i was being fried!   ……  Then suddenly, my knees gave out and everything went completely black………

  


Chapter 2 - This is some Bullshit!



I woke up to a partly cloudy blue sky, the smell was of pine trees and earth. A rich musty aroma from decomposing leaves, twigs and many other matter on the ground…. I was laying on my back…..but where, where the hell was I?  I blinked a few times, shaking my head, feeling my ears and to my surprise, I felt no pain, no blood, nothing…  It was as if nothing had happened just moments ago in my living room. But I was no longer inside my living room, I was somewhere else…..but how?   I carefully stood up and scanned my new surroundings….  No… this can't be happening, this isn't real there's no freakin way, I must be dreaming…..what in the holy jingle bells is happening…. I must be trippin, but I hate mushrooms, so I scratched that out of the equation.



(Notification sound)



You are now in the land of Horror, do you have what it takes to survive, do you have what it takes to escape?



Read across my vision in computer text before disappearing after a few seconds.



I was not only in a game of some kind, but judging from the font read aloud to me, I also recognised this clear patch of land I was now in..   This was the beginning of that Escape Horrorland game I was playing….. No ficken way I said out loud to myself.  



HAHAHA Another Earthling I see…..  



A voice came somewhere nearby to my right just out of view.  I quickly turned and saw some old ass man in tattered clothing walking up to me with a smirk on his wrinkly frail face.   The man looked to be in his 70s at least!..... 



What the hell is going on here? How am I here and not in my apartment? This is some sick shit is this some kind of prank and who the hell are you old man?  I yelled out of fright and confusion.  ‘Settle down young man this is no prank, you are one of many who have been chosen to complete the quest of Horrors’  he said.  ""This is real, you are not imagining this, the same thing that you saw playing this video game is what you will now face head on in person, the only difference is now that if you die here you die for real”.   I was still trying to grasp my brain around all of this….. So what you're saying is that electrical malfunction somehow zapped me inside the fricken video game?  Are you off your rocker buddy? I screamed at him angrily.  “I'm afraid so, listen, there is no way to beat around the bush to explain this to you kid but you're in this video game, but inside here is their world, it's real for them.  They know nothing about our universe aside from us who have somehow been sent here to what I assume is to complete the game”.   

“Hmm well lad a 25 year old such as yourself might just have a chance as wrapping this place up.  As for me, I'm too old, I had no business even trying to play video games at my anyhow but with luck I have it here I am.’     

How did you know my age, I never told you, you some kind of mind reader too grandpa?

‘No I used ‘analize’ to see your basic profile information’  

How the hell do you do that?  How long have you been here?

“You simply concentrate on someone or something in this realm and it will show you, and as far as how long i've been here and why im still here… .well lets just say at my age kid I have not the strength or ability to protect myself against most of the creatures here.  I don't know how long I've been here, times are different and I didn't keep count”.  “Go ahead give it a try, analyze me son”

Shoot, I guess I really don't have anything to lose, I thought to myself.  If i'm really in this bitch i need to start thinking about what I do in this game and ‘man the hell up’ before some beast swallows my ass and craps me out.

I closed the analyze tab and then asked him.  ‘George, what else can you tell me or teach me about this place and how things work?  I have played this game before, but never like this obviously’.



‘Well son…. What is your name first of all?  Here in this realm I'd suggest using your gamertag name considering that your formal self doesn't exist here.  You can concentrate on your profile by simply ‘willing it’ and like that aside from other things that are done here in person compared to using a game controller.’



I willed my profile Display next:

Profile:



Name…….   Which showed a cursor blinking in an empty space next to it….. Well crap, my gamertag was “StarFishPumper” because I’m a Sexual Tyrannosaurus like Blain from the 1987 Predator movie, or at least I thought myself to be.   There's no way I'm having anyone call me that in person.. I laughed to myself at the thought….

I thought for a moment and then it hit me…



“My name is Kenjo”



Then name entered itself and then displayed the rest of my information:

I'm no Noob, I said out loud and closed my profile display.  I noticed on the top right side of my vision to have a thin red bar which I could only assume to be my health bar just like in the game.  Ok, so far it's starting to make more sense to me.  So George, I asked.  Are there Health Herbs here to find and eat for healing like in the game, what about finding loot or other various items?

“Yes Kenjo, everything is just as it was in the game, you just have to concentrate or simply ‘will it’ and it will be”  he replied.  

“Here, I have stashed a few things i've found over my time here alone, I doubt ill be around for too much longer the way things have been going for me here so better I give it to someone who could actually put some use to it” George said.

I minimized the notifications and thanked George for not only his goods but also the little help of information of just everything in this beeyatch.   I put on the ring of health and automatically noticed my red health bar lengthen some across my screen. Then adding on the funky looking grayish brown chest plate armor and sheathing the sword from my belt I noticed that it's more like a short sword in my hands, which made sense as I'm human and goblins are little ugly ass green boogers with legs.  But it will have to do, I said to myself, better this than nothing but these brown peasant clothing I'm wearing and ugly as hell looking knock off Moccasins. 



I willed my profile once again now with the new attire and weapon equipped.

Your relationship with George went from Stranger to now Friendly.



(Level Up Sound Effect)



Congratulations, you have advanced to Level 2.  Making allies and learning about new items and skills can help you not only level up faster by experience but also help you to stay alive.  Now stop being a lil bitch!



Noticing my Strength & Health went up by 30 points to a total of 230 and strength went up 10 points to 30, I closed the dialog and smiled…  



Come with me I said to George, there is power in numbers, you shouldn't be here all by yourself and now unarmed my conscience wouldn't feel right just leaving you here.

“Kenjo my boy, I am tired… I've been here for so long, and even back home on Earth I knew I was done not only mentally but physically.  Whatever happens, I've lived a good life, but I'm ready for my next journey when that path shows itself to me.

I understand, but that still doesn't mean I agree with you, but the choice is yours. Thanks again for everything, do you mind if I stay here with you through the night to gather my bearings before I hit the road tomorrow?



“Not at all I'm cooking up some Bunny Stew and you're more than welcome to accompany me around the fire. I can't say it is anything special but I find this area quite safe and quiet compared to the other areas I have traveled, you’ll be safe here for the night.  I do need some Mint Leaves if you don't mind finding some, they're randomly around and actually good for health so make sure you keep some with you for your journey.”



That's right Healing Herbs are found in this game, I guess he calls them Mint leaves, i just hope to god they at least taste half as good.  I've only had mint leaves in cucumber water than my old lady would make as some stupid detox crap she’ll do from time to time.  Never was too fond of it myself,  I just squeeze some lemon in the water and that's good enough for flavor for me.  It becomes French. I called it “Lem’Wa”.  I smiled remembering the good times back home, I also missed her Baoding Balls skills (bow’ding balls) ‘and i'm not talkin bout no Meditation!’  I giggled, as I searched the nearby brush for what George had called Mint Leaves. 



(Notification Sound Effect)



Congratulations!  You have uncovered “Health Herbs”, a minty smell & taste to which consumed gains you 10 extra points to your health.  



I grabbed some and put it up to my nose….yup definitely mint leaves, i took a nibble and to my utter surprise it tasted just like mint leaves back on Earth.  After spending some time scavenging the nearby brush areas around the clearing where George had set up camp for the night, I had a good supply for not only the supper for tonight but so for my own stash for tomorrow's journey to find a way out of this hell hole.  Once back at the campsite I gave him what was needed and sat beside the already roaring fire near a makeshift tent.  Bushcraft skills was something I had always loved watching on YouTube but I never tried doing it in real life before, or whatever my life was now called being here in Horrorland that is.  

“That tent space is for you” George said to me before I could ask him, ""I like to just stargaze myself but once you’re on your way you’ll have to decide how you prefer sleeping at night”.



…… Supper wasn't all that bad, my girl used to have two lop eared bunnies as pets back when we first moved in with each other but had to lock them up in their cages in the outside storage space on our patio due to their smell.  That definitely was no life for a bunny, or any animal pet in all honesty.  But they both died of old age; one went into the dumpster and the other we buried at her mothers house and by some magic of the Gods it started growing a tomato plant in the same spot we buried the 2nd bunny.  I don't know if her family ate those tomatoes or not, I don't even like tomatoes unless they're in salsa or cooked so it didn't matter to me one way or the other, but definitely brought back some memories eating the stew.  George and I had some casual small talk before hitting the hay, come to find out he is from California and he said the monsters here and the crime back home as different as they were weren't anything new to him.  

“I'm from a beach town called Oceanside in an area known by locals as The Deep Valley.  A lot of crime, murder and theft happens in that little area of mine.  I have been wanting to move away for years but I was only a year away from retirement at that time and thought it best to stick it out and wait until then and hit the road to a Red state”.

After that, we both said our goodnights and laid down for the night.  The next morning to my surprise George was gone, I mean completely vanished, no trace of anything that he had on him aside the the items he had given to me the day prior.  The early morning was cool with a light chill breeze that tickled my skin giving my arms goosebumps upon its touch.  The sky was cloudy but the sun was doing its best to fight off  the mist as best as it could and I gathered up my things into my pack, putting on the chest plate and sword on my belt.  Now, if I'm not mistaken, the game had a built in map showing everywhere you’d traveled will be lit up and the gray section areas of the map that you have yet to uncover.  I didn't know how in the hell I was supposed to find my map, I didn't have a fricken controller with me on this hellhole, but I took a wild guess that anything I wanted to check out whether it was my profile, stats, inventory, maps… All I needed to do was to ‘will’ it.   

I shrugged and concentrated, willing the map to be visible to me.

The map instantly popped up on my view, completely covering my vision.  I definitely didn't want to look at my map during a time of danger. That's for damn sure, I'd be slaughtered in a second if I ever made that mistake.  



(Notification sound effect)



Congratulations!  You have activated your map interface.  This is the map of Horrorland: The areas visible on your map are locations you have been to and the areas that are gray you have yet to discover. 



Seeing the small red icon circle at the bottom portion I can tell was myself still in the open clearing starting area near the edge of Knoxdale Forest.   There is a small dirt path leading around the forest North which connects to a bridge from memory playing the game days beforehand… which leads to The Dark Forest where I kept getting my ass kicked.  So I knew where I needed to go up until that point.   Willing the map interface to kick rocks, it minimized on my screen to a tiny icon at the far left corner of my vision.  Once that was settled, I started my trek along the dirt path in the hopes I don't run into anything life threatening, or at least something that I can at least handle.  I was definitely having my doubts as to how in the world am I going to finish this in one piece.  Even though that fear stuck to the back of my mind like grease on your fingers and trying to wash it off without any soap, I continued on down the path.

What I could only assume was mid day judging by the position of the sun in the sky, I knew I had a good 5-6 hours before dusk and would definitely want to find somewhere safe to sleep for the night.  While I walked along the trail of Knoxdale Forest I swear I could hear movement inside the foliage, the sounds of multiple things moving about, twigs snapping, cracking on the forest floor and through the thick brush inside those dark woods beyond my sight.  



The walk for the past couple of hours was semi pleasant, yes I was extremely paranoid about the woods around me but yet not actually seeing anything, I just kept my guard up and tried to make the best out of my walk.  I heard the scream of someone and the roar of something very not human somewhere further up ahead of me.  I stopped stunned and quickly hopped over behind the bush to my right hoping to have not been seen by whoever was making those noises up ahead.   I focused and tried to explain ‘’what  in the holy jungle bells of old Saint Nick's sack of goodies’ I was witnessing with my own two eyes?



At about 40 yards up ahead just right on this very same trail not only did I see the bridge entrance but also a battle to the death between what I very well knew to be a troll from the game.  Seeing this disgusting humanoid abomination in person was something else entirely though.  It was about 5 feet tall and as wide as that Blueberry girl from Willy Wonka movie.  It has grayish skin with a hint of green, so I slowly walked close through the brush to try to examine the situation better and see who this Troll was fighting with.     Once I had stealthily reached a safe hidden distance of about 20 feet away, assuming it was fighting another human that must have made the mistake of not being aware of their surroundings, I came to the realization that this creature was fighting against a Forest Elf.  This Elf was about half half its height, skinny yellowish pale skin, brown hair braided back like someone on the Vikings TV show on HBO with pointed ears and wore green armor. That Elf must be from Knoxdale I thought to myself. They're small yet mighty, and if you piss them off or try stealing from them or jacking up their woods they will definitely kick your ass. Aside from that,  they're actually quite cool in the game.  You can trade with them for all kinds of various items if you win them over or have something good to offer in trade or have enough coin.  



I focused my attention on the Troll and analyzed his Stats: 

  


Name: Bile’ron

Race: Troll

Level: 15

Age: Unknown

Health: 20 of 320

Strength: 75 

Damage: 30

‘Trolls are nasty disgusting creatures that typically hide beneath bridges and out of sight from other creatures and races.  They are not intelligent creatures whose sole purpose is to feed and sleep.  Do not approach or try to conversate with this creature and it will surely try to kill and eat you right where you stand.’



Noticing his red health bar so low I could see that he was practically moments away from being beaten by the Forest Elf.  That's when I quickly analyzed The Elf:



Name: Wadell Bearclaw:  Protector of the Wilds

Race: Wood Elf

Level: 20

Age: 30

Health: 25 of 385

Strength: 40

A wood Elf is one who Dwells in the forests whose home is built high into the trees.  They aren't necessarily evil but mostly associate with nature rather than other creatures. They may be friends with humans but it is rare.  The Wood Elves are often mistaken by Fairies due to their small size and pointy ears and are known to be extremely stealthy and deadly with a bow and arrow.  What they lack in size they gain in distant combat. 



After reading his stats I had a decision to make, and I needed to make it quick….

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming more demiromantic with age. In a digital/online context, I'm much more graysexual** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1745549003.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

1k7abdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1k7abdw/leave_if_you_can/,Leave if you can.,"About a year ago I was looking online for people who were going through the same thing I was at work and found this subreddit. I felt validated and commiserated with your stories.

I spent 7 months working with Nboss, but a little backstory first: I had been in the department for about 6 months before Nboss got hired. For my first 3 months we had a manager who was pretty laid back. Laid back manager left, and we spent the next 3 months without a direct supervisor. We were drowning, so when we found out a new manager was coming in who had extensive work experience in the field we were relieved. L. O. L. 

In the very beginning there were subtle red flags, but we gave Nboss the benefit of the doubt because we were in desperate need of a supervisor. After a few weeks, their true personality and character, or lack thereof, began to show. Thankfully, my co-workers and I were friends (still are), which made it easier to combat the divide and conquer tactic Nbosses love so much. But it was bad; two out of three co-workers ended up leaving the company entirely before I was able to quit. Unfortunately, I had to hit the 1-year mark to be able to apply to different departments within the company. 

I won't lie to you and say that I was counting down the seconds until 1 year was up. It was hard enough to land that job in the first place and after dealing with Nboss for 7 months, I was exhausted. And to be completely transparent, Nboss liked me so I didn't get the worst of their treatment, but I still endured their power trips and despised how they treated my co-workers. I'm also not naive to think the leopard wouldn't eat my face.

On a lovely Thursday afternoon on September 19th, Nboss's need to micromanage and overall bad behavior finally gave me the push I needed to clean up my resume. That same day I reached out to friends and applied to open positions on the company website. Mercifully, my search lasted only 2 weeks. The day after I was offered the new job, I was making coffee when Nboss came up to me with a shit-eating grin and their hand out for a pound saying “unexpected”, then walked away. Apparently, that same morning, Nboss’s boss had a serious conversation with them about why three people were quitting within the same month. 

I gave my official 1 month notice (company policy, don’t ask) the following day and Nboss acted like they couldn't care less. The following week Nboss couldn’t stand to even look at me and left me alone, but all good things must come to an end. The following Monday Nboss informed me they were able to negotiate with my hiring department to keep me for an extra 2 weeks.

Those next 5 weeks were hell. I had to train a new hire and Nboss tripled my work; often not coming into the office and telling me 15 minutes before a meeting that they wouldn't be able to attend and asking me to take lead when I had no idea with who it was or what it was about, giving me tasks I had never done before that had to be completed by end of business day, etc. I got through it out of spite, help from my more experienced co-worker, and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. 

It has been almost half a year since I left, and I’ve come to know that Nboss received multiple HR complaints while being on probation for hostility, yet they’re still there terrorizing everyone.

All this to say that what everyone says here is true: the only way it will get better is by getting out and never looking back. 



Tldr: nboss was and still is awful. If you can leave, do it.





Note: the industry I'm in is very niche. If something doesn't make sense, apologies, but I'm not willing to go into more detail.

Note2: my partner read this before I posted and asked why he wasn't mentioned as the loving supportive boyfriend who was rooting for me the whole time (he was).",4,1745548597.0,ManagedByNarcissists,1,1.0,False

Short answer: anyone trying to get paid on the 'Gram. Whether you're a coach, a digital product seller, or even a small biz owner, **6-Figure Instagram Stories - Virginia De Assis** gives you the playbook to sell without sounding salesy.

If you’re tired of posting random stuff hoping it leads to something—and you want to show up with purpose, this is for you. Also, if you want to sound like *you* instead of copying some generic template, Virginia’s big on authenticity.

# Where Does It All Happen?

Everything is online, baby. You can take this course from your couch, your favorite coffee shop, or while pretending to work from home. It’s super accessible, and it even comes with a bonus—**Profitable Story Prompts**—which is a full year of content ideas to keep you from ever getting stuck on “what should I post today?”

So whether you're chilling in the U.S., traveling the world, or building your business from a small town, you’ve got access.

# When Should You Start?

Honestly? Yesterday. But today works too. The sooner you dive into **6-Figure Instagram Stories - Virginia De Assis**, the sooner you’ll stop winging your content and start creating stories that actually *convert*. It’s self-paced, so no pressure—but consistency is key here. Start now, and you’ll likely see changes in your audience interaction (and maybe even your income) faster than expected.

# Why Does This Course Matter?

Because we’re all tired of spinning our wheels. Posting just to post doesn’t cut it anymore. Virginia shows you *why* stories work when done right—and how to stop just entertaining your followers and start *serving* them in a way that leads to real business growth.

Plus, the course doesn’t feel like boring textbook stuff. It’s like getting tips from that one business-savvy friend who just gets it and breaks things down so you actually understand and implement.

# How Does It Work?

Virginia teaches through video lessons that walk you through each part of her story-selling system. You’ll learn how to:

* Craft stories that keep people watching
* Use hooks, design, and structure like a pro
* Connect emotionally with your audience (aka build trust)
* Slide in that CTA without being cringey
* Analyze your results with Instagram Insights

And it’s not just talk—there are templates, examples, and of course, the 365-day content prompts that help you stay consistent without feeling like a content machine.

# Final Thoughts

**6-Figure Instagram Stories - Virginia De Assis** is kind of a game changer if you want to make Instagram actually *work* for your business. No fluff, no hype—just real strategies from someone who’s done it.",1,1745548594.0,QiraStudying,1,1.0,False

I already purchased tickets for j-hope, the rose, xdinary heroes, and ATEEZ so I was hoping to get something under $100 just to be in the building, but I’m not going to spend that much for nosebleeds. 

I think the bubble on concert ticketing prices for huge shows is about to pop- Beyoncé and Katy Perry aren’t selling out, and SM Town has sold a shockingly low number of seats considering their lineup. Everyone wants to immediately vilify Ticketmaster (and they deserve a ton of criticism for dynamic pricing and exorbitant fees), but artists (or the tour promoters they hired) are setting their ticket prices and allowing dynamic pricing. 

K-pop fans spend a lot of money on our favorite groups. We’re buying multiple physical and digital album versions, fan club memberships, light sticks, weverse content, merch, fan calls, pop-ups, award voting, coffee trucks, online concerts/videos, movie theater events, streaming content, send-offs (which needs to be a separate post on why we tolerate them stacking the fans), and buying and making concert freebies. Do they really have to sell a corner nosebleed at that price?

I understand the prices being a little higher- the shows typically have a high production value, but I’m sad to see them start to price out so many people, myself included because I think we all just want to go and see them. I’ve been to almost 100 concerts, and K-Pop is by far, the most expensive. I’m seeing a pop/rock show next week that cost me $35.

It came with the house, and I use it pretty heavily as a family of four that only eats out once a week. It's a basic stove, but honestly - I really like it and it has served me well so far. 

Well, today I went to make a cup of coffee, which I use the smaller back burners to do. When I hit the button to turn the back burner on, the front burner (big one) turned on as well. I shut it off, tried again and the same thing happened. I then turned on the front burner, but the back burner didn't turn on. It only happens on the left side (the right side has the variable sized burner, which works normally). 

Any idea what could be causing this? I'm guessing repairing a 12 year old isn't worth it. My two concerns with not replacing the stove: major - it's going to fail soon or could be indicative of other problems that make the machine as a whole unsafe. And of course, the lesser concern - a family member or friend (it's rare for other people to use it though) not realizing the problem and catching a cutting board or something else on fire. 

If your answer is I should replace it sooner rather than later: What would you get? (Gas is not an option for every reason). I really like that I don't need a backsplash with mine, but I'm willing to consider putting one in if the right unit needs it. ",1,1745548259.0,Appliances,1,1.0,False

Hi (34M). hope your having a good day cute reader. Just here to tell my history.

15, April. My fucking birthday. I hate that date. The day my awesome tragedy started. Lots of issues there. Thing is that day i was wasted as fuck going to the university (really easy stuff i do fine in terms of grades for a degenerate human like me). And i met whit my best friend (who is my love interest, fuck that shit i dont control that feeling and she knows what i feel), She look at my drunkass face and oh boy she got mad (i mean come on it was my fucking birthday and she knows is fucking sad for me to deal whit that date). 

  
""YOU HAVE TO GO TO REHABILITATION"" whit fire in her eyes. I can do it alone I told. ""NO, YOU FUCKING CANT"". She even text my mother hahaha (i gave her number in case of emergency, we are real good friends). 40 minutes of minutes of pure rages upon me, a somewhat of smart moneky shitface. We go to class later at 7:00 PM, things cool off, she gave me her presents.   
  
And i went to a friends house to keep drinking yeaahhhh Then i open my present and started to cry in front of the boyzz (no shame tho', long time alcoholic, no shame in crying, its a fucking routine!), she draw me a bird and a clay sculpture that i made but she did some crafty stuff whit fire and so on. I was moved by her.   


16, April. Had a test at the university that day. I wont drink i said to myself, and i have to look her again. I was feeling like shit. Was a test group, so i didnt have to write, shit that i could not do at the moment, my hands were shaking badly. The week before i invited this girl to watch a movie in my house after class and she told me ""Dont get confused"", we already talk about my feelings, we fucked a few times also but she didnt want a relationship, she broke up whit her excouple a few months ago. That day walking whit her back to the bus stop she accepted to come to my house. We watched a reeeeeal bad movie, so bad we have fun of how bad it was, and then we went to sleep (different beds).  


17, April. We woke up at the same time, around 10 AM, she started to tell me i cant fucking drink anymore, not as mad as before but slightly angry. She goes to her home. I sat drinking my coffee for 15 minutes. And guess what, yeah baby i had some beer left! BUM i open one of those godly cans, and just started drinking while watching the news. When i was at my second beer, she text me, ""I forgot my cellphone charger"". And there was i fucking souless. ""If she comes back, i am fucked, fuckity FUCK"".  
  
She didnt, was already on the bus on her way home. I started to feeling like a piece of shit. Oh we addicts are great for the poetry of lying and not giving a fuck. Well, i was giving some fucks this time. So i did what any sane dude would do. Call your cocaine addict and also alcoholic buddy! But this time was the final one (hahaha how many alcoholics say that to themself). I went to not sleep for al the snorting at 7:00 AM.

18, 19, 20 April. Living hell. Forcing me to eat. Wont get into details, i may have hallucinate some shit.

21, April. I get up of bed. Took a shower. And when i was drying myself, i was feeling... good? I started to cry like a river. I realize that... it was possible? IT WAS FUCKING POSSIBLE! Every time i remember that morning i get sentimental. I discovered the gift of my birthday (only person who gave something btw), wasnt the draw and the clay, was her fury (and that fucking illusion).   
  
Went to buy some paper and pencils to draw to do selfmade therapy stuff (and well she likes to draw, gotta show my artistic bullshit also). I was thinking ""lets reconnect whit my inner kid"" and that kind of crap when drawing. And i discovered, another shitty catch frase, i just found out the adult. When i was a kid and teen a drew alot, first Gokus and anime shit, then monsters from hell or space (no anime style), then futuristic cities and shitty achitecture type of things. Lets try some of that?

At that day i didnt draw before in like ten years whit the spirit to do so. Was difficult at first, then i gained confidence and just started to do introspective dark shit (and drunken kitties, got alot of drunken kitties). Didnt draw any of my kids drawing. It has helped alot.

Anyway, next day arent interesting really. Just not drinking and doing fine till now. (to be fair it will be 1 week sober tomorrow at 7 AM but) ONE WEEEEEK SOBEEEEEERR WHIT NO FUCK DOCTORS, NO FUCK PILLS, AND ALONE.

I’m a third year college student, Aerospace Engineering and physics as a second major. I tend to receive good grades and usually study hard. I pride myself in thoroughly knowing the material and putting in enough effort until I reach a deep thorough understanding. I also work over the weekends to afford rent and all other expenses. I have a boyfriend of four years  with whom I am moving in together in 3 months. 
Given the nature of my majors, my studying takes over all other areas, be it friends, spending time w boyfriend, seeing family, or even exercising and just taking care of myself and relaxing. I recognize the issue and actively attempt to combat the time management challenge by doing things like food prepping, making schedules, studying with breaks, planning etc. I use google calendar to plan study times, I have set up my day in such a way where I should always study from 8am to 5-6 pm, and my evenings should be free. However, what ends up happening every single semester is that at some point things snowball, I don’t sleep well one night, then I push studying for later, then I scroll for an hour, and I find myself having to pull an all-nighter just to complete all my work. Afterwards it takes a few days, even a week sometimes to just get myself back into the groove, and most of the time I am continuously behind on learning the material. 
 This kind of lifestyle obviously affects my mental state, it disrupts my sleep and I occasionally lash out at my boyfriend, which I do not pride myself in. This intensifies when exams are approaching, meaning right now, because finals are in a week. 
All of that said, I recognize that I am very good at setting up support systems for myself, such as prepping meals ahead and freezing them for days when I can’t cook, and planning my studying ahead. However, I seem terrible at sticking by those plans, be it because I feel like I don’t have a social life and I stay up until 3am scrolling, or be it because an assignment turns out more time consuming than I thought. I recognize that I lack discipline that would keep me in line, not allowing for such things to happen. At this point I don’t think pure motivation will do it, so I am looking for literature that would help develop self-discipline. I am a firm believer that discipline is what gives you freedom, now I just need to implement it haha. So please recommend books/authors that might have useful ideas, tips, or just your own experience with overcoming this snowballing issue, when everything gets knocked out of schedule, and you’re a stressed mess that can’t put themselves back into structure.  
Another important aspect - I find it difficult to study in specific places. I have a desk set up in my bedroom, and sometimes I am very productive here. Other times my bedroom is too relaxing and I end up procrastinating. I’ve tried to study on campus, but I am a snob about noise, so anytime people around me talk/eat I get annoyed ( not proud of that either). I also tend to feel restricted when studying on campus. Coffee shops are off the table due to the noise issue. I am especially concerned about being able to focus at home, given that I’m moving in with bf soon, and studying at home then just seems impossible bc we always talk/hang out.  So if you know how to develop a mental connection between a specific place and a state of mind, please share that as well. 
All ideas and input is appreciated, criticisms included.

I’ve been having a lot of the symptoms of ALS and finally was able to see my doctor who wants to go the “let’s rule out everything else” route.  I assume that is standard but my concern is that I am in a pretty steep decline. I went from “normal” to nearly unable to live by myself in 4 mos. At this rate I could require assisted living in 2025. 

Doctor wants to first rule out a pinched nerve, then maybe refer me to a neurologist. Meanwhile I can barely lift a coffee cup (split hand, split elbow) and I am twitching and cramping all the time. I’m assume it’s just their process as she said the neurologist would reject the referral absent ruling out these alternatives. 

My question to the sub: is there any benefit to me trying to move things along more quickly? If there’s no effective treatment, should I just relax and let them go through their process of excluding everything else since I’m not losing time or anything. If I had the diagnosis I might organize my life differently (quickly organized family trip, maybe find assisted living spot) but if it makes no medical difference maybe I can be at peace letting it play out slowly.

1k7a3k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k7a3k4/do_i_f22_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_m28/,Do I (F22) break up with my boyfriend (M28)?,"We have been together for 6 months now. He is a good guy, just not a relationship type of a guy (he had one relationship before me and it lasted 4 months, everything else were casual hookups).

The biggest issue is that he doesn’t know how to behave in a relationship or how to set priorities, and because of that, he comes across as immature and childish. For example, he allowed his male friend to share his bed, supposedly just until the friend ""figures things out,"" which was supposed to be for a few months. The friend is still there, sleeping in my boyfriend’s bed, and even brings his girlfriend over—apparently, she has no problem laying in a bed that another man besides her boyfriend sleeps in.

I work and study, and it would be easier for us to spend time at his place (because of the distance), but that’s not possible because of his friend, so we mostly see each other in cafés. As a result, we don’t get to spend real quality time together or have deep conversations. My apartment is even farther, so we’d definitely see each other more often if he had his own room. He hasn’t said anything to his roommate and doesn’t plan to—not even to point out that maybe it’s not okay for the roommate’s girlfriend to be coming over when his girlfriend doesn’t. The same rules should apply to everyone.
By sharing the bed, he saves around 120 euros a month, but it’s not like he’s using that money wisely—he drinks up to 3 coffees a day with friends and colleagues and orders stuff from Amazon.

I also think that he doesn’t understand or know how to establish healthy boundaries with his best female friend. He has shared some of my intimate issues from my past relationship with her because he wanted a “female perspective”—as if he needed another woman to validate that my feelings were real, like I wasn’t enough on my own.

Also, when he visited the said friend with a group of people, he couldn’t talk to me on the phone because she was hiding behind him and eavesdropping. She apparently thinks that kind of behavior is cute or funny. Also, her Instagram is full of provocative pictures, and her bio literally says “the goal justifies the means.” Recently, she called him at 11 PM asking him to take a walk around the city. I got upset because I feel it’s disrespectful for my boyfriend to go on casual night walks with a girl who isn’t me. It just made me so insecure, you just don't do that in relationships. It made me feel like my boundaries don't matter and I started feeling like I couldn't trust him with my heart. Not because he is going to cheat but because he does things so nonchalantly, not thinking about me in the process.

A few days ago, I was seriously ill, barely able to get out of bed, and he came to help out and just be there for me. Suddenly, around 2 PM, he told me he’d leave for a bit to see his best female friend in town and then come back. This really hurt me because he knows he can rely on me—I’ve taken care of him when he wasn’t well, I've let him sleep at my place while he wasn't feeling well bc there are too many people in his. I cooked and went to get groceries, his meds, I did everything I could to make sure he recovers. It never even crossed my mind to meet up with anyone else, let alone someone who makes him feel insecure.

At that point, I was ready to break up, because he keeps making the same mistakes. I keep explaining that we need to set boundaries and communicate, but he ends up doing what he wants and I end up in tears. He eventually calmed me down, and we agreed that I would meet his friend the next time they hang out (he had suggested that before, but I’m an introvert and had already met many of his friends, so I needed some time to adjust.)

The next day, he went to work so we didn’t talk much, but he still found time to ask if I’d like us all to meet in a few days. Maybe I’m too sensitive, but even that hurt. After all the crying and explaining, after a sleepless night, he thinks I’m just ready to meet her—as if it’s more important for him to be fair and fulfill his promise to her than to understand me for once, to see that I’m hurting, and not expect me to meet her immediately.

There were other situations too—like when he got upset because I didn’t want to get into the car with his male friend group and go for a ride. I wasn’t aware we’d be driving, and I was raised to be cautious as a woman. There was a misunderstanding, but instead of trying to understand why I felt uncomfortable riding with people I don’t know, he got mad at me because I said I'd prefer to stay home instead and then ignored me for 6 hours. For someone who values communication deeply, I realized this was his way of punishing me.

I don’t think he understands that he’s no longer single, that he’s in a relationship now and that  priorities change. I feel like his life is going on and passing me by and he invites me in when he has time and when he is bored. He also knows he can depend on me and uses it, but as soon as I'm not needed anymore I'm not a priority anymore. 

There are more situations like these, I just wrote a few so you understand my point.

I really don't know what to do. Thank you for reading

And I’m like, “Heck yeah, I deserve nice things.”

I get there, order super safe: eggs, toast, maybe a tiny bite of hash brown. No dairy, no grease bomb, no weird sauces. I was basically a food monk. Everything seems chill... for the first 10 minutes.

Then my gut does *that* little churn. You know the one. The “you’ve got maybe 15 minutes before the chaos begins” churn.

Suddenly, I’m not listening to my friends. I’m scanning for exits, locating the bathrooms, planning a fake phone call to excuse myself. Why is every nice cafe bathroom always hidden like it’s some sort of escape room?

Twenty minutes in, I’m walking briskly—not quite running, but *speedy*—like someone who remembered they left the stove on. I swear I almost knocked over a stroller on my way out. Got home just in time to realize... this was a full-body betrayal.

It’s not limited to bars and clubs—it’s for real-world, everyday situations too. You’re learning how to become that guy who’s just naturally good with people.

**Who Is This For (Besides the Obvious)?**  
Sure, it’s aimed at guys who want to get better with women, but it’s also for anyone who struggles with conversation flow. If you freeze up, feel anxious about keeping a chat going, or wish you could just be smoother, this system is for you. Jon breaks it down so even total beginners can follow it. No flashy gimmicks—just solid, usable tools.

**When Will You See Results?**  
That depends on how you apply it. But since the course comes with actionable steps and daily conversation practice routines, most guys start seeing a noticeable improvement in a week or two. It’s not magic—it’s repetition and using what works. The system is designed to build real-world confidence fast.

**How Does It All Work (Without Feeling Fake)?**  
Here’s the cool part—*Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn* isn’t about putting on a show. It’s built around being authentic, playful, and present in your interactions. You’re not learning scripts—you’re learning structure and flow. So instead of overthinking what to say next, you just *get it*. That’s where the “effortless” part really kicks in.

1k79vn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k79vn1/would_love_some_advice_on_this_because_i_dont/,Would love some advice on this. Because I don’t know what I’m doing,"
Soooo I am 24 F and the guy I’m hooking up with is 33 M and married. I am single. 
We met through work. I work in a shopping centre and he is part of the security. Me and him sorta hung out through mutual co workers and got coffee few times and then we just made a plan to meet and since then just meet once a week or two to hook up in a parking lot. 

I’m just unsure. We text all the time. Sexual , normal talk and in person we’ve talked for hours about religion, relationships etc.

He never mentioned he was married. I found out through someone else because he initially said he is divorced and that’s it. Which is true. So this is his 2nd marriage. Why hide you’re married ? 

When we talked he said his wife is someone he is happy to go home to , they met at the gym etc and showed me a picture when I asked. He does fuck around. He doesn’t have affairs just hookups. He said he’d never do a gf on the side. 

Now the thing is he constantly tells me he gives no shit if I hook up w others. He simply doesn’t care and he is just surface. It just feels when we are together so different. Like he asked me once - did you hook up w him? Don’t fucking lie to me. 
And I said no I don’t do that. And he said I don’t care anyways. You can hook up w anyone I don’t care. 

I don’t know just I kinda wish to be more a bit. To be a gf and I kinda feel I’m being stupid. I like his personality and company but tbh idk how to make him see me for me. It’s only been 1 month but I kinda just wonder how it’ll keep going. He just gets no feelings at all ? I don’t get it 

I know one of the other co workers fucks around too but really loves his wife. But the one I’m hooking up with never says much of her and like when I asked what if she cheated, he said she can finish w him and then we can divorce. That’s fine. That ain’t love for me.

1k79vfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyabuse/comments/1k79vfv/my_former_therapist_let_me_live_with_her_now_shes/,My former therapist let me live with her. Now she’s kicking me out - and moving a new client in,"I started seeing this therapist (now 40s F) when I was newly 18 (now mid-20s F). It started out normal, but it evolved into a dual relationship.

She offered me a hug during a session. Then the next she’d have me sit next to her and hold my hand. Then she would schedule me to be her last client of the day and stay with me at her office well past midnight. Soon, she was speaking with me on the phone almost every day for 2-3 hours at a time. She would start meeting me at coffee shops outside of sessions. That turned into her meeting me in empty parking lots or her office late at night or early morning to sit with me. 

The relationship was never sexual, it just pushed a lot of ethical boundaries that confused me. She’d hold me and we’d sleep in the same bed. She told me she was “fixing” my attachment issues. Then at some points she would get overwhelmed and push me away. I’d cry and have panic attacks and she would call me manipulative and dramatic and push me away.

Eventually I would stay at her house for a few weeks at a time. Then a little over 4 years ago I fully moved in. I only started paying her rent 8 months ago. Things really started to come to a head when she moved in another client. Since I had the second bedroom, the other client has been sleeping in her bed next to her. It wasn’t until then that I finally started to realize how inappropriate my relationship with her has been. It was what everyone in my life was trying to point out to me for years.

I recently called her out on it and asked to talk to her about how uncomfortable it made me feel. I also pointed out how she was treating me differently and that I’d like her to be a little less cold to me. Long story short, it didn’t go over well. 

Now she’s kicked me out, changed the locks, and refunded me half my rent money. I looked up the laws in my area and apparently I’m considered a tenant and she is legally not allowed to do this.

I’m experiencing so much grief and I feel betrayed and discarded. I wish both of us would’ve made better decisions.",7,1745547221.0,therapyabuse,6,1.0,False

2 years ago, i was helping operate a coffee shop with an investor.

 i never signed an operator's agreement.

 i opened the business credit card with American express under my name but with the company's bank account. after a few months, i decided to leave and surrendered the credit card under my name. About 14 months after that i was notified by American express the card hasn't been paid and had $3,000 on it that needed to be paid but i haven't been apart of the business in over a year and when i logged in i saw a long chat history of the current owner trying to remove me from the business credit card but they never reached out to me to do it. 

The card is now closed but i am responsible for paying it off. 

Ive been trying to get them to pay it off (they've made a few minimum payments) before i pay it off and take them to small claims court. I have screen shots of the chat on american express website as well as text logs of them saying they'd pay it off. 

what kind of attorney would i ask for help in this?

do i have a good case to win against them?",1,1745547202.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

1k79s9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1k79s9r/contextual_approach_anxiety/,Contextual Approach Anxiety,"I’ve recently gotten out of a LTR and am just getting back in the game. I’ve been making a habit of starting conversations with most people I encounter in day-to-day life to build the habit. I’m to the point now where I don’t really feel awkward starting conversations, even with beautiful women, but only in certain situations and if I feel like I can think of an opener that is relevant to the environment. If I can’t think of anything I kind of freeze up and if I feel like the approach would be unusual, I’ll also freeze up. I will provide some examples, but I want to know if this is normal, am I messing up by not trying even if the approach seems inappropriate? Just looking for some feedback and wondering if I’m just in my head too much and need to man up, or if these are genuinely bad dynamics to approach a woman in public. I’m also happy to elaborate on any of this.

Situation 1. Beautiful woman sits directly across from me at a cafe as I’m working on my computer. I notice her drink is so hot the steam is obnoxious so I made a comment about it. We chatted and bantered for a minute or two before her friend showed up and I went back to work. I didn’t try to engage again after the friend showed up because I didn’t want to interrupt their conversation or make them feel like I was eavesdropping. When they left, she went out of her way to get my attention and say goodbye. She was even hotter than I initially realized. I had no problem starting this conversation because she was sitting across from me and there was something I could naturally comment on.

Situation 2. Cute girl standing next to me at a crowded bar/club as I ordered a drink. I’m pretty sure she was saying something about my beer to her friend, so I told her “you don’t want to drink this beer” or something like that and we flirted for a minute or two and she told me she was from the city that the beer was made or whatever. She was twirling her hair and I can tell she was into me, but I kind of just turned away and back to my friends once our conversation hit a lull. I fumbled this one because I definitely could’ve asked her to dance or something, but the point is I had no anxiety or worry opening this conversation.

Now I’ll give two examples where I got anxiety and chickened out.

Situation 3. Pretty woman walks into a cafe where I’m working on my laptop. She walks past me to the counter and I have no idea if she saw me. At the counter, I see her glance over at me and play with her hair as I looked back. When she got her coffee, on the way out she was making eye contact with me the whole time with a big smile plastered on her face and I just let her walk by. This is where I’m kind of lost, should I be jumping up and trying to stop this woman on the way out of this crowded cafe? I have a lot of anxiety about this kind of approach, but maybe I’m just being a pussy.

Situation 4. Again, I’m working on my laptop at a restaurant. Cute girl sitting to my 2 o’clock in a booth by herself. She’s far enough away though where I wouldn’t be able to talk to her without yelling. I was there for a while and there were times when there were people in the surrounding booths and others where it was just us. I noticed that when she got up she would look over my way and play with her hair, but dart her head away when I looked in her direction. I just didn’t do anything. I had mad anxiety about approaching her and interrupting her work or that she would feel uncomfortable with nowhere to go since she was sitting in a booth and I would have to go up to her and hover over her to start a conversation. I couldn’t think of a way to start a conversation without it seeming completely unnatural and risking getting embarrassingly rejected if I was misreading her signals.

So what are your thoughts? Anything I should be doing different? Am I just being a bitch? Any advice. It’s been many years since I’ve had to approach and I’m just trying to knock the rust off.",1,1745546956.0,CoreyWayne,0,1.0,False

1k79rfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWX5/comments/1k79rfi/help_very_torn_deciding_between_two_different/,Help! Very torn deciding between two different 2022 X5 xDrive45e's,"Hi all, I'm very torn by which vehicle to pick. Here are the details

First Option:  
$45,500 ($50k out the door) with 41k miles + clean title, one owner, and features:   
  
Canberra Beige/Black Sensatec (mehh?)   
Drive Assist Pro (must have feature for me)   
Premium Package

I'm not sure how they got the black accents on this since its listed as 'xLine' on the sheet. Aftermarket maybe? And if so, I wonder about the quality of the work... Also the X5 badges on the back are removed. This is being sold by a BMW dealership (NOT CPO) and seems to be pretty immaculate overall.

Second Option:

$42,000 ($46,500 out the door) + 52k miles w/ 1 owner and good service history, BUT two 'minor' (cosmetic) fender benders on the Carfax report, one on the front bumper and one on the back (both about a year apart). This one has a lot more features though than the first, with:   
  
Drive Assist Pro,   
Park Assist Pro,   
Premium Package,   
M Sport Package,   
Trailer hitch,   
M Sport Break Calipers,   
Coffee Vernasca Leather.   
  
I do like this one a lot because of the extra features, but I'm a bit concerned about difficultly reselling in a few years due to the carfax, as well as any possible damage to the Drive Assist sensors....

1k79r1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k79r1y/a_good_reason_to_be_followed/,A good reason to be followed.,"This will sound like a fictional story to some but to others who have felt it (kind of) will think of this as a good reminder to always watch your back. 

6 years ago I was in a coffee shop at Starbucks and I was ordering a cappuccino and I saw someone in the corner of my eye. Watching me, I sat down and had my drink and then I left but when I was walking to the shop to get some food the person was still following me so I did something now that I think was stupid.

I went to the men’s toilets and locked myself in a bathroom, I heard a knock on the door and I said what anyone would say “someone is in here, sorry.” But they stood there still for about 2-3 mins because I could see their feet bellow the door and I “asked what do you want?” And the man said “I was paid to kidnap you, but I’m doing the right thing. I won’t do it.” I wondered why me? It turns out a group of people were following me for 5 months because of past family history.

I then left the stall and talked to him in private next to a shop alley. He was about 6ft 1 with black hair and green eyes and we talked for about 10 mins and then we exchanged numbers so I could check on him when he was in a safe place from the people. 

He walked me home and I trusted him because if he really did want to do something to me he would of done it in the alley, I waved him off but I saw 2 men in masks down about 50-70 feet away from my house watching in ski masks. I then messaged him about 30 mins later saying “how you doing?” The man then said “I’m walking home now but I do not know what the people will do to me.” I then said “don’t worry just go to the police and write a statement.” The man then replied very fast saying “that isn’t possible.” And I was extremely confused because anyone normal would do that. He then said “I have a history of violence including the police.” And I then thought and said “go home, lock your doors and just wait in case somebody knocks and if they do, call the police.” And the man agreed and then he messaged me later in the evening messaging me “they found me.” I was in shock because he sent me a photo of the people and 1 of the men wasn’t wearing a mask. It was my uncle who was an alcoholic 10 years ago and it seems he was still on it, the man messaged me saying “I know them, I owe them money. I stole from them a few weeks ago .” I then messaged him saying “call the police now, do it.” …The man never messaged me again, I never saw him again and to this day I have not seen my uncle since.

I then a week later went to the police to do a missing persons report and a restraining order against my uncle and hopefully I never see him again.

Cheating or no?,"Okay so it started off when I was in Brazil with my boyfriend two summers ago. My best friend from childhood, Jarred, passed away in a car accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend. Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Costa Rica and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now. Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with. I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends. I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”. Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man. Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me. Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up. On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time. Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from myn type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him. Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways. Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me. When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.

1k79owp,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1k79owp/a_story_with_a_character_with_schizotypal/,A story with a character with schizotypal personality disorder (Chapter 1),"Hey. I'm a person with schizotypal personality disorder and I wanted to write a story about a person with this disorder. Here it is. Feel free to criticize it, I know I'm not a good writer. I just wanted to give it a try.

It was a dream in which God stood before me in all His glory. Innumerable seraphim fell down before The Great Light, unfazed by the brightness and heat. And in the middle - what I saw was indescribable. 

A void filled my vision and my cheeks went wet - with a jump, I realized it was not from tears, but from my eyes melting down my face. I stretched an arm out to Him and tried to run forward, but before I knew it, the ground gave way from beneath my feet.

I could make out remnants of the light giving way to void. Around me, eerie laughs rang out from someplace far, far away. And I was all alone.

 And then it was 8:38 AM when my shift started at 9:00. I ran to the bus stop and forced down a scream when I watched my bus ride off before me. It was the third time this week I'd slept through my alarm. I couldn't have mama wake me up because she was at work. I'd have to make the half-hour walk to work.

I eyed the cars speeding past me as I walked on the sidewalk. I felt their judgement rain down on me like tar, me in my McDonald's uniform at my young age. Perhaps they'd assume it was a part-time gig to get me through university, or they could read my mind and tell the truth - that I was starting a whole new generation of white, immigrant trash. They could tell it in the way I walked, the way I *talked,* and my stupid name. In some ways, I was lucky; many of the immigrants at my work were Indian and couldn't hide their otherness to save their lives. I was still white, but still *other.* This grey area left both parties grasping at and looking for defined rules to follow while interacting with me, and more than often the best solution they could find was to ask me if I'm Russian or Ukrainian, knowing I might tell them no, feigning ignorance, and then saying my English is good. 

And how did they see me now..? Just another Ukrainian-but-not-quite-Ukrainian immigrant just trying their hand at the American-but-not-quite-American dream? A Polish man in Canada in a McDonald's uniform was not out of place. What was is the fact that I immigrated as a child. I was supposed to go to school, get my education, go to university, and go somewhere higher. As it is, school wasn't my thing except for English class, ironically enough, so I decided not to waste my money on university and got right where I belong, as a wage slave to a company greater than my mind allows me to comprehend. Couldn't go to trade school, was never enough of a man to be good at using wrenches or saws. I was used to people calling me the first term that comes to mind when you think of a man like myself - middle school left me with a healthy dose of self-hatred and humiliation. It escalated from a pink hoodie to Party City wigs to my mama's old dresses - and I could never even pin down why I was doing it. My mother supported me, said that love was love and that if I really was gay then so be it - except, I never was gay, or transgender, or any of the other billion identities floating around nowadays. No matter how obsessed with labels this world becomes, my self always slips out of its grasp like oil. 

The real deal is, that when I look in the mirror, I see nothing, and feel nothing, except the vague sensation that if I stare into one of my eyes for long enough, a black hole will appear out of thin air in its place and consume everything ""I"" am. And then I'll just *be.* Unseeing, unhearing, unfeeling. A soul in a vacuum. That's all I am.

I could see the golden arches above the grey clamor of the world. They stood like a flag - *this is McDonald's territory*. Within this space, and every space in your head we shall occupy, *we* will define reality. *Mc*Nuggets, *Mc*Cafe, in a *Mc*Space full of ordinary *Mc*People. Baby McGoats to sacrifice. Melt reality on the grill for three minutes minimum - scoop the liquid left with two spatulas - and shape it like ice cream on a board. Delicious. Someday, you, too, will make ice cream. But only with permission from higher-ups. Only the higher-ups can choose the ice cream flavors, get it? You stay in line.

My manager looked like a deer in headlights when she spotted me trying to sneak my way past her line of sight in the rightermost area of the kitchen, even though I was the one who was caught late. She strode up to me, and it occured to me that if she were wearing stilettos instead of black sneakers, she would be truly terrifying. 

""Do you know what time it is?"" I feigned ignorance.

""Um, 9:10? Sorry, my bus was canceled."" ""Last time you said your dog died, and before that, there was roadwork at your bus stop. Kasper, what is going on?""

I couldn't honestly answer her if I tried. No matter how hard the world tried to drill it into me, though, I could never become a reliable person. Could never recite my times tables. Took longer to learn the alphabet, could never operate my body to square dance or do a cartwheel. Or get to places on time. No alarm I set, nor planner I write in, changes my form, a squirming blob of potential. Melt reality on the grill for three minutes minimum - scoop the liquid left with two spatulas - and shape it like ice cream on a board. Delicious. Someday, you, too, will make ice cream. But only with permission from higher-ups. Only the higher-ups can choose the ice cream flavors, get it? You stay in line. 

I nodded and positioned myself at the grill with my head bowed. One of the grills was broken again. A repairman was tinkering with it, wires all over the place, like something out of a sci-fi flick. One wrong move and the repairman will die. And yet, it seemed to me, as if the repairman was still in the position of power. When a piece of machinery does something differently than the rest, it must be repaired. It does not cooperate. It is not productive to the company's end goal. And what does that mean if the company defines reality?

Four hours into my shift my manager asks me to step inside the office. Stomach plummeting to my feet, I know what she's going to say before she says it. ""...And with all that considered, Kasper, we're going to let you go.""

In that moment, something overcame me. A feeling of absolute power. For a moment, I genuinely considered opening the scalding cup of coffee on the desk and throwing it over her face. I considered punching her. I thought of singing. Crying. Dancing. And for a moment, I thought, ""this is how God must feel."" My thoughts were moving the continents, they're coming crashing together at the speed of sound, earthquakes exploding over the world as it united into one, with me at the very center, me, the grand orchestrator, watching…

""I understand. Thank you for keeping me as long as you have."" My manager sighs. Disappointment. I was familiar with the feeling, and with others feeling it towards me. 

""Alright, go punch out.""

And yet, as I clocked out of work for the last time, I could've sworn a dribble of spit landed on the floor. Unfortunate accident. Won't happen again. I don't make the ice cream. The ice cream machine is broken. And I headed on out.

My therapist has been really trying to help me have check ins with my parts and it’s just not going well.

I’ve set alarms, I’ve tried to come up with things I do each day that another part likes to trigger my awareness that I need to check in, and then, nearly every day, I forget. I’m still wary of internal communication, so I avoid. I also struggle a lot with amnesia so even if I have good intentions, I can’t follow through.

Part of me avoids while another part of me wants to progress. But I seem to sabotage myself. My parts want me to take initiative to communicate, and I let them down nearly every day. I have told my therapist I’ll check in with one part when I drink coffee, bc they like coffee too and I drink it every day… but then I drink coffee and checking in does not remotely register as something I should be doing. Then they write about how upset they are, and then I feel bad about it.

1k79orj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1k79orj/solstice_scent_reviews/,Solstice Scent Reviews,"Hello! I fell down the rabbit hole of indie perfumes back in January, and Solstice Scents was the second order I made. After several months of resting (at least a week before initial impressions), testing, and very inconsistent note taking, I'm ready to try my first review! 

THE PERFUMES: Camp Willow, Cellar, During the Rain, Pinyon Truffle, Runestone, Violet Mallow - all in oil format

THE RATINGS: Out of 10, a 4-6 is a perfume that I solidly enjoyed, although it may feel somewhat without shine, or not quite my thing. 0-3 something about it turned me off, 7-10 I am intrigued and I actively want to wear this again.

MY PREFERENCES: I am still very much figuring out what I like and dislike. Notes-wise I have tried and especially like patchouli, champaca, spices, red musk, tar, evergreens, tomato leaf. My very favorite perfumes so far are all earthy florals, sometimes with a charred twist (ie Zoologist T-Rex, BPAL Tlazolteotl). I like scents that feel open and expansive, with room to breathe or subtle shifts to break up the monotony of scent. I'd love to find a perfume that smells like realistic violet leaves or toasted grains!

I like fruits & honeys, but seem to otherwise have an aversion to sugary/syrupy/prominent sweetness. I've had beef with strong amber, vanilla, and white musk. There's also a specific note I dislike that I suspect could either be a strong bergamot and/or oakmoss. All of these notes show up in perfumes I *do* like, though, so they aren't a total no-go

SOLSTICE SCENTS EXPERIENCE: Solstice Scents were very easy to order from! On the website their perfumes are exceptionally well described, which is really useful for a newbie like me. I was able to understand a lot by referencing what the perfume *actually* said it was, and comparing it to what I assumed or wished it to be. 

For the most part their formulas didn't work for me, but were so loved by my friend and sister that they ended up placing orders of their own after smelling my samples. To me, the scents tended very sweet. Even when I was intrigued by an opening, I lost interest as the top notes faded and the sweetness was no longer balanced. 

## CAMP WILLOW
`Campfire, Fir Balsam, Spruce, Pine Needles, Black Coffee, Vanilla Pipe Tobacco, Marshmallow & Bourbon`

I haven't worn this much and tend to wash it off after the opening fades. I was intrigued by a campfire atmospheric, and really interested in the coffee and tobacco notes! Unfortunately I didn't take the marshmallow and vanilla as seriously as it seems I should have. 

The opening is sweet pine and smoke and what I read as chocolate (probably the marshmallows and coffee). None of the individual notes stand out strongly - they blend and twine together, with one or two occasionally peeking out. The fresher notes dissapear quickly (within less than half an hour) and from there its purely sweet and smokey.

Test 1: forest, chocolate and just a hint of smokiness. 
Test 2: sweet smoke and pine lingering in the background, a hint of crispness. 

2/10 I enjoy the opening and can appreciate it on other people, but I don't like wearing this. (As an aside - the description mentions campfire at night, but for whatever reason the subjective impression I get is of a morning campfire, or of a grey afternoon!)

## CELLAR
`Damp Earth and Stone, Wooden Casks, Cool Fall Air, Crisp Apple, Pear and Broom Corn`

This one has 3 distinct stages to me, and I *love* the initial scent with the rush of damp stone + fruit. It does give the impression of the cool breeze that wafts out when you open the door to a stone-walled room or a shed with a concrete floor on a warm day. There's no mildew or rot to the scent in my experience, just an earthy dampness. The apple/pear scent is the strongest component, and it is absolutely juicy and well balanced at first with the background earthiness. The cellar scent fades before the first hour and the apple gets a little sweeter and warmer. At this stage the earthiness is basically indistinguishable to me and I dont enjoy it nearly as much - it's not bad, just monotonously sweet. Once I hit the second stage it doesn't seem to noticeably morph. However, waking up the next morning the apple is definitely gone while a sweet skin scent remains strong - broomcorn, I think? It is  warm, cozy, and mild at this stage, and I like it with the apple gone.

4/10 I am so delighted by the opening, and I enjoy the apple in the beginning while there is still an impression of cellar air. I initially rated it higher, but honestly as much as I enjoy the apple-pear scent, it gets a little dull for me as it sweetens and warms. I would have to be in the right mood to reach for this. Good throw and longevity! My friend *loves* this one, and in the perfume brackets I held Cellar made it to the semi-finals.

## DURING THE RAIN
`Petrichor, soaked Earth, limestone, loam, clay and wet concrete`

This is very strong - a little goes a long way, and the beginning stage is honestly slightly off-putting to me as that initial concrete-y ozone-y smell comes in swinging hard. It's a *very* fun one to show people, and very realistic. As it dries down on paper this smells a lot greener/grassier than in the bottle or on my skin! It also smells milder and grassier wearing this on my skin during an actual storm.

5/10 very fun to sample! Comes on strong and fast, mellows fairly quickly on my skin. Incredibly accurate, but not quite the rain scent for me with that initial oomph. I'm giving it to my friend.

## PINYON TRUFFLE
`Chocolate, Pinyon Pine, Pinyon Resin, Swiss Stone Pine, Tonka, Vanilla`

Okay *this* is an interesting one. I tried it once, hated it, adjusted my expectations, and tried it again with a lot more appreciation. It's not what I was expecting or hoping for, but I did end up really intrigued by this scent! If u purchase, I definitely recommend testing on paper *and* skin to get a different feel for it

1st Test:
This is just a no from me. I was pretty excited for this one, but I was looking for more of the dark and powdery and fermented scent of cacao paste blocks - I didn't actually want *chocolate*. The description of pinyon pine as fruity and cardamom-spicy and the description of cocoa as earthy was promising to me, but ultimately what I was hoping for was an ultra dark/fruity/earthy cacao paste, and what I received was refined chocolate. It's pretty much a sweet pine truffle as it is named and the impression it leaves is strange. I think it was well-described, but I was hoping for something different and mis-read what they were going for with this one!

2nd Test:
You know, on re-smell + with expectations adjusted, I'll give this one a lot more credit. It is a sweet and spicy opening on my skin, with a hint of juicy pine. On the test paper it leans juicier and sweeter and a little less spicy. The cocoa is present in the background, providing a weird richness for the pine to play off of. I'm not quite sure how to explain the juice part, it's sugared but in a wet and clear and refreshing way. Overall it is intriguing, if a bit bewildering, and I find it a lot nicer than I remember, it ultimately just doesn't work for me once it loses the spicy edge.
  
7/10 ??? it's a weird one - I can't quite decide whether it's charmingly odd or charmingly off-putting. Is it giving piney cream soda or Hershey's bar hanging out with the ghost of a car freshener? Initially I despised it. The more I smell it, I think I might love it? Since it's caught my interest and I can't make up my mind, I'm giving extra points for weirdness and intrigue. It's a natural like runestone but it has a little more throw for me (runestone basically has none). I'm not sure how long it lasts - I haven't yet worn it for a full day with intention. It will stain pale skin and light clothes!

## RUNESTONE
`Natural Earthy Forest Blend With Aged Patchouli, Vetiver, Oakmoss, Cedar, Violet Leaf, Dirt, Leaves, Cypress, Spruce`

My love! The winner of the perfume bracket, and the only scent aside from During the Rain that wasn't dominated by sweetness for me. It doesn't smell as deep or earthy to me as the description suggests - instead, it opens with a wash of cool, freshly cut herbs, almost minty (not peppermint, but something in the mint family). There is earthiness present, but it's mostly background and keeps the herbal and evergreen notes grounded. Those opening notes stick around a long time, instead of disappearing within the hour, they seem to weave throughout the life of the scent! As it fades you get a bit of that ""been outside all day"" skin scent mixed with hints of lavender and pine. 

The perfume is made up entirely of naturals and my skin tends to drink it up. I applied as recommended on the SS website for pinyon truffle (moisturize, apply, wait to dry, apply again, repeat applications until happy). I probably did like, 4 or 5 applications all told? On paper and clothes the scent is stronger. Would definitely recommend the spray for this one.

Test 1: It smells more like spruce/pine/cypress than anything else to me. I think I can get hints of the lavender! There is less of the stone and more of the forest. At times it smells cool and crisp, at times sweet, at times masculine, warm and dry, but in order to smell anything at all I need to press my nose into my wrist! 12 hours later I can still smell it faintly and it's sweet and interesting, but only with my nose to my skin. Even on clothing it is faint (meanwhile cellar on my sweater from last night is still wafting up to me at times)

7/10 intriguing and pleasing, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. I don't think I'd live in it, but I do really enjoy smelling it. Somewhat lasting (particularly on clothing) but unfortunately pretty faint. Or maybe it's for the best, I can see this being overwhelming if applied too strongly. That being said, that would be *very* hard to do

## VIOLET MALLOW
`Marshmallow Cream, Violet Flowers, Vanilla Bean, White Musk.`

Oh this one was so bad for me... Tried only once. I got this on a whim because I love the smell of violet leaves. Somehow, I thought that this meant I would like this perfume based on vibes. As it turns out, violet flowers and marshmallow smell nothing like violet leaves and dirt. Who coulda known

Test 1: In the bottle and wet it reminds me of vanilla extract, then vanilla. As it dries I think I am getting the violet. I am not sure what violet flower smells like, something astringent maybe? A floral, but far away. Five minutes in I..... Hate this. It smells *slightly* sour like a scented hand sanitizer or like a vanilla sugar bath and body works lotion with a weird note. 

1/10 I wish I could balance this with a second impression but I gave it away immediately. It smelled better to me on paper and on my sister, but I hated wearing it. My sister loved it so much that she bought a full size

Addendum: I called on my sister for her review, and here is what she said! (For context she is the master of being cozy, and this scent is very much up her alley in a way it was not mine):

""It's definitely a very warm scent vibes wise. It lasts pretty long like most of the day but idk it might depend on how much you wear. It's a little overpowering and strong when you first apply but like after 10 minutes it mellows out. The violet tends to fade and so you're left with a sweeter scent but it's not a sickly sweet one. More of a warm one like I said before if that makes sense""",9,1745546656.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False
1k79o44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1k79o44/talisker_distillery_visit_cask_drawing_6_reviews/,"Talisker Distillery visit: Cask Drawing, 6 Reviews","Good day r/Scotch ,

Having finished up the Advanced Whisky Ambassador program (https://www.thewhiskyambassador.com) April 16th, I met up with my wife back at our hotel and we drove up to the Isle of Skye to visit Talisker. One of my personal favorites since being introduced to Talisker 10 many moons ago,  it's been on my bucket list of distilleries to go and visit. I had planned this trip out and booked the Cask Drawing experience, which entailed drawing from five different non-purchasable Talisker-owned casks and one bonus dram, that was purchasable. Those being:

1. 11 Year old, Refill Hogshead, ABV 60.3%
2. 12 Year old, Recharred wine cask, ABV 56.8%
3. 21 Year old, Refill cask then port casks then puncheon, ABV 58.3%
4. 12 Year old, Refill cask then gonzalelez bypass Pedro-Ximenez (PX) sherry butt, ABV 57.9%
5. 28 Year old, Refill butt and rejuvenated (recharred) hogshead, ABV 59.8%
6. Talisker Elements 27 Year old @ 58% ABV (Official bottling/distillery exclusive)

How much for the Cask Drawing tour? As per the site: £150 per person ($277 CAD), at 1.5 hours duration. A 10% discount at the shop is given if you show them your band.

After getting our event band at the front counter, we met up with the guide and group and went for a brief tour of the distillery. If one has been to a couple of distilleries, much of it is similar. You typically get some history about the distillery, the process, see the mill, the washbacks, the stills and the spirit safe.  One item of note, a Porteus mill, which I've seen in several distilleries including Springbank, Loch Lomond, and several others. Why does this matter? It's a vintage piece from the 1940s that was so well-engineered, the company that made them went out of business. Now, many of these yesteryear pieces of equipment still see production use.

After the tour, we went into the Cask Drawing room. There, we each got a turn to use the valinch (aka whisky thief) on the cask to fill up the individual glass jugs for their respective dram. Once enough was collected, we'd get to try the dram and move on to the next. We were on a time limit of about an hour, and we'd only be able to try the 6th whisky if we had time. I made it a point to not linger too long and not drink too much with each dram. With tastings like this, it's a rookie move to have too much of anything - cask strength *anything* can and will get you if you drink too much, too fast.  Fortunately, driver's kits were provided as part of the event. Our guide for this event was a cool guy and had a good sense of humor.

**Reviews**:

Talisker 11 Year old, Refill (Bourbon) Hogshead  
**ABV**: 60.3%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Straw  
**Nose**: Cereal, salt, brininess, smokiness  
**Palate**: Salt, cereal, spicy, vanilla, faint aspect of smoke, medium mouth-feel  
**Finish**: Salinity, light wisp of smoke  
**Conclusion:**  A younger expression that in the line up, wasn't all that impressive. Post-tasting at the distillery, the ABV on this dram is very present.  6/10.

Talisker 12 Year old, Recharred wine cask  
**ABV:** 56.8%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Amber/Ruby  
**Nose**:  Dry, red wine, brown sugar  
**Palate**: Brown sugar, medium mouth-feel, slightly grapey, salty, balanced  
**Finish**: Medium, with some dryness from the wine coming through  
**Conclusion**:  In the line up, this stood out as it had a bit more expressiveness to it. Post-tasting, this is an unusual expression for Talisker. I suspect that this was a dryer wine, like a Bordeaux, that was used. 7.5/10

Talisker 21 Year old, Refill cask then port casks then puncheon  
**ABV:** 58.3%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Deep gold  
**Nose**: Salted caramel, brown sugar  
**Palate**: cinnamon, honey, cloves,  smooth and juicy mouth-feel \`  
**Finish**: Medium, dusting of chili flakes, a touch of salt, with honey sweetness fading into dryness   
**Conclusion**: Given the age and the ABV, another odd but tasty expression. Note, not their official bottling.  8/10  

Talisker 12 Year old, Refill cask then gonzalelez bypass Pedro-Ximenez (PX) sherry butt  
**ABV:** 57.9%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Gold  
**Nose**: honey, caramel, dried fruit, light smoke  
**Palate**:  salt, caramel, light sherry notes, a hint of smoke, stone fruit, medium mouth-feel  
**Finish**: lingering salt, drying   
**Conclusion**:  Tasty, though the sherry influence contributes to a longer finish. 8/10

Talisker 28 Year old, Refill butt and rejuvenated (recharred) hogshead  
**ABV:** 59.8%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Gold  
**Nose**: citrus, maritime, cereal,   
**Palate**: Tropical fruit, salt and pepper, juicy mouth-feel, bright sultanas   
**Finish**: Long drying finish with hints of citrus and salt  
**Conclusion**: This is a weirder one in the sense that it's an older whisky with a higher ABV and some lovely variation in flavors. A lovely dram. 9/10. 

**Bonus dram**: Talisker Elements 27 Year old  
**ABV**: 58%  
**Price**: N/A  
**Color**: Deep gold  
**Nose**: seaside air, shortbread cookies, honey, sultanas, smoke  
**Palate**: Briny, pepper, honey, sultanas, rich and full mouth-feel  
**Finish**: salt notes, lingering honey and fruity sweetness  
**Conclusion**: This is tied as being one of the tastiest expressions of Talisker I've ever had, too bad the bottlings for this are fairly expensive.  9/10 

**Final Thoughts**: Some context, for those left reading. Carbost is a quaint little village up in Skye. Leading up to it is single track with passing spots for when there's oncoming traffic. There's a store, a school,  a coffee shop, the Talisker owned restaurant, the Old Inn hotel and bar, all within walking distance of the distillery.  Oh, and up the hill, an oyster shed. All by the sea, with mountains in the background. It's a beautiful place to stay and unwind. Portree is about a 1/2 hour trek by car.

The Talisker distillery itself - the whisky is worth going for. It's a *busy* distillery - apparently it's seen upwards of 1500 visitors in a *day*. They've got a decent car park that allows for a fair number of vehicles. The entrance to the shop reminded me of entering a theatre due to the low overhang coming into the building. The shop itself has some neat Talisker-branded swag, ranging from shirts, biking jerseys, polos, other Diageo whiskies, all of the core range of Talisker, a fill-your-own-bottle station and another, pre-filled distillery exclusive bottling. If one is to believe, the 27-Year Elements bottling may very well be another Distillery Exclusive. ",16,1745546602.0,Scotch,2,1.0,False

Caffeine (CA), found in coffee, tea, and soft drinks, has been shown in lab tests to stop the formation of tau aggregates and even break apart existing ones. However, the exact way caffeine works at the molecular level was unclear until now. In this study, scientists used advanced simulations to examine how caffeine affects tau proteins. They discovered that caffeine prevents the tau proteins from forming harmful structures and can even disrupt the ones that have already formed. Caffeine binds to the tau proteins in specific ways, and this helps stop the disease-related changes from happening.

Additional reading into the correlation between caffeine and CTE delay/prevention can be found in this sub by searching keyword tea or caffeine.

This is from years ago but it still plays in my head as to whether sharing this information was inappropriate when being asked such a personal question.

I may have gotten the reaction I wanted from my gossiping coworker, but I question whether I shouldn’t have elaborated or even answered the question at all.

Years ago, I worked at a coffee shop in one of the affluent neighborhoods in a condensed city. I was for almost 2 years at that point and had become familiar with the regulars, their orders, how to kindly say we don’t serve Starbucks beverages, etc. I had also been working with the same 6 people as well.

The diet I went on was candida yeast diet to starve the bacterial overgrowth in my nether regions. I decided to go on this diet after not succeeding with the medication my GP recommended and OTCs during that past year. 

One regular, a rich Asian lady who would always engage in conversation with us at the bar. Today happened to be 5th week I had been on the diet, and I had become noticeably thinner than I usually am; I usually had a medium-build athletic body. 

The regular asked, “hi OP, how are you? Did you go on a diet, you look skinny! Tell me which one because I am so fat. Hahaha!”

In Asian countries like China and Japan, being told that you’re skinny is usually a compliment. I knew this regular meant it in that way, but I decided to reply differently because of the coworker who was working the bar with me.

I should have said, “oh thank you, regular! I appreciate the compliment.” Then redirect the conversation to something else like how wonderful the regular looked that day, how it takes one beauty to know one.

I didn’t. I said, “thank you, regular. I was on a diet because of a bacterial overgrowth that I have been trying to get rid of for a year. The medicine from my doctor and OTC didn’t do anything to help it. Hopefully I’ll be off the diet soon.” Then I smiled and redirected the conversation.

From the corner of my eye I saw my gossiping coworker gasp and looking ashamed with herself. 


Now why did I say what I wanted? I did it because my coworker was gossiping with everyone else since the beginning about how I was having an eating disorder and said that I was dieting for no reason.

The worst part of all of it was that I had to pretend that I didn’t know that my coworkers were talking behind my back about this. I couldn’t call them out otherwise they would deny it ever happened. I didn’t feel comfortable sharing that information with them, mainly because of my trauma of being called a hypochondriac by my father every time I was in pain or ill. I already felt isolated from them, and even more so when this was going on.

I knew my coworkers were good people who did care about others, but I knew I was the exception since I was the “villain” on staff. It seemed like no matter what I did I was damned, so I had to carry on in my own way like nothing ever happened.

Although I still wonder to this day, would it have been better if I just accepted the compliment from the regular and redirected the conversation to something else?

I quit 2 years ago, but it has been the worst 3 years of my life. I started working in the beginning of Covid and only had 3 days of training. They transferred me to a drive thru where I was only allowed to do window and dto and no bar work whatsoever for 6 months. I constantly got yelled or lectured at. I worked 25-35 hours a week. Eventually I was transferred to a cafe store, which was even worse. I had to get retrained but everyone was fed up with me, I kept getting yelled at for mistakes and things that weren't even my fault, and was verbally abused by my supervisor for 2 years. My mental health was getting worse, and I got entangled in some pretty bad situations that took a huge toll on me. Yet, I rarely called off sick and showed up on time. I know I should've quit but I know I would've been hard on myself for being a quitter, so I endured it. I've had a supervisor purposely speak badly about me in front of me. I've had a supervisor constantly yelling at me every 10 min and call me dumb to my face. No matter what I did, it just wasn't right. I was basically the laughing stock. Eventually, I gave up trying and became lazy and tired of doing work when I'm never appreciated for it. There were days that were so hard that I just have a panic attack. Now, I feel fearful when I make a mistake, and yes I constantly make them. After leaving Starbucks, I felt like I had no right to make mistakes. Making mistakes just meant I was a fuck up. I now have bpd and ptsd, and I think about my time there frequently because I feel so dumb that I couldn't even handle working in a coffee shop.

Some context:
I went to a film and tv college that covered gcse and alevels. I was a hard working student, never got in trouble, never had detention, always handed work in on time, got low As high Bs in my subjects, bordering on mute if around people I didn’t know and didn’t have many friends, was closer to 1-2 teachers then most people in my year group and a large majority of the year didn’t even know who I was (around 60-70 in the year group) It is highly likely I have autism and anxiety but have never been officially diagnosed so it wouldn’t have been on my school file but my friends and teachers were aware and could tell based on how I was in general. I struggle with unfamiliar places, unknown people, not knowing the schedule and changes to routine. I had had some issues throughout my time at the school with this and the lovely lady in charge of student wellbeing and pastoral was aware of this and would occasionally sit w me or help when I got too overwhelmed. 

After I finished my alevels my school offered a program for 18-19 year olds that was like a skills crash course where you could pick a section and would do around half a year that was a mix of learning skills and doing some work experience. I chose the art side of the course and the lady running the program was also my teacher for the art section. There wasn’t many of us in the group, around 6, I didn’t really click with any of them but would make occasional talk and we all just became mutually accepted of the space we shared and it was a civil atmosphere. The teacher was out quite a lot only working a few days a week and when she was in she was helping with the other courses and running the program that took up almost all her time so we would have other people stepping in to run little workshops and just watch over us as we did projects we were set. 

I enjoyed doing the little projects and when the teacher was occasionally there she would come and look at my work and give me little pieces of help and encourage my work. 

After a couple months we go to the first work experience section. We had a big group meeting with all people on the program where we were told our expectations where we were told it was a luxury that these companies would take us on for a week or 2 and even if our job was to make coffee that we should accept it and take on what we were given with great enthusiasm. The course was free but we had to supply our own equipment and all our travel expenses had to be done out of our pocket which we were told beforehand. In the meeting we were also told that if anything was to happen while we were at the work places and we ever felt unsafe or anything happens that we are not sure about that we should report it to the school and just be careful of our surrounds as they had had some bad experiences with a couple places from the previous year groups program.

Us art group were split into little groups of 2 and given our workplace where we would go for 2 weeks, it was over 2 hours away by public transport and none of us could drive. It would cost some other students on the course about £30 a day for train tickets to get there. 

We were told beforehand that us ourselves had to contact the workplace to find out all the info we needed like what times we start, if we needed to bring anything, what they expected from us and anything else. I sent an email as soon as we were given the information which was about a week and a half before we were supposed to go and got no reply. The boy I was partnered with to go with for the 2 weeks was deaf and couldn’t do phone calls and so even with my bad phone anxiety I stared at the phone for literal hours before calling the number provided by the school to find out what we needed to know since I didn’t get an email reply and time was running out. The lady that picked up the phone was new to the job, I introduced myself and said that I was going to be doing work experience that my school had arranged, she didn’t even know we were coming, had no idea what we were going to be doing there and said there was no other info she had for me and hung up after about a 3 minute phone call. I went back to the school and told them how the call went and they told me it was my problem to sort out. 

On the day of, I got my ass on a train to a dark sketchy ass building stock yard type estate in the middle of London 2 and a half hours from my school at 9 in the morning to a company that didn’t even really know I was coming by myself because the boy I was with had some train trouble and was going to be late (not that the company had told us what time to come for). I walked to the building and there was only people working in the workshop so I asked this man that I was there for work experience and bless him he took me back to the worker break room and introduced me to the man who ran the workshop (not company). I again introduced myself and said I was here from my school for work experience, he asked me what I specialised in and I said prop and set building/making whatever. His reply was to follow him and he took me up some stairs and into an office where I was given a chair next to the receptionist and he walked away and left me there. The receptionist had no work for me because she didn’t know I was going to be there and so I sat and worked on school work for around 9 hours. 

The boy I was going with turned up about an hour after I did, met the same man in the workshop and told him the exact same thing, and he was lead to the workshop and introduced to the all men team and given little jobs to do. He asked where I was and he was told ‘men work in the workshop and woman work at the desks so I thought she would be happier with the girls upstairs’

-The building company is run by a woman who I didn’t see once on my first day-

After I was told to sit at the desk I sent an email to the lady that was in charge of the work experience and told her I was not comfortable being at the company and what had been said and how I had been treated by the members of staff and asked if I could work on a project at school instead. She replied to my email asking if I had spoken to the owner of the company and that I would have to stay till the end of the day and that if I wanted I could go into school the next day instead of back to the company to ‘discuss what had happened’

I went to school the next day and was put in a meeting room with the lady running work experience and the lady running the program and was shouted at for being unprofessional and that I was told to expect boring jobs and asking if I thought I was ‘too good to be doing little tasks’ told that women will always get little comments like that in this job and even her as a 40 something year old still gets comments about her being a woman in a male workplace and that she’s learnt to just ignore it. I was then given the work experience owners phone number and told to call her and apologise for my behaviour and not sorting it on the first day and to discuss about what my place would look like after for if the owner would even want me back in her company. The 2 women left me in the room sobbing hysterically and after not being able to call the owner I went to a wellbeing teacher in the school to try and calm down (who was ironically the program runners husband) he found be sobbing in the corridor and I told him a brief rundown of what had happened and that I had to call the owner and his reply was ‘yes my wife had explained what had happened last night’ thought great, love that my horrible experience was told over your dinner that night. I finally managed to call the owner and she told me that she was sorry about what I had heard but she asked her members of staff and none of them had made a comment, but after some chat she changed it to ‘I have spoken to the staff member and he’s said that you’ve taken it the wrong way and that I run a woman lead company and my staff would say anything like that’ but that she was happy for me to come back to the company and have a chat with her in person and give me some little jobs to do if I was happy to come back but she would come and meet me as I arrived and set it up for me. 

I agreed to go back but only if she was there to help set it up but she had a meeting she had to go to so it was pushed back another day till she was free. 

I went back, she did not meet me, me and the boy were sent up to the attic and told to sweep dusty floors for 6 hours and clean out all their old equipment with a lovely member of staff who was knew to the company, whilst cleaning we found porn magazines and other rank shit, no one came to check on us and it was not worth the money we were putting into it but I went home miserable but was going to try and suck it up and go back the next day. 

The trains were cancelled, it was raining and I was being shoved on different trains at 6 in the morning to go back and ended up having a breakdown on the train platform and had to call my parents to come and get me because I couldn’t get back to the company (they still hadn’t told us what time we even needed to be getting their for even when we asked members of staff at the company). My parents didn’t want me going back to the work experience because of how bad my mental health had become over it and they emailed my school about what had happened and that I would not be going back that day and I went to school instead. I was pulled out of the room I was in to be put back into the meeting room where I was screamed at until I was hysterically sobbing again about how I had disrespected the school and they were appalled by my behaviour and it threatened my place on the course that I would have to be removed since I was not taking it ‘seriously’ and getting my parents to email the school was a pussy move and that I am 18 years old and shouldn’t have to get my parents to fix my mistakes. I was then put into a meeting with the same 2 ladies and the principal where I brought a friend with me as backup and the principal told me that even though I had gone through this that the work experience and he was ‘very sorry it happened’ but that it was a big donator to the school and a good connection for alumni and so I needed to grovel and kiss the feet of the owner in the hopes that she would accept my wrongdoings and take me back for work experience and to call the company to let them know I wouldn’t be in that day (they didn’t answer the phone so I had to leave a voicemail and no one ever got back to me)

I told them that I was not comfortable going back to the company which lead to the conversation that if I don’t complete the work experience then I couldn’t pass the course. I told them that I want to leave the course and wouldn’t continue it or go back to the company. The lady running the program told me I wasn’t able to make that decision that day and I had to ‘go home and talk it through with my parents to make sure I was sure of my decision’ (I would have to pay for leaving the course which I was aware of and happy to)

I went back the next day after telling my parents I was dropping out and told the lady running the program I was leaving. She went on to tell me what a waste it would be to drop out because I had good potential and that if I had told them beforehand about my hesitancy with the work experience that ‘other measures could have been taken’  and her last words to me as I left was

‘Be careful when you make accusations in case they aren’t true’

I took my shit and walked out and didn’t go back and got my bill by my parents email a few months later for about £100 that I paid in full. I lost my entire support system that day and all the teachers I loved and had connections with, with no future plan and no idea of what I wanted to do and not a single person from the school has checked in to see how I am after it

—————-
The boy still continued to go back after I dropped out. On his last day there the one person from the workshop that was new and lovely was about 20 years old, had an accident in the workshop and someone had dropped some heavy materials on his hand that had de gloved and broken his fingers leaving him in critical condition in hospital with plastic surgery needed to fix the damage

—————-
Once the boy had finished his 2 weeks, the next 2 people from my course went and the girl walked into the building, one of the staff members looked like one of her r@pists and so she walked straight back out again and didn’t go back and the school had no issues with her not going and arranged something different for her to do instead


There is probably some bits I missed because this was from almost 2 years ago now but it still fucks me up with how it went and the shit I went through

I think it is perfect for one who is struggling to understand what happens in the mind of a dementia sufferer.

My parents who lived together, alone (I know it’s an oxymoron) had a regular schedule for their daily existence. One of their rituals was having coffee. They had a Keurig and made single cups, one at a time. In their more lucid times, they had realized that they had a small bottle that, when filled was the perfect amount of water for each cup of coffee.  That was part of the ritual. They had all the other steps memorized after pouring in the bottle of water.

Dementia progressed and they still had this ritual in their daily routine. Since dementia had progressed around this ritual, it was an automatic thing to do. Then one day, the bottle was broken. That shattered bottle’s remains were gathered up by them and placed off to the side. They weren’t thrown away as normal trash would be. There weren’t any thoughts of “what else holds the same amount of water?” They were both stymied by the fact that their one step in the process was missing. They lost the ability to make a cup of coffee at that point. Their simple cup of coffee was removed from their routine because a bottle was broken and it wouldn’t ever return. The precious bottle still remained on the counter, in pieces, almost as a shrine.

I finally understood today that this example was the perfect explanation of dementia. It is THE loss of reason and routine. A break in an established routine that your mind cannot establish a workaround is what dementia takes from you. Those parts of your brain do not function like they did before. It’s like an “if this, then that” (IFTTT) routine that has been interrupted. Interrupted by a simple broken bottle. There is no repairing the routine because the bottle is gone from the equation and no other vessel will work because you don’t know how to duplicate what the bottle provided.

That is what dementia is - that interruption – a broken bottle in the middle of your routine. That piece of your every day series of events that didn’t require reason, it was just a part of your routine that absolutely fit. Once it is deleted, the entire routine is gone. There is no fixing it, it is simply gone. Most of their broken routines are like that. They have a piece of their routine that has been removed (whether by their own body’s chemistry or accidentally like a broken bottle) and the remainder of what was a comfortable routine is shattered and gone and will not return.


That is the definition of dementia...simplified, in my opinion.",29,1745546096.0,dementia,5,1.0,False

Obligatory disclaimer:
This post wasn’t auto-generated. It was written with time, coffee, and a healthy disregard for consensus.
If you’re here to drop “thanks, GPT” or “you clearly don’t understand quantum physics,” relax — you already won that debate in the mirror of your own priors. Now sit down. This might sting a little.

⸻

TLDR for those who read the title and comment anyway:

There’s something in quantum physics called the Quantum Fisher Information metric (QFI). It measures how well a quantum system can distinguish between infinitesimally close parameter variations.

Now here’s the proposal:
What if wavefunction collapse happens when the system hits the upper limit of its ability to distinguish?
What if staying in superposition would violate the system’s internal logic, so it projects itself into the most coherent subspace available?

Yes, this idea is dangerous. Because it implies:
	•	Collapse isn’t a weird physical event — it’s a functional, logical projection.
	•	Reality is whatever the universe can still distinguish without contradicting itself.
	•	And all of this can be measured, not just speculated — using QFI.

⸻

The equation that summarizes it all:

g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{QFI}} = \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{Tr} \left[ \rho(\theta) \{ L_\mu, L_\nu \} \right]

This is the Fisher information metric over the quantum state space. It defines the informational distance between nearby quantum states.
When that metric collapses (i.e., its determinant goes to zero), the system can no longer distinguish nearby hypotheses.

What does the universe do?
It projects into the nearest coherent subspace.
What do we observe?
Collapse.

⸻

Logical Collapse Condition

At its core, this isn’t about wavefunctions or measurement devices or whether a cat is alive, dead, or writing a postdoc application.

This is about how much a quantum system can still tell the difference between possibilities — and whether it can keep doing that without falling apart.

Here’s the idea:

A quantum system is always juggling multiple possible futures — that’s what superposition is. But for those futures to remain meaningful, the system has to be able to distinguish between them. It has to know, in an inferential sense, what the hell it’s doing.

That ability to distinguish isn’t infinite. It has a budget.
There’s only so much “inferential bandwidth” the system has before things get… muddy. And that bandwidth depends on how well the system is structured — how well it can correct for noise, maintain coherence, and keep its internal logic intact.

So what happens when the number of distinctions the system tries to track exceeds the amount of coherence it can preserve?

It collapses.

Not metaphorically. Functionally.

Collapse, in this view, isn’t some spooky event triggered by measurement. It’s the universe saying:

“This is now too ambiguous to continue distinguishing safely. Time to pick a coherent branch and move on.”

Think of it like a quantum version of a memory buffer overflowing — except instead of crashing, the system reroutes itself to the most stable, least contradictory path. Like a self-healing quantum code.

And that’s where surface codes come in.
Because if this sounds like error correction… that’s exactly what it is. Surface codes are how we stabilize logical information in quantum computing. They detect when too much uncertainty creeps in and correct the state by projecting it back into a coherent, valid subspace.

The universe might be doing the same thing — just at a cosmic, fundamental level.

⸻

Retrocausality? Are you serious?

Dead serious. But not magical.

If you’re dealing with a self-correcting system (like a distributed quantum surface code), future coherent states can retro-condition the system’s trajectory.
The equation isn’t hand-wavy:

\vec{\mathcal{I}}r^\mu = -\kappa \cdot \nabla^\mu \mathcal{F}(\rho, \rho{\text{target}}) \cdot \Delta \mathcal{C}

Hate it if you want. But CPT symmetry is laughing at you right now.

⸻

Predictions? Yes. Because otherwise it’s just metaphysics in cosplay.
	•	Entangled quantum clocks in different gravitational potentials should show discrepancies in QFI — informational time dilation, not just relativistic.
	•	Zeno-like spectral decay, with abrupt jumps when QFI collapses into a null cone.
	•	Retro-conditioned interferometry (like a Mach–Zehnder with moving mirrors after the photon passed) should violate Leggett–Garg inequalities predictably.

All of this is simulatable with Qiskit, OpenQASM, and a bit of scientific honesty.

⸻

Why isn’t this accepted (yet)?

Because — let’s be blunt — standard theoretical physics:
	•	Has spent too many decades canonizing decoherence as a sacred cow.
	•	Hates philosophical significance unless it comes with an Oxford postcode.
	•	Still treats Fisher information like some weird footnote from quantum metrology class.

But that doesn’t make the idea wrong.
Just inevitably late to the formal party.

⸻

Want to refute it? Great. Just don’t recycle these dead mantras:
	•	“This isn’t science because it’s not falsifiable” → Already gave you three testable predictions.
	•	“But it’s not in the Standard Model” → Neither was the neutrino mass.
	•	“Thanks, GPT” → You’re welcome, but this one came with human-grade sarcasm.

⸻

Open discussion. But if you’re just here to quote the orthodoxy, bring arguments — not emojis.


TL;DR (again):

Wavefunction collapse may not be a mystery.
It may be a logical saturation, measurable through the QFI.
Reality emerges wherever the universe can still distinguish between options without imploding.
Everything else is noise — or someone’s favorite interpretation.

And what I wanted to do on these remaining months being here in the PH is to focus on my personal happiness. Neglecting the fact that I have a son under my roof rn and a same sex partner longing to be caressed.

Everyday, everytime I left for work, I receive long chats from my partner saying how terrible of a father I am to my 11yo son for leaving without preparing breakfast first for them and all that. That I don't even leave my son cash to spend for the day. That I don't take care of my son in general.

I never try to defend myself, but I fight back just so he also feels bad like how he makes me feel with all the negativities in the chat.

I left early, and I come home late. That's my jobs requisite. Altho, most of the time after work I meet with other people, to drink a little, have coffee, roadtrip, and even fuqq. Coz hey, I'll be away for a while soon and I can no longer do any of these. In short, I'm cheating. With younger people.

Anyways I really like how she’s written in these. Her being war captain is very surprising but it goes to show how it seems marvel finally realized what a goldmine of a character they have on their hands and that they should push her to be more important. It also makes sense since if anyone was gonna be in charge of the younger mutants it was gonna be her or Dani. 


This whole era also does a great job at showing she’s more then fit for the role, I like how she’s more of the powerhouse of the group, frequently beating groups of people with such ease the comic doesn’t even feel it’s worth actually showing the “fight.” Magik seems much more emotionally mature than before and her having to look after the younger generation seems right up her alley and while Dani is more of the group therapist, she does get to have good moments with characters like Glob, Karma, and Doug where she can use her own experiences to give them advice. 


One thing I really like is how she still hasn’t fully accepted herself, instead her self loathing has shifted towards rage and aggression. She constantly does a poor job at easing tensions almost like she’s hoping the conversation with the antagonist group will break down so she can have an excuse to fight them. 

You also see how she try’s to teach Doug to fight in the same Cat taught her back in Limbo. Her heart is in the right place and it’s clear how much she cares about the new mutants since that harsh training is what helped her survive as a child so she probably thinks it’ll work for Doug as well. Also on X of swords, her and Cyclops having code words is another neat way of showing how much they trust each other along with her teleporting all of sword base which I didn’t know she could do. 


This run also shows that she’s much smarter then she actually lets on and is the only one in the group we see double checking she isn’t about to break any of Krakoa’s laws like the “do you wanna make out” scene which is one of many examples of her pretending to be stupid. The same thing happens when her and Gorgon are sizing up their opponents in X of swords at the dinner when they firsts arrive to Otherworld.


That’s not to say she isn’t still a little gremlin, I love how often she’s chugging big pitchers of coffee or making jokes that feel more in line with how she use to act with the new mutants in the original run. This whole series in general nails the family dynamic between them all imo. 


Finally the Labors of Magik arc towards the end of new mutants is one of the best stories with her I’ve read so far. The parallels between her and Madelyn Prior are pretty well done and it feels like a long time coming for her to finally be free of Limbo. The whole thing with her facing different versions of herself when she’s stuck there is a great way to show that much like her Soulsword she can no longer hide the fact that she feels like she’s a deeply broken person and that it’s finally time for her to pick up the pieces and remake herself into the person she wants to be and her yellow costume feels like a great payoff to showing that she’s done just that. 


Her having to save her younger self and trying to comfort little Illyana only for the younger one to turn around and comfort her after she says she doesn’t want the young version to turn out like her by saying she’d be glad to be like her almost brings me to tears. Every version of herself she encounters helps to teach and remind herself of who she is, but the young Illyana really resonated with me the most, her knowing the childlike innocence she lost is proud of her is just such a great moment. 


What do you guys think of these comics cause I’m loving them all so far! There’s so much more that I took away from these comics but I wanted to keep it as short as possible so a lot it got cut, since I actually take notes after every reading session for my initial takeaways so it’ll make writing these updates and thoughts easier but there was just so much more then before for these. If you actually read all that thank you and I’d love to hear your thoughts on these comics! 


TLDR: Krakoa era Magik so far has a lot of the nuance and depth I’ve come to expect and I’m blown away by how well they portray her and how they’ve chosen to develop her. Somehow my love of this character has deepened even more! ",3,1745545266.0,Magik,0,1.0,False

Their recipe has almost a kilo of coffee for half the amount of water I used (1 gallon to 2 L). They recommend 800g of used coffee I think or 250g fresh grounds for 2 L. 

Taste was interesting. I would describe it as a mixture of a sour ale and a coffee stout. Didn’t taste sweet like my regular apple chunk + ginger tea based one. I will probably try again with twice the grounds so that the coffee flavor is stronger, but that is seriously a large amount of coffee! The coffee didn’t come through as strongly as I hoped.

1k795lp,https://i.redd.it/posotgnhxvwe1.jpeg,[KAWA] Abu 2660 Geisha Washed,"Forgot to take a picture of the brew itself. First time trying Kawa. José Lutrell is known for more heavy processing, and this coffee is no exception. While nominally a washed process gesha, this lot is quite processed, going through a double fermentation process (first being rested in cherry, then being pulped and rested again). As such I went for lower extraction adjustments on my regular recipe. These were 29 days off roast, which feels in the ideal peak range for a roast like this. 

Visually, the beans were quite light, being similar in appearance to other very light European roasters. To compare with other rotation offerings, I’d say it’s similar to Datura, and notably lighter than AMOC, B&W, and Glitch.

Texturally, the beans were surprisingly porous, being a very smooth grind for how lightly roasted they were. This is generally more common for more processed beans. 

Recipe: 12.5/200g at 92C, 4.8 on ZP6, 4 equal pours every 30 seconds, using the Origami dripper with Cafec Abaca filters. This coffee was more fines prone than I expected (again, more common with more process), leading to a total brew time of 3 minutes.

Aroma — very floral when ground. Brew was predominantly sweet in a brown sugar / baked goods sort of way. 

Flavor — definitely does not taste washed , straight up tastes like a natural process. Very juicy and sweet, but somewhat one dimensional. There was a hint of roastiness as well. Aftertaste was like berry juice, with a distinctly sweet note as well. Overall brightness was quite low, which I felt made the profile a little imbalanced. I didn’t get Kawa’s listed notes of nectarine, chamomile, elderberry, and black pepper, with elderberry probably being the closest to my experience. Hoping that extracting less will give more clarity. 

With regards to roast profile, Kawa’s style reminds me a lot of Prodigal and April (and like an inverse H&S) in that they seem to emphasize juiciness and sweetness over brightness and florality, though it’s somewhat early for me to say as it’s been a single cup. I also got their Kenya Kiandu AA, whose listed notes of chocolate and ripe plum also implied this kind of roast profile.

Will probably go quite a bit coarser for my next brew. Overall, decent first impression but sort of one dimensional; hoping further brews can find a bit more nuance. ",2,1745545005.0,coffeerotation,1,1.0,False

 Divorced for 6 years so a long gap without a date.

Well it was embarassing.
I set a coffee date at a place near where she lives nothing fancy after exchanging messages over tinder for 3 days.
I'm not the most talkative guy but do fine in social settings, however I completely blacked out and could only speak fast and with a lower tone of voice vs my normal, still perfectly clear but still very odd for me at least. 
I'm 184 cm tall ,she was 186cm but I already new that so it was not a surprise,  she was stunning compared to her pics but as soon as she begin to talk was a bit of a turn off for me. 
Very deep almost masculine voice and especially bc she only talked about sports so basically her life was between work and going to the gym. Beforehand I knew she had other interests (live music, museums and movies) still when I tried to bring up those she talked briefly and reverted back to gym talk.
I'm ok with that, we didn't have too much in common and that's fine at least we tried.The date only lasted 1h.

 What worried me was seeing myself as being completely inept and kind of a weirdo.

So to more active daters here I ask is this just a matter of being rusty and will get better with more dates or is there any easier way to make these less awkward?

Yesterday and today, I’ve just been angry, tired, frustrated and at a loss regarding both my design and video editing career. Normally when I have an off day, I’m just like “it’s fine, just allow yourself to feel this way and pick up the next day.” These past two days, it’s just been weighing particularly heavier on me.

As a freelance designer and video editor, I’ve been outreaching and networking with people nonstop. You name it — sending emails/social media messages, setting up coffee shop meetings, applying to part time, full time, contract jobs in both design and video, reaching out to people who are looking for designers across Facebook and freelance platforms like Upwork and Contra, etc. I’ve even done a recent project where in exchange for my services, I got ad space to promote my services. As you would guess, no luck there.

I see a lot of posts on here where many other designers are having the same exact problems, and I really feel for them because this whole career field has taken such a hit and I guess these two days, I’ve just been really infuriated with businesses that there’s this lack of communication and to be honest, laziness too. I can’t tell you how many businesses just straight up don’t look at their messages. Don’t even have a social if you plan on not looking at your messages. What if a customer was reaching out with questions via your social because you opened that route of communication? Already making a bad first impression.

1k79239,https://www.reddit.com/r/MUD/comments/1k79239/enter_mudvault_a_new_way_to_find_muds/,Enter MudVault: a new way to find muds.,"Hey all,

Over the course of time I've used many of the existing solutions out there for finding muds, like topmudsites, themudconnector, and mudverse, but I've been unhappy with the way the voting systems are handled, and the way the sites seem to fizzle out and completely die.  
I've also had some experience with sites like mudbytes, that have hosted useful snippets and forum posts, and thought that was great; but it seems to have died a bit, and is a bit hard to navigate.

Enter MudVault, which is what I came up with to attempt to solve some of the issues at hand.   
MUDVault attempts to prevent things like bot voting, and allows a lot of different sorting types for muds, like ratings, votes, sorting by tags, and more. I've implemented a useful searching system which allows you to easily find MUDs with specific keywords you're interested in, like pvp or housing or crafting or \*whatever\*  
On top of that, it's definitely one of the only modern looking websites of the type that I've seen, and it's enjoyable to use (imo).  
  
The website also aims to host a variety of snippets, admin tools, builder tools, and player tools.   
Think [MUD-Colorizer](https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/MUD-Colorizer), a tool I made for people to easily color things, [MUDForge TUI](https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/MudForge-TUI), a Rust based TUI client, [MUDForge](https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/MudForge), a Rust based cross-platform EGUI mud client, and the super graphical GMCP based web client I'm working on [MUDForge Web Client](https://www.darkwiz.org/play). I'd like to make all of the tools accessible there, plus some of YOUR tools, so if you have some tools you created that you think are useful for mudders, let's get them submitted to the website for people to easily access...  


The website is in early alpha right now, and you can find it at [MUDVault](https://mudvault.org).   
Right now you can add your mud listing, do some voting, write reviews for muds, and check out some (fake) snippets.   


The goal of the website will also be to archive some useful mud code, so I will do my best to host useful snippets that people will be able to view/copy/download easily from the site. 

  
If anyone has any questions, let me know. I've still got a lot of ideas I'm working on implementing into the website, so you may have a comment that I already plan to address.. I probably haven't touched on a ton of what I plan to do, but the Discord is useful for asking questions, and offering recommendations.

P.S. Google is the only way to sign up, for now, and that's intentional. I may add more methods later, but that seems to be a good way to stop some of the issues seen on a lot of other websites of the sort.

You can check out the mudvault discord subchannel on my mud discord at:

Friendly owner. Some of the best coffee I've ever had. Hot coffee is served in crystal wine glasses, what! I bought multiple bags and wish I bought more. Highest recommendation. 


2. Koffee Mameya - went twice. First cup I had here was one of the better cups I've ever had. Subsequent cups were great as well. The baristas are very knowledgeable and friendly. Not a huge fan of the set up - even a small line feels long here (you'll see what I mean). Nonetheless it does move along and the coffee is worth it. Highly recommend.


3. X coffee - went twice. First cup was a lychee coferment that was out of this world good. Good cheese cake. Friendly staff. Had places to sit both times we went. Highly recommend.


4. Philocoffea - recommended by the Koffee Mameya staff. No one which was amazing. Coffee was excellent but not outstanding in any way. No complaints and would go back. Highly recommend.

5. Lonich - I was Instagram incepted to go here. Mistake. IG suggests the coffee omakase with multiple unique coffee based drinks. This is only avaliable by reservation which was not obvious. When we arrived there was one person in the store. We were told the tasting menu was sold out but we could order a cup or two to go. The bean selection was outrageously priced. We chose one mid tier and the cheapest beans and it was $50 USD for two cups. It was a half hour wait for those two cups of coffee. Of note, during our nearly 1 hour in the shop, no one else came in for the reserved tasting menu that was sold out....the coffee was good but nothing special. I strongly recommend against this place. 

Bonus - Beyond in Kobe. Fun little open air corner store. Great pours and fun vibes. Check it out if you're passing through Kobe! Highly recommend.

Missed - so many but Glitch hurt the most. I walked by 3 times on 3 days at 3 different times. One time it was pouring rain. Every time there was a line down the block. Could not justify waiting over an hour for a coffee during a week in Japan. Maybe next time!",11,1745544077.0,pourover,4,1.0,False
1k78u5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoneySub/comments/1k78u5g/how_to_setup_a_profitable_coffee_subscription_for/,How to Setup a Profitable Coffee Subscription for Any Café,"## How to Setup a Profitable Coffee Subscription for Any Café

*I tested a **$25 “Unlimited Drip” coffee subscription** in two cafés and ticket size grew by **34 percent in 12 weeks**. Here is the playbook.*

**Why the subscription model for coffee works**

- Members visit every day, coffee is already paid  
- The affordable drink nudges people to add a pastry or sandwich  
- A lively morning crowd attracts new customers who notice the buzz  
- Steady revenue lets you plan bean and milk orders with confidence  
- Subscribers often bring friends who become buyers too  

---

## The Daily Brew Pass: Pay Monthly, Sip Daily

**One low monthly fee gives each member a fresh house coffee every day. No punch cards, no limits. They walk in, pick up, and enjoy.**

> **Tip:** keep it personal. Learn subscriber names and place their cups on a small **Subscriber Pickup** shelf. They feel special and other customers get curious about the offer. No forms or extra steps for the guest. Just show up and receive the coffee.

| Metric | Pay Per Cup | Brew Pass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue certainty | Depends on weather and mood | Collected on the first day of the cycle |
| Average ticket | Only coffee | Coffee plus pastry or snack |
| Flow at the counter | Quiet spells between rushes | Constant comfortable buzz |
| Customer loyalty | Easy to lose | Auto renew keeps them coming back |

---

## Foot Traffic First, Profit Second

**The goal of the pass is not to squeeze margin out of every cup; it is to pack the room.** Once you own the morning crowd, extra dollars follow naturally:

- **Pastry pairings:** train staff to ask “croissant or cookie today?” A three-dollar margin item becomes sixty dollars of pure profit when sold twenty times before noon.  
- **Upgrade moments:** offer a small fee to swap drip for a specialty latte. Most members say yes when the base drink feels free.  
- **Bring-a-friend perks:** “Your friend’s first cup is on us.” New faces convert into new subscribers one in four times in my experience.  
- **Retail shelves:** bags of beans, branded mugs, reusable tumblers; subscribers already trust the roast and love to represent the brand.  
- **Seasonal pop-ups:** pumpkin spice launch or summer cold-brew takeover; announce it in the members-only email and watch the selfies roll in.

> **Numbers to watch:**  
> • Average add-on per subscriber visit  
> • New-subscriber referrals per month  
> • Non-member walk-ins during peak subscriber buzz hours  

Keep the subscription price razor thin. The real money is in pastries, upgrades, and the steady flow of newcomers who wonder why so many regulars already have a cup in hand.

I feel like I need to vent. I was dating a woman I truly had feelings for, but the relationship was extremely complicated and confusing from the start.

She would often cancel plans last minute, and when I said anything about it, she’d respond with things like, “If you don’t like it, I’ll leave.” She complained that I didn’t go see her, but when I said I would, she’d say her room was messy. Sometimes she told me to find someone else, claimed I didn’t love her and would get tired of her. She tried to make me jealous by saying people asked if she was single or suggesting we download dating apps.

One time, she said she wasn’t going to a party, so I said I’d go to church. Then she decided to go to the party after all and kept insisting I go to church while she went out. I felt hurt and said if she didn’t want me to go with her, she could’ve just told me. She said I hurt her. I tried to make it up by buying her chocolates and showing up early to see her, but she didn’t want to. Her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. She introduced me as her boyfriend to her friends, and later that same night said, “Let’s download an app and find you a hot girl.”

She never wanted to show herself on video calls, saying her hair was messy. Conversations were very one-sided. We planned to go to the park, but she canceled saying she hurt her leg. Sometimes she’d just disappear when I tried to open up.

She told me her ex had abandoned her and that another guy had replaced her. Once, I was mugged and nearly lost her contact—her reaction was indifferent. She said she wouldn’t message me if I didn’t message her first. There were always excuses when I tried to see her.

We finally went to the movies together. It was a nice moment—we kissed and spent the afternoon together. But shortly after, she asked if it wouldn’t be better if we were just friends. Another time at the mall, she gave me a chocolate, and we spent some time together. Once, I walked her home after the park, and it was always clear she didn’t want me meeting her family.

There was a time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I mentioned how we never went out because she was always making excuses. She got really mad. Another time we played a game, I said something bad about it, and she got upset and quit. Everything turned into a reason for her to shut down or vanish.

After all this, I called and broke up with her. She cried and blocked me. Then she said I “sent her to the psych clinic” and took away her happiness. Not long after, she texted me saying she missed me more than she thought she would. We started talking again, and I found her on a dating app. When I asked about it, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex.

Despite everything, I told her I loved her. She told me she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her. She invited me to her mom’s birthday party—I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her daughter and later invited me for coffee. We started talking again, but she said her dad was angry with me. I got upset and vented online, and she saw it and accused me of using and deceiving her.

After that, she blocked me and disappeared.

I honestly don’t know what I did wrong. I tried, I was present, I cared, I loved her genuinely. But now I feel guilty for walking away. She said the choice was “MINE,” that I abandoned her, that I took her happiness away. But honestly, I don’t know if I was the villain or just someone who tried to love someone who wasn’t ready.

1k78twy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1k78twy/her_name_is_holly_p2/,Her name is Holly. P2,"The day she walked into the break room with her hair chopped off I nearly gasped out loud. Bangs she had bangs now, her hair didn’t look nearly as greasy. Full of volume, could tell she loved the new look. Her smile radiated around for days. She was touching her hair so much that week. I noticed when she started brushing away her slight grown own bangs weeks later. 

When had a one on one conversation the week I was promoted, in the office I now inhabited. I didn’t take time to decorate. Just a calendar on the wall and a white board for daily sales goals. She sat with her hands pushed under her thighs. Looking anywhere but at my face. I ripped the band-aid. 

Don’t remember exactly what I said something along the lines of I understand you also hoped to be in this position, and I offered to help her with development if she was interested. She cried, expressed her frustration being employed there for nearly 5 years and passed by for every leadership role. I’d been her before at my previous job. I felt for her. I knew I could help her if it’s really want she wanted. 

Slowly gave her responsibility along with free range to show some creativity. Involved her with planning resets and overnights. The first time she sat in for interviews her eyes looked like the a full moon. Talked a million miles a minute after. 

At the time I didn’t have a partner to run my departments, corporate has been restructuring. We finally got the go ahead to hire someone. Of course I did advocate for
Holly at this time it had not been 6 months of being in my role. I didn’t have any pull. 

My supervisor started her interviews for the opening. I met a few candidates. Didn’t seem impressed with any. Laura called me into the office to meet Tanner. He was a good bit older than me, his hair was kind of wild. Wore it really tall that’s the only way I can describe it. 

After his interview, Laura asked me a couple questions and gave me the run down on Tanner. We agreed he seemed like a good fit for the team. She agreed to talk with Holly since she had also applied for the position. 

Tanner and I got along really well. Looked forward to our morning check ins, coffee and sales reports sounds less exciting then it was. Found out early on how competitive he was. We split the sales floor down the middle to be fair. He was always trying to out sell my departments. With the split we also split the employees we would be responsible for (reviews, training, payroll, scheduling). 

Holly worked in women’s, which I kept as part of the split. There was a large even happening for a women’s brand launch, Tanner was coming in early to help set up. He had talked to me about painting and his fondness of the arts. That morning he brought in a stack of paintings. Holly offered to hop on the lift to harness the last brand sign, while Tanner and I sorted the paintings. He pulled one out from the middle. I instantly knew it was for me. He held it up high and said ‘it’s Starry Night meets Snoopy meets Bullseye. And it’s for you!’ 

Tanners art is still in my garage to this day. I love the painting it’s silly and colorful. He worked there for a few more months before deciding to take a role closer to his family. Leaving yet another position for Holly to apply for. This time Tanner and I both advocated for her. We both helped her with interview questions, I knew she was ready even if she didn’t. 

Holly didn’t know it but Tanner really pushed for her, more than me. He felt she might leave the company if not promoted soon, which Laura didn’t want. All the leads relied on her, she was very efficient and eager to step in when needed. I watched her unload a reefer trailer for the grocery team once, walked into the back and there she was face red pulling pallets off a trailer. Had to help her with the paperwork, guess she didn’t think that part through. She had drive, just needed direction.

Not asking for medical advice but honestly open to any and everything you got.,"Gonna try to condense what I been dealing with and see if anyone has any suggestions, thoughts, similar experiences. Don’t be afraid to offend me or say the wrong thing. Nothing you say or how you say stuff will bother me. Just want some help. 

So basically I was diagnosed with UC way back in 2003. Had about 3-4 colonoscopies from 2003 to maybe around 2007. From 2003 to maybe 2006 or 2007 I was taking Asacol. 9 brown pills a day. Wasn’t really strong and don’t know if it helped. From 2003-2007 had a few flareups and was given prednisone. From 2007-2009 I don’t recall anything crazy. I will say I had a life event happen from 2002-2005 and was essentially in juvenile jail (treatment facility) so the thought was it was caused by stress and anxiety. I was obviously eating relatively healthy there and I do remember having normal stools.

I continued to take medicine a little bit but eventually stopped taking it. From 2005-2010 I maybe saw Gastroenterologist a couple times and maybe had an additional colonoscopy but can’t remember. 

2010 moved to Florida. I ended up getting deep into drugs (pain pill addiction, drinking, street drugs like X, E, Powder, and tobacco). Also abusing amphetamines (Adderall) however I want to see a Gastro Dr once or twice from 2010-2014 or 15. Maybe a colonoscopy. Important to mention that from 2008-2016 I never really saw a dr continuously and just kinda thought the issues I had with the bathroom were normal. Wasn’t life changing really, but at times was a big inconvenience. 99% of my issues revolve around constipation, feeling I have to go and not going, etc. That was the main reason I would go to Drs. Not always but frequently had blood in stool but just thought it was from wiping too hard, straining the area to try and go, etc. 

Around 2016, I stopped doing all drugs and alcohol. Started to deal with my current issues (anxiety, depression, autism and bipolar) and I had an instance where I had incontinence. I was working at Home Depot and I remember having to run to bathroom a few times because I couldn’t hold it in. Can’t remember if I saw someone for that, but I believe it was just a one time thing. Actually I did. I was given prednisone and I believe I had a Colonoscopy. 

Side Note: All my colonoscopies came out good. Sometimes they would mention the tear right outside but nothing serious showing up. 

I didn’t continue to go because it honestly wasn’t bothering me. I was just so used to it. Now here I am, off all illegal substances, I do drink coffee with non dairy creamer, I do eat junk food, and I take Effexor (depression) Adderall (prescribed) multi-vitamin, B Complex Vitamin and a probiotic every night. Things are not terrible but I feel like they should be better. Just recently had a colonoscopy done and I did the prep right, but Dr said prep was terrible but he said everything turned out good and well do a more aggressive prep next time.

Everything is inconsistent. If I drink coffee at work, my stomach might bother me, but I don’t use the restroom like at home. I think there is a mental thing going on that knows at home I am more comfortable using the restroom compared to work. However, there are times at work I feel like I have to go but don’t, and a few times where I have to go normal and I don’t want too, but I end up doing it just to feel a little better. Some days nothing bothers me. Some times I can eat mexican or Chinese but other times I eat them and it just wrecks me. Not all day, but bathroom shortly after or next morning. 

Just wondering what anyone would suggest. I am thinking because nothing serious has ever popped up in procedures, it’s a lifestyle change I have to make (diet). 

Oh I will say, one of the first colonoscopies I had, there were polyps but they removed them. Maybe there were two where they were present, but that’s the worse it got. They were able to remove them. All my issues are revolving around constipation and feeling like I have to go but don’t, or anything similar to that. I have tried not eating and seeing what that would do, and I will still have those feelings. I think it’s a mental and anxiety thing too. 

Any suggestions, thoughts or anything you want to recommend. Don’t worry about offending me or saying something personal. Just don’t worry about that. If you say I am a clown for eating snacks and an idiot, that’s fine and you are probably right. Whatever you can. Thanks and sorry this is all over the place. ",1,1745543357.0,IBD,1,1.0,False

Dear Reader,

Before us lies an unusual tale of events that seem like an exaggeration, yet everything here is sometimes a hard-to-accept truth, because some boor would say: ""Look, whoever told you this story is really full of shit and making up nonsense."" But it is wise to avoid such people.

Pipo was a man special in every way. Besides an unselfish love for barbecue and bad cheap beer, he also loved slightly darker-skinned and hairier women, like his Koviljka, thrash metal, and occasionally folk music. He got his nickname because his parents were deeply convinced of Pan-Slavism, so they named him Slaven (Slav) but it didn't seem to impress anyone as some kind of argument that would rival his rather plumbing-related nickname, similar to pipe.

Tall, thin, and blond, with metal-framed glasses, he gave off a somewhat clerk-like or priestly impression at first glance, but appearances were deceiving: within him burned the fearless heart of a *krsnik*, a vampire hunter, or warrior against primal evil and the forces of darkness. In that heart, there was room for nothing else but a few things he had always loved most: fighting the aforementioned forces of darkness, hooliganishly leaving cucumbers in impossible places, and, of course, sports.

He was a passionate fan and had already been banned from any water polo and swimming events for two years because he had been caught multiple times throwing flares into the pool, sweaty and disheveled, and from his devoted cheering, his shirt was spilled with beer and stained with ketchup from hot dogs. Pipo didn't like mustard, but he loved sausages so passionately that he would often exchange the cucumber he always carried with him for another hot dog.

*Krsnics* are most often quite inconspicuous and a bit eccentric. So there is also Pipo's colleague, an elderly lady of about ninety years, who spends all day watching the street from her window and, with her special senses, monitors the movements of vampires, werewolves, s*trigas* (witch-like creatures), *urečljivacs* (those who can cast the evil eye), and other supernatural beings who are very skilled at disguising themselves as humans. For some reason, she had always hated plants, especially trees, which goes to show that some people become grumpy old shits and shameful misarborists as they age.

There was a type of orkos whose horns did not completely disappear when they transformed into humans, and these were very quickly exterminated by the *krsnics* and a crazed mob with torches, hooks, and hoes. A typical example of evolution at work, whatever various creationists might think about it. Therefore, Pipo only encountered very skilled and usually life-threatening supernatural beings, and sometimes he would escape death by sheer luck, but he always held onto his beloved fan chants: ""With a stake and a chain and a knuckle-duster to the head,"" which, along with his old wise mentor's statement that everything in life can be achieved with savagery and violence, helped him a lot in surviving.

One day, our vampire slayer received an email in which some mysterious colleagues invited him to a picturesque little town in Istra because they needed his help. Since Istra, as we all well know, is *Terra magica*, it is clear that *krsnici* there work double shifts fighting orkos, štrigas, urečljivacs, and similar beings, and vampire hunters were already tired of killing Jure Grando, because that ancient vampire from the neighboring village was as persistent as weeds. No matter how many times they killed him, he would always return.

The invitation to Istria seemed particularly appealing to Pipo because they mentioned that a water polo tournament was being held there, and, as we have already mentioned, water sports were especially dear to his heart.

""Ha, water polo. The only thing better to cheer for than that is synchronized swimming, that lovely touch of attractive worlds, sports, and sophisticated erotica.""

Despite the fact that he muttered this thought into a non-existent mustache extremely quietly, in the bus he was on at that moment, the passengers moved away from him, and some of them would have bet that they saw the gleam of a pure sexual maniac or some unscrupulous drug addict in his eyes. It didn't help that he casually pulled an unpeeled raw cucumber from his pocket and, chewing it thoughtfully, stared out the window, quietly humming another fan song, ""Let them suffer who are bothered.""

When he returned home, wasting no time, Pipo put a few flares, a couple of cucumbers, some clothes, and weapons in his backpack and set off for that magical land, caressed by rich tastes, smells, and ennobled by beautiful women.

He got into his old Renault and in a couple of hours found himself in that place, whose name we will not mention after all. He immediately called The Dark, as the guy who sent him the letter had introduced himself, and waited for him in the popular Sax café, talking with the locals about matches, sipping some fine foreign beer, and loading the jukebox with selected Rammstein, Iron Maiden, Slayer, and Lamb of God tunes. Just as he was ordering a round, singing, ""My heart burns..."", a tall, strong, dark-haired man in his middle ages joined him at the bar.

""Ciao. I'm The Dark, Slaven.""

""Oh, greetings,"" Pipo offered his hand. ""Call me Pipo. So, you called me?""

""Yeah. What will you drink?""

""Beer.""

""Okay. Then I will too.""

The Dark sat down at a table, and Pipo joined him. They calmly began to sip their drinks and talk about sports when a young man entered Sax walking backward and looking somewhat strangely. With tears in his eyes, he ordered a local bright red non-alcoholic drink, and sat down dejectedly, complaining to his worried friends about his misfortune and the curse of some cast speller. One of the guests left the café, nodding goodbye to The Dark. It was the same guy who had bought him a drink as soon as he entered.

Krsnics can see supernatural beings, no matter how skilfully they disguise themselves, but there was also a preparation of horseradish and elderberry that blocked their ability. The young man who bought Pipo a beer had unnoticeably poured some of that preparation into it, as the supernatural beings had ordered him to, and Pipo thought to himself how he really didn't like those craft beers that tasted like everything but beer. On the other hand, there was an exception; he liked beer with beans, those flavours went well together for him. Of course, after taking a few more sips, he was no longer able to see supernatural beings, so The Dark seemed completely normal to him.

That evening, Pipo stayed at a small hotel Laura, and The Dark met with the other supernatural beings and told them that Pipo seemed like a completely okay guy to him. Namely, although they all hated krsnics, somehow the two of them had clicked, they liked the same things, especially sports. The rest, a few strigas and strigoons, and two older urečljivacs told him to prepare Pipo, and they would make sure their sworn enemy met a fate, as one of the urečljivacs put it, ""worse than the worstest.""

""Is that how you say it?"" The Dark bristled. ""No, you don't say the worstest, what kind of word is that, bitch?"" Both The Dark and Pipo leaned towards grammatical Nazism, which sometimes got on the nerves of those around them quite a bit, but over time they got used to that irritating trait. After they had another drink for the road, they all went home to their houses, caves, and lairs.

The next day, The Dark and Pipo first had coffee, then went to the ""Pod lipom"" (Under the Linden Tree) eatery and ate goulash with gnocchi. Pipo was delighted with the fullness of the flavour and the reasonable price. After that, they went to the Bunker café, where they drank a fig brandy each to selected new age music, waiting for the group to gather. Soon the crew appeared, and the fun never stopped.

They hung out like that for several days, and the time for the tournament, which they were all extremely looking forward to, arrived. They piled into several cars, bought everything they would need, and headed towards the local picturesque waterfall, below which the sporting event was being prepared.

Pipo was so thrilled with the nature, the people, and the game that he excitedly shared all his cucumbers within the first half hour. The group looked at him somewhat in wonder, but there was no one who didn't take that unusual gift. Pipo and The Dark drank and ate sandwiches all day, cheering at the top of their lungs, so everyone turned to look at them. When Pipo went to answer the call of nature, because beer demands it, one of thes*trigoons* approached The Dark.

""So, what do you think of this *krsnik*?""

""He is excellent lad"", The Dark smiled. ""My kind of guy. He's cheerful, and he can drink like a local abyss.""

""So, shall we do it as we agreed?""

""Well, I wouldn't, he's not a bad bloke.""

At that, the dark strigoon just frowned and went over to the rest of the supernatural beings. He told them what The Dark had said, and they all turned towards him, dissatisfied.

""What's up, pussies? What?"" The Dark snarled, and everyone moved away, because no one was in the mood for a conflict with a savagely wild and deadly dangerous orko.

When Pipo returned, they continued cheering and lighting flares, but they didn't throw them into the water, after all.

""Excellent team,"" Pipo enthusiastically blurted out. ""They left their hearts in the water.""

""Yeah, yeah. They burned out in the water. Those were some tough matches,"" The Dark agreed.

They looked at each other delightedly, and the orko spread his arms.

""Come here, let me hug you.""

""Remind me to tell you something about Merlin.""

""Shh, shh.""

So the two of them, sweaty, shirtless, hugged and lit a few more flares, yelling, ""Alealeeee!""

Night began to fall, and the friends sang until they were completely hoarse. The group came over to them and said they were going back towards the town. One part of them said they would take Pipo, and the others said they would go with The Dark, which didn't bother him, because they were going together anyway. Of course, this was a carefully planned diversion because the rest of the supernatural beings were firmly determined to get rid of the krsnik they hated. When they arrived in town, those with whom Pipo was going deliberately separated to prevent The Dark from protecting Pipo.

Pipo got drunk as a skunk on honey liqueur, good wine, and bad beer. The *urečljivacs* and s*trigoons* literally had to carry him to the pit, and since every drunk person weighs at least a ton, it was awkward for them to carry him along the dizzying steep slope. All the way, he tried to sing Pantera's ""Cemetary Gates"" and urged the others to join him, but they just glared at him and held him so he wouldn't tumble into the pit.

""Hey, guys, I gotta pee. Stop a bit, where are you rushing off to like you're not normal?"" our hero said, swaying and peeing on his sneakers.

The supernatural crew stopped, holding him carefully, because he was as unsteady on his feet as a newborn fawn. He looked at them and sang, ""Into battle, into battle for our people, into battle, into battle for our people. Alealeeee.""

When they finally reached the pit, they struggled with him because he kept singing and wanted to swim in the murky stream. Since there had been a lot of rain those days, the water level was high, and it wasn't really advisable to fall into the near-torrent. Of course, it was even less advisable to be executed by mythological beings, but Pipo at that moment was far from any coherent judgment; as the saying goes, he didn't know his ass from his elbow. When they reached the last chamber of the pit, one of the s*trigoons* uttered an incantation in the ancient magical Haids language, and massive wooden, iron-bound doors appeared on the cave wall, which they opened with some difficulty. Behind them followed a corridor whose walls glowed with a greenish magical light and led to a large hall, where they laid Pipo, who looked at a handsome\*striga,\*winked at her, and tried to grab her firm behind. She moved away and sized him up in wonder.

""Look at him. What a disgusting character you are, a real marvel. Get lost, scram!"" the witch said, flustered.

""Come on, come on, don't be like that that to a man who would go through fire and water for you. Heck, even a liter and water. Wanna kiss, kitty?"" Pipo sensually pursed his lips, and the striga moved away from him and looked at him with disapproval.

""Misogynist,"" the two-hundred-and-fifty-year-old girl hissed.

""Hipster,"" Pipo retorted, to which she frowned, because it was a bit of a low blow.

Then the strigoons and urečljivacs surrounded him and tied him to the table. One of them, holding a very nasty-looking axe in his hands, looked around very menacingly and then began in a solemn, threatening voice.

""Slaven, you are a krsnik, who has brought much evil upon our...""

""Wait, his name is Slaven?""

""Only my mom and wife call me that,"" Pipo interjected, eyeing the axe suspiciously. ""Have you noticed that girls never accept nicknames? So my friends, Rile and Drele, in their versions become Zdravko and Davor, and no one calls them that,"" he shook his head disapprovingly.

""Will you stop with this nonsense? We have a serious trial before execution here, and you're talking about bullshit.""

""But they really do call them Zdravko and Davor.""

""Stop!!!""

At that moment, Orco Dio, as The Dark was really called, joined them. He had meanwhile realized what was happening, so he quickly and cruelly killed the crew from his car and swiftly, as much as his drunkenness allowed, headed after the others into the pit. He caught up with them very quickly.

""Wait a minute,"" he said. ""He didn't deserve this, I completely screwed things up when I invited him into this trap. Pipo's not a bad guy, I was pleasantly surprised. Look, he's been here for almost a week now, we drank at Sax, and at Bunker, and at Belic's, and he was always up to the task. He hasn't killed any of us. He loves sports. We both left our hearts on the field.""

""What field now?""

""The waterfall. Actually, in the water.""

""Wait...""

""Alright, enough. Whoever tries to hurt him will have to deal with me,"" he snarled in a deep, supernatural voice and revealed his true, black, slimy, and spiky form. Pipo still saw him as a human, but the others didn't. Orco Dio roared with a voice from hell, and everyone moved away from him, which emboldened him even more. He moved menacingly towards them, and they all scattered, because anyone an orko scratches or bites dies in painful agony. In the end, they all threw down their weapons and fled head over heels. The Dark returned to Pipo, untied him, and offered him some mistletoe brandy from his flask. They drank a little, hugged, and patted each other on the back, then a song and conversation began that quite resisted both good taste and any common sense:

""No one can do anything to us, we are stronger than fate.""

""Fucking awesome song,"" Pipo said.

""It's fucking awesome to me too. By the way, what were you trying to tell me about Merlin?""

""In the mountain dialect, merlin means carrot.""

""Look at that. And how do you say dragon there then? Parsley, potato?""

""How did you guess?"" Pipo looked at him in surprise.

""Listen, who knows, knows.""

""And who doesn't know, gets a two.""",1,1745543217.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Hey Mom, Dad— And, uh, hello to my future wife and hypothetical kids (if you’re digging through old transmissions one day)!

Just wanted to let you all know I made it up here safe. Pisistratus Station is… well, let’s call it “industrial chic.” My habitation cell’s about the size of my old freshman dorm—minus the window, minus the door handle, and plus a constant low hum I haven’t quite figured out yet. Still, it’s home for now, and I can't complain.

Before we docked, I got a glimpse of the platform. I had no idea how massive it would be. The whole base is built into this rotating ring system—like a wheel half-buried in the dark side of the moon. They said it turns at a fixed rate to create a centrifugal force that simulates Earth’s gravity. You can’t feel the rotation from inside, but knowing it's happening gives you this weird sense of motion in the back of your brain. The size of the platform blew me away—it must be at least a kilometer wide, maybe more. They didn’t really cover *that* in the training videos. It’s like living in a giant, quiet machine.

Sorry for the short notice on the departure. Once the company pushed us through our specialization certs, things moved *fast*. One day you’re learning how to realign hydraulic lock seals in VR, and the next you’re vacuum-sealed into a shuttle bound for the far side of the Moon. They gave us a week—enough time to pack a duffel, sign a few papers, and say goodbye without thinking too hard.

Don’t worry though—I'll make sure to snag some moonrocks for everyone. Maybe even some deeper core samples if I get in good with the miners. Some of them are already swapping stories about weird strata shifts and mineral anomalies—just harmless tall tales, I’m sure.

I’ve got orientation briefings in the morning—station safety, maintenance protocols, door calibration standards. Nothing too wild. I’ll send more when I get a better lay of the place.

Love you all. Tell the dog I miss him.

Alrighty—hope everyone’s cozy back home, tucked in, maybe sipping coffee or watching something dumb on TV. Up here… it’s still night. Technically.

I found out that the far side of the Moon doesn’t really *do* mornings. When we docked, they told us it was “night”. Turns out, we’ve got another ten days of darkness to go. Fourteen days of night. Fourteen of daylight. Like a celestial switch.

And the telescope? Yeah, you can forget that—this side of the Moon never faces Earth. Not even a shimmer. Something to do with the rotation rate of the Earth and Moon mixed with their orbits. It’s just black sky and stars out there. Honestly, it’s beautiful, but it also feels… heavy. Like the whole sky’s pressing in.

Anyway, I promised you updates, so here we go. Today’s briefing was actually kind of awesome. We learned why the station’s named *Pisistratus*. He was some old-school Athenian leader—benevolent, they said. Supposedly ushered in a golden age, redistributed land from the elites to the common people, built up the arts and the temples.

I guess that’s why so many of us are up here. Not just scientists, not just astronauts—normal people. Mechanics, janitors, miners. I might be the only one in my habitation sector with a degree, and it doesn’t even matter. That’s kind of the magic of this place—everyone’s useful. Everyone has a job.

The miners especially—rough folks, but some of the highest-paid up here. They say the core’s rich with rare isotopes. Stuff you can’t even find in Earth’s crust anymore. I heard a guy say one of the new mines has veins that *pulse*—probably just a figure of speech. Right?

I got my assignment! I’ll be stationed near the western airlocks, just off the corridor leading to Mine 7B. It’s a quieter sector—lower traffic. I monitor a bank of cameras, run diagnostics, cycle door tests. Six doors, one tech, one long hallway.

Honestly? I’m excited. There’s something kind of peaceful about it out there. Real quiet.

Anyway, more tomorrow. Love you guys.

Hey guys. Sorry I didn’t get a message out yesterday—it was… kind of a whirlwind. Spent most of the day clearing out my little office nook near the West Wing airlocks.

You know, I figured everything up here would be sleek, futuristic, that kind of thing. But honestly? Some of my equipment feels like it belongs in a museum. My camera monitors are chunky old CRT-style boxes—no touchscreens, no fancy heads-up displays. The feeds are weirdly grainy too, with this low hum in the background. Like they’re running off… older tech, I guess. I even had to dust some of them off.

Controls are tactile—clunky switches, big metal toggles. Kind of retro, which would be charming if there weren’t serious cases where a door could cycle improperly, and all of our oxygen is sucked out.

Yesterday I had to do a servo repair on Door 3. Nothing too wild, but it was different from what the crash course taught us. Wiring was off. Slightly older schematic. Still—pressurized doors are pressurized doors, right?

Today was quieter. Almost peaceful. I considered walking back to my habitation cell early and writing this, but I stayed in the office and fiddled with the terminal a bit.

Good news—I got one of the IT guys, Ethan, to help me clean up the interface. He’s only been here a couple months longer than me, but he’s sharp. Showed me a bunch of back-end menus, some override protocols I didn’t know I had access to. Emergency lockdowns, remote seals—some of it felt... above my clearance, if I’m being honest.

He said it’s standard now, that they updated things a while back. But the way he said “updated” was weird. Like the system's been layered over *something older*.

Honestly, the computers themselves run pretty quick. Maybe they’ve just got new guts inside old shells. Kind of getting the feeling that it’s how it is with this whole station, now that I think about it.

On a lighter note—cafeteria absolutely *slapped* today. Real apple pie. Not rehydrated, not vacuum-sealed—actual, warm, fragrant pie. I was sitting there wondering if that technically makes it a moonpie up here. Or… maybe a moonpie up here would just be called a pie and the ones back home are the frauds? Got caught in that loop for a while.

Anyway, I’m clocking out soon. Crew from Mine 7B’s scheduled to return tomorrow. I’ll be on door control—open, cycle, seal. Easy stuff.

Gotta stay rested, even if all I’m doing is pushing buttons. Love you guys always.

Okay. Today was cool, but I have some questions.

The mining crew came back a little early—not an issue. The outer door camera showed them pulling up in the large buggy with a bag about the size of me, probably stuffed with ore and rare minerals. It looked… uncanny, the way they hopped toward the airlock platform with the bag drifting behind the guy carrying it. Like it was deadweight, but not *heavy*.

They keyed in the activation code, then radioed the keyphrase to my room, and I hit the confirmation. The base’s announcement system echoed through the halls, alerting everyone to the gravity shift. The low hum of the station’s rotation slowed until it stopped, locking into position with the platform.

Two of the miners lifted the bag as they entered. Cycling began—oxygen restored, pressure stabilized. Then centrifugal rotation spun back up. Gravity settled.

That’s when one of the miners lost his grip.

His side of the bag dropped to the floor with a force I could *feel* through the feed. There’s no sound on the cameras, but I swear I heard the thud in my chest. A dark liquid sprayed out across his boots and pooled fast.

It was thick. Not hydraulic fluid. Not oil. Something else.

Within seconds, Research techs in yellow badges were sprinting past my hallway viewport with a cart. I glanced back to the monitor just in time to see them load the bag—quick, methodical. Way too smooth to be their first time.

I stood to get a better look as they wheeled it past my window. Down the hall. Out of sight.

No one said a word about it. Not during check-in. Not in the logs.

I know it’s probably nothing. Ore can leak, right?

I hope nothing poisonous was in the liquid that got on the floor, but they cleaned it up pretty quickly, so I’m sure it's safe.

Anyway—tonight I swapped out my bedding and noticed a huge black, maybe brownish, stain on the mattress underneath. The look of it reminded me of the leak from the bag.

So, three things:My bed’s been used and the stain looks pretty fuckin old. Two—the mining crews are supposed to work in teams of six. Only three came in with that bag. And three—I hadn’t really thought about it until now, but… why do they need both a code *and* a keyphrase just for me to let them in?

Why lock a door that tightly unless there’s something we’re trying to keep out?

Time to sleep before I overthink it. This kind of stuff is above my pay grade. Love you.

So… two more of the crew came back today?

They didn’t have a vehicle. I watched them almost robotically leap across the lunarscape toward the keypad podium. No buggy, no extra gear. Just the two of them, silhouetted against the black horizon.

They keyed in the code and gave the keyphrase over the radio—quiet, raspy, almost like their comms were breaking up. I hit the confirmation key.

The announcement sounded, gravity slowed, oxygen cycled, they came in.

Fifteen minutes later, my supervisor shows up. Doesn’t knock, doesn’t greet me—just asks why I stopped the centrifuge.

I told him about the crew, the radio call, the docking procedure. He just… stared at me. Like I’d said something wrong. Then turned around and walked out before I could even ask.

I watched him cross the corridor outside my window at a brisk, determined pace, speaking into his radio the whole way.

Don’t get me wrong—I was worried. Still am. But no one’s said anything. Not to me, anyway.

It’s been a few hours now, and we just entered a lockdown drill.

Except they *really* stressed that we treat it like the real thing.

Doors sealed, motion lights off, auxiliary power only. No one in or out.

Something about the phrasing—the tone—it wasn’t just a drill. It felt more like a warning.

The kind where they don’t want to say what they’re actually preparing for.

Gonna lie down and wait it out.

I don’t know what’s going on.

Mom, Dad… I’m scared.

It’s been about three weeks since my last log. I had to wait. I had to survive.

I used the 14 days of light. That’s the only time it’s safe to move around.

They don’t come out as much when the sunlight hits the exterior corridors. I think the windows—those thick, curved panes—act like traps.

They just stop and stare, motionless, when the beams catch them.

But the inner corridors? The ones without windows?

No light reaches there.

There’s no stopping them there.

The bigger rooms—the ones with skylights—were safer.

For a time.

I managed to reach Ethan from IT on the short-range comms link in my office. A few times.

While he was still alive…

The last time we spoke, he said he’d been sleeping in the hydroponics atrium during the lightshift. That dome gets full sun exposure during the light days.

It kept him safe from the things.

We didn’t talk often, but early on, he told me enough to make some guesses.

The team leads. The high-clearance personnel.

They’re not on base anymore.

I remember it now—clear as day.

The night of the lockdown, I was already in bed when the alert came through: **Centrifugal Halt – Platform Synchronization Inbound.**

I thought it was just another drill. I waited for the hum to return. For the soft sway of gravity to resume.

But it never came back.

Ethan told me later that week. He saw it—through a corridor window after he’d cracked open his cell door.

The Emergency Return shuttle lifted off from the south platform.

While we were still in full stop.

They left us here.

*All of us.*

Before I knew any of that, I’d already floated back to my office—half an hour of low-G silence behind me. Something felt wrong, even though I hadn’t yet realized the shuttle had left.

I keyed in my credentials. Accessed the override protocols.

I started by checking why the centrifuge hadn’t restarted. Why the platform hadn’t cycled.

But then I saw it.

The south platform wasn’t the only door with an administrator override.

The research corridors glowed orange—pathing active. Three internal doors were blinking red.

Not cycled.

Locked shut.

The only way to clear an administrator override is with a full facility reset.

That would cycle every exterior door. Re-engage gravity. And unlock every single pressurized passage across the station.

I didn’t do it.

But someone else did.

Another door tech, I’m sure.

I’m not responsible for this.

I understood what it meant when I saw the research facility manually locked down.

I understood.

Something was in the station that we couldn’t let spread.

When all of the doors unlocked, they clambered out.

Shambling *humanthings*.

I’ve seen them in person now.

Incomprehensibly grotesque.

Rotted. Necrotic. Elongated joints, with hanging jaws and stringy hair.

They move like they’re searching.

Like they’re remembering.

I know they’re remembering.

Because Ethan still comes to the locked door at the end of corridor R

…and stares through the camera.

Straight at me. I can see his mouth moving, rambling, but I won’t go near the door.

I have to go for now.

Without many of the engineers, the station's gone into auto-backup mode. A few generators are about to cycle on in a couple minutes.

And even though I’ve locked off the corridors between my cell and my office… When that noise kicks up, they get agitated.

I’ve got a little crawlspace behind a panel in the office I hide in, in case one of them manages to open a door again.

Pray.

\-Leon

 I wasn’t supposed to find this. But I did.

For days now, I’ve been unlocking and relocking the admin corridors—watching, waiting. The human things, they don’t remember their paths. They wander, bumping into walls or sealed doors, some drifting into new hallways before I shut them off. There’s one that drags a broken leg behind it, like a sack of tools. I timed its circuit through Sector D. When it was far enough down the hall, I made my move.

The door to Administrator Roan’s office was locked with a four-tier system—no easy bypass. I’ve cracked two before—maintenance overrides buried in the diagnostic logs. But this one… it had a special key gate.

I thought I was screwed. Then I remembered something: Roan’s quarters.

I wasn’t shocked to find a few administrators left behind. The station layout, combined with the timing of the outbreak and subsequent evacuation, made it feel inevitable. What I didn’t expect was what I found in Roan’s quarters.

Her facility suit lay discarded on the floor, the remains of her body still inside, like she’d been eaten from the inside out. The suit’s fabric clung to her like a half-formed cocoon, and what was left of her… I don’t even know how to describe it. Soft tissue, sloshing in my hands. I had to pry her keycard free from the inner lining of the forearm. It took a few minutes—and a lot of gagging—but I got it.

When I made it back to the office and slotted the card into the master terminal, I thought it was all over. I was wrong.

That’s when I saw it.

A system-wide communications lockdown had been enacted during the final centrifuge cycle, just before the Emergency Return shuttle launched. Personal comms had been rerouted. Every outgoing message from standard personnel accounts was flagged as “nonessential” and dumped into a queue.

They’re all still here.

Every message. Every cry for help.

Not just mine. Hundreds of them.

Audio. Video. Text logs. Some people were still recording even after the power started to fail in their sections.

Some of the messages are just static and sobbing. Others... Some of them talk about things that don’t make sense. Worse than what I’ve seen.

There are names I don’t recognize. One man—security, I think—kept saying he heard them whispering in the walls. That they knew his name. And that they remembered him.

I opened my own log queue. It was there. Everything I’ve said to you. None of it ever left Pisistratus Station.

I sat there for a long time. Listening. To everyone. To no one.

There’s a backup transmission command on Roan’s computer. A hardline. The problem is, I have a list of thousands of servers to send transmissions to. I can manually clear the queue of each flagged log, but I don’t know which servers to send them to.

I think I have no choice but to send everything out. I’m hoping for help. I’m unable to establish a direct line to Earth—every company line seems halted. I believe we were told that each transmission takes a week to reach Earth.

So, tomorrow, I’ll send everything out. Today, I’ll reroute some doors, maybe raid the cafeteria again. I should be good for months if I stay quiet.

I love you, Mom. Dad. I’ll be home soon. – Leon

**>>End Transmission from August 8th, 2015<<**

------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Space and Layout Efficiency

When choosing a camping trailer with an outdoor kitchen, the first aspect you want to consider is the space and layout. A well-planned outdoor kitchen should maximize utility without compromising comfort. Look for trailers that offer a thoughtfully designed cooking area with enough counter space for meal preparation. This space should be easy to access yet neatly integrated with the rest of the trailer’s exterior to avoid clutter. Ample storage compartments for utensils, cookware, and food supplies make a big difference in keeping your outdoor kitchen organized and efficient.

### Durable and Weather-Resistant Materials

An outdoor kitchen will be exposed to varying weather conditions, so durability is key. Choose camping trailers with outdoor kitchen components made from high-quality, weather-resistant materials like stainless steel or treated wood. These materials withstand rain, wind, and sun exposure without rusting or deteriorating. Besides durability, a rustproof finish ensures that your kitchen maintains its appearance for years to come. Durable hinges, latches, and seals are also important to keep the kitchen area sealed against moisture and dirt when closed.

### Functional Cooking Appliances

The heart of an outdoor kitchen lies in its cooking appliances. Most camping trailers with outdoor kitchens offer built-in grills, stovetops, or burners that run on propane or other portable fuel sources. When selecting a trailer, assess whether the cooking appliances meet your needs. Are you planning quick grill sessions or elaborate meals? Dual burners offer flexibility for cooking multiple dishes simultaneously, while foldable grills save space when stored. Additionally, some trailers feature outdoor refrigerators or coolers to keep ingredients fresh. These appliances should be easy to operate and maintain for a seamless cooking experience.

### Water Supply and Sink Features

Having a water supply in your outdoor kitchen adds convenience that enhances your camping experience. A built-in sink with running water allows you to wash your hands, rinse dishes, and clean produce quickly. Check if the trailer offers a freshwater tank, a gray water tank for waste, and a reliable pump system. The size of these tanks matters if you plan to camp for several days without access to external water sources. An efficient drainage system paired with leak-proof seals helps maintain cleanliness and hygiene during outdoor cooking.

### Lighting and Electrical Outlets

Cooking outdoors often extends into the evening, so proper lighting is a vital feature. Look for camping trailers that come equipped with built-in LED lights around the outdoor kitchen area. These lights provide ample illumination for meal prep and cleanup while conserving battery power. Additionally, electrical outlets offer the flexibility to plug in small appliances like blenders or coffee makers, which can greatly enhance your culinary options. If you frequently cook after dark, a trailer with adjustable or motion-sensing lights can make outdoor cooking safer and more enjoyable.

### Ease of Setup and Portability

When balancing comfort with convenience, pay attention to how easy it is to deploy and pack away the outdoor kitchen area. Features like foldable countertops, slide-out trays, and removable appliances reduce setup time and increase portability. A trailer that allows quick access to the outdoor kitchen without complicated assembly lets you spend more time enjoying your adventure and less time struggling with equipment. Consider the weight and size of all kitchen components, especially if you plan to transport your trailer on narrow or rugged roads.

### Additional Comfort and Convenience Options

Some camping trailers with outdoor kitchens come with extra amenities designed to improve your outdoor living experience. These can include built-in seating areas nearby, awnings or retractable shades to protect against sun and rain, and even outdoor speakers for entertainment. Look for models with flexible design features that can be customized to suit your preferred style of camping. The availability of these conveniences can turn a practical outdoor kitchen into a cozy social hub for family and friends around the campfire.

### Energy Efficiency and Eco-Friendly Design

Modern camping trailers increasingly focus on sustainability, which is worth considering if you want to minimize your environmental impact. Choose trailers with energy-efficient appliances and LED lighting to reduce power consumption. Solar panels integrated into the roof can provide renewable energy to run your outdoor kitchen without relying solely on generators or hookups. Eco-friendly materials in construction and packaging also contribute to reducing your carbon footprint while enjoying the great outdoors.

### Customer Support and Warranty Coverage

A reliable warranty and responsive customer support are essential aspects when investing in a camping trailer with an outdoor kitchen. Choose brands that offer comprehensive warranties on kitchen components and structure, so you have peace of mind in case of defects or damage. Prompt and helpful customer service ensures that any maintenance or repairs can be handled quickly, keeping your outdoor kitchen functional and ready for every trip.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Experience the Freedom of Outdoor Cooking on the Road

When you’re exploring new places with a camping trailer, having the ability to cook outdoors adds an extra layer of joy to your adventure. A camping trailer with an outdoor kitchen lets you prepare meals under the open sky, surrounded by nature’s beauty. This setup is more than just a fun convenience; it offers practical benefits that enhance your travel experience.

### Enhancing the Camping Experience with Fresh Air and Scenery

Cooking outdoors means you can enjoy fresh air and scenic views while preparing your meals. Instead of being confined to the small indoor kitchen space of your trailer, the outdoor kitchen allows you to spread out and enjoy the environment. Imagine grilling your dinner as the sun sets, or making breakfast while birds chirp nearby. This connection to nature makes mealtime more relaxing and memorable.

### Practical Advantages of Cooking Outdoors During Travel

- **Less Indoor Heat and Smells:** Cooking indoors, especially in a compact trailer, can quickly make the space hot and trap cooking smells. By using the outdoor kitchen, you keep your trailer cooler and avoid lingering food odors inside.
- **Easy Cleanup:** Cleaning up can be a hassle indoors, but an outdoor kitchen often includes simple setups with sinks and easy-to-wash surfaces. You can rinse dishes immediately outside without worrying about spills inside the trailer.
- **More Space to Work With:** Outdoor kitchens typically have larger counter space, giving you more room for meal prep and cooking gear. This extra space helps you stay organized and efficient.

### Effortless Entertaining When Traveling

Cooking outdoors transforms mealtime into a social event. When you have family or friends on your trip, gathering around an outdoor kitchen area invites everyone to join in. It becomes a central spot for sharing stories, helping with meal prep, or simply enjoying each other's company. Plus, it keeps the cook involved with the group rather than isolated in an indoor kitchen.

### Healthier and More Delicious Meals on the Go

Outdoor kitchens encourage cooking fresh and more wholesome meals rather than relying on packaged or fast food. Grilling, roasting, and sautéing with fresh ingredients offer better taste and nutrition. The ease of cooking varied meals from scratch means you’re less likely to compromise on your diet even while traveling. Plus, the outdoor setting can inspire creative recipes that pair perfectly with the environment, such as grilling fresh fish after a day on the water.

### Increased Flexibility and Independence

Having an outdoor kitchen on your camping trailer grants you independence from campsites without amenities. You don’t have to rely solely on campground dining options or carry bulky food that only works without cooking. Your travel plans can include remote spots without facilities, knowing you can prepare quality meals easily. This flexibility opens up more possibilities for where to stay and explore.

### How an Outdoor Kitchen Adds Value to Your Camping Trailer

An outdoor kitchen is a valuable feature that heightens your trailer's appeal and functionality. Not only does it add convenience, but it also makes your trailer more versatile and comfortable.

- **Counter Space and Storage:** Essential for chopping and organizing ingredients and utensils.
- **Refrigerated Storage:** Keeps perishables fresh and reduces trips inside the main trailer.

### Tips for Making the Most of Your Outdoor Kitchen While Traveling

To truly enjoy the perks of cooking outside while on the road, consider these practical tips:

1. **Plan Simple Menus:** Choose meals that work well on a grill or outdoor stove for easy prep.
2. **Use Portable Cooking Gear:** Supplement the built-in fixtures with lightweight cookware designed for outdoor use.

4. **Store Ingredients Smartly:** Use airtight containers and coolers to protect food from bugs and weather.
5. **Clean As You Go:** Make cleanup simpler by washing utensils and cutting boards immediately after use.

Enjoying the outdoors while maintaining the comforts of a well-equipped kitchen is one of the best parts of traveling with a camping trailer. With an outdoor kitchen, every meal can become a fresh, fun, and tasty experience, making your journey even more special.
