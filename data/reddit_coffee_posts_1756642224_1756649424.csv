1n4vmmc,https://i.redd.it/bm6u63q34dmf1.png,Review 11 Plus: Mad River Distillers,"While their primary location is in Warren, VT, this bar is located in downtown Burlington. The wife and I wandered in during a recent trip, and she added a few notes of her own. Mad River has been around since 2015 and offers bourbon, rye, and several rums. The web site boasts all locally procured grains and aging. I bought a whiskey flight with the four products below.

Product 1:
Label: straight bourbon, distillery-only release.
Age: 2-3 years.
Proof: 92.
Distillery: Mad River Distillers, Warren, VT.
Mash bill: 70% corn, and the rest wheat, oats, and malted barley.
Price: 47.99.

Nose: youthful grains jump out, young oak.

Palate: some oats, Carmel. Minimal complexity. Wife said it smells like unaged white dog. Strong ethanol.

Finish: short.

Verdict: 4 (T8ke). Not off to an amazing start here.

--------

Product 2:
Label: Burnt Rock bourbon.
Age: 2-3 years.
Proof: 92.
Distillery: same.
Mash bill: 70% corn, 15% rye, 15% smoked barley.
Price: 57.99.

Nose: pine, maybe some maple, youthful corn.

Palate: unfortunately similar to the first. Youthful grains, carmel, and smoke. Wife again compared it to rubbing white dog on your hands then smelling it on a distillery tour.

Finish: short, mercifully, but full of corn. 

Verdict: 4 (T8ke). While the first two have different mash bills they are annoyingly similar and not in a good way.

-----------

Product 3:
Label: Revolution Rye whiskey.
Age: 2-3 years.
Proof: 96.
Distillery: same.
Mash bill: 100% rye, with 3 varietals: chocolate malted, toasted, and something else unlisted.
Price: 49.99.

Nose: pine, black pepper, rye herbs. Wife said bleach and sanitizing products from her restaurant days.

Palate: damp rye bread, maple, soap, burnt coffee. Fuck this sucks.

Finish: still brief rye herbs. At least it doesn't stick around.

Verdict: 2 (T8ke). Asking myself a lot of questions right now. A 2 is pretty rough but if I had a bottle of this at home I cannot imagine returning to this in any way except as self-harm.

-----------

Product 4:
Label: Double Tapped maple bourbon whiskey. The bourbon is the straight bourbon, see product 1.
Age: 2-3 years.
Proof: 76.
Distillery: same.
Mash bill: 70% corn, and the rest wheat, oats, and malted barley.
Price: 39.99.

Nose: lots of maple, mercifully. Not much else.

Palate: overwhelmingly sticky-sweet maple syrup, like they dumped syrup right into a blended whiskey. The bartender said thats pretty much what happens. Some carmel and smoke.

Finish: more maple. Short given its low proof.

Verdict: 4.5 (T8ke). Its not great, but man after the last 3 this is like a breath of fresh air. At least I could drink it without questioning my life choices.

Final thoughts: I didn't have particularly high expectations going into this flight. I suspect, but obviously can't prove, that climate plays a big role here. Vermont has a much narrower range of temperatures in a given than Kentucky, and that effects how much flavor the barrels impart to the whiskey. I wonder if a Vermont whiskey should be handled more like scotch with long maturation times and less evaporation.

Still. That was a rough experience, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.",1,1756649248.0,bourbon,0,1.0,False

1n4vlrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n4vlrl/experience_the_magic_of_howard_wood_polish_or/,Experience the Magic of Howard Wood Polish or Just Hype?,"Howard Products RF3016 Restor-A-Finish has been a game-changer in my household, especially considering how much I treasure wood furniture and antiques. Scratches, blemishes, and those annoying white heat rings – they show up on wood surfaces faster than a cat landing on freshly folded laundry. I decided to try this wood repair product after reading rave reviews, and I’ve put it to the test on various wooden pieces in my home. With over 40 years of heritage, this product promises to restore wood finishes without the hassle of stripping or refinishing, and that’s a claim worth exploring.

**Design and Ease of Application**  
The simplicity of its design caught my attention right away. It comes in a lightweight, compact bottle that’s easy to handle, even when working on larger furniture pieces. What really nails it for me is the wipe-on, wipe-off process. There’s no need for special tools or complicated instructions. I poured a bit onto a soft cloth, rubbed it into the damaged area, and then wiped off the excess. It took barely any effort to see an improvement in the finish. Plus, the product’s design ensures minimal wastage, which is always a bonus.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
I tested it on a vintage oak coffee table and a modern walnut cabinet, both of which had their fair share of scratches and faded spots. The results? Stunning. The walnut cabinet looked richer and evenly toned, while the golden oak coffee table regained its warm glow. Scratches disappeared as if by magic, and even those stubborn water rings seemed to vanish into thin air. It’s versatile enough for different types of wood finishes, which is great if you have a mix of antique and contemporary wooden furniture like I do.

[Check Howard Products RF3016 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b000c0182w/)

**Benefits**  
• Restores finishes without stripping or refinishing, preserving the wood's authenticity and value  
• Works effectively on a variety of wood tones, from maple-pine to dark oak  
• Simple and quick application process that anyone can manage  
• Eliminates watermarks, scratches, and white heat rings with ease  
• Enhances faded finishes, bringing life back to dull wooden surfaces  

**Limitations**  
• Not ideal for surfaces with deep gouges or severe damage that go beyond the finish  
• The strong odor during application might be a bit overwhelming for some people, so ventilation is needed  
• The product isn’t suitable for all surfaces, like painted wood or laminate, which limits its scope  

**Versatile Color Matching Options**  
One standout feature of this wood polish is the variety of colors it offers to match almost any wood tone. With nine shades, including Neutral, Maple-Pine, Golden Oak, Cherry, and Ebony Brown, I had no trouble finding the right match. My golden oak pieces looked brand new again, and even the dark walnut cabinet had a refreshed, professional look. It's worth noting that properly matching the color can take a bit of trial and error, but once you nail it, the results are remarkable.

**Suitability for Different Users**  
Whether you’re an antique dealer, a DIY enthusiast, or someone simply looking to refresh their wood furniture, this product has something for everyone. I even had my less DIY-savvy friend test it out on her dining table, and she was thrilled with the results. It’s a wonderful alternative to sanding and refinishing – especially for those without the time or expertise for such intensive repairs.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other wood polishers and refinishing products, Howard Restor-A-Finish shines (pun intended). I’ve tried natural oils and waxes before, but they don’t blend out imperfections nearly as seamlessly. Some competing brands might be cheaper, but their lack of versatility and effectiveness on blemishes make them less cost-effective in the long run. That said, if you’re specifically looking for an odor-free product, there are options in the market that may be gentler on the senses. However, they usually come at the expense of performance, especially for deeper scratches or oxidation.

**Value for Money**  
For what it does, I’d consider this product to be excellent value for money. Restoring wood furniture professionally can cost a small fortune, but this product offers a DIY solution that works almost as well. Some other products in a similar price range either don’t match the color as effectively or fail to rejuvenate finishes without requiring extra steps like sanding. My walnut cabinet looks like it belongs in a high-end showroom, and it didn't require hiring a professional – that’s a big win in my book.

Context: We’re pretty close as friends, and I honestly enjoy the bond we have. But I don’t know if she feels the same way. Another layer is that I’m not even sure if she likes girls, so I’m careful not to cross any lines.

Problem/Goal: I’m torn between just keeping her as a “happy crush"" or taking the risk to see if this could turn into something more.

But then there was she (Let's call her 'S' ) sitting right next to me in class, always stealing my notes and giving me that half-smile when I caught her.We started studying together, or at least that’s what we told everyone.

Truth? We were passing silly chits, sharing earphones during lunch, and finding excuses to walk together from class to the metro.

Somewhere between mock tests and midnight coffees, I fell for her.  One evening, after everyone left the library, I finally said it — “I think I’m in love with you.” She looked up, eyes wide, then laughed softly… leaned in and said, “Uth jaa bsdk !.” And then… I woke up. 😴💔 (Isliye Bolta hu Padhlo be tumlog, Lekin nahi, hame to reddit par love story dekhna hai🫠☝🏻️).",2,1756648961.0,TeenIndia,4,1.0,False

Yep, that name's Riza Nogales. 

She was emotional during that night. On verge of tears and going home undrafted.

But on the 25th pick, her name was finally called, drafted to become a Thunderbelle.

Fast forward to August 31st, she was awarded as the Best Middle Blocker of the Invitational Conference. Her journey taught us some lessons:


1. The order of the draft pick doesn't define a player. Kahit pang 69th pick ka, ibig sabihin mayroon pa rin nagtitiwala sayo. 



2. Hindi mahalaga kung gaano katagal ang paghihingay. Timing is everything, kumbaga sa court, wait for the perfect set to achieve a clean kill.

I managed to use loyalty points to get us free breakfast for the week. We just tried it today and it is hands down the awesomest hotel breakfast I have ever had. 

It has make-your-own-waffles, bacon, sausage, pancakes, three kinds of potatoes, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, eggs made to order, omelettes, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, English muffins, bagels, three kinds of bread, and pastries. And it is very well thought out - there are multiple stations for everything so you never have to wait even when the breakfast room is at full capacity. There are ten tanks of coffee so there is never a queue for coffee either. 

The staff were super nice too and cleaned up our mess with a smile when my partner knocked over his orange juice and then while trying to clean it up, knocked over my coffee. 

I had waffles and bacon. The waffle maker was one of those that does 4 tiny waffles instead of 1 big one so it had extra crispy golden edges. The bacon was also perfectly crispy. 

I am not sure I would go for biscuits and gravy again though... I had always wanted to try it so it was worth it for that. 

I really ought to put most of the above into a TripAdvisor review or something.

Arjun sat on his bed, waiting for Meera’s call.

She had promised they would talk today — finally, after a week of quick texts and late replies.
The clock struck 10:30 PM.
No call.

Arjun checked his phone again. Her status showed a picture with a friend from work — a coffee shop selfie, both smiling, captioned:

“Much-needed break with my favourite person ❤️☕”

His heart sank a little.
He told himself not to overthink. She deserves to have friends. She’s just relaxing after a hectic week.

Still, he waited.

At 11:15 PM, a notification popped up.

Meera: “Hey! Sorry Arjun… today just flew by. I was out with Riya, we had so much to catch up on. Can we talk tomorrow? Promise for real this time 😅”

Arjun stared at the screen for a while before replying:

“Sure. Sleep well. Good night.”

He didn’t add a heart this time.

The next day, they finally got on a video call.
Meera looked tired but cheerful.

“Arjun! Hey… sorry about yesterday. Riya and I just kept talking, I lost track of time.”

Arjun smiled faintly. “It’s okay. You seem happy.”

“I am,” Meera admitted. “It feels nice to have someone here who just… gets my daily chaos, you know?”

Arjun nodded, but his chest felt heavy.
She used to tell me everything. Now she tells Riya first.

There was a long pause.
Meera’s phone buzzed.

“Oh, it’s Riya. She just reached home. Wait, I’ll reply quickly.”
She typed, smiling at the screen.

Arjun watched silently. For the first time, he felt like a stranger in his own relationship.

“Arjun?” Meera said, noticing his quietness.
“You okay?”

He forced a smile.
“Yeah… just a little tired.”

They talked for a few more minutes — about random things — before Meera said she had an early morning meeting.

“Good night, Arjun.”
“Good night,” he replied softly.

When the call ended, Arjun lay back on his pillow.
He missed the girl who used to wait for his messages.
He missed being her safe place.

Somewhere, Meera probably smiled at her last text from Riya.

And Arjun?

1n4ve3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1n4ve3y/the_switch_to_wegovy_my_experience/,The switch to wegovy - my experience,"Had to switch due to insurance.  Was on 12.5 zepbound for just over a year and had lost 80+ lbs.

Here's what's changed on Wegovy,  the good and the bad:

-gained 5 lbs in just over a month. This is likely due to needing to start at a lower dose (1.0) and work my way up to a therapeutic dose. Am currently on 1.7 and it looks like I'm stabilizing-- neither gaining nor losing. 

- I had entered perimenipause before starting zepbound. Just the beginnings of night sweats and insomnia.  Zepbound removed both. On Wegovy I'm back to waking up at 2 a.m. without cause and struggling to go back to sleep. Night sweats have not returned.

- smell is normal again. I'm a super smeller and while I haven't heard anyone else complain about this, my sniffer changed on zepbound and/or my super sniffer picked up zepbound in my body and that overpowered other smells. It was always worse an hour after my shot and better the day before my next shot. I still smell a little of the wegovy in my general odor (the smell of my skin) the day I take a shot, but otherwise don't smell it AND my super sniffer is back again. (For better or or worse.)

- BMs. On zepbound they became skinnier and shorter while a normal consistency (not constipated). Consequently I had BMs 2-4 times a day. My normal had been every morning or every other morning. We're now back to normal size, normal frequency. There was a period of adjustment where I had to be careful about water, diet and fiber, but now my morning coffee does the trick.

- Endurance sports -- I had to be super careful on zepbound as I would hit a wall with energy lows if I didn’t fuel carefully for long runs/rides. I'm on too low a dose of wegovy to say for sure, but that doesn't seem to be as big of an issue.

- appetite suppression: I'm covered well. Not quite as great as zepbound and I don't have the same great signal that I need to STOP eating, but I'm not always hungry/thinking about food. So it's good enough. Might improve on a higher dose

We are great, happy couple and the kids are awesome. My husband has a widowed mother and a younger brother (37M), who live together a couple of hours from us, and I have my parents who live 3 hours away. 
For some reasons, my kids are closer to my parents. I guess it is natural for children to be close to one set of grandparents. Sometimes I ask my parents for help, sometimes my husband asks his mum, especially with our older boys. Both of us work full time. 
Anyway, I need advice. We often go to my mother in law’s house in weekends to visit, but the whole dynamic in my husband’s family is quite odd to me. They don’t communicate much, the whole conversations revolve around the kids. I have known these people for a decade and a half and I am always uneasy there, for no valid reason. They are kind and polite, good to the kids, but something is just… off, and I can’t understand what. Probably things that have to do with the past, whatever it is, I don’t want to interfere and meddle with their unspoken code of conduct.
My husband and I will be working in a renaissance fair in a month. We do this every now and then. This time, my husband will work both days full time while I will work mornings. I will be bringing the kids with me while I work and then take care of the kids during the rest of the day. We like to just do some activities, eat cotton candy, go on rides, watch some theatre. I am really looking forward to have this time with my kids especially after the stress of going back to school. But i am worried about my MIL and i dont know what to do. My MIL and BIL will go to the fair as well (it’s close to their house), and (this has happened every year), they usually get there, spot the kids, and then decide they are going to hang with us. No prior arrangements like “i am going there at this hour, let’s get some coffee”. They just come, look for the kids (either with me, my husband or both), and stay with us. They have no plans.
I could understand if these were the only opportunities they have to be with the kids, but ee are often together.
I want to be free of them, make my own decisions and not be conditioned by their presence. Sometimes after a while i will say : “ok kids, say goodbye to grandma, we are going to get some ice cream”, and they don’t follow us, but sometimes i am hanging with friends with kids, and out kids are playing together and MIL and BIL come and just… stay there. They say hello to the other people and just stay there, looking at my kids (they’re not babies anymore…), and I get really uncomfortable with it because i cannot be at ease with my friends.
My parents, on the other hand, are very mindful of our family time, for example, if they are babysitting my kids and my husband arrives before me, they will go out and respect our much needed family time, they don’t extend their stay… my MIL is the opposite, i have to send the kids to bed for her to consider leaving.
Now, my husband is on the same page as me, but he does not know what to do. Neither do I. It seems harsh to ask her: hey, if you see us, just say hi, don’t stick around… they are not doing anything wrong, just being immensely out of touch. Last year the same thing happened and i ended up leaving a few hours earlier even though i had plans with friends i see once a year just to avoid having them breathing down my neck. My kids love them but also dont want them around all the time, especially when they could be having fun. I honestly don’t know how to handle this… any sugestions?",1,1756648540.0,familydrama,0,1.0,False
1n4vabn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4vabn,Zimaya Sharaf Blend - A Wonderful Winter Fragrance,"Name: Zimaya sharaf blend 100 ml Extrait de parfum

Price: 1900

Type: Winter wear, Gourmand.

Test duration: 4 days, 1 month macerated

My review:

This is an underrated perfume in the khamrah or pseudo angels share clone dna. But better than Lattafa khamrah imo.

Presentation: 

Just beautiful, whether its the box or bottle or juice color, well presented. 

Smell:

It starts with a very nice blend of Dates, safron, amber and vanilla. Dates and amber together create a syrupy boozy effect without any boozy notes. lts beautiful.

But as it uses dates and safron there will be a middle eastern vibe here.

Then it dries down to a calm and sweet vanilla with a hint of choco nuttiness and musk.

This one is way mellow and refined than khamrah, its a strong amber scent yet doesn't overpower you (If you like sweetness that is).

Regardless its an unique and intoxicating smell

Performance:

Beast mode for sure. Projects even after 2 or 3 hours, over spray at your risk. Scent bubble however is medium sized, sillage smell is a bit boozy and rich vanilla.

Lasts 12 hours in the evenings (I do night shifts sometimes), don't think I can test in summers as it is very sweet

For whom:

If you like vanilla based sweet gourmandish
fragrances, you will love this.

If you like khamrah or qahwa, you will love this but will be redundant.

If you think this is very boozy and a clone of angels share, you will be disappointed, don't get this if you don't like that middle eastern type of smell.

If you are in search for a unique winter and date night (Can't relate) fragrance, get this. 

Layering:

Love the smell as it is, but I tried layering it with
coffee attars to get qahwa like effect and it works somehow, also goes well with the black phantom clone I have.

Verdict:

Smell, performance, presentation all a 10/10. It is mellow, warm and elegant, but the sweetness can still choke one out unless you like being choked 😏.

1n4v7mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1n4v7mm/habit_cravings_are_tougher_to_beat/,Habit Cravings are tougher to beat,"Some context:

Today is my 40th day smoke free but I still feel like smoking almost every day. I found this incredibly strange because why would I still be craving it if I haven’t had any nicotine in my system for so many days.

The last couple of days have been incredibly tough because of this since I felt it’ll be impossible to quit cigs for good if I get urges like this forever. Like till when can I expect to actually fight them off.

So I asked gpt if the urges ever stop and it told me this:

Physical Cravings which come with serious withdrawals like irritability, restlessness and very strong urges typically last only the first 2 weeks or at most 3 weeks.

Post then for another 3 or so months, urges persist but these aren’t as strong. These urges are typically HABIT URGES, meaning you have correlated some part of your life with cigs and will take some time for your brain chemistry to rewire.

These habits could be connected with good weather, drinking, boredom, stress etc.

This made total sense now, I wasn’t actually getting any withdrawals or strong urges but this constant feeling of wanting a cig because I was continuously engaged in activities which my brain associated with cigs.

Such as:
1. I work from home so there was always an ashtray and cigs on my table while I worked
2. I watched tv shows on my tablet in the balcony while smoking so most shows or entertainment was associated with smoking
3. Morning coffee or refreshing drinks like Diet Coke in the noon always had a cigg with them

And so on

Why do I share this?

Because now it makes the fight easier

How?

I know the enemy i.e bad habits

More specifically bad association my mind had made

I know the time frame

It will take 3-6 months of constant effort to make sure my brain breaks these associations.

So now, every time I get a craving while performing an activity associated with smoking, I ask myself,

“Did smoking genuinely made this experience better?”

“Did I enjoy this show more because of a cig?”

“Did this coffee taste better because of a cig?”

And more often than not, the answer is a big fat NO.

And then I remind myself, all the good not having a cig has done.

- No breathlessness while walking or climbing stairs
- No fast heartbeats even when sitting or lying down
- Food and drinks taste better
- I smell better, my clothes smell better
- I don’t have to hide from my parents at home while doing something shameful
- I don’t feel lesser of myself because I depend so much on a paper rolled with leaves inside

And VOILA, the moment passes, and I hopefully require my brain by 0.01%.

**Grossly Oversimplified TLDR:** I made this design that could help a whole bunch of people, but I am comically untalented when it comes to actual hands-on crafting, so I could really use some help. The wall of text below details the construction and operation of a small-scale, functional model of the Integrated Biomass-Hydro Combined Cascade (IBHCC) system. Its purpose is to provide a safe, visual, and intuitive demonstration that reveals a shocking truth: every conventional power plant on Earth is throwing away more energy than it captures. The entire apparatus can be safely operated on a standard picnic table or workbench, progressing from simple to advanced configurations.## Waypoint Network Applications

**Ecological Restoration:**
- **Desert Reclamation** - Transport seawater inland for controlled salt marsh creation and gradual soil remediation
- **Watershed Replenishment** - Pump water uphill to restore dried river systems and aquifers
- **Wildfire Prevention** - Create strategic water reserves in fire-prone areas for rapid deployment

**Agricultural Systems:**
- **Inland Aquaculture** - Transport seawater for marine fish farming hundreds of miles from coast
- **Precision Irrigation** - Deliver water exactly where needed without energy-consuming pump systems
- **Soil Remediation** - Transport treated water for healing damaged farmland

**Industrial Applications:**
- **Mining Site Restoration** - Pump clean water to remediate contaminated sites
- **Manufacturing** - Supply industrial processes with pressurized water without grid dependency
- **Cooling Systems** - Provide industrial cooling water using transport network pressure

**Emergency Response:**
- **Disaster Relief** - Rapidly establish water supply to disaster-affected areas
- **Remote Communities** - Connect isolated areas to reliable water networks
- **Strategic Reserves** - Create distributed water storage for regional resilience

## Network Interconnection & System Regeneration

**Full IBHCC Integration Points:**
- **System Re-energization** - Waypoint water can be directed into full IBHCC facilities downstream, where it gets completely re-energized through the full dual-system process
- **Water Addition** - Each full IBHCC system adds new water to the network (from seawater, groundwater, atmospheric water generation, etc.)
- **Pressure Restoration** - Full systems restore and amplify pressure for continued long-distance transport
- **Multi-Source Integration** - Network can draw from multiple water sources as it expands

**Network Multiplication Effect:**
Instead of water pressure gradually declining over distance, the network would actually **gain capacity** as it grows. Each full IBHCC facility acting as both a destination and a regeneration point, taking in water from the transport network while simultaneously adding new water and pressure from local sources.

## System Scaling & Universal Retrofit Potential

**Scalable Development Path:**
The IBHCC scales systematically from homestead (50-200 lbs coffee waste daily) to community (2-4 parallel systems) to industrial installations (6-12+ parallel arrays). Each scale maintains the same fundamental principles while increasing capacity through proven parallel multiplication.

**Universal Retrofit Applications:**
The waste heat recovery system can be retrofitted to virtually any existing thermal facility - coal plants, natural gas facilities, industrial processes, even oil refineries. Any facility with a steam stack becomes a candidate for IBHCC enhancement while maintaining existing baseline operations.

**Hydroelectric Plant Integration:**
Existing hydroelectric facilities present particularly elegant retrofit opportunities. The dam's water flow replaces the elevated storage tanks, requiring only addition of Heron Fountain pressure multiplication and precision nozzle systems. A portion of the dam's flow gets diverted through the pressure multiplication system, then delivered at higher velocity for enhanced turbine impact. Thermal supercharging can be powered by the plant's own electricity through electric heating coils rather than biodiesel, creating a fuel-free enhancement loop that increases total power output from the same water flow.

## Learning from Past Failures: The Salton Sea Lessons

The IBHCC's water management systems benefit from studying previous artificial water body failures. The Salton Sea in California demonstrates what happens when water systems lack proper engineering controls.

Created accidentally in 1905 when the Colorado River flooded California's Salton Basin, the Salton Sea initially became a recreational paradise attracting celebrities and luxury resorts. However, fundamental design flaws created environmental disaster:

- **No outlet strategy** caused dissolved salts to concentrate until salinity exceeded ocean levels
- **Uncontrolled agricultural runoff** created toxic algae blooms and massive fish die-offs  
- **Unlined basin** allowed contamination and geological instability

**IBHCC Solutions:** The system's condensation process creates pure distilled water, eliminating salt accumulation. Coffee-ash concrete liners provide permanent containment, while biological filtration through spirulina systems maintains water quality. Unlike single-purpose recreation, IBHCC systems provide energy, waste processing, and food production - creating permanent community value with multiple revenue streams.

## Addressing Institutional Skepticism

**The Cost Reality:** The IBHCC is fundamentally cheaper than conventional power plants being built today. It uses simpler core technologies (biomass gasifiers vs nuclear reactors) and produces its own building materials during operation, reducing infrastructure costs from 40-60% down to 5-10% of total project cost. No hidden subsidies, loan guarantees, or insurance backstops required.

**Scalable Implementation:** This isn't an ""all or nothing"" system. Start with homestead-scale units buildable without advanced expertise, then scale using materials the system produces. A small installation continuously creates ash for concrete, waste heat for curing insulation, and steam for processing structural materials - enabling organic growth impossible for other power systems.

**The Thermodynamics Question:** This isn't energy from nothing - it's strategic utilization of the complete biomass feedstock. The solid portion powers the base steam cycle, while liquid biofuels (from the same source material) provide targeted heating throughout the waste recovery system. Combined with pressure amplification from trapped air expansion and gravity-assisted water cycling, the total system extracts significantly more energy from the same fuel input than conventional single-cycle systems.

Think of it as two integrated systems: System 1 (conventional steam) provides baseline power, while System 2 (waste recovery) captures and redirects energy that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere.

**Energy Balance Reality:** The auxiliary equipment (fans, pumps) does consume power, but this comes from the system's own electrical output - similar to how power plants use a portion of their generation for plant operations. The net gain comes from capturing waste heat that conventional plants vent directly to cooling towers or exhaust stacks.

**Why This Works:** Conventional thermal plants achieve ~30-40% efficiency because they operate as single-cycle systems. Combined-cycle plants (gas turbine + steam recovery) already prove that capturing ""waste"" from the first cycle can significantly boost total efficiency. The IBHCC extends this principle further by adding thermal storage, pressure amplification, and multiple heat recovery stages.

**Important Note:** While the principles are sound, the specific efficiency gains, as with the system as a whole do still absolutely need extensive experimental validation.

**Water Security Backstop:** Even if energy claims prove optimistic, the system provides energy-positive desalination using waste heat that's already being produced. This makes freshwater production essentially cost-free, providing enormous value through water security alone.

## The Steam Engine's Last Stand

While humanity invests hundreds of billions in fusion research - attempting to recreate stellar nuclear fires in magnetic bottles cooled to near absolute zero - the ultimate goal remains unchanged: heating water to create steam that spins turbines. We're building the most sophisticated machines in human history to accomplish what steam engines have done for centuries.

This raises a fundamental question: if our most advanced energy technology still depends on steam turbines, have we truly optimized steam systems to their limits? While brilliant minds contain plasma at 100 million degrees, we routinely discard 70% of thermal energy from every power plant as ""waste heat.""

The IBHCC suggests extraordinary performance may be achievable through systematic application of principles we've understood for millennia - thermal expansion, pressure multiplication, gravitational storage, and waste recovery - rather than requiring breakthrough physics decades away from practical application.

1n4v67u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4v67u,Passed WGU Nutrition D440 First Try! 🎉 My Complete Study Guide & Tips,"Hey fellow night-shift warriors and caffeine-fuelled nursing students! 👋

I FINALLY conquered the D440 Health & Wellness Nutrition OA yesterday and wanted to share everything that helped me pass on my first attempt! This course had me stressed for weeks (anyone else get nutrition anxiety?!) but I found some strategies that really worked. Buckle up for my comprehensive breakdown of what to focus on!

# 📚 COURSE OVERVIEW

D440 covers nutritional concepts across the lifespan, with emphasis on:

* Nutritional assessment techniques
* Therapeutic diets for various conditions
* Vitamin/mineral functions and deficiencies
* Nutrition across different life stages
* Cultural considerations in nutrition

# 🔑 KEY TOPICS TO MASTER

# 💉 NUTRITIONAL ANEMIAS (High-Yield Topic!)

The OA had MULTIPLE questions about iron-deficiency anaemia. Know:

* **Iron-rich foods:** Heme sources (meat, poultry, fish) vs. Non-heme sources (beans, spinach, fortified cereals)
* **Absorption factors:** Vitamin C enhances absorption; calcium, tannins (tea/coffee), and phytates inhibit it
* **Teaching priorities:** Taking supplements between meals, pairing iron foods with vitamin C foods
* **Clinical signs:** Fatigue, pallor, brittle nails, tachycardia, decreased exercise tolerance

Sample question I encountered:

>

The correct answer was A - combining non-heme iron (spinach) with vitamin C (orange) to maximize absorption.

# 🍎 DIABETES & CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM

* **Glycemic index:** Low vs. high GI foods and their effects on blood glucose
* **Carb counting:** Teaching priorities for diabetic clients
* **Consistent carbohydrate meal planning:** Distribution throughout the day
* **Hypoglycemia vs. hyperglycemia:** Signs, symptoms, and interventions

This came up in several scenario questions where I had to evaluate meal plans for diabetic patients.

# 🧂 THERAPEUTIC DIETS

Know the basics for these diets (restrictions, allowed foods, teaching priorities):

* **Sodium-restricted diets:** Different levels (2g, 1.5g, 1g)
* **Renal diets:** Phosphorus, potassium, sodium restrictions
* **Cardiac diets:** Focus on heart-healthy fats, sodium limitations
* **DASH diet:** Components and benefits
* **Mediterranean diet:** Key principles

# 🤰 NUTRITION ACROSS THE LIFESPAN

* **Pregnancy:** Increased needs for folate, iron, calcium, protein
* **Lactation:** Additional caloric and fluid requirements
* **Pediatrics:** Age-appropriate nutrition milestones, introduction of solids
* **Adolescence:** Increased calcium, protein, and calorie needs
* **Geriatrics:** B12 absorption issues, calcium needs, protein requirements

I got several questions on pregnancy nutrition - know those increased requirements cold!

# 🧪 NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT

* **Anthropometric measurements:** BMI, waist circumference, weight changes
* **Biochemical data:** Albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, hemoglobin/hematocrit
* **Clinical assessment:** Physical signs of malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies
* **Dietary assessment methods:** 24-hour recall, food frequency questionnaires

# 🧠 MY STUDY STRATEGIES

1. **Create nutrient deficiency flashcards** \- For each vitamin/mineral:
   * Food sources
   * Functions in the body
   * Deficiency symptoms
   * Toxicity symptoms (if applicable)
2. **Practice NCLEX-style questions daily** \- This was my secret weapon! The question format on the OA is very similar to NCLEX.
3. **Make a therapeutic diet chart** \- I created a quick-reference comparing all the therapeutic diets with their restrictions, allowed foods, and rationales.
4. **Use the pre-assessment strategically** \- I took it early to identify weak areas, studied those specifically, then took it again right before the OA.
5. **Study resources from** [**RN Student Resources**](https://rnstudentresources.com/) \- Their D440 materials aligned perfectly with the exam content and saved me tons of time organizing information.

# ❓ SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM MY OA

1. **Scenario-based question:**Answer: B - Simply avoiding table salt isn't enough; label reading is essential since processed foods contribute significantly to sodium intake.*A nurse is providing discharge education to a client with newly diagnosed heart failure. Which statement by the client indicates understanding of sodium restriction?*a) ""I should avoid adding table salt to my food."" b) ""I need to read food labels for sodium content."" c) ""I will avoid all canned and processed foods."" d) ""I should drink 8 glasses of water daily.""
2. **Knowledge application:**Answer: C - Bananas are high in potassium which needs to be restricted in renal diets.*A client with chronic kidney disease is following a renal diet. Which food selection indicates the need for further teaching?*a) Rice b) Apples c) Bananas d) Chicken
3. **Assessment scenario:**Answer: B - Low albumin levels can indicate protein malnutrition.*During nutritional assessment of an elderly client, which finding is most concerning for malnutrition?*a) BMI of 24 b) Albumin level of 3.0 g/dL c) Total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL d) Blood glucose of 95 mg/dL

# 🏆 EXAM DAY TIPS

1. **Read every question TWICE** \- Many questions had similar answer options that could be easily confused.
2. **Look for key words** like ""priority,"" ""first,"" ""most important"" - They're telling you exactly what they're looking for!
3. **Take your time** \- The OA gives you plenty of time, so don't rush. I finished with 45 minutes to spare.
4. **Trust your preparation** \- If you've studied the topics above thoroughly, you're ready!

# 🌟 FINAL THOUGHTS

The D440 exam focuses heavily on practical application rather than memorization. Understanding nutritional principles and how to apply them in patient scenarios is key. I found the exam to be fair but detailed - it definitely tests whether you can apply nutritional concepts in realistic nursing scenarios.

I'm happy to answer questions in the comments. We're all in this together! 💪

Good luck future nurses! You've got this!

I have swapped to food choices that is comprised of 90% whole foods. I get at least 10k steps a day. I drink two glasses of water in the morning and drink electrolytes. I do black coffee every morning. I dont drink sodas, no calorie-dense drinks, and no calorie dense dressings. I’m also careful when cooking not to use butter or a heap of olive oil. Only spritz of olive oil spray. 

However, my struggle is telling my brain to chill the F out. 

Even with whole food, trying to focus on satiating foods, drinking a gallon of water a day, and hitting my protein goals, I struggle with portion control. 

Have you guys found any tricks to turn your brain off? For example, I will craveeeee sweets (cookies or chocolate candy).  I end up eating 3 bananas or a boat load of Greek yogurt, inherently blowing my calories out of the water. 

I admittedly do not track my calories.  I try to focus on low calorie foods; call me lazy af, but my life is HECTIC. Logging foods and weighing every item just turns me off to process. 

Any hacks to basically tell your brain “nah fam, you’ve had your 1500, you’re good.” … or will I continue to be in a depressing state of cravings forever?! .. I’ll also add it isn’t hunger cravings. It is certainly just “taste” cravings. 

I know it’s totally feasible to have gluttonous foods in moderation; however, that doesn’t work for me. I have found it better to cut those garbage foods out completely. For example, if I buy Oreo thins, it is guaranteed that the package won’t last more than 3 days. Therefore, I don’t buy them (or foods like that anymore). 

Similarly, even with whole foods, I will over eat. Breakfast will include eggs, shredded potatoes, chicken, and greek yogurt. However, I find I “load up” on those foods, or if I don’t, I’m snacking a lot more during the day. 

I certainly have more fat to lose before getting to a lean and healthy level… I have sustainably hit 10k steps for 6 months, shed some pounds, and made the shift to Whole Foods. 

I’m looking for a way to dial this in and dial the portions back, without constantly thinking about the restrictions. I hope this makes senses. Basically my brain is thinking about food 90% of the time if I’m not actively engaged in something that requires 100% attention. It would also be great if there is a way to help with this, that doesn’t totally involve weighing every food I eat. With a hectic life, and little spare time, I know success will also be tied to something that’s easy to implement and doesn’t feel like a chore. 

Anywho, hoping if any of you have been in a similar spot, you may have some hacks, tips, or swaps that were game changers or made this process a lot easier. My brain always has an itch of wanting to eat or snack.

The idea that we all had a life before the one we have now, however which way we decided to live it. No matter what, however, we won't remember.
We're not supposed to anyway.

So why was it, that she wasn't given the gift of forgetting?
Why did she have to be woken up to the vivid memory of a life that is no longer hers?
Nightmare after nightmare, those tear clouded eyes, the hand that held hers, the soft whispers of not wanting to go, of loving her until those eyes lost their spark.
Same nightmare everytime and yet it was just as bad as the last.

Vesper was given the misfortune (although she'd never admit it aloud) of being raised in a life she couldn't escape, not even in the past. She was - and still is - part of the mafia, the south to be specific but it didn't matter, all that really mattered in that past life was her.
She'd never forget the first day she met her, at her favourite bar in that jade satin dress for any sleazy guy to ogle, her voice as smooth as silk as she sang on that stage. The amount of times their eyes caught clearly uncoincidental and how Vesper approached her after.

After that, they were inseparable, even when she knew who Vesper truly was and what she did, she stayed. Vesper loved her with her whole heart and more, willing to give her the world, anything that she wanted. She swore that nothing would happen to her.
But..
Something did happen. A rat. Someone she saw as a brother, being the cause of everything shattering. The two of them died alongside each other, Vesper's hand in hers as a promise.

She'd find her bird again.

Now back to the present, Vesper being sleep-deprived and having to deal with her Uncle's bad mood because of some shit that happened with some guys in his clique, she went with the only thing that could fuel her for the rest of the day. Coffee. A coffee shop had opened up nearby so what better than to test it out. She walked in and got into the annoyingly long line, watching each person move out of the way and slowly getting closer to the woman behind the counter. She just hadn't expected that when it was her turn she'd freeze up like this.
Freeze at the sight of those familiar eyes.
A face that looked as if it hadn't aged a day.
A confused expression riddled all over her face as Vesper stood frozen like an idiot

It's alot, yes, but you got through it. Suprisingly.
Can you really blame me, I'm just a sucker for story building.

Anyway enough chitchat, this is about soulmates bonded in every life, binary stars if you will, born to always orbit around one another and eventually find each other again. 
But how will this story play out? Does y/c even suffer with the same curse of remembering? Is there a sense of recognition? Will Vesper make the same mistake or will things be different this time?

Another thing, I'm not picky on which role I have, whether it's the coffee shop girl or the mafia girl, the prompt is mainly to get the gist of things. Plus, if you want to be the mafia girl, you can change how things might've gone in your past life.

In terms of roleplay, I'd call myself somewhat literate, responding with 2-3 paragraphs, but it can be more when I'm really into describing the setting or some scenes. I usually use 1st person, but I can also use 3rd if that's preferred

Two big boxes full of different items, ranging from used household electronics to souvenirs clothes and blankets. Nothing posh or uber expensive, just didn't fit in our suitcases. DHL and others were simply too expensive, and this cost us about 1000 dirhams. Both were 25kg boxes of personal items. 

We opened our parcels and were shocked. Plastic folders cut through with a knife. Everything that was neatly packed and wrapped in bubble wrap cut through and rummaged through. Sealed boxes force opened, torn or cut through. Glasses and cups that were wrapped in bubble wrap opened and thrown back inside like they are junk - completely shattered glass. It is as if people just rummaged through our belongings, vandalised them, looking for something of value. Due to mishandling many things broke or were chipped/bent on arrival. We had to throw away otherwise normal stuff we could have used for ages. Inexpensive things like books and blankets left untouched. 

Worst of all. A used coffee machine that cost 600 AED was just stolen. Unopened Dior cologne - stolen. Other small things that looked shiny or expensive enough to sell - stolen. Whatever wasn't worth attention was mishandled or opened and thrown back inside. Some metal tins were literally opened, emptied completely and thrown on top of everything - someone literally took whatever was inside. All we know is that we packed everything very neatly, and that shipping itinerary mentions a coffee machine and cologne that was not in the parcel when it arrived sealed with EMS tape. 

The parcels were not opened by customs of either country - otherwise they would have left a note of what they inspected or took out and re-sealed them. But our posessions were simply vandalised by Emirates Post workers. We are shocked and appaled by this, obviosuly there is no chance of getting any compensation or apology. These items are lost now and the damage has been done. 

Just warning any leaving expats or anyone - don’t use Emirates post for things you value, because you never know what might happen.

There are companies that use software to scan your feet for sizing, for example Russell or Red Wing Irish Setter. They are still far from accurate or trustworthy for most people, so we still rely on tape measuring.

I can see a future where a cell phone app allows 3D scanning of your feet to within 98%+ accuracy. Those measurements are then sent to the company in place of paper forms, and a 3D last is printed for the order. Measurements can be inexpensively stored electronically if retaining the lasts is too cumbersome. And this would cut down the human error in customer measurements, and the time and lost revenue required for costly remakes. 

I do realize technology is not to this point yet, and very cost prohibiting for now. Just interesting….🤔

1n4uvoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n4uvoy/should_you_try_the_best_drip_coffee_maker/,Should you try the best drip coffee maker Technivorm Moccamaster KBT,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 coffee maker for the past month has been quite the journey. As someone who practically runs on caffeine and enjoys a good brew, I knew I needed a reliable machine that struck the perfect balance between performance, design, and practicality. This polished silver drip coffee machine truly stands out in the crowd, both visually and functionally. But not everything about it was flawless, so let’s dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and polished silver exterior. It’s not just a coffee machine; it’s a statement piece for any modern kitchen. The build quality is top-notch, and you can tell it wasn’t thrown together haphazardly. Handmade in the Netherlands, the craftsmanship shows in its sturdy build and the functionality of each component. The 6.75""D x 11.5""W x 15.25""H dimensions make it compact enough to fit nicely on most countertops without hogging too much space. At 6.5 pounds, it’s easy to move but still feels like a premium and durable product.  

The accompanying brew basket, thermal carafe, and adjustable drip-stop system add a lot more sophistication to the design. These removable parts make cleaning straightforward while also adding to the product's long-term usability. I also appreciated the included travel lid. For someone who keeps rushing out the door in the mornings, that extra touch felt thoughtful.

**Performance: Brewing Excellence**  
Once I started putting the Moccamaster to work, I immediately noticed its efficiency. The 40-ounce brewing capacity coupled with its swift 4-6 minute brew cycle makes it a lifesaver on busy mornings. That manual-adjust, drip-stop brew basket gives excellent control over how the coffee flows into the thermal carafe, which is ideal when trying to regulate taste and strength.  

During the brewing process, the pre-immersion drip-style system became one of my favorite features. By ensuring a natural pulse action and an even coffee bloom, it consistently delivered rich, flavorful cups. Every cup felt as if it had been brewed by someone with far more expertise than me. To top it off, the thermal carafe manages to keep coffee hot for an hour, though I sometimes wished it would stretch a little longer. If you’re traveling, swapping in the travel lid keeps the coffee warm on the road too.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Simplicity is key with this machine. The one-button operation is a dream come true for those of us who struggle with overly complex gadgets before caffeine kicks in. Despite being straightforward, you don’t miss out on customization because of the manual adjustability of the brew basket. Whether you want a bold morning brew or a mild afternoon pick-me-up, you can tweak things easily.  

The reusable filter was another highlight for me. Not only does it reduce the need for purchasing and throwing out paper filters constantly, but it’s also eco-friendly, which resonates with my sustainability values. However, this feature requires careful cleaning to ensure the best-tasting brew each time, so something to keep in mind.

**Advantages**  
Several aspects stood out as real game-changers:  
- Efficient 4–6-minute brew cycle for 40 oz of coffee.  
- Pre-immersion drip ensures consistent coffee bloom for superior flavor.  
- Durable thermal carafe keeps coffee warm and retains freshness.  
- Handmade, robust design exudes quality and longevity.  

**Limitations**  
Despite all the positives, no product is ever perfect, and the coffee maker had a few things that could be improved:  
- The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for about an hour—longer heat retention would be better.  
- Lacks an automatic shutoff feature, requiring manual intervention after brewing.  
- A little on the pricier side, though the premium build quality justifies the investment.  

**Product Competitors**  
Looking at its competitors, I found myself comparing the Moccamaster to a product like the Breville Precision Brewer. The Breville offers a similar level of precision but tends to focus on a broader range of brew strength and temperature options. While it’s a strong contender, the Moccamaster’s design edges ahead both in durability and ease of use. On the other hand, budget models such as the Ninja Coffee Brewer may appeal to those who want greater affordability, but they fall short when it comes to the superior flavor extraction that the Moccamaster provides.  

Everything about this coffee machine, from the premium build to its consistent brewing results, places it in a category above most home coffee machines. That said, it might not appeal to those looking for advanced programmable features or super-advanced brewing styles like cold brew or an espresso option.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While this coffee maker sits in the higher price range compared to mainstream machines, it absolutely justifies its cost with its performance and longevity. I’d describe it as an investment piece for anyone truly serious about good coffee. Additionally, the five-year warranty really sweetens the deal, offering peace of mind for those hesitant about taking the plunge. It’s not often you find such a commitment to product durability from manufacturers these days.

1n4uvkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1n4uvkw/the_value_of_deep_understanding/,The value of deep understanding,"I've been guilty of using it all: simple auto completion before AI, Google and stack overflow, asking chatgpt and copy paste, in editor ai agents and pure vibe coding clis. This is my main job and I won't leave an opportunity to be more efficient on the street. There, doing things I already know, I settled with using agents but watching it's fingers very closely, with big prompts that already take out the majority of mental load.

However, I have started a new learning path that involves coding recently (robotics), and I noticed how I automatically go into lazy mode of vibing it all, not even questioning what exactly the robot layout that some AI spit out is doing as long as it does what feels right at runtime. 

And then I noticed how I did not actually learn this, it's not my knowledge, I am not left behind with understanding, but the next question to a chat window. 

So I disabled the auto completion, ditched the Agent and tried it myself, and it actually felt good. Not the ""I'm the god of productivity"" rush good, but an accomplishment that will last longer than the next dopamine spike from the next prompt.

Then I remembered how addicts describe their addiction, and it's similar: a little voice telling you that without the stuff, you won't perform. You need it. When having an out-of-window assistant that also gives out code sometimes, but mostly explains things is coffee, vibe coding is doing meth.

But nothing was harder to handle than **Hope Lopez the Third**.

It all went down during the **Big Fish Incident**.

Hope was trying to impress a crowd at a Toontown charity event by “borrowing” the Big Fish for a dramatic performance. She claimed it was going to be “art” involving water balloons, interpretive dance, and tartar sauce. Instead, the fish slipped free, caused pandemonium, and left the entire event looking like a food fight at SeaWorld.

Paul, who was on security duty, tried his best to fix things. He calmed children, wrangled churro bandits, and dove headfirst into the fountain to stop the Big Fish from swimming off into the parking lot. But when the police arrived, both Paul and Hope were caught red-handed with nets.

“Sir, ma’am you’re both coming downtown,” the officer said.

Paul protested, “I am an officer of the mall!” but it was no use.

**In Jail**

Paul was horrified by life behind bars: no Segways, no coffee kiosks, no mall Wi-Fi. Hope, on the other hand, thrived. She started running karaoke nights, leading push-up competitions, and convincing other inmates to call her “Warden Lopez.”

Still, Paul kept pleading his case, insisting he was only there by mistake. Eventually, the Big Fish itself made things clear. It broke into the jail through a busted water pipe, flopped dramatically into the visiting room, and “testified” by splashing at the guards until they looked into the security footage.

The truth came out: Paul was innocent. He’d been caught in Hope’s mess, but hadn’t caused the chaos himself.

**The Release**

The warden opened Paul’s cell door. “Blart, you’re free to go. Your record is clean.”

Paul straightened his mall cop badge with pride. “Justice always finds a way.”

Hope waved from her bunk, grinning. “Don’t feel bad, Blart! Jail’s kind of my thing. I’ve already got karaoke night scheduled and I’m running for ‘Inmate of the Month.’ This place suits me.”

Paul sighed, pushing his Segway out of the evidence room. “Hope… you’re the only person I know who could turn jail into a social club.”

As the doors closed behind him, Paul looked up at the sky and made a silent promise: next time, he’d keep at least three churro carts of distance between himself and Hope Lopez the Third.",1,1756647240.0,ellykatstans,0,1.0,False

so we had a pep rally, and these two popular girls (who had a LARGE reputation of being pick mes and putting other girls down and embarrassing them for attention from boys Wendy did it many times to me and it honestly got worse each time and I never confronted her cause she was the type to quickly talk bad and start stuff and i just didn't want drama and all i ever wanted was to be her friend but she only ever talked to me when it benefitted her..) named katie and wendy, they were sitting behind 3 boys (they were a year older), names Braxton, Carson, and Christan (christian being my crush at the time and wendy KNEW that and knowing her from past experiences i know she told them) and i saw Wendy and Katie continuously call me over and the boys started arguing with each other over smth (clearly planning on flirting/talking to me as a joke. also wendy and katie kept pointing to random guys of the three and giving me a thumbs up and during this whole thing they all kept looking over at me and stuff) and then after like 10 minutes i finally went and sat and braxton moved and I sat behind him and the girls wanna start acting like we are friends giving me fist bumps even though they would act embarrassed of me all the time before and would clearly find me very weird and they IMMEDIATELY told Carson to say hi or something to me and Carson like moved over to directly behind Braxton (we were on like bleachers and Braxton moved to like the gapn thing between the seats so carson could be directly behind him or smth) to like make room for me to sit next to Christan or whatever and gave him a look and christan quickly told him to come back and then after awhile of awkward, uncomfortable ass silence Wendy and Katie told me i can go back if i want to and i went back cause it was just uncomfortable and embarrassing and then my english teacher at the time saw the whole thing (the whole school was in the gym btw so everyone saw) and then she was giving me a look, like she was giving a comforting look to tell me it was okay and kept giving it to me and my friend asked me if i was okay and i said yeah and i felt embarrassed and i did see Carson look over at me but it wasnt with that annoying playfulness again it looked like concern but tbh i doubted it i didnt wanna be delusional (note this later on) after the pep rally thing after carson looked at me with concern and stuff cause I was on the verge of fucking tears, they came to me and the lied. They said they were just inviting me to sit with them and said and I quote ""but they are...."" like girl NO. Do not even lie. it's so clear what you were doing. the fact they lied when it was so obvious what they were doing. They weren't just inviting me to sit with them. They never did. They had a history of being pick mes and putting girls down for male validation and willow only talked to me when it benefited her, like, she wasn't nice to me at all until she had no body else to hang out with. They pointed at guys and gave me a thumbs up and called me over repeated it for like 10 minutes and were clearly entertained and chuckling when the guys were arguing over who to talk to me as if I dont have fucking feelings like I'm not a fucking doll bro and and then when I go over they wanna act all nice and give me fist bumps and then immidetky tell Carson to say hi to me like bro... And then had the audacity to say ""sorry we were just inviting you to sit with us but they're.... "" like sybau don't put this on them they acted that way cause YOU provoked them to like you purposely did that to me cause you knew they would just for attention and to make yourself feel better I cried later on and my friends comforted me and they all said it wasn't my fault and stuff and i shouldn't feel embarrassed and we told our hope teacher (he's lowkey amazing with advice) and my english teacher told me she talked to them and stuff and she hugged me (i got so many hugs that day) and told me that its okay and that boys are just gonna be boys (im pretty sure katie and Wendy saw me crying cause they kept looking over). The next day my mom found out cause my english teacher at the time (love her btw) emailed her to check in on me (also reported the situation) but by then I was asleep and in the morning my mom called me downstairs and asked what happened, I told her but I was crying so she didnt understand anything but she told my dad what she could, my dad wanted to report it but I didnt want to cause I didnt wanna be seen as a snitch and stuff and my mom did tell my dad to not report it since I didn't want to and stuff, my dad got me chips and coffee and later on I found out my english teacher at the time did report it (idc tho) and the principal called me mom and asked her to ask me to call him. I did and My heart was RACING and I had to say my whole side of the story from what I knew which was basically nothing, i don't know what was said or anything (Note this down). The next day a few of the people from the grade above us (where the boys were, they were sophomores and we were freshman) and they told me that the girls got suspended and everyone was talking about it. (no shock there since this is a really small private school) and told me that one of the other guys (not the ones that was present during the thing) said the story and mentioned how I was crying. It was embarrassing af but he added me back on bereal later and my friend did mention that he wasn't saying anything bad just the story and that I was crying and that all the guys got sent to the office and the girls got suspended. Katie kept on adding me on bereal like. 15+ times and I kpe tunadding her and ignoring her when she'd say ""hi"" cause respectfully, at your big age why cant you apologize?

Fast forward to the last day of school (a month later) everyone was playing kickball, Carson was cheering me on and you could tell by his voice that he still felt really bad and stuff and I hate myself for not smiling at him or anything or atleast something cause I don't want him to think I was ever mad at him, I wasn't, he was the only guy who seemed like they cared out of the three of them. I just didnt let myself believe it cause I was delusional over him once back when I liked him and I only got hurt. The only reason I didn't smile ro say thank you as much as I wish I did was because I was still processing everything after. It won't get out of my head.

Near the end of summer break a friend and I were talking about this and I mentioned how Carson seemed like he felt bad and my friend told me that after the thing he told my friends that Wendy and Katie were messed up for doing that which confirmed it for me. I tried to send him a thank you thing but i think after he rejected me he blocked my number (I do not blame him for that he did the right thing, I rather him do that then lead me on).

I hate that I can't move on even tho everyone already has. I told my friend I wanted a clean slate with Katie too (Wendy left) and I tried. I prayed for it. A lot. And like I said, I can't get closure without answers or at least an genuine apology. I got neither. I do not know what was said about me and the apology i got was a lie. (I mean, wendy gave me an apology card and candy but it was clear her mom just made her and the card was referencing to the apology was a lie.) And my mind keeps going back to it. Like, sometimes I'm okay, i don't care. But then other days it won't get out of my head. The only time it didnt bother me was my birthday casue i told myself to not be petty towards anyone on my birthday (the best birthday ever tbh) and thats the only day it worked. But, I kinda have an idea.

Carson is talking to a girl rn and she is really sweet and stuff, i want to ask him about it and what was said about me so I can get closure for a situation that was never closed properly. My friends told me i should since I clearly need closure, one of them said I should leave it since it was last school year and he might have forgot (the thing is,that isn't something you forget every detail of so he must remember something that can give me the closure i need) but if it's really bothering me then go ahead. And it is. I want closure. I want to know everything. I'm just scared cause of my reputation of he thinks I like him since i have a reputation of liking a lot of guys, but he won't, right? I mean, the whole school knows who i like rn but whatever.

I need advice, and I was hoping to get some from here. Thank you for those who read to the end. Also... Are my feelings justified?

edit: I forgot to mention this but I will never wear a bow again. I wore a bow that day and cried like a child, and a bow is kind of childlike (in a good way) and I don't want to wear one again. I'm childlike enough as is.",1,1756647008.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1n4urj2,https://i.redd.it/23clnkrexcmf1.png,"Mindfulness in everyday tasks: small shifts, real gains","**TL;DR** Mindfulness doesn’t have to be a 30-minute sit. Bringing full attention to ordinary tasks—washing dishes, brushing your teeth, making coffee—can reduce negative affect, sharpen attention, and support emotion regulation. Short practices (even \~10 minutes) show measurable benefits, and longer-term practice is linked to brain changes in regions tied to learning, memory, and self-regulation. Practical how-tos and starter routines below, plus cautions and ways to track progress. ([PMC][1], [PubMed][2], [PNAS][3])

---

### Why everyday mindfulness works

“Informal” mindfulness—bringing awareness to what you’re already doing—has a solid research footprint. A randomized study found that mindfully washing dishes increased state mindfulness and positive affect while reducing negative affect, suggesting that even mundane chores can become effective practice. A broader review distinguishes informal from formal practice and shows both can contribute to well-being. For leaders and busy professionals, the takeaway is practical: you don’t need more time in the day, just different attention to the time you already have. ([SpringerLink][4], [PMC][5])

Short practices can help. A meta-analysis of *brief* mindfulness trainings (from single sessions up to two weeks) found small but reliable reductions in negative affect; a 2023 experiment comparing 10 vs. 20 minutes suggests benefits at both durations, with marginal dose differences. Translation—consistency beats length for most people starting out. ([PMC][1])

There’s also plausible neuroscience behind the subjective improvements. Longitudinal work shows increases in gray matter concentration after an 8-week MBSR program in areas involved in learning/memory and emotion regulation (including the hippocampus), while separate studies report white-matter changes after roughly 11 hours of training linked to self-regulatory networks. These findings don’t mean “instant rewiring,” but they do align with reports of better focus and steadier mood as practice accumulates. ([PMC][6], [PubMed][2], [PNAS][3])

---

### How to turn routine into practice

**Pick one anchor task for the day**
Choose something you already do: brushing your teeth, showering, making coffee, bed-making, a short walk, or even a single email triage block. Decide in advance that this is your mindful rep. If you forget and drift, that’s normal—returning your attention *is* the rep. For everyday integration ideas, Harvard Health’s guidance on “everyday mindfulness” is a clear, practical starting point. ([Harvard Health][7])

**Use a simple focus frame**
Try this three-step micro-protocol during the task:
• Notice sensory details—temperature, texture, scent, sound.
• Name what’s happening—“thinking,” “hearing,” “feeling”—then gently re-center.
• Keep attention broad enough to include breath and body posture.
This is consistent with the literature on informal practice: weaving mindful moments into existing routines. ([PMC][5])

**Insert mindful “bridges” between activities**
Before you switch contexts, pause for three slow breaths and scan for tension in your jaw/shoulders/hands. Then set a one-sentence intention for the next block, e.g., “One thing at a time.” It’s a pragmatic way to counter “autopilot” and multitasking drift that undermine focus. ([Harvard Health][7])

---

### A 7-day starter rotation you can repeat

Day 1 — Brush teeth with full attention to pressure, pace, taste, and arm movement.
Day 2 — Make coffee or tea slowly; attend to aroma, warmth, and first sip.
Day 3 — One sinkful of dishes as practice; notice contact with water and breath.
Day 4 — Five mindful minutes of walking; feel footfalls and cadence.
Day 5 — Mindful inbox: read and act on one message at a time, noticing urges to jump.
Day 6 — Bed-making as a “moving meditation,” attending to fabric, folds, and alignment.
Day 7 — Active listening in one conversation; aim to understand before responding.

Expect good days and messy ones. What matters is reps, not perfection. For a dishwashing-specific example and outcomes, see the randomized study referenced above. ([SpringerLink][4])

---

### How to know it’s working

Look for small, cumulative signals: slightly lower reactivity in a tense moment, a quicker recovery after an interruption, a touch more patience with a colleague or family member. If you like data, pick one brief, validated stress or mood scale and check in weekly; meta-analyses suggest you should expect *modest* early effects that compound with practice. ([PMC][8], [PubMed][9])

---

### Common pitfalls and adjustments

* **“I keep forgetting.”** Tie the practice to a cue that already happens—after you put coffee on the counter, during the first minute of your walk to the car, or when you open your inbox in the morning.
* **“I get bored.”** Widen the sensory frame and include breath + posture; boredom often signals a too-narrow focus.
* **“My mind races.”** That’s expected. Label “thinking,” then return to the task. Repetitions build attentional control.
* **“I don’t have time.”** You’re not adding tasks—just changing *how* you do one. Evidence suggests even brief practices can be helpful. ([PMC][1])

If you have a history of trauma or certain mental health conditions, proceed gently and consider guidance from a qualified clinician or teacher—mindfulness can surface difficult material for some people, and support matters. ([PMC][8])

---

### Discussion prompts

* What everyday task feels like the best entry point for you this week?
* If you’ve tried this before, what helped you stay consistent?
* Are there work routines—stand-ups, one-on-ones, code reviews, clinical rounds, shift handoffs—where “one-thing-at-a-time” attention noticeably changes outcomes?

If you’re reading this on a weekend, take it as your reminder to log off for a bit and give one small mindful task your full attention. See how Monday feels after that.

Online games have been around for decades, but in 2025 they are still one of the most dominant forms of digital entertainment. From massive MMORPGs with millions of players to small free browser-based experiences you can play during a coffee break, online games shape how we spend our free time, how we socialize, and even how we measure personal achievement.

I’ve been playing online games since the early 2000s, when browser-based Flash games were all the rage, and now, in 2025, I still find myself discovering unique gems that manage to stand out in an oversaturated market. One of those games is **Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads**, and today I want to explore not only why this game is worth your time, but also why the phenomenon of free online games continues to thrive.

This is going to be a long read (around 5000 words), but if you’re passionate about online gaming, grab a drink and let’s dive deep.

# The Everlasting Appeal of Online Games

Online games capture something unique: the ability to instantly connect with fun, competition, and community. Unlike single-player console games that require large downloads, physical media, or expensive hardware, online games are accessible. They’re usually free-to-play, often available on both PC and mobile, and you can jump in within seconds.

In 2025, the online gaming landscape is diverse:

* **Casual online games** like puzzle titles, racing games, or zombie survival runs are played by people of all ages.
* **Competitive online games** such as MOBAs, battle royales, and FPS titles dominate esports and streaming.
* **Social online games** like Among Us, Fall Guys, or Roblox continue to show us that fun is more about who you play with than the graphics on screen.

The keyword here is *online*. No matter where you are, you can log in, connect with other players, and share experiences. That’s something that traditional offline games, no matter how advanced, can’t fully replicate.

# Free Online Games in 2025 – More Relevant Than Ever

Back in the day, we had Miniclip, Kongregate, ArmorGames, and dozens of portals full of Flash games. With Flash gone, many thought free browser-based gaming was dead. But HTML5 and Unity changed the story. Now, websites and indie developers can publish fully functional online games that run smoothly on any device.

Free online games today offer:

* **Accessibility** – no downloads, no complicated installations.
* **Cross-platform fun** – play on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
* **Constant updates** – devs can tweak gameplay and fix bugs instantly.
* **Community-driven growth** – streamers and Redditors often “discover” small games and make them go viral.

And among all the countless titles, *Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads* is a shining example of how even a simple concept can become addictive when executed well.

# Spotlight on Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads

So what is *Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads*?

It’s a voxel-style driving game developed by **Brinemedia**, where your goal is simple but exhilarating: drive through apocalyptic landscapes, crush zombies, collect fuel, and upgrade your vehicles to survive increasingly challenging runs.

What makes it special?

1. **Voxel/Blocky Graphics** – It feels like a mix between Minecraft aesthetics and Mad Max gameplay. The colorful blocky style makes it lighthearted while still delivering intense action.
2. **Simple but Addictive Gameplay** – Drive, shoot, and survive. Each run feels rewarding because you earn currency to upgrade your ride.
3. **Variety of Cars** – From small buggies to massive armored trucks, each vehicle has unique strengths.
4. **Replayability** – The more you play, the more upgrades you unlock, which makes you want “just one more run.”

It’s not trying to compete with AAA zombie games like *The Last of Us* or *Dying Light*. Instead, it’s about fun, fast-paced, bite-sized sessions.

# Why Zombie Games Work So Well Online

Zombies have always been a staple of gaming. From *Resident Evil* to *Left 4 Dead*, we can’t get enough of blasting hordes of the undead. But why do zombie games, especially online ones, have such an impact?

* **Endless Enemies** – Zombies give developers an excuse to throw hundreds of enemies at you without worrying about realism.
* **Survival Fantasy** – Everyone loves the idea of surviving an apocalypse with just their skills and a cool car.
* **Replay Value** – Each run feels different. Sometimes you get lucky with upgrades, sometimes you struggle – that unpredictability is part of the fun.

For online players, zombies also mean competition: who can last longer, who can kill more, who can survive the longest run.

# Tips & Strategies for Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads

If you’re planning to play, here are some strategies I’ve picked up:

1. **Fuel First** – Without fuel, you won’t last long. Prioritize upgrades to increase your tank.
2. **Balance Weapons and Armor** – Don’t go all-in on one upgrade. A balanced car is much more effective.
3. **Learn the Terrain** – Each map has bumps, jumps, and tricky spots. Knowing when to accelerate and when to conserve fuel is crucial.
4. **Don’t Fear Restarting** – Runs are meant to be short. Embrace the cycle: earn, upgrade, try again.

# Comparing with Other Popular Online Games

Of course, *Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads* is not the only online game worth playing in 2025. Let’s see how it compares:

* **Versus Subway Surfers** – Both are endless-runner style games, but Zombie Derby adds combat and destruction.
* **Versus Crossy Road** – Crossy Road is iconic for casual fun, but Zombie Derby gives a more intense, apocalyptic vibe.
* **Versus Roblox/Minecraft Minigames** – While those platforms are massive, Zombie Derby offers a polished, focused experience without distractions.

It doesn’t try to be everything — it just does one thing very well: car + zombies + survival.

# The Community Side of Online Games

One of the best things about online games is sharing them. On Reddit, YouTube, or Discord, players swap strategies, brag about high scores, and recommend games to each other.

That’s exactly why I’m writing this post — not just to review Zombie Derby, but to highlight why **free online games still matter in 2025**. They’re the kind of experiences you can share with a friend in seconds:

* “Hey, check out this zombie driving game.”
* Send a link.
* They’re playing in under a minute.

That immediacy keeps the culture of online gaming alive.

# Final Thoughts – Why You Should Play Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads

In a world where big studios dominate with billion-dollar franchises, it’s refreshing to see indie developers create games that are simple, fun, and instantly accessible. *Zombie Derby: Blocky Roads* doesn’t need to be an AAA blockbuster. It just needs to deliver satisfying zombie-crushing action — and it does.

If you love **online games**, if you grew up on browser-based fun, or if you just want a quick way to kill time while killing zombies, this game deserves your attention.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Taylor Fritz vs. Tomas Machac: A US Open Showdown of Power, Precision, and Perseverance**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis clash that’s like a high-stakes game of Jenga—unstable, unpredictable, and likely to end with someone yelling “*I didn’t touch that!*” as the tower collapses. Fourth-seeded American Taylor Fritz, armed with a cannon of a serve and a résumé that includes three Grand Slam quarterfinals this year, faces Czech underdog Tomas Machac, a player whose recent form is as reliable as a WiFi connection in a subway tunnel. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed librarian and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had too much coffee.

### The Numbers Game: Fritz’s Edge, Machac’s Spark

Fritz enters this match as the clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.36** (implying a **73.5% implied probability** of victory). Machac, meanwhile, is priced at **3.1** (a **32.3% chance**), reflecting his 4-16 career record against top-10 players. Fritz’s 25-9 hard-court record this year dwarfs Machac’s 17-7, and their head-to-head is lopsided: Fritz leads 2-0, including a 2020 French Open win after Machac retired due to injury.

Statistically, Fritz is a machine on serve, winning **84% of first-serve points** and blasting **20 aces** in his last match. His 55 winners suggest he can dominate rallies, though his **31 unforced errors** hint at occasional turbulence. Machac, on the other hand, has been a model of efficiency in the US Open, not losing a set and hitting **39 winners** in his three matches. His 78% first-serve success rate is solid, but Fritz’s serve is the kind of weapon that makes you wonder if he’s secretly a superhero named *Sir Ace-a-Lot*.

### The News: Injuries, Form, and a Dash of Drama

Fritz, the home favorite, has been a Flushing Meadows regular, reaching the quarters here in recent years. His recent five-set thriller against qualifier Jerome Kym proved he can withstand press

1n4upud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4upud,WGU Health & Wellness Nutrition D440 2025 New OA 1st Attempt,"OMG you guys!!! I just finished my Health & Wellness Nutrition D440 assessment and I AM OVER THE MOON!!! 🥳 Got a 99% conversion score (1230 HESI) and I'm literally doing my happy dance right now! For anyone prepping for this course in 2025, I put together all my study notes that SAVED ME!

# 💪 How I Conquered This Beast 💪

First off, this new OA is NO JOKE! But with the right study strategy, you can totally nail it! Here's what worked for me:

# 🩸 Iron-Deficiency Anemia (This was a HUGE topic!)

* Non-heme iron heroes: spinach, beans, lentils (plant power, baby!)
* Absorption boosters: Vitamin C is your BFF! I made flash cards pairing iron foods with C foods
* Did you know coffee and tea can block iron absorption? I cut back during study weeks!
* Pro tip: Remember that heme iron (meat sources) absorbs WAY better than non-heme (plant sources)

# 📊 Glycemic Index (Questions EVERYWHERE about this)

* Low GI (<55): Slow-release carbs = happy blood sugar 🥦
* High GI (>70): Spike city! 🍭
* When counseling patients about GI, remember it's about EDUCATION not just telling them what to eat
* They love scenario questions where you have to pick appropriate counseling responses!

# ⚖️ Weight Management (So many scenarios!)

* Patient-centered approach is KEY – they want to see you respecting autonomy
* Know the difference between advising vs. educating vs. referring
* Lots of questions on appropriate nursing interventions for different weight goals

# 🍼 Life Stage Nutrition (Easy points if you know this!)

* Pregnancy needs: folate (600 mcg), iron (27 mg), calcium (1000-1300 mg)
* Kids/teens: calcium for those growing bones!
* Older adults: B12 absorption issues, vitamin D needs

# 📝 Sample Questions I Saw

One question was almost IDENTICAL to the practice exam:

>

The key was recognizing that the client misunderstood what GI actually measures! The correct answer focused on clarifying the purpose of GI while supporting his weight loss goals.

Another tricky one:

>

They wanted you to select foods with both iron AND vitamin C for absorption!

# 🔥 Last-Minute Review Tips 🔥

1. Focus on NURSING ACTIONS - they care about what YOU would DO, not just what you know
2. Review the rationales when you practice - understanding WHY an answer is right/wrong saved me!
3. Don't skip the fundamentals - basic nutrition principles are woven throughout
4. Practice time management - I had plenty of time but some questions are LONG scenarios

I found some amazing resources at [https://rnstudentresources.com](https://rnstudentresources.com/) that helped me organize all this info! They have study guides that really aligned with the new 2025 OA format!

An hour or so before I start feeling really strange, I can’t describe it but something just feels “off” in my body. I then start feeling disconnected from myself, and my vision feels like I’m looking at things but not SEEING them, like everything is blurring and I’m not taking in what my eyes are seeing. I feel more dizzy then normal and start over heating, by this point I am struck with the worst wave of impending doom, in my head I am telling myself it’s okay and to be calm, but no matter what I can’t stop this wave of fear from hitting me, almost like my system is forcing me to be scared even tho my thoughts are telling me it’s okay. It’s the strangest thing. Then the shaking and staring of into the distance happens, not violent shaking like people genuinely associate with a seizure, lighter twitches almost, and I’m just staring of into space and now can’t talk or form a proper thought. During this bit I also am struggling to breath, then I start calming down, for a while after I feel a bit shaky and twitchy like someone who’s had way to much coffee, I also get chills and feel incredibly cold for a bit. I can feel something wrong in my body for about an hour to 2 hours before it happens, the actual episode itself is no longer than 10 minutes. 

And no it is not a panic attack. I have had panic and anxiety attacks before, this is NOTHING at all like it, completely different. The first time this happened I hadn’t been diagnosed with pots and went to the hospital. They told me it was a panic attack but they also blamed all my pots symptoms on anxiety when I’ve always known it wasn’t and it was something physically wrong, same goes for this. 

Is this an absent seizure? could it be a non epileptic seizure? I’ve been in a flair up for a few months now and the stress that’s caused my body could have built up and triggered it. Does anyone else get this? ",2,1756646426.0,POTS,2,1.0,False

So, I started IF again 11 days ago. I have already lost 4lbs. I'm aiming for 100 days and see how much I can accomplish.

I don't follow a singular scheme, I alternate between 20:4 with an OMAD, 18:6, and sometimes I just fast. It's a bit of a problem because at the ripe age of 32 years I still live with my parents because of health issues and they're commenting a bit too much saying that ""I don't eat"" (but this is a very long story, they're not exactly helpful) even when I'm literally eating in front of them.

This is how it goes, in general (I'm trying to find a reasonable order as I go):

\- **20:4 with OMAD** (most used if I stay at home): bread or rice, lean proteins, vegetables, fruit;  
\- **18:6:** one or two protein bars for breaking the fast + a tasty dinner (similar to OMAD but without fruit and rice, often is the solution when I'm out with friends);  
\- **fast means I go over 20 or 24 hours** and eat without following specific rules (no binge of course).  
In the meantime I take collagen, prebiotics and electrolytes. When I'm not eating I drink coffee, water, or water with lemon.  
I walk a lot most of the days and I also do some yoga and/or barre workout from time to time.

I'm not asking for advices or opinions, I've been struggling with emotional eating since my pet died and this is the only thing that's helping me. It's embarrassing to say but... I've been having a very brutal week and I'd like to get some positivity my way, for once. It would really mean a lot now.

so we had a pep rally, and these two popular girls (who had a LARGE reputation of being pick mes and putting other girls down and embarrassing them for attention from boys Wendy did it many times to me and it honestly got worse each time and I never confronted her cause she was the type to quickly talk bad and start stuff and i just didn't want drama and all i ever wanted was to be her friend but she only ever talked to me when it benefitted her..) named katie and wendy, they were sitting behind 3 boys (they were a year older), names Braxton, Carson, and Christan (christian being my crush at the time and wendy KNEW that and knowing her from past experiences i know she told them) and i saw Wendy and Katie continuously call me over and the boys started arguing with each other over smth (clearly planning on flirting/talking to me as a joke. also wendy and katie kept pointing to random guys of the three and giving me a thumbs up and during this whole thing they all kept looking over at me and stuff) and then after like 10 minutes i finally went and sat and braxton moved  and I sat behind him and the girls wanna start acting like we are friends giving me fist bumps even though they would act embarrassed of me all the time before and would clearly find me very weird and they IMMEDIATELY told Carson to say hi or something to me and Carson like moved over to directly behind Braxton (we were on like bleachers and Braxton moved to like the gapn thing between the seats so carson could be directly behind him or smth) to like make room for me to sit next to Christan or whatever and gave him a look and christan quickly told him to come back and then  after awhile of awkward, uncomfortable ass silence Wendy and Katie told me i can go back if i want to and i went back cause it was just uncomfortable and embarrassing and then my english teacher at the time saw the whole thing (the whole school was in the gym btw so everyone saw) and then she was giving me a look, like she was giving a comforting look to tell me it was okay and kept giving it to me and my friend asked me if i was okay and i said yeah and i felt embarrassed and i did see Carson look over at me but it wasnt with that annoying playfulness again it looked like concern but tbh i doubted it i didnt wanna be delusional (note this later on) after the pep rally thing after carson looked at me with concern and stuff cause I was on the verge of fucking tears, they came to me and the lied. They said they were just inviting me to sit with them and said and I quote ""but they are...."" like girl NO. Do not even lie. it's so clear what you were doing. the fact they lied when it was so obvious what they were doing. They weren't just inviting me to sit with them. They never did. They had a history of being pick mes and putting girls down for male validation and willow only talked to me when it benefited her, like, she wasn't nice to me at all until she had no body else to hang out with. They pointed at guys and gave me a thumbs up and called me over repeated it for like 10 minutes and were clearly entertained and chuckling when the guys were arguing over who to talk to me as if I dont have fucking feelings like I'm not a fucking doll bro and and then when I go over they wanna act all nice and give me fist bumps and then immidetky tell Carson to say hi to me like bro... And then had the audacity to say ""sorry we were just inviting you to sit with us but they're.... "" like sybau don't put this on them they acted that way cause YOU provoked them to like you purposely did that to me cause you knew they would just for attention and to make yourself feel better I cried later on and my friends comforted me and they all said it wasn't my fault and stuff and i shouldn't feel embarrassed and we told our hope teacher (he's lowkey amazing with advice) and my english teacher told me she talked to them and stuff and she hugged me (i got so many hugs that day) and told me that its okay and that boys are just gonna be boys (im pretty sure katie and Wendy saw me crying cause they kept looking over). The next day my mom found out cause my english teacher at the time (love her btw) emailed her to check in on me (also reported the situation) but by then I was asleep and in the morning my mom called me downstairs and asked what happened, I told her but I was crying so she didnt understand anything but she told my dad what she could, my dad wanted to report it but I didnt want to cause I didnt wanna be seen as a snitch and stuff and my mom did tell my dad to not report it since I didn't want to and stuff, my dad got me chips and coffee and later on I found out my english teacher at the time did report it (idc tho) and the principal called me mom and asked her to ask me to call him. I did and My heart was RACING and I had to say my whole side of the story from what I knew which was basically nothing, i don't know what was said or anything (Note this down).  The next day a few of the people from the grade above us (where the boys were, they were sophomores and we were freshman) and they told me that the girls got suspended and everyone was talking about it. (no shock there since this is a really small private school) and told me that one of the other guys (not the ones that was present during the thing) said the story and mentioned how I was crying. It was embarrassing af but he added me back on bereal later and my friend did mention that he wasn't saying anything bad just the story and that I was crying and that all the guys got sent to the office and the girls got suspended. Katie kept on adding me on bereal like. 15+ times and I kpe tunadding her and ignoring her when she'd say ""hi"" cause respectfully, at your big age why cant you apologize?

Fast forward to the last day of school (a month later) everyone was playing kickball, Carson was cheering me on and you could tell by his voice that he still felt really bad and stuff and I hate myself for not smiling at him or anything or atleast something cause I don't want him to think I was ever mad at him, I wasn't, he was the only guy who seemed like they cared out of the three of them. I just didnt let myself believe it cause I was delusional over him once back when I liked him and I only got hurt. The only reason I didn't smile ro say thank you as much as I wish I did was because I was still processing everything after. It won't get out of my head.

Near the end of summer break a friend and I were talking about this and I mentioned how Carson seemed like he felt bad and my friend told me that after the thing he told my friends that Wendy and Katie were messed up for doing that which confirmed it for me. I tried to send him a thank you thing but i think after he rejected me he blocked my number (I do not blame him for that he did the right thing, I rather him do that then lead me on).

I hate that I can't move on even tho everyone already has. I told my friend I wanted a clean slate with Katie too (Wendy left) and I tried. I prayed for it. A lot. And like I said, I can't get closure without answers or at least an genuine apology. I got neither. I do not know what was said about me and the apology i got was a lie. (I mean, wendy gave me an apology card and candy but it was clear her mom just made her and the card was referencing to the apology was a lie.) And my mind keeps going back to it. Like, sometimes I'm okay, i don't care. But then other days it won't get out of my head. The only time it didnt bother me was my birthday casue i told myself to not be petty towards anyone on my birthday (the best birthday ever tbh) and thats the only day it worked. But, I kinda have an idea.

Carson is talking to a girl rn and she is really sweet and stuff, i want to ask him about it and what was said about me so I can get closure for a situation that was never closed properly. My friends told me i should since I clearly need closure, one of them said I should leave it since it was last school year and he might have forgot (the thing is,that isn't something you forget every detail of so he must remember something that can give me the closure i need) but if it's really bothering me then go ahead.  And it is. I want closure. I want to know everything. I'm just scared cause of my reputation of he thinks I like him since i have a reputation of liking a lot of guys, but he won't, right? I mean, the whole school knows who i like rn but whatever.

I need advice, and I was hoping to get some from here. Thank you for those who read to the end.

Two big boxes full of different items, ranging from used household electronics to souvenirs clothes and blankets. Nothing posh or uber expensive, just didn't fit in our suitcases. DHL and others were simply too expensive, and this cost us about 1000 dirhams. Both were 25kg boxes of personal items. 

We opened our parcels and were shocked. Plastic folders cut through with a knife. Everything that was neatly packed and wrapped in bubble wrap cut through and rummaged through. Sealed boxes force opened, torn or cut through. Glasses and cups that were wrapped in bubble wrap opened and thrown back inside like they are junk - completely shattered glass. It is as if people just rummaged through our belongings, vandalised them, looking for something of value. Due to mishandling many things broke or were chipped/bent on arrival. We had to throw away otherwise normal stuff we could have used for ages. Inexpensive things like books and blankets left untouched. 

Worst of all. A used coffee machine that cost 600 AED was just stolen. Unopened Dior cologne - stolen. Other small things that looked shiny or expensive enough to sell - stolen. Whatever wasn't worth attention was mishandled or opened and thrown back inside. Some metal tins were literally opened, emptied completely and thrown on top of everything - someone literally took whatever was inside. All we know is that we packed everything very neatly, and that shipping itinerary mentions a coffee machine and cologne that was not in the parcel when it arrived sealed with EMS tape. 

The parcels were not opened by customs of either country - otherwise they would have left a note of what they inspected or took out and re-sealed them. But our posessions were simply vandalised by Emirates Post workers. We are shocked and appaled by this, obviosuly there is no chance of getting any compensation or apology. These items are lost now and the damage has been done. 

Just warning any leaving expats or anyone - don’t use Emirates post for things you value, because you never know what might happen.

I just got my first road bike and I’m super excited to start riding! Since I’m still kind of a newbie, I’m currently looking at 2-4h rides, in the city but also on the Jersey Shore and in the 9W area. 

The bike itself was a somewhat big expense, so I’m wondering — what are the absolute necessities and what can wait? 

More specifically, I have a helmet, but it’s one of those collapsible ones that many people use for citibikes (https://a.co/d/gaHevB4), so I’m thinking I need a new one, ideally with MIPS pretty soon. But would this one work for a couple rides? And how urgent are cycling glasses?

What I also just got is padded shorts, two used jerseys, and a bottle cage (just one though, probably need a second one soon). I have a mount for my phone but would want to upgrade to a cycling computer eventually. 

I think I’ll get a lock too but I’m not sure how urgent it is (and which kind). This would be just for small breaks, I would prefer not to leave my bike unattended at all but I’m not sure how many coffee shops etc will allow me to bring it inside. How do you all handle this? 

Anything I’m forgetting? Thank you all in advance!

1n4ughh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n4ughh/questions_i_should_have_asked_sooner_about_the/,Questions I should have asked sooner about the BBE [Sage/Breville Barista Express],"Hi Espresso-Community,

I have been a quiet reader for a few days now.

I have a Sage Barista Express (=Breville), I am using on and off. I recently picked the dialling in process back up and a few questions occurred:

1. Does the Program-Butten for 1 and 2 Cups (shot length) reset when I unplug the machine?
2. Does programming the 1 Cup button affect the time of the 2 Cup Button? (I think, no?)
3. Does the grinder grind x amount of beans for single filter and exactly the double amount for the double filter? I am using the single filter for dialling in to not waste as many beans.
4. If I dial in with the single filter, can I use the same grind size for the double filter and adjust the yield via the program button? Or does the slanted anatomy ( I mean this \\\_/ vs this I\_I but don’t know how it is called) of the single filter brew different than the more straight double filter?
5. Do you get very inconsistent grind amount from the grinder? I always put in 9g premeasured beans and also have a thing similar to this...

[https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/de\/listing\/1094914709\/silikonbalg-fur-breville-sage-barista?ls=r&external=1&rec\_type=ss&ref=landingpage\_similar\_listing\_top-1&sts=1&content\_source=1329093401df745f28754b596a7de983&#37;253A05967e62a5780f640c3db6fda460db2c7116142d&logging\_key=1329093401df745f28754b596a7de983&#37;3A05967e62a5780f640c3db6fda460db2c7116142d](https://preview.redd.it/nf8nif6ttcmf1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=d604475e47ba277371c4c11c6907c9443243e197)

... to blow out as much of my freshly ground coffee at each go. I know the best thing to do would be to upgrade the grinder, but I am not in a financial place to do so just now. Are there any tips to get more consistent results in the meantime?

7. For grinding single doses, I set the grind amount wheel to the max. Is it a problem to have the grinder running empty for a second (during which I blow out the rest of the coffee with the thing mentioned above) before I stop it manually?

I could try to find answers to question 1, 2 and 3 by just trying it out but I am already wasting a lot of good/expensive beans (local German roastery, Espresso blend, I think a dark roast but in only says “kräftig” on their website which translates to something like “strong”)

 

I appreciate you taking time to answer my questions and apologise for any mistakes as English is not my first language.

I have been financing myself since last 4-5 years. I take very little to no money from home (My family has an unstable financial situation). My income source is through tuitions. What I earn in a month goes by in a blink, food, rent, bills and especially on transportation. I dropped out of uni as it was becoming a burden on my family. I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangouts, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I’m very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through the last two months (June, July). 

To be financially independent and to pay for my own tuition fees, I want to start a business asap, a tea/coffee/juice stall at an area with high foot traffic in Dhaka. 

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of 800 USDT/USDC, which I can repay in 3 months time with interest (rates can be set by lender). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life. 

I will be deleting this post soon, it's actually very embarrassing for me to be asking like this but I currently have no one who can help me with this matter.

Whoever is genuinely interested in helping me, please message me, I will elaborate my situation and share my business plan.

1n4u98j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1n4u98j/could_the_best_electric_kettle_be_the_breville/,Could the best electric kettle be the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe,"Breville BKE845BSS is a stylish and functional addition to my kitchen. With its brushed stainless steel finish, it immediately impressed me with its sleek and modern design. Standing out as more than just your average electric kettle, it has features that cater to tea and coffee lovers alike. At first glance, it’s clear this isn't some basic water-boiling appliance—it’s designed for those who take their hot beverages seriously.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right off the bat, the aesthetic appeal caught my attention. The brushed stainless steel finish provides a premium and durable feel, making it look right at home alongside my other upscale kitchen gadgets. It’s not just a pretty face either; its sturdy construction reassures me that it’s built to last. The dimensions are well thought out, making it compact enough to fit on the countertop without taking up too much space, yet large enough to hold 7 cups—perfect for big tea drinkers like me or when entertaining guests.

Breville designed the kettle with usability in mind. The handle is ergonomic, ensuring a comfortable grip even when the kettle is filled to the brim. And the hinged lid operates seamlessly, opening softly to prevent any accidental steam burns. That soft opening lid is a tiny detail, but it makes a surprisingly big difference in safety and convenience.

**Temperature Control Features**

This is where the electric kettle truly shines. Its five temperature settings, each tailored for different tea types and French press coffee, elevated the brewing experience for me. No more guessing or experimenting with water temperatures—this kettle took care of it for me. I’ve brewed black tea, green tea, and even Oolong with perfect results every time. Each setting ensures the water heats to the precise temperature needed to bring out the full flavor and quality of the tea leaves or coffee grounds.

It’s impossible to describe how satisfying it is to know your cup of tea or coffee has been brewed under optimal conditions. The one-touch, pre-programmed buttons make using the kettle a breeze. It’s basically foolproof—press a button, and it does the work.

**Perks**

- The pre-set temperature options ensure brewing perfection for black, green, white, and Oolong teas, as well as French press coffee.
- The soft-open lid prevents steam burns and water splashing—much safer for chaotic early mornings.
- The keep-warm function holds the water at the ideal temperature for up to 20 minutes, which is perfect for someone like me who always forgets about their kettle.
- A cordless jug and 360° base add convenience, making it easy to carry and pour water anywhere in the kitchen.

[Check Breville BKE845BSS price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)

**Performance**

The water heats up quickly thanks to its 1500W power. I noticed that it boiled water faster than my old kettle, saving precious minutes on busy mornings. This performance difference is noticeable if you’re someone like me who depends on several cups of tea to survive the workday. The kettle operates quietly—no annoying loud boiling sounds—which is a plus for when I’m up early and trying not to wake the household.

During everyday use, its keep-warm button became a lifesaver. Before, I’d constantly reheat water, but thanks to this nifty feature, I could enjoy my cup at the perfect temperature without rushing. Over time, you start to appreciate details like this.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- It’s slightly heavier than basic electric kettles, making it a bit less portable for younger kids or elderly relatives to handle.
- The price point may put it out of some budgets, particularly if you’re used to basic kettles without the bells and whistles.
- Cleaning the stainless steel surface can be challenging as fingerprints and water stains appear quickly.
- While the keep-warm feature is handy, it only lasts for 20 minutes—longer durations would’ve been ideal for forgetful tea drinkers like me.

**Other Options**

Comparing this kettle to simpler models or even high-end ones from competing brands, it genuinely holds its ground. Basic kettles like those from Hamilton Beach or Cuisinart offer functional water boiling but lack the temperature settings and precise control Breville offers. On the other hand, premium kettles from competitors such as Smeg or Fellow Stagg might rival Breville in aesthetics but tend to come at a significantly higher price without offering four or five temperature presets. I also checked out a model from KitchenAid, which had decent features but a much bulkier and less elegant design.

What sets this kettle apart is that balance between usability, style, and intelligent features. Breville managed to create something practical yet stylish, without feeling overly complicated.

**True Value**

Is the Breville BKE845BSS worth the investment? I’d say it depends on how serious you are about your tea or coffee game. For casual drinkers, a simpler, cheaper option might suffice. But for anyone who appreciates brewed beverages crafted under just the right conditions, this kettle is a treasure. While it may sit at a higher price point compared to standard electric kettles, you’re getting significant added features and a high-quality build that justify the cost.

I have an opportunity to buy a GS3 which served in a showroom. The seller claims it's as good as new. The price of that would be roughly 3800 EUR, very close to a new Micra machine.  What would you recommend? Is it worth getting a used GS3 for home at the same price point, or just go for a new Micra machine?

I'm a starter in coffee making, but I learn fast and I love manual adjustments. We usually pour 8-10 coffees per day. I don't mind the boiling time, or the waste of water, etc. Just want to get the best coffee experience there is.

I am struggling not to reach out and write to her. But my heart is yearning for contact and to revive the friendship.


The usual - instant deep connection with a friend. Thought it would be different this time around. That she would be in my life for a while. We had similar values and experiences in life. She said she wanted the same thing as me like an active friendship and frequent communication. 

I expressed (and still do) that I want active friendships. Not the “let’s get a coffee and each have a monologue to summarize the last 3 months of our lives”. My goal is to have actual new memories and do things and go to events. 

Realized I was the one putting most of the effort. The messages. The initiating of hangout or phone call. She is caught up in her own crises of life, work, and money. Still is. Her reasoning; “My mental health isn’t good. I can’t message or talk to you or anyone.”

Ok. I stepped back to not be a burden. Before that, I expressed my desire to help and even did things like calls, send a small gift, listening to her for 1 or 2 hours. But it became unequal. I stopped all of that to see if she would step up and start initiating. No. Nothing. 
So I have been letting the friendship fade. No fight or argument. Just the slow fade. 

the saying “if they want to, they will” is so true. She has time to post on social media and make content, but zero time for me. I’m not priority. And ok it is how it is. But the desire to write on the monumental day was burning. 

I wonder if I will regret not reaching out. This person was like a sibling. But I also know writing and waiting for a response may open a wound and leave me tender and not enough. 

I can only hope this same day next year will be less raw and heavy. And maybe she won’t even be a thought. So my focus is less on who I wish she and our friendship could be, and more the reality of what little it is.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Spell “Lehecka” Without a Spellchecker*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like we’re back in Mrs. Johnson’s 7th-grade math class (but with better coffee). The bookmakers have Jiri Lehecka as a near-75% favorite across the board, with decimal odds hovering around **1.32-1.35** (implying Lehecka needs to win \~77% of the time to justify the line). Adrian Mannarino, the 37-year-old French veteran, is a **3.2-3.45** underdog, translating to a **29-31% implied win probability**. For context, Mannarino’s odds are about the same as me correctly spelling “Lehecka” without Googling it three times.

The spread favors Lehecka **-4.5 games**, suggesting bookmakers expect a relatively straightforward victory. The total games line sits at **38.5**, meaning this could be a grueling three-setter or a clean sweep—depending on whether Mannarino’s “resurgence” includes rediscovering his first serve.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Quirks, and a Side of Absurdity**  
Adrian Mannarino’s resume is equal parts grit and chaos. The 37-year-old Frenchman has defied Father Time (and his own forgetfulness) to reach the US Open round of 16. Per the Adnkronos report, Mannarino’s **notable habit of not knowing his opponent until 20 minutes before a match** has somehow worked in his favor—so far. Imagine showing up to a job interview without knowing the role. Now imagine doing it in front of 20,000 people. That’s Mannarino’s career in microcosm.

On the plus side, he’s riding a lucky break after Ben Shelton’s withdrawal and has already beaten players like Thijs van den Berg and James Duckworth. However, his age and recent “complicated period” (read: inconsistent form) raise questions about sustainability.

Jiri Lehecka, meanwhile, is the definition of a “dark horse” with a capital *D*. The 21-year-old Czech has stormed through the bracket, knocking off higher

Like, you’re telling me people are genuinely upset about shitholes becoming clean and functioning neighborhoods? Really?

“Oh no, they cleaned up all the drug dealers and addicts! Oh no, there are nice restaurants and safe streets now! Oh no, property values went up and my neighborhood isn’t a crime-ridden wasteland anymore! This is terrible!”

What exactly are you missing about the old neighborhood? The constant sirens? The boarded-up windows? The fact that you couldn’t walk to the corner store without watching your back? The needles in the playground?

I grew up in a “pre-gentrified” area and it fucking sucked. Nobody chose to live there - we lived there because we couldn’t afford anywhere better. The moment anyone in my family got enough money, they moved the hell out as fast as possible.

Now that same neighborhood has coffee shops, functioning streetlights, and kids can actually play outside safely. But apparently this is bad because… reasons?

“It displaces long-term residents!” Yeah, it also displaces drug dealers and criminals. Sometimes displacement is good, actually.

“It’s cultural erasure!” The culture of what, exactly? Poverty? Crime? Broken windows and liquor stores on every corner?

The people complaining about gentrification are either:

1. People who never actually lived in these neighborhoods when they were shitty
1. Landlords mad that they can’t rent slums anymore
1. Criminals upset that their territory got cleaned up

Nobody who actually lived through the “authentic” version of these neighborhoods is sitting around missing the good old days when everything was falling apart.

*A story of fate, quiet love, and moments that make you believe in destiny.*

# 🌤️ 1. Weekend Nostalgia

It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.

Dhaval sat on the couch, a warm cup of chai in hand, lazily flipping through his old college trip photos. Anamika, his wife of four years, was in the kitchen humming an old song, unaware of what was about to unfold.

They had an arranged marriage — no long dating phase, no college romance, just two strangers who chose to build a life together. And somehow, they made it work. Long drives, late-night talks, and shared silences had turned them into best friends over the years.

But what Dhaval saw that day would change everything he believed about “chance.”

# 📸 2. The Photo Frame of Fate

Click. Click. Swipe.

He paused.

One photo from his Udaipur college trip caught his eye — a random group photo in front of the City Palace. It wasn’t the palace or his college friends that made him freeze.

It was her.

Blurred, in the background, almost hidden behind a group of tourists — stood a girl in a yellow kurta. She wasn’t posing. She was just walking past.

But he knew that face.  
That smile.  
That walk.

It was Anamika.  
His wife.

# 🪞 3. Destiny in a Snapshot

He stared at the photo in disbelief.

How was this possible?  
They had never met before marriage. Or so he thought.

And yet — here she was, captured in a photo from seven years ago, when they were both college students, unknown to each other.

He rushed to the kitchen.

“Anamika! Come here, you need to see this.”

She wiped her hands and walked over.  
He pointed to the photo.

“Look closely. Isn’t that… you?”

She squinted.

Her eyes widened. A small gasp escaped her lips.  
“Yes… that’s me! Oh my God, that is me. I had gone to Udaipur with my friends around that time.”

Silence.

They both looked at each other.  
Smiled.  
And then burst into laughter — the kind that comes from pure joy and quiet wonder.

# 🌠 4. When Something Is Meant to Be

They sat together for hours that day, looking through more photos, sipping tea, and talking about the strange, beautiful coincidence that had always lived in their past — quietly waiting to be discovered.

That photo became more than just a frozen moment.  
It became a reminder.

A reminder that when something is meant for you, it will find its way to you —  
in a city you don’t remember,  
in a frame you didn’t notice,  
in a person you were yet to fall in love with.

Sometimes, destiny doesn’t knock on your door loudly.  
It whispers, hides in pixels, and waits — patiently — for the day you’ll finally see it.

# 🌄 5. Udaipur — Again, but Together

A week later, they were walking hand-in-hand near the same City Palace, this time as husband and wife.

It wasn’t a lavish trip — just two people reliving a strange twist of fate. They took selfies near the spot where the original photo had been clicked. Laughed again. Talked for hours over lakeside coffee. Shared new memories in a place that had unknowingly started their story years ago.

They even recreated that blurry photo — this time, intentionally — smiling directly into the lens.

That night, over dinner, Dhaval said, “It’s like the universe left us a trail — and we finally followed it.”

Anamika nodded, eyes glowing. “We were always meant to find each other. This… was just proof.”

They ended the night planning a weekend movie and dinner date, soaking in the serendipity that life had gifted them — again.

# 💫 Final Thought

**Go with the flow.**  
**Trust the timing of your life.**

**Because when something is truly meant for you — it won’t pass you by.**  
**It will find you. In its own time. In its own quiet, magical way.**

I saw somewhere mention that if your urine output doesn’t increase on diuretics it could mean there’s a problem. For me, my urine output has decreased but I’ve been on diamox for a year and all my blood work is fine including kidneys, potassium is perhaps a little on the low end of normal. 

My theory is that my urine output has decreased because I used to be that person who drank 3-4L of straight water a day + other drinks and was peeing ALL the time and gradually around the time I was put on diamox my fluid intake reduced a lot due to mental health issues, feeling full all the time, being inactive.. various reasons. 

So now I’m wondering if actually my urine output is down, only from my previous normal, not the average persons normal. Nowadays even on diamox I manage 2L on a good day and rarely even drink coffee/tea anymore. I get maybe 300ml almond milk in a smoothie on top. That’s all a lot less than I used to have. 

How much water should I be drinking? And should I definitely be adding electrolytes? I do take magnesium supplements and add a tiny tiny bit of coconut water to my smoothie but I don’t think my potassium intake is high enough (as diamox has also reduced my appetite so I don’t eat as many potassium rich foods as before). Tried a very low dose potassium supplement (200mg) one time and it gave me kidney pain. I’m lost as to what to do tbh.. 

Sorry for the essay! Just tired of still feeling crappy on diamox a year later. Symptoms are reasonably well controlled I’m just exhausted and constantly dehydrated. My neurologists have been useless with advice for basically anything. ",4,1756644165.0,iih,1,0.84,False

I have a Delonghi Dedica and a Fellow Opus. Ever since I got this combo I was astonished of how impossible to dial this equipment is. 

I’ve been extracting with unpressurized baskets. I’ve tried all basket sizes, and every type of coffee bean you can image. I’ve tried single doses, double doses…

I can’t grind below 3,5. Every setting below that the machine chokes. The only way to get decent espresso out of this is grinding around 3,5/4 and small dosing. I’m getting at the most 15 grams in (with a double shot basket) and getting a ridiculous 15 grams in around 30 seconds. 

Honestly, after spending 500€ on subpar equipment, I’m feeling like throwing it all out and giving up espresso. 

Is the Dedica just not up for the challenge, or is there something wrong with it?",1,1756643921.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

I really appreciate all the advice.

I’d really appreciate it if anyone has the patience to take a look and give feedback on how it’s organized and the information I included. Since I’m a beginner designer with little professional experience, I ended up adding a lot of personal and fictional projects, and I’m wondering if this is normal or well-regarded in the industry.

I also included my logo and a QR code that links to my portfolio. If that was a bad idea, I can remove it!

1n4tkdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1n4tkdr/seasonal_short_and_sweets_frames_within_frames/,Seasonal Short and Sweets | Frames within Frames within The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity,"##It’s time for another edition of Short and Sweets, where we analyze short clips of anime to get you to pay a little more attention to the details. This time, I’m discussing how the usage of a cinematic technique in *The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity* reinforces the emotional beats. 

The backdrop of *The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity* is one familiar to romance fans. Like the infamous star-crossed lovers of Romeo and Juliet, our protagonists hail from two very different circles that hate one another. In the case of Rintarou and Kaoruko, they begin to form a relationship despite the fact that their neighboring schools acrimoniously despise each other. The joy of this show, beyond Kaoruko’s comical expressions, comes from watching our cast overcome their established preconceptions and break down these superficial barriers. The way *The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity* manages this evolution is by manifesting these barriers in the composition.

This is a cinematic technique called “frames within frames.” Your first frame is the overall composition - in anime that’s the usual 1920 x 1080 screen. Within that resolution, the camera captures another frame or box inside the screen. In creating this frame through some prop or camera angle, the director can imbue the scene with additional meaning. [It could represent separation or isolation](https://imgur.com/Q2Z91Is.png). Or it can do the opposite; [it can demonstrate unity](https://imgur.com/xprBUD4.png). These recent episodes of *The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity* employ this method to capture how one of its supporting characters, Subaru Hoshina, opens up to the boys she used to hate. 

At first, Subaru is vehemently opposed to Kaoruko and Rintarou meeting up outside of school. Distrustful of boys and fearful of the social repercussions if Kaoruko were caught fraternizing with their rivals, Subaru musters up the courage to ask Rintarou to stay away. Their opposition is visualized through [the coffee shop window frames, which divides them put them into on two discrete panes](https://imgur.com/Zbjghu5.png). Even as she acknowledges that Rintarou is not a bad guy and that this request can be considered “incorrect,” [she still asks Rintarou to stop seeing Kaoruko](https://imgur.com/bXvxPRf.png). Here, we see [a fun shot using an upside-down glass as the frame around Subaru](https://imgur.com/CWQ92IC.png). When paired with the window frames, it feels like overkill. Subaru has layered so many defenses that she walls herself in, refusing to entertain any of Rintarou’s arguments. At the same time, the glass gives a sense of fragility: Subaru’s protective bubble around Kaoruko cannot last forever. And it also symbolizes her delicate worldview coming into sharp focus, where the boy she once hated has turned out to be kind and a source of happiness for her best friend. [Even if she knows she’s wrong](https://imgur.com/nMxnVzU.png), Subaru stubbornly wants to stay inside the world she knows. 

In episode 6, Subaru admits to Kaoruko that she tried to scare Rintarou away. It’s a heartbreaking episode, where Subaru reveals how she’s been tormented by guilt and shame. There’s plenty of great direction worth acknowledging in this scene, such as the [blocking](https://imgur.com/4CDRCDP.png) and [short-siding](https://imgur.com/sVxCEwj.png). But again, it’s the frames within frames that steal the show. When Subaru admits to hating herself, [the camera films her from within a nearby bush](https://imgur.com/OIcodCV.png). She’s framed by the tips of leaves that symbolize the barbs she throws herself upon. The playground’s structures repeatedly [isolate Subaru] (https://imgur.com/XktLWnE.png) [from Kaoruko](https://imgur.com/1bfdiWt.png), but [Kaoruko forces herself through these artificial barriers](https://imgur.com/2t19CBE.png). [She grabs Subaru and hugs her](https://imgur.com/VR1iuAp.png), refuting Subaru’s self belittlement. In the same playground where she once rescued Subaru from bullies, Kaoruko saves her again by turning these [scenes that diminish Subaru](https://imgur.com/bMNEtbs.png) into [ones that instead highlight their friendship](https://imgur.com/miAfYvo.png). Just as frames can separate characters physically and mentally, they can emphasize the efforts taken for characters to breach that containment. 

And finally, Subaru meets with Rintarou at the very same playground where she let everything out to Kaoruko. But now the two converse with [no noticeable barriers in between them](https://imgur.com/xqsGswD.png). I love when a small arc makes heavy use of a cinematic technique as a sort of motif for that particular conflict. It neatly creates a visual vocabulary to help viewers follow the narrative. Subaru has come to accept Rintarou as Kaoruko’s friend. And it’s punctuated by [this shot of Subaru’s face barely breaching a wooden post to enter the same frame with Rintarou](https://imgur.com/xqsGswD.png). [As she says, they’re not quite friends yet](https://imgur.com/iYcI1JP.png). But Subaru has taken her first step into a new world with new friendships and free of the frames that limited her perspective.",6,1756643735.0,anime,2,0.8,False

Legs feel like jello.,"So, this is a rare thing that happens to me (I'm male, early 40s), probably ten or so times over the last three or fours years, but I would appreciate any insight.

I don't know what it is or why it happens exactly, but, for instance, as a writer, I spend a lot of time in coffee shops with my laptop.  At the end of the day, I'll walk home (about two miles) and I'll suddenly feel very weak.  Like all the energy just drained from my body.  My legs in particular feel weak, like jello, and I'll often have to stop and sit down.  A small breeze would be enough to take me out.

And, I suddenly feel ravenous.  I could eat a horse.  And I do.  Luckily, each time I have always had food in my bag, and I cannot stop eating it.  I feel like I need to get it into my system super fast.  I eat anything.  Savoury food, sweet treats, candy, whatever.

Once I walked back the two miles, and I was fine, but then I took the family dog out for a walk.  Just as I got back home again, this feeling hit me.  I raided my fridge and could not stop.

1n4tj3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1n4tj3t/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4tiqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n4tiqv/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4tib6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1n4tib6/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4th0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1n4th0q/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4tgjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n4tgjk/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4tghw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1n4tghw/film_review_singapore_dreaming_2006_the_film_our/,"Film review: Singapore Dreaming (2006), the film our president praised","
Non-academic weekend. Singapore Dreaming is a “slice-of-life” movie, focussing on the Loh family, with the central event being Mr Loh’s winning of the lottery, thus getting $2 million, having gotten the impossible and now free to chase their materialist dreams.

I’ll try to summarise the plot so we can cut into the meat, go:

The film opens up with Loh Poh Huat, an elderly man and his wife, Mrs Loh. Mr Loh Poh Huat has 2 adult children, his daughter Mei, and his son Seng. Mei is married to CK, but looks down on him because of his unsuccessful attempts to sell insurance. Mei also hires a filipino helper called Pinky. Seng has a girlfriend called Irene, who really really wants to get married.

**Plot**

The plot starts, as Seng returns to SG from the USA, having studied in a polytechnic in Idaho, to yet another evening, of Mr Loh longing to move out of his HDB, and Mei berating CK for being an ineffectual, “shameful” low-wage earner (while Seng gets even more guff thrown at him by Mr Loh, who isn’t quiet about his dismissive views of CK). Like father like daughter, Mei wants to move out and often tours condos, longing to buy, but never being able to. Mr Loh (in typical, confucian chauvinism) favours Seng unequivocally.

Seng has returned, but can’t find a job (and spoiler; didn’t graduate from the poly. He is also in immense debt from his studies, and because he used his dad’s credit card to buy a car). In a stroke of immense luck, Mr Loh wins the TOTO and gets $2 million. But because Fate is an utter bastard, Mr Loh dies after his country club interview from a heart attack. Now the film REALLY kicks into full gear. As expected, the shit hits the fan, as vitriol gets passed around like a hot potato, starting with Mei and her boss, then Mei to CK, then Mei to her helper, Pinky (causing Pinky to leave after being accused of pocketing $500, even though Pinky was nothing but reliable throughout the film), and finally CK venting to a beer girl at a coffee shop. The film finally ends, as it’s revealed that Mr Loh actually made a will! All his money goes to his wife, while Mei gets a lump sum, and Seng gets barely anything (and has more debts).

**Review**

Certainly a sobering take! As stated in the tile, then presider SR Nathan approved and praised the film. I personally like how the film is less of a mounting conflict and resolution, and more like a natural unraveling of Seng’s tomfoolery. One thing I absolutely like about the film is how it does not preach to you. It does not go the usual “uh treasure life not money”, and Mr Loh’s death is not a “karma” moment by any means, but rather a truly unfortunate accident in life. Also, I appreciate how the film bluntly portrays generational trauma, as Mr Loh sidelines and looks down on his daughter, and as Mei herself does the same to CK, simply as a frustrated lashing out.
One wholesome thing, in-spite of the film’s bleak events and general atmosphere of materialism, are the relationships. For one, CK and Seng seem to have a genuinely brotherly relationship, as brother-in-laws. CK seems genuinely happy for Seng when he thinks he graduated, in-spite of his shitty life circumstances, and never once doubts his ability to get a job, while Seng reciprocates and is one of the few family members kind to CK.
Irene and Mrs Loh have a genuinely motherly/daughterly relationship, with Irene often supporting Mrs Loh, and even keeping in touch as good friends, after she leaves Seng, assuring Mrs Loh that she “did her best the best [mrs Loh] knew how”. 
Heck even Seng and his dad have a good relationship, as Mr Loh appears to have unwavering faith in his son’s ability to succeed, giving him more than he needs (and also spoiling him).

I suppose these little touches make the film more realistic, complementing the dreary, materialistic tone, where hope is found in the small moments of genuine friendship and kinship.

1n4tg2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n4tg2g/my_roommate_is_a_demon_who_tortures_me/,My Roommate is a Demon who Tortures me,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. 

No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 

 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. 

Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”

1n4taf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1n4taf0/my_prepre_plan_execute_review_process_for_using/,My [Prepre -> Plan -> Execute -> Review] process for using Claude Code in my B2B marketing agency,"Hey all - been getting deep into the 'Claude Code for non-coding tasks' and sharing my current process that I'm working on.

This is the process I’m using to create on-brand marketing assets for B2B GTM teams. It works pretty well for writing tasks, design, and some coding. I’ve included overall process and a specific example for one step in my workflow. If you find this interesting, drop a comment. I'm not super technical but trying to figure things out.

Anyway, here's the overall process that I'm using:

1. **Prepare:** give the model a heads-up of what you’re going to be working on in this session. I’ve got a detailed explanation about the project in a README.
2. **Plan:** get into the specifics of the task at hand, building the to-do list etc. For repeated tasks I use a custom slash command (sometimes with $ARGUMENTS for variables), or just raw dog a new conversation. This is all in planning mode.
3. **Execute:** once I’m happy with the plan, I let Claude Cook
4. **Review and** ***selectively*** **improve:** this step has the biggest improvement in outputs

*Tactical note: the tasks I’m working on are quite varied so accounting for every situation a single* CLAUDEmd *file doesn’t make sense. This README approach allows me to be more flexible.*

Now here’s a specific application of this process that I’m using to create Brand Systems for clients

1. **Prepare**
   * Start a new chat, use a /new-chat slash command to prompt Claude to review the README to get up to speed with the project.
2. **Plan - all in plan mode**
   * Use a custom slash command to explain the part of the process that we’re working on i.e., /brand-system:01-start
   * This explains the part of the process that we’re going to be working on with the files to expect in the next prompt
   * Another custom slash command with the below inputs
      * Location of the design reference images to use the brand system, which are referenced as $ARGUMENTS since the location changes depending on the client I’m working with
      * A generic JSON template with the structure of the brand system
   * A detailed prompt with instructions
   * Since I’m in plan mode, I review Claude’s todo list to make sure it’s aligned. For the brand system, it’s usually pretty standard. Other steps in my process require more iteration.
3. **Execute**
   * Run the todo list, check twitter, grab a coffee
   * I usually use Opus 4.1 for creative tasks like design and writing, especially anthing multimodel (like this example where I’m sending images)
4. **Review - initially in plan mode, then switch to run**
   * Plan mode
      * Once I have the output, I have another custom slash command with a lengthy review prompt, specific to each step in the workflow. I also re-share the design reference images
      * Importantly, the custom prompt focuses on just listing **issues**, not suggesting any fixes
   * Here, I review the list of issues and choose the ones that I want to implement
   * Execute mode
      * Implement the suggestions
   * In most cases, one loop of this review/issue is enough. Some steps in my workflow are more judgement based so for those I’ll run through review/improve loop a couple more times.

**Questions you might have**

* Why don’t you use single larger prompts instead of splitting things up?
   * For my workflow, splitting tasks into these smaller steps tasks feels like it gives better outputs
   * This helps me to build the relevant context and feels like it ‘primes’ the model for the primary task
   * This is 100% anecdotal but it works for me
* Where do you save the custom slash commands?
   * I keep the the custom commands and other things like writing guidelines, templates, etc. in the project repo so I can use github to manage versions
* Why don’t you use subagents for some of these tasks?
   * For my workflow, maintaining a single context for discreet tasks works best
   * Subagents spin up a fresh context each time so don’t do the trick for me. The tasks I’m working on require building context from previous steps
* How are you using custom output styles?
   * I’m experimenting with these, e.g. for the copywriting that I do as part of my process
   * I’ve got a business copywriting output style that helps to convert input text (e.g. call transcripts) into marketing copy for some output (e.g. case studies), but it does require me providing a guideline/template of the structure that I want to follow

*A story of fate, quiet love, and moments that make you believe in destiny.*

# 🌤️ 1. Weekend Nostalgia

It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.

Dhaval sat on the couch, a warm cup of chai in hand, lazily flipping through his old college trip photos. Anamika, his wife of four years, was in the kitchen humming an old song, unaware of what was about to unfold.

They had an arranged marriage — no long dating phase, no college romance, just two strangers who chose to build a life together. And somehow, they made it work. Long drives, late-night talks, and shared silences had turned them into best friends over the years.

But what Dhaval saw that day would change everything he believed about “chance.”

# 📸 2. The Photo Frame of Fate

Click. Click. Swipe.

He paused.

One photo from his Udaipur college trip caught his eye — a random group photo in front of the City Palace. It wasn’t the palace or his college friends that made him freeze.

It was her.

Blurred, in the background, almost hidden behind a group of tourists — stood a girl in a yellow kurta. She wasn’t posing. She was just walking past.

But he knew that face.  
That smile.  
That walk.

It was Anamika.  
His wife.

# 🪞 3. Destiny in a Snapshot

He stared at the photo in disbelief.

How was this possible?  
They had never met before marriage. Or so he thought.

And yet — here she was, captured in a photo from seven years ago, when they were both college students, unknown to each other.

He rushed to the kitchen.

“Anamika! Come here, you need to see this.”

She wiped her hands and walked over.  
He pointed to the photo.

“Look closely. Isn’t that… you?”

She squinted.

Her eyes widened. A small gasp escaped her lips.  
“Yes… that’s me! Oh my God, that is me. I had gone to Udaipur with my friends around that time.”

Silence.

They both looked at each other.  
Smiled.  
And then burst into laughter — the kind that comes from pure joy and quiet wonder.

# 🌠 4. When Something Is Meant to Be

They sat together for hours that day, looking through more photos, sipping tea, and talking about the strange, beautiful coincidence that had always lived in their past — quietly waiting to be discovered.

That photo became more than just a frozen moment.  
It became a reminder.

A reminder that when something is meant for you, it will find its way to you —  
in a city you don’t remember,  
in a frame you didn’t notice,  
in a person you were yet to fall in love with.

Sometimes, destiny doesn’t knock on your door loudly.  
It whispers, hides in pixels, and waits — patiently — for the day you’ll finally see it.

# 🌄 5. Udaipur — Again, but Together

A week later, they were walking hand-in-hand near the same City Palace, this time as husband and wife.

It wasn’t a lavish trip — just two people reliving a strange twist of fate. They took selfies near the spot where the original photo had been clicked. Laughed again. Talked for hours over lakeside coffee. Shared new memories in a place that had unknowingly started their story years ago.

They even recreated that blurry photo — this time, intentionally — smiling directly into the lens.

That night, over dinner, Dhaval said, “It’s like the universe left us a trail — and we finally followed it.”

Anamika nodded, eyes glowing. “We were always meant to find each other. This… was just proof.”

They ended the night planning a weekend movie and dinner date, soaking in the serendipity that life had gifted them — again.

# 💫 Final Thought

**Go with the flow.**  
**Trust the timing of your life.**

**Because when something is truly meant for you — it won’t pass you by.**

**Chapter Six: The Fracture**

They sat in silence. The hallway still smelled faintly of citrus and sage, though the scent was beginning to fade.

Julio now sat in the breakroom with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, humming softly as he peeled an orange into a single spiral. He did not speak unless spoken to, and even then only in metaphors. The spiral of peel sat like a coiled ribbon beside him. When he smiled, it wasn’t at anyone. It was at the peel curling perfectly away, as if witnessing a miracle.

In the lab’s conference room, no one moved.

""It’s over,"" Bates said finally.

No one contradicted her.

Wei was the first to respond. He looked down at the table as he spoke, voice calm.

""It was always going to happen. We are not gods or engineers. We’re passengers on a collapsing bridge. The virus is not the fire. It’s the tide.""

Langston blinked slowly, then turned her head. ""You’re glad,"" she said. ""You’re glad it got out.""

""Not glad,"" Wei replied, folding his hands. ""Relieved. The world was already ending. We’ve just adjusted its trajectory.""

Bates looked between them, grief blooming in her expression. ""That’s not what we built this for.""

""Wasn’t it?"" Wei asked softly.

""This was to protect people. Not change them.""

""Sometimes they’re the same thing.""

Langston stood suddenly, the scrape of her chair loud in the sterile room. ""We need to report it. All of it. Julio’s case, Devoste’s logs, everything. Full transparency. We can still slow it down.""

""We’ll be shut down,"" Bates said.

""So be it,"" Langston replied. ""The data will survive. Other labs can—""

""Will they?"" Wei interrupted. ""The world is a year from boiling oceans and authoritarian regimes armed with drones. We’ve tried compliance. It got us here.""

Langston’s voice grew sharper. ""This isn’t revolution. It’s bioterrorism.""

Wei stood too, with measured precision. ""Then it’s the gentlest kind in history. No death. No violence. Just stillness.""

""Stillness that rewires people’s minds.""

""No. It quiets them. It lets them hear.""

""Stop!"" Bates said sharply.

Both turned.

She was trembling, barely holding herself together.

""I don’t want this,"" Bates whispered. ""None of us did. But we can’t keep talking like this is a philosophy debate. We need to tell the truth.""

Langston nodded slowly. ""We follow protocol. Notify the CDC.""

Wei gave a tiny nod. ""Of course,"" he said. ""You’re right.""

It was a verbal agreement. It was all they had.

Langston drafted the notifications. CDC. WHO. The NIH. Department of Defense. One by one. Then she made the calls.

Hours passed.

Responses trickled in. Then slowed. Then stopped.

CDC: “Please provide documentation. Review pending.” WHO: “Your case is in queue.” Defense Dept: “We will respond if your inquiry meets classification parameters.”

Langston stared at her screen.

""It’s happening already,"" she said.

Bates looked up. ""What is?""

Langston didn’t answer.

Wei did. ""The silence.""

**——**

They couldn’t keep Julio here forever.

He wasn’t a prisoner, and they had no legal grounds to hold him. But he was clearly changed, clearly contagious, and even more clearly untroubled by it. They didn’t even know how to prove he was infected. “He’s healthy and happy, so we detained him."" That wouldn’t stand up in court, let alone in public opinion.

They had done the only thing they could think of: nothing.

Call after call to the CDC went unanswered. Their data was deemed “non-urgent.” And so, Julio watched the sunrise, and they watched the clock.

Something had to give.

Bates stood. If MIMS was truly loose, there should be signs by now. ELM didn’t linger. People got sick, fast. Hospitals should be overflowing. Streets should be silent. Masks, sirens, curfews. She should see terror. Panic. But if MIMs was spreading too, how would that look? Would they know?

And what if Julio was the only case? What if it could still be contained? She had to know.

She was the infectious disease doctor. The one who’d walked barefoot through floodwaters to reach cholera patients. Who’d patched wounds with duct tape and gauze while waiting in an unlit Mongolian train station. If anyone should go out, it was her.

The next morning, Bates left the lab for the first time in nearly a week.

They had tested Julio with the same thoroughness they had shown for Devoste. His neurological scans showed a flattening of affect, yes, but it was not nearly as profound. He spoke, often in metaphor, and only when spoken to, but his gaze was clear. His vitals were normal. Unlike Devoste, he displayed no aversion to technology or synthetic light. He ate fruit, hummed to himself, and expressed delight in small things: a warm cup of tea, the curl of apple peel, the rustle of a blanket. He was changed, undeniably, but not passive. He had become present. Deeply, quietly present. Not Basic, Bates noted. Attuned. And in many ways, happier.

She walked past Julio without speaking. He had taken to watching the sunrise from the stairwell landing, knees tucked under his chin, silent as stone.

She told herself it was just a walk.

But she needed to see.

The streets were moving. The city hadn’t stopped. But it felt… tilted. Bates tried to catalog what she should have seen: crowded ERs, masks on every face, lines outside clinics, ambulances snarling the intersections. That’s what an ELM outbreak looked like. But here there was no sign of ELM panic. No sirens, no shouting, no obvious fear. Just people, moving with unusual grace and goodwill. The air smelled like morning coffee and loamy soil after rain. Bates’ chest tightened, not in panic, but in awe. The virus was spreading, but it was not the one they had feared.

Cars moved leisurely, people crossed the street, lights blinked. But the sharpness was gone. No one honked. A man waved another into traffic with a small smile. A woman paused to let a stray dog sniff her hand.

At the pharmacy, the lights were low and warm. The shelves were full. The pharmacist moved slowly behind the counter, humming faintly, folding a paper bag with something like... tenderness.

Bates bought mouthwash. She didn’t know why.

On the walk back, she saw it.

A man crouched on the sidewalk, tying a little girl’s shoe. She giggled, pointing at a butterfly.

Behind them, a woman stood with her face tilted to the sky. Eyes closed. Arms loose at her sides. Breathing.

Not catatonic. Just present. Like a tuning fork, resonating with the morning air.

When she opened her eyes, they met Bates’s.

Not recognition.

But no fear either. Just an endless, quiet calm.

Bates turned and walked faster.

Back in the lab, she threw the mouthwash in the trash.

Oh it’s pronounced Roy - Boss, in case you were wondering. Rooibos is grown in South Africa in the Fynbos biome and became more desirable and available when the Dutch Tea Trade routes opened. Rooibos, also known as Red Tea or Red Bush tea has a light nutty flavor with hints of vanilla and caramel. And it is 100% caffeine free. In our game you can find Rooibos in the Nomad Highlands. You will see 2 varieties. The red and green. The red yields more tea than the green. The farmer can brew your Rooibos into a tea that aids your stamina and endurance. Good for long glides. And its naturally calming effects will help take the edge off. Oh and of course you can grow your own at your base. And lastly, Rooibos is crucial for Flame upgrades.

This is the process I’m using to create on-brand marketing assets for B2B GTM teams. I’ve included overall process and a specific example for one step in my workflow. If you have thoughts/suggestions/improvements, I'd love to hear them.

Here’s my four step process that works a treat for non-coding tasks:

1. **Prepare:** give the model a heads-up of what you’re going to be working on in this session. I’ve got a detailed explanation about the project in a README.
2. **Plan:** get into the specifics of the task at hand, building the to-do list etc. For repeated tasks I use a custom slash command (sometimes with $ARGUMENTS for variables), or just raw dog a new conversation. This is all in planning mode.
3. **Execute:** once I’m happy with the plan, I let Claude Cook
4. **Review and** ***selectively*** **improve:** this step has the biggest improvement in outputs

*Tactical note: the tasks I’m working on are quite varied so accounting for every situation a single* [*CLAUDE.md*](http://CLAUDE.md) *file doesn’t make sense. This README approach allows me to be more flexible.*Here’s a specific application that I’m using to create Brand Systems for clients  


1. **Prepare**
   * Start a new chat, use a /new-chat slash command to prompt Claude to review the README to get up to speed with the project.
2. **Plan - all in plan mode**
   * Use a custom slash command to explain the part of the process that we’re working on i.e., /brand-system:01-start
   * This explains the part of the process that we’re going to be working on with the files to expect in the next prompt
   * Another custom slash command with the below inputs
      * Location of the design reference images to use the brand system, which are referenced as $ARGUMENTS since the location changes depending on the client I’m working with
      * A generic JSON template with the structure of the brand system
   * A detailed prompt with instructions
   * Since I’m in plan mode, I review Claude’s todo list to make sure it’s aligned. For the brand system, it’s usually pretty standard. Other steps in my process require more iteration.
3. **Execute**
   * Run the todo list, check twitter, grab a coffee
   * I usually use Opus 4.1 for creative tasks like design and writing, especially anthing multimodel (like this example where I’m sending images)
4. **Review - initially in plan mode, then switch to run**
   * Plan mode
      * Once I have the output, I have another custom slash command with a lengthy review prompt, specific to each step in the workflow. I also re-share the design reference images
      * Importantly, the custom prompt focuses on just listing **issues**, not suggesting any fixes
   * Here, I review the list of issues and choose the ones that I want to implement
   * Execute mode
      * Implement the suggestions
   * In most cases, one loop of this review/issue is enough. Some steps in my workflow are more judgement based so for those I’ll run through review/improve loop a couple more times.

**Questions you might have**

* Why don’t you use single larger prompts instead of splitting things up?
   * For my workflow, splitting tasks into these smaller steps tasks feels like it gives better outputs
   * This helps me to build the relevant context and feels like it ‘primes’ the model for the primary task
   * This is 100% anecdotal but it works for me
* Where do you save the custom slash commands?
   * I keep the the custom commands and other things like writing guidelines, templates, etc. in the project repo so I can use github to manage versions
* Why don’t you use subagents for some of these tasks?
   * For my workflow, maintaining a single context for discreet tasks works best
   * Subagents spin up a fresh context each time so don’t do the trick for me. The tasks I’m working on require building context from previous steps
* How are you using custom output styles?
   * I’m experimenting with these, e.g. for the copywriting that I do as part of my process
   * I’ve got a business copywriting output style that helps to convert input text (e.g. call transcripts) into marketing copy for some output (e.g. case studies), but it does require me providing a guideline/template of the structure that I want to follow

I 've had this symptom for 4 months now, maybe longer but I didn't notice it. Occasionally, I have short period (usually last 30 minutes) where I can feel that I have missing/skipping heart beat, like literally.  I check my BPM during this period, heart beats normally then a skipped beat, then it beats normally again. Symptom repeats after few minutes, and the period last 30 minutes maybe longer. I can feel a small pressure in center of my chest, + slightly nervous when it happens, no dizziness, no shortness of breath.

I also have a blood pressure monitor, an omron BP5360, it can detect irregular heartbeat and it does detect it on me.  So this isn't something that ""I just feel"". It usually happens in the morning, if i overwork on the day before.

Went to ER twice, and my Electrocardiogram was fine, my symptom disappeared when I got to hospital so idk.  I went to doctor's last month, Echocardiography was normal, bloodtest was normal, (or they said, i wasn't sure what did they test, probably enzymes) , checked Electrocardiogram again, this time, with a ""**Incomplete right bundle branch block**"". Still doctors said it was alright, nothing was serious, and they gave me Bisoprolol 2.5mg, Levosulpirid 50mg, and some vitamin B supplements.

Been taking it for over a month now, remove coffee from my daily routine but I just don't feel like the symptom is going away.
