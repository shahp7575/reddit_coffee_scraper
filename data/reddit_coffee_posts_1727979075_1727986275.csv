Planiram sa društvom da posetim Amsterdam uoči Nove godine. Interesuje me kako je najlakše/najisplativije doći od aerodroma do centra i po ostatku grada (smeštaj, itd).

Trenutno nemam ništa zakazno tako da bi svaki savet dobrodošao.

Naravno i sugestije za dobre coffee shopove, i sl.",1,1727986190.0,AskSerbia,0,1.0,False

I would also get symptoms of Raynaud's from cold water. I read somewhere online that Vyvanse would cause it that much. I've been only taking it for 3 days but I can still feel numbness in my fingers&toes from cold, unlike before Ritalin and vyvanse.  
  
Does anyone here have any experiences with this? I'm on vyvanse 40mg, which doesn't give any other side effect like I sleep well and eat without issues, I also have had some coffee as the effect it so minor.",1,1727986157.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

[https://imgur.com/a/c9HeY6i](https://imgur.com/a/c9HeY6i)

I want to give a shoutout to boo9817 for the inspiration! I combined suggestions from their posts and other recipes to get this as close to the perfect brownie as possible. Personally, I find many anabolic recipes use oils, butters, and flours that don't feel low-calorie or convenient. Some may taste fine, but I wanted to achieve a better balance and create a brownie that truly tastes delectable, as it should. But I digress. As for the added ingredients, the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor by deepening its richness. Vanilla, a common ingredient in many protein recipes, elevates the overall flavor profile, adding warmth and balance. The egg whites contribute to a slightly cakier texture and add more volume. If you prefer a different texture, feel free to omit them! That being said. here's what is needed for the recipe:

**DRY INGREDIENTS**

3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder

Pinch of Salt

2 Tbsp Chocolate Protein Powder (Others work too! I used Salted Caramel Whey Protein Powder, and it worked fine. If your protein contains sodium, like mine, omit the salt.)

1/6 Tsp Baking Powder

2-2½ Tbsp Flour or Oat Fiber

¼ cup Erythritol (or sweetener of choice)

1 Tbsp Instant Coffee

**WET INGREDIENTS**

1 Egg White, whipped to stiff peaks (use 2 for a more cake-like consistency)

½ Tsp Vanilla Extract

½ cup Diet Soda (Flavored diet soda seems to pack more flavor. If you don't prefer the taste of soda, opt out for Carbonated Soda)

**(OPTIONAL TOPPING) PB2 GLAZE:**

2 Tbsp PB2 (powdered peanut butter)

1 Tbsp Almond Milk or water (or adjust to reach desired consistency)

1 Tsp powdered sweetener (like powdered erythritol or Swerve)

½ Tsp vanilla extract

**INSTRUCTIONS (*****Note: Incorporate egg white mixture last as explained in the recipe*****):**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
2. Mix dry ingredients: Combine cocoa powder, salt, protein powder, baking powder, flour/oat fiber, erythritol, and instant coffee in a bowl. The coffee
3. Mix the Vanilla and the Diet Soda together and add to dry ingredients. Mix it all together.
4. Whip egg white(s) to stiff peaks, then gently fold into the dry mixture.
5. Bake for 20-30 minutes (Do the toothpick test)
6. Cool slightly before serving.
7. (OPTIONAL) Create the PB2 glaze by mixing the ingredients thoroughly, then apply it on top of the brownie.

**CALORIES (without Glaze):**

\~ 12 Cals (Cocoa Powder)

\~ 40 - 80 Cals (Protein Powder - varies)

\~ 57 - 71 Cals (Flour)

\~ 17 - 34 Cals (1 or 2 egg whites)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**= \~ 126 - 197 Cals**

**CALORIES (with Glaze):**

...

\~ 23 Cals (PB2)

\~ 0 - 5 Cals (Water or Almond Milk)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**= 149 - 220 Cals**

**PROTEIN:**

Without PB2 glaze: \~14 - 17g protein (depending on egg whites added).

With PB2 glaze: \~19 - 22g protein.

1fvgukb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1fvgukb/grabbing_coffee_did_i_pass_the_pre_screening_test/,Grabbing coffee - did i pass the pre screening test ,"So I mentioned I know a nice place for a coffee, just in passing convo. He suddenly said let’s go. And for context, I do have an inkling that he likes me - but this was the first time we’ve had a full conversation - i met him at a society… 

He orders for me at the cafe and then we have our drinks … we talk for a bit etc. i feel like there were some awkward moments and I don’t know if he truly enjoyed himself, but we did have a few laughs. 

Then it comes to the time for me to say bye and we hug and part ways. I have heard how grabbing coffee is like a “pre-screening test” to an actual date, sometimes. 

I think i like him but would like to get to know him more … he has my socials and I will see him at the next society meeting.

My question is: did I pass the pre-screening? Is it a sign that he’s not into me if he didn’t  suggest another hang out or even hinted towards one? 
Thank Reddit - might need your help",1,1727985864.0,dating,1,0.67,False
1fvgugr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fvgugr/espresso_machine_ice_coffee_200/,Espresso machine ice coffee [$200],"I drink alot of ""bad"" coffee. Usually when im not in the office i make 10 cups in my Moccamaster with pre-grinded medium roast coffee each morning. I pour that into a thermos and then i drink it from a plastic travel mug during the day because i like to sip during the whole day.

Im now changing job, i will be working from home 100% and im thinking about changing things up a little. I went on vacation this summer and I had some great ice coffee since I like it more than warm coffee.

My question is, what type of cheaper espresso machine would work for me when making ice coffee? Will De'Longhi Dedica suffice?",1,1727985858.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Recipe + Calories + Protein are listed below. 

I want to give a shoutout to u/boo9817 for the inspiration! I combined suggestions from their posts and other recipes to get this as close to the perfect brownie as possible. Personally, I find many anabolic recipes use oils, butters, and flours that don't feel low-calorie or convenient. Some may taste fine, but I wanted to achieve a better balance and create a brownie that truly tastes delectable, as it should. But I digress. As for the added ingredients, the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor by deepening its richness. Vanilla, a common ingredient in many protein recipes, elevates the overall flavor profile, adding warmth and balance. The egg whites contribute to a slightly cakier texture and add more volume. If you prefer a different texture, feel free to omit them! That being said. here's what is needed for the recipe:

**DRY INGREDIENTS**

3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder

Pinch of Salt

2 Tbsp Chocolate Protein Powder (Others work too! I used Salted Caramel Whey Protein Powder, and it worked fine. If your protein contains sodium, like mine, omit the salt.)

1/6 Tsp Baking Powder

2-2½ Tbsp Flour or Oat Fiber

¼ cup Erythritol (or sweetener of choice)

1 Tbsp Instant Coffee

**WET INGREDIENTS**

1 Egg White, whipped to stiff peaks (use 2 for a more cake-like consistency)

½ Tsp Vanilla Extract

½ cup Diet Soda (Flavored diet soda seems to pack more flavor. If you don't prefer the taste of soda, opt out for Carbonated Soda)

**(OPTIONAL TOPPING) PB2 GLAZE:**

2 Tbsp PB2 (powdered peanut butter)

1 Tbsp Almond Milk or water (or adjust to reach desired consistency)

1 Tsp powdered sweetener (like powdered erythritol or Swerve)

½ Tsp vanilla extract



**INSTRUCTIONS (*****Note: Incorporate egg white mixture last as explained in the recipe*****):**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)

2. Mix dry ingredients: Combine cocoa powder, salt, protein powder, baking powder, flour/oat fiber, erythritol, and instant coffee in a bowl. The coffee

3. Mix the Vanilla and the Diet Soda together and add to dry ingredients. Mix it all together.

4. Whip egg white(s) to stiff peaks, then gently fold into the dry mixture. 

5. Bake for 20-30 minutes (Do the toothpick test)

6. Cool slightly before serving.

7. (OPTIONAL) Create the PB2 glaze by mixing the ingredients thoroughly, then apply it on top of the brownie.



**CALORIES (without Glaze):**

\~ 12 Cals (Cocoa Powder)

\~ 40 - 80 Cals (Protein Powder - varies)

\~ 57 - 71 Cals (Flour)

\~ 17 - 34 Cals (1 or 2 egg whites)

**The Versatile Magic of Designer Yoga Leggings, Embrace Comfort, Style, and Confidence**

Ladies, finding the perfect pair of leggings can feel like stumbling upon a hidden treasure chest. You want something that makes you feel like a goddess on the yoga mat, but also effortlessly chic for that coffee run with friends. Well, our designer yoga leggings are here to give you the best of both worlds, read on!

[Woman in a yoga pose wearing Magical Memes Art designer leggings](https://preview.redd.it/52isvipwilsd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b408b954d4339fae422d7315f9a6204d0bb8416)

Whether you're perfecting your downward dog or strutting your stuff with a latte in hand, our leggings are designed to offer comfort, style, and a confidence boost. You will wonder why you didn’t add them to your wardrobe sooner.



**Meet Your New Best Addition to Your Wardrobe, The Perfect Pair of Yoga Leggings**

Our yoga leggings aren’t just for yoga. They’re for those spontaneous brunch plans, lazy Sundays on the couch, or casual work-from-home vibes. And yes, showing off your fabulous assets, bootylicious booty, in a way that makes you feel beautiful, no matter your body type.

You deserve to feel comfortable and stunning, whether you're practicing yoga, lounging, or going on errands. There’s nothing quite like a well-made pair of leggings to bring out that confidence.

Here’s why our designer yoga leggings are about to become your wardrobe MVP.



1. The Smoothest, Softest Fabric You’ll Ever Feel

Our leggings are made from a luxurious blend of poly-spandex, with a magical 18% spandex content. Translation, all the stretch, all the comfort, and none of the see-through mishaps. Also, no white spots here. We print our vibrant color designs on the fabric before assembling the leggings. The patterns are flawless and the seams align like visual poetry. Every single pair is precision-cut and hand-sewn after printing for that tailor-made, perfect fit.

Feel like butter on your skin? Check. No awkward see-through moments? Double check. And let’s not forget, the fabric has all-way stretch, meaning you can move and flow with ease. All is well whether you’re doing splits or dashing through your day.



2. Booty-Boosting, Confidence-Enhancing Perfection

Every woman deserves to feel good about her booty. Our leggings accentuate and flatter, providing that perfect contour without being too tight or too loose. The raised waistband offers extra coverage, so you never have to worry about them slipping or rolling down mid-yoga pose. Just think of it as a hug for your hips and tummy that supports you in all the right ways.



Unsure if you can pull off leggings? Yes, you can! It’s all about the right fit. With sizes from XS to XL, there’s a pair for every body, and with the high-stretch fabric, these leggings mold to your body like a second skin. You’ll feel supported, secure, and most importantly, fabulous.



3. Yoga Warrior One Moment, Fashion Icon the Next

Leggings are the most versatile piece in your wardrobe. Sure, they’ll carry you through that hot yoga class or pilates session, but they’re equally at home when paired with a cute oversized sweater or a cropped tee for a more casual, streetwear-inspired look. Go from yoga to brunch without missing a beat.

Feel like giving off ""effortlessly cool"" vibes while running errands? Done. Want to nail your at-home workout while still looking good enough for a spontaneous Zoom call? You got it. Our leggings are designed for every occasion, every style, and most importantly, every woman.

And here's the beauty, our leggings are never see-through. Whether you're doing a full backbend or just bending over to tie your shoes, you're covered. Literally. So go ahead, do your yoga class then treat yourself to a brunch. Our leggings move with you and stay opaque through it all.



**Leggings that Love Your Body as Much as You Do**

Worried about fit? Leggings are notorious for being tricky when it comes to sizing, but not ours. We’ve taken the guesswork out by offering a size range from XS to XL, ensuring that there’s something for everyone. And the fabric? It will contour to your shape in all the right ways. They highlight your booty, embracing your curves, and keeping everything secure without digging in or feeling too tight.

Whether you’ve got a petite frame, an athletic build, or curves that can stop traffic, our leggings are made to flatter. The all-way stretch means they move with you, supporting your every movement, and providing maximum comfort from the waistband to the ankles.



**Raise the Waist, Raise the Comfort**

Raised waistband is a comfort game-changer. Not only does it provide that extra bit of coverage, no accidental peekaboo moments here. It also adds a layer of tummy support that smooths and shapes without feeling constricting. It’s like wearing a gentle, supportive hug all day long.

Pair these leggings with a sports bra for your workout, or throw on a chic top and some sneakers for an off-duty model look. With a waistband that stays in place, so you can go about your day confidently.



**The Science Behind the Stretch, Why Our Leggings Feel So Good**

The magic is in the fabric. Our leggings feature a blend of polyester and 18% spandex. This makes them super soft to the touch, lightweight, and stretchy in all directions. No stiff, uncomfortable material here, just pure flexibility that moves with your body. Bend into a Warrior Pose or chase after your kids at the park.

This stretch is grade-A, meaning it provides consistent compression without ever feeling too tight. It hugs your curves while letting you breathe, stretch, and move with ease. Plus, no matter how much you stretch, bend, or squat, our leggings won’t turn see-through.



**The Leggings Lifestyle, From Mat to Street, Your Go-To Outfit**

Here’s the best part: these leggings are truly made for everything. Whether you’re hitting a yoga class, lounging at home, or dressing them up with a cute top and some boots for a night out, they’re ready for anything. With our stunning designs and matched seams for visual perfection, your outfit will never look dull or boring.

Yoga leggings are no longer reserved just for the gym. They’ve become a fashion staple because, they combine comfort and style in a way that few other clothing items can. Our leggings take that concept to the next level with designer prints, precision-crafted matching seams, and a fit that makes every body look amazing.



**A Little Love Story, Featuring Leggings**

And now for some fun! Have you ever wondered if leggings could lead to love? Well, we’ve heard a few stories from happy customers who swear that their leggings played a part in their love story.

One of our favorite anecdotes comes from Sarah, who met her now-husband during a post-yoga brunch with her friends. She was wearing her favorite pair of our leggings, when she noticed a handsome guy, that wouldn’t stop glancing her way. ""I felt so comfortable and confident in my leggings,"" she recalls, ""I didn’t even notice him until he walked up and complimented me!""

From there, the conversation flowed, and the rest, as they say, is history. It turns out that wearing something that makes you feel good on the outside can lead to other good things. Who knows? Your next pair of leggings might just be the start of your own love story.



**Time to Grab Your Perfect Pair**

So, are you ready to experience the magic of leggings that fit like a dream, move with you, and show off your best features? Whether you’re using them for yoga, lounging, or simply living your best life, our designer leggings are your go-to. Treat yourself, you deserve it.

5 months ago a beautiful girl started working where I go drink my coffee next to my job, from day 1 I liked her but I was way too afraid to approach her, feeling judged for doing that in a work place and that if something went wrong she was in the place I go everyday, and it would be akward.

Some time later I started to say hi and talk very casually and from time to time I tried to be a bit more confident and make some kind of joke (i believe she liked most of them) but I would get so anxious after that that I would stay some days just saying hi and barely talking to her (i would excuse in my mind that we dont need to talk a lot everyday and even if she wasnt with much work she was still in her work place).

This went by until last month when I had a cirurgy and had to stay at home for a months, I came back to work yesterday. We would just say Hi and no kisses nether a shake but this time I came more confident and approached her more, she gave me her hand for a shake and I didnt, i went straight to give her a kiss in the cheek she seemed fine with that if a little taken by surprise, we talked a little how things were going and I went to work and today the exact same happened but I just asked if she was ok and left to drink my coffee.

Thing is, for some time now I feel that they all can see I like her and is expected of me to give a step further when I just give one or two backwards. I feel judge by them and I dont know if she likes me enough for me to ask her out or if I should back out...

Please tell me your point of view on this and ill try to answer the questions you have.

Situation 1: was speaking to a guy for a few weeks with regular phone calls that would last 2-3 hours at a time. He offered to meet up & I accepted. We spent 7 hours (after only planning a coffee and a walk) talking about everything and nothing. By the time we were saying goodbye I had butterflies and was feeling really great. He said that he wanted to see me again. 

He’s ghosted me ever since. 


Situation 2: we spoke a few months ago for a short time then life got in the way; we reconnected and I’ve never felt this way about a man. The conversation flows so easily including voice notes late into the night. He’s been away working and due to the nature of his job he was able to chat. 

He’s come back home on leave & I can see that he’s been online, but he’s messaged me a couple of times over the past almost 2 days. 

Honestly; my heart hurts from it. Going from conversation everyday to that.. I’m not somebody who gets attached easily but this time I’ve let myself and this is the price I’m paying.

Seriously. It feels like I basically work non-stop lately. I get up in the morning, get the baby up, changed and dressed, make coffee and breakfast and then straight to work. 

I get off work and immediately start cleaning the kitchen so I can make supper for baby and then us later in the evening. 

Baby gets dropped off about 30 minutes after I get off work. So i clean until she gets dropped off, get her settled in her playpen so I can make her supper, get her fed, cleaned up and ready for bed and down for the night. At which point its time to start cooking supper. 

I finish supper just in time for husband to walk in the door and he basically washes his hands and goes straight to gaming while we eat.

By then it's after 9, closer to 10 and I'm pretty much ready for bed. 

He's home until at least noon in the mornings and all he does is feed himself and the toddler breakfast and put lunch in her bag. The rest of the morning (aside from playing with baby) is spent sitting comfortably and playing games until he has to leave to drop her off with the sitter before his work starts.

It just feels like he does a very tiny amount of work daily. I know he cooks a meal for them (usually eggs) but he doesn't clean anything up when he's done, doesn't wipe down the highchair or table, doesn't pick anything up off the floor or even set the couch cushions up properly or fold the blankets on the couch. 

I feel like I'm constantly working with no time to myself just to try and keep the place looking slightly acceptable. 

I've complained about having so much to do before and he just says ""So? Delegate then"" but he will not even consider lifting a finger without explicit instructions to do so.

All I can say is, it must be nice to be a husband and just come home from work and not have to lift a finger to do anything else. ",4,1727985226.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

This is basically my pack loadout for temps between 30-80F in 8,000-11,000 mile elevation in the Colorado mountains. Total weight varies between 42-52lbs depending on food.

Klymit Static V Luxe (30"") sleeping pad 

REI Magma 15 sleeping bag 

Durston X-Mid 2 tent, stakes and carbon poles

Glock 40 (10mm) + spare mag (flat nose hard cast) 

Sawyer squeeze filter

Flavor packets/coffee water filter + tablets aspirin / ibuprofen / anti diarrhea pills / tums / adderall / oxycotin / chlorine or iodine tablets 

Everclear 95% alcohol 50ml bottles (vodka has too much water)

Stihl Chainsaw (Rather lug 10lbs of chainsaw 20 miles than use a handsaw)

Favorite foods are fish, shin ramen, oatmeal, trail mix, peak refuel, granola bars.



**My buddy brings a jet boil stove, first aid trauma kit, GPS watch. I usually bring between 1-8 16oz bottles of water depending on water resources, 4 empty gallon jugs for water storage and more food, depending on how many days, about 3,000 calories per day, butter and worms for fishing. My aussiedoodle carries his own food and pulls me with a leash attached to my belt. When temps drop below 30F, I'll bring long johns, an extra towel and sleeping pad for dog.** 

  
This setup has been working for me for the last 6 backpacking trips between 5-25 miles on trails and off trails. I always camp near a lake or stream. For me, 40lbs is lightweight, 60lbs is doable, 70lbs is my limit when going up mountains (cramp town).

1fvgf89,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1fvgf89/dog_days/,Dog days,"This story takes place at my last job. It's not strictly speaking tech support, more along the lines of something getting in the way of tech support. Will remove if it really doesn't fit the sub.

Tl;dr: I troubleshooted a security system, and it fought back.

Cast of characters:

    $Me: Linux system administrator. PFY without the P or the Y. Mild streaks of BOFH.
    $UnluckyColleague: Exactly what it says on the tin. Name and function within the company irrelevant to the story.
    $LuckierColleague: Ditto.
    $Dog: Overzealous but extremely well configured mobile quadrupedal security implement, of the canine variety.

We had a power outage last night. No big deal. As I'm making my rounds, coffee in hand, trying to see if every piece of hardware recovered correctly, in comes $UnluckyColleague, winded as if he ran a mile down the road. I inquire about his current status, to which he informs me that he was chased by one of our neighbor's guard dogs who somehow jumped the fence. Fence that is a good two and a half meters high. Dogs don't jump that high, do they ?

I'm used to dogs. Been around them for a sizeable part of my life. Hell I know those guard dogs specifically (what with being neighbors and all), I'm sure I can guide him back to his kennel.

This, my dear readers, is what you probably already identified as hubris.

That dog in particular is a new one. I open the door and spot the creature, but instead of a Belgian Shepherd, I am faced with an absolute unit of a Dogo Argentino (heretofore identified as $Dog). He calmly walks up to me, and tries to put me down with his paws. Judging by the force I felt at that moment, this dog was easily around 40 kilos. Heccin chonker.

I attempt to explain to $Dog that I am not a threat - as the concept of not needing to guard the neighbor's building is probably a little bit foreign to him - and surprisingly he isn't aggressive at all. I'm no expert in animal behavior, but I imparted this to $Dog simply being trained to not maul whatever highway bandit he catches to death, instead just putting them down and lying on them until further notice. He seems to at least understand I mean no harm, so that's a promising start. Let's stop that right there.

Have you ever had 40 kilograms of something hurled at you at roughly Usain Bolt's top speed ? Welp, that's what happened when I moved about three meters away and beckoned $Dog to follow me back out to the neighbor. He was trained to stop people, and, come hell or high water, he was going to do his job. Even if he was *technically* off-duty. Now I'm lying down with half my weight in dog on my chest, and some newfound perspective regarding Newton's second law of motion. Mostly an upwards looking one, in fact.

Convincing $Dog to let me stand up wasn't too difficult, but he seemed to insist on me not moving. At all. Again, not an expert in animal behaviour, but his body language indicated a good amount of anxiety, and he seemed to instinctively fall back on his training. I hold him by the collar whenever other colleagues pass me by and explain the situation; The neighbor was actually plain not there at all, and it'd be a while before he could show up to collect $Dog. That's certainly one way to start the day.

Enter the Wi-Fi being down. Because *of course* it has to go down *now*.

At this point in time it's around 8:30 in the morning, the Wi-Fi is down, and I'm on the phone explaining to one of my colleagues what to check on both the WAP and in the server closet to try and restart the network, while $Dog does his best to lay me flat on the ground using all of his strength. You ever tried fighting both a dog and rebellious network equipment at the same time ? Man it's not as fun as it sounds. (Beats early morning meetings though)

The more astute among you might have noticed a named character that hasn't appeared in this story. Enter $LuckierColleague, proud owner of a dog herself. A lovely female Samoyed to be precise. Therefore covered head to toe in female-samoyed-scented freshly shed winter coat.

Remember that $Dog is 40 kilos of canine muscle ? I think I mentioned this once or twice. I'm no slouch myself in terms of the mass department, but the surprise pull, bolstered by the inattention brought up by trying to explain to somebody how to restart the WAP, sent me on a downward parabolic trajectory at a velocity that I would tend to qualify as ""OUCH"".

$LuckierColleague attempts to pick me up, which predictably gets countered by $Dog trying to jump on her (though this time it's a little less job related). $Dog is actually taller than she is when he stands on his hind legs, and I'd wager he isn't that much lighter either. This is probably not going to end well... Except, well, seems like $Dog likes her a lot more than he does me. Wonder why.

She relieves me of my duty of dogsitting (in the sense of being the one the dog sits on), seemingly able to wrangle the beast with far more ease than I could muster. Must be a druid with Animal Friendship. I quickly book it to the server closet to sort that Wi-Fi issue.

One of the teaching assistants had her daughter (f19) helping out and volunteering on the trip too. 

She first caught my eye when I got in the building, I had one of those 😯 moments when I saw her. I ended up sat next to her on the bus and, although we didn't talk the whole time, I enjoyed my time talking to her; I actually ended up paired with her and her group for the whole day which I was glad about. She was fun to talk to and we had a few laughs together throughout the day. She was also ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE with the children which is, of course, a major green flag.

I wanted to talk to her and get to know her more, maybe even go out and get a coffee or something but I was way too nervous to ask during the trip and then I missed my chance at the end of the day as we left and missed each other by literally a minute.

I want to talk to her more but I don't know how best to go about it. 

I didn't ask for her number and she doesn't work there with me, only volunteering for that trip. I sometimes end up making small talk with her mother in the hallways as we walk past each other, she's always really friendly to me, but I feel that going up to her and saying how I feel about her own daughter is kinda weird and wont go down well. 

My only ideas are mentioning her up in those small talks, bringing her up and asking how she's getting on etc. My other idea is waiting and hoping for both her and I end up on the next trip next month and then after that, I maybe ask her out for a coffee. 

Hopefully y'all are smart enough to give me some good advice on this cause I've never been great at this stuff.

I work at a coffee shop now and can be a bit quiet and anxious with all the new people around everyday. But, I think part of the reason I stay that way is because it’s not something I care about. When I worked as a CNA or even a nanny that anxiety faded away over time because I loved and believed in what I was doing. I feel like those times in my life were the happiest and most myself I’ve ever felt in a job. I plan to keep taking medication and going to therapy to manage my anxiety..  

I think part of the thing that scares me is having so much responsibility and needing to talk with confidence. I’m always second guessing myself and making myself shrink/ feel small. It feels like I can’t take myself seriously. I have this idea that I’m not put together enough to be able to help with other people like that… especially since OT sometimes helps with social skills. I want to believe I can do more than I’m telling myself but I’m scared. I have a deep respect for myself and all I’ve been through but my self esteem is low. I think I have Autism and ADHD and I’m thinking I may get tested soon. I’m wondering if maybe knowing that about myself and then going to therapy with the full picture could help me understand myself better and gain some confidence. 

Anyone have a similar experience? Would you recommend healthcare? Anyone specifically work in OT? I’m struggling to figure out what I want to do because I feel like I need to feel passionate/ care deeply about it so I’ll be motivated to keep doing it.  I’ve also noticed that in the past, the more social I would get, the less scared I would become over time. I’ve just been stuck in this phase of bad social anxiety for a couple years now and have this fear I will always be this way. ",0,1727984091.0,socialanxiety,0,0.5,False

I have been experiencing **sudden strong urges to urinate** that takes a lot for me to hold in. I recently woke up with a strong urge to urinate but could not use the restroom because my roommate was using it; I urinated a little before I could finally relieve myself, but not a tremendous amount came out. The next night I accidentally urinated in my sleep while having the ""urinal"" dream. When I do relieve myself, I urinate a normal amount.

I have had **no issues with bladder control in the past**. As a matter of fact, I have been able to hold in strong urges to pee for 30-45 minutes, allowing me to pee for around 1 minute and 30 seconds.

I have been drinking **2-3 40 oz. Owala mugs per day**, sometimes more to loosen my mucus from post-nasal drip.

I am currently working in a hospital as a **CNA** where I do work with a lot of incontinent individuals.

BP usually sits around **110/70**. I have a **family hx of diabetes (dad)**, but I have not been diagnosed with diabetes. My coworkers test my **fasted blood sugar** for fun and it is always **within normal limits**; I do however note that I do snack on candy almost everyday when I am working.

I've read online that the color may stain on clothes, which is something that's holding me back. I am also curious about the quality. I know leather is deemed to wrinkle, but how is the quality and durability of this bag?

1fvg3aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1fvg3aj/self_motivation_for_today/,self motivation for today,"hi all, just coming here to log my thoughts. posted last week about a setback i had last tuesday and being worried about a wedding i had to attend this past weekend.

i did not manage to stay sober at the wedding and ended up on a 48 hour binge that left me lagging at work monday and hurting mentally.

a friend unexpectedly came into town on monday and needed a place to stay for the week and so they are currently living with me. they do not know about my struggles with alcohol and drink a lot themselves but i have been avoiding temptation so far by using an upcoming deadline at work to justify my early bedtimes and lack of interest in going out.

well, two things happened this morning that triggered me a bit. first, the work deadline i had been stressing about got extended, and my boss gave me reassurance that i was progressing well on the project (despite me not feeling that way at all and dealing with a healthy dose of impostor syndrome related to it). this has lessened my desire to continue working hard this week and the thoughts are starting to creep in --

""well, you blocked off your whole day tomorrow to work on something which isn't so important anymore.. you know what that means, right? you could drink tonight and sleep it off tomorrow.""

second, i had a coffee date planned this afternoon which just got pushed back to an evening time at a place which still serves coffee but also serves beer and wine. i know my date is going to now opt for a drink instead of coffee as originally planned, and i am *so* tempted to join in given the stressful week i've already had and the lack of urgency to be productive tomorrow.

i'm trying to play the tape forward and collect some thoughts --

* my date tonight will likely just have one or two drinks before we part ways. i will part ways and almost certainly continue drinking until i'm hammered.

* if i'm productive tomorrow despite my extended deadline, i can really knock this important project out of the park and reduce stress next week

* next week i need to begin packing up my apartment for a move at the end of the month. if i can keep a sober streak going through this weekend, i'll be really well set up to accomplish this without the usual last minute scramble that accompanies moving.

* i've already made so much progress this week -- i've exercised, slept, and eaten well. that would go to waste if i drank tonight.",2,1727983906.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

1fvg23i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1fvg23i/there_is_light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel/,There is light at the end of the tunnel.,"Hey everyone, just wanted to pen down a few thoughts before I leave this channel. Reading everyone's posts here really affirmed that heartbreak is a universal experience. I want to be able to leave a note behind to help everyone who are really struggling and just trudging through the mud now.

Just a bit of background - I was blindsided by a person I thought I was going to marry. My world literally fell apart afterwards - unhealthy friendships started to show, my self-identity was completely gone, poor social support. I invested all my energy and time into keeping this relationship alive, that I didn't realise I have neglected myself and my other relationships all this time. I was stuck in negative cycles - constantly kept thinking he was the one for me, and watching those tarot card readings and youtube videos about how to get your ex back. He continued to breadcrumb me, so I waited and waited for him to change his mind. Just 2 months ago, I found out that he was already dating someone new. I remember feeling so lost, so alone. I never thought things would get better for me. But how wrong was I...

**I am here to tell you that you will get through it all.** Even when you feel like you aren't going to make it. I promise you it does get better. If there is one thing I have learnt, healing is non-linear. Some days you feel at the top of the world, and some days, well you end up sobbing and doomscrolling sad breakup TikToks. But let yourself feel the emotions. In hindsight, I kept approaching the breakup from a logical perspective - thinking I deserved better, that we were not meant for each other, etc. It was only after I truly had waves of tears (and passing out from crying - please don't!). I felt better. Wipe those tears, get up, move your body (works like magic). Even if it's just drinking a glass of water, light stretches or running to taylor swift's TTPD album and cursing your ex at the same time (so cathartic). How much we grief is a testament to our ability to love. **Give yourself grace and self-compassion**, the same you would have given them or the people you love.

One thing I struggled with was thinking that he was the one I was destined to be with. and that he was the best person for me. I put him on a pedestal all this while, and it hindered my healing. I know you all are tired of hearing 'There are plenty of fishes in the sea'. Trust me, I HATED hearing that shit. But there are MILLIONS of people in the world, and I promise you when the time is right, and when you become the best version of yourself/ heal from this/ heal your inner child, love will find you. I am not seeing anyone now, as I know deep down I am still not ready. But I trust that the universe will work its magic someday (because I'm just a lover girl at heart). Bring them down from the pedestal, and watch yourself detach. **Detachment is the game changer**. There are many resources online to do this. You are special too, my love. Your energy is what is putting them so high up there. You are whole, just on your own. And isn't that beautiful? I wish you could see your own light.

Set your mind to move on from this person (no 10% of wishing this person will come back and 90% of 'letting go'). COMPLETELY THROW THIS PERSON OUT OF YOUR MIND. Erase all the futures, hopes and dreams with them. It's painful severing the bond but this is when your healing truly start. This is when you truly prioritise yourself. It took me 7 months to get to this stage because I waited around for him, hoping he would change his mind. The person may come back eventually, but you will thank yourself for upgrading and discerning if you even still want this person at the end. Daily affirmations help - write it down, paste it everywhere in your house, write on your mirror. Journalling helps - not just when you feel sad. You need to record your happy/ empowering moments too! So when you feel like shit, you can still go back to the journal and see that you have the ability to feel happy too.

Turn your story from a wounded, disempowering one into one of strength, hope and deep knowing that everything happened for a higher purpose. It is easier said than done, and it could be premature if the breakup only recently happened for you. But connect with everything that turned out for the better as a result of this breakup. (if you feel like you don't have any - search harder. It could be newfound peace that you never had with your toxic ex. Or it could be having coffee with an old friend which you never had time to do while in a relationship).

Ego-death feels like death, but it won't kill you. You could have lost yourself somewhere in the process. And this breakup could have completely thrown your life off-course. But sit with it, meditate, do guided reflections on everything that has happened in your life. Find unhealthy patterns, learn to heal your wounded inner child. **This is your time to re-invent yourself.** What a rare opportunity! No more old baggage or limitations or people's perceptions of you holding you back. Do something that you could never do/ did not feel motivated to pursue in the relationship. The right person would have lovingly pushed you to be the best version of yourself - I never felt that way. I slacked off at work, did not exercise, ate junk food and rotted at home watching TV shows. Example: I was never a runner. I hated it with passion, and I thought I was the most unfit person. But I signed up for a half marathon and I have never stopped running since. I also took the time to connect with old friends that I have completely neglected. And if that is not an option, make new friends. Post-breakup, I felt so present connecting with new people. It was such a refreshing change. I also started trusting my intuition more, and took myself out on solo dates. This experience completely changed me physically, emotionally and spiritually. I have never felt more connected to myself and the world around me. I feel lighter, happier and more confident. I can now safely say I love myself. It took me a long time and showing up for myself when I just wanted to give up to get to this stage.

If the breakup has been a really long time that it no longer feels 'socially acceptable' to still be sad about it or if you have reached a point where you feel like you have exhausted all your options to make yourself feel bette, do consider therapy. I am having a few sessions now and it has helped me changed my negative thought patterns tremendously.

**There is light at the end of the tunnel. Those months of grief and sorrow - they turn into weeks, then days, then hours, and somedays you go without thinking of them at all. And even when you do think of them, they just become a passing thought, a distant memory that no longer holds as much sorrow. The thought passes, and you carry on with the rest of your day.**

These are just some of the lessons that I have learnt on my personal journey, and I hope they helped or comforted you at least. If you have read till the end, I know you must be going through a deep pain. I am sorry that you are going through this. It is never easy, no matter how many breakups you have gone through. I can only hope that you muster up whatever strength you have left in you to fight. **Fight with everything you have.** You deserve so much from the world, more than what your ex could ever offer you. The world is your oyster, love. You only live once, so make it count - go be the best version of you. I am always rooting for you, and I cannot wait to see you thrive.

Then two. 

Then four. 

Then five. 

Then seven. 

Then eight. 

Today I found out that it was nine. Nine in 6 months. He insisted it was “only for coffee.”

Then he admitted one made a pass at him but he rejected it. 

Then two tried to hook up but he rejected it. 

Then I found a guy he had hooked up with twice. 

Now it was three blowjobs, a handjob, and sex once. 

He never used protection.

I manufacture and sell coffee flavorings (think like Hazelnut and vanilla and stuff), and I market both to business like coffee shops and to individuals. I do everything online, and sell on places like Amazon, Walmart, etc. 

However, I've recently been toying around with the concept of opening a physical location, possibly even a coffee shop. I would continue to sell online, but I would also open a coffee shop that uses my flavoring in the coffee it sells. The reason I'm hesitant to do so is because the rent, hiring an employee, keeping set hours (right now I work from home and on my own time), and possibly not making enough extra to justify the added headache and expenditure stresses me out. I've got a great location picked out, a marketing strategy, and even a bakery that is interested in partnering with me to sell baked goods and help with overhead costs if I did this. 

I just need someone who's ""been there, done that"" to help me go over the risk vs reward in doing something like this. I don't want to risk losing my business. If I moved to a physical location, the rent would be about $300/mo more than what I currently pay to produce my product. If I can make $300 a month extra in profit from opening a coffee shop, then I won't owe anything else out of pocket beyond paying for the equipment and liscencing to get it set up. 

Are there hidden costs I'm not seeing? Is it worth it in the long run? Is there potential for increased profits, or Is this a sinkhole? Should I focus my attention entirely on building up my online business? Any thoughts appreciated. ",1,1727983488.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

Appliances like TVs, gaming consoles, and small kitchen appliances still draw power even when turned off but are still plugged in in the outlet.

You can consider unplugging small kitchen appliances like toasters, blenders, and coffee makers, as well as entertainment devices such as gaming consoles and DVD players. Appliances like desktops and printers, along with portable fans and space heaters, can also be unplugged if they aren’t used often.

While unplugging can help reduce your electricity bill, it's not practical for larger appliances like refrigerators or washing machines. Instead, focus on smaller devices you don’t use frequently. Using power strips can make it easier to disconnect multiple devices at once. Unplugging appliances can lead to some energy savings, especially for rarely used items, but it would probably cause more hassle to you in the long term.

I was crying when getting ready to go somewhere as a child and walked on my toes so my mom took me to doctors since I was a child but nothing was found. I struggled through school but I had an extremely supportive family who helped me with homework, I had tutors later as well, my parents never shouted at me, and if I struggled with something they would reward me for doing it. I also went to therapists. Was prescribed herbal calming medicine but it only made it harder for me to focus. So I stopped taking it

When I was 18 I had a big burn-out with university and my friend who works with special needs kids told me to look into ADHD. I did and everything matched except hyperactivity. I talked to my mom and she said she remembered doctors thinking I might have it. Getting diagnosed would be useless cause in Russia where I'm from stimulators are illegal and getting misdiagnosed with depression could have real-life consequences for me.

Luckily now I live in Belgium so I decided to get diagnosed here. Found a psychologist who works with ADHD and she assessed me. It lasted for around 3 hours and later she concluded I don't have ADHD. She saw the problem with my lack of focus but thought I was dyslexic and maybe something was wrong with my stress processing. But said wasn't impulsive enough during making exercises. It kinda made me feel really bad. Like I was bullied in every educational setting and seeing that I have 85 IQ and very poor processing skills made me feel really bad she said Ritalin could help with my issues and I just needed to see a psychiatrist but it made me feel really bad. The worst I have ever felt. I wanted to give up on it forever. I also have some medical trauma that happened a few years ago about my autoimmune condition. I needed to fight for months for diagnosis and they gaslit me that there was nothing serious when my thyroid stopped functioning completely and it was seen on my blood tests. 

My partner has ADHD and it runs in his family so they just gave pills for me to try. I didn't touch it for a few days but once decided to try and it worked wonders. It made me sleepy and bored of the video game I was addicted to. I also never cared about stuff about me being messy but now I started noticing lol and it was disgusting so I started cleaning it up. It didn't block my emotions completely i still cried when I watched a sad movie and when my dog was acting weird I still panicked. I was extremely calm and relaxed. The sounds of my partner chewing or socks no longer annoyed me. Studying and reading was extremely easy and I could retrieve my focus easily if I lost it. Talking the local language also became so much easier. I could also understand Spanish which I didn't practice for years. 

I talked to my family doctor and admitted I tried Ritalin and it works for me wonders so she sent me to a neurologist. The neurologist didn't see nerve damage and started telling me that anxiety could do this to me because I was in a new place and stuff. I told him I was always like this and the only difference was that my mom who always did shit I couldn't do is not here. He told me Ritalin is basically ecstasy and it just relaxes some people. And I should look and look for other psychologists and psychiatrists till I find the right one I just cried but I asked him if he could see adhd on MRI and he said yes so I will do this next week.

I feel really bad. It feels like I'm back to the past when doctors just don't believe me and they actually try to help me but I freak out and walk away. I also felt better before I started this process. I am also not very financially secure at the moment and I spent 1000 euros just to feel worse. Everyone is telling me to get therapy but I feel way worse when I'm around doctors again. 

I think the first psychologist was wrong. I told her the issues that bother me the most like forgetting to take my medication or procrastination to the point where I can't get a refill on my medication and it makes my kidneys underperform. I also said to her that I don't think anyone in my family has ADHD and my mom had a myoma when she was pregnant and the psychologist thought it was a ""natural cause"". Well, being on Ritalin helped me understand that my mom probably has it and my grandma has. Both of them had shopping addictions and my mom drinks like 10 coffees to function daily and focusing is also hard for her. My mom also has restless leg syndrome, she is forgetful and emotional, she also admitted she doesn't brush her teeth if she doesn't need to go out that day. My ADHD partner couldn't remember my struggles and just said his biggest struggles that I have too like forgetting my headphones or losing my phone all the time 

So ye now everyone thinks I'm delusional and worried about what I will do if I don't have ADHD and I don't know myself.  Just thinking about therapy makes me cry because I need to face my biggest fear lol. I am no longer taking Ritalin so I'm just back to my old self just less pessimistic and more scared of doctors. I also gotta wait months till I can see a psychiatrist and I don't wanna do therapy while I'm unmedicated. And my mom thinks people who aren't scared of doctors are weird. 

I haven't seen any stories like mine or even close to it. Usually, doctors don't believe in the whole existence of ADHD but she wasn't even old or dismissive. I am lost at the moment.

1fvfsgt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvfsgt,Caffè Equilibrato,"This is my entry for [October's competition thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ftfavo/original_cocktail_competition_october_2024_coffee/)

My aim was to create a balanced cocktail with ingredients that most home-bartenders have, so everyone can make and enjoy this drink.

##Caffè Equilibrato
2 oz French Brandy
1 oz Cocchi Di Torino Sweet Vermouth 
0.75 oz Lemon Juice
0.5 oz brewed coffee (Moka pot, Espresso or French press to keep the Italian-French theme) 
Optional 0.25 oz Egg white (or your choice of cocktail foamer)

###Building the drink
Dry Shake first, if using Egg white.
Shake well with ice and double strain into a chilled Coupe glass. (If you're not using egg white or foamers, you can served in an old fashioned glass on the rocks) 

Express Lemon oil on top of the drink and then garnish with a twist of lemon

I chose a French Brandy as it compliments the Sweet Vermouth well. However I wouldn't recommend one that's too mellow, for eg. St Remy VSOP.

I used Medium Roast coffee. If you can't brew your own coffee, you can add 1tsp of a good instant coffee into 0.5oz hot water.

### Tasting Notes
Your start with the lemon and coffee notes on the nose. 
The taste starts with a slight sour note from the lemon, followed by the sweetness from the vermouth and Brandy, ending with the bitter notes from the coffee.
While you get more coffee in the first 2 sips, your palate will start picking more of the Brandy and vermouth notes by the 3rd sip.
The Cocchi Di Torino shines through the strong coffee flavor and hence its my choice of sweet vermouth. 

PS: This is not a post dinner drink, unless you're planning for a long night. ",15,1727983117.0,cocktails,2,1.0,False

For context, I already had a higher anxiety level before starting the drug so even if it did increase the anxiety I wouldn't know if that was bupropion or just me.

I also had a decreased appetite before starting because I have GERD and I was in a flare up when we started bupropion. I was trying to manage the flare up without medication and still am. But its almost 2 months in and my appetite is subminimal.

My sleep was almost unaffected till last week. This week I've felt like I had 10 cups of coffee. I feel tired but just can't go to sleep. On days I am up till as late as 3.30am.

Vertigo was the only major reaction in terms of physical problems. It almost seemed like everything was moving round and round so fast. I was in the middle of an ophthalmology class lol and I could hardly understand what was being said.

I've been on antidepressants earlier so I basically knew these things would happen. The fear isn't in these smaller physical problems. I fear the mental consequences. When some drug plays with your mind, that is when nobody can intervene or do anything.

I was behaving strange last night. Tried to put myself off to sleep by 11am. Closed my eyes. Started to see myself in a seminar room lifting a chair and throwing it on the floor. I tried to ignore but it wouldn't go. Repeated quite a few times. Then I sat up and tried to relax and sleep again. Next I saw myself going to the bathroom, opening the bottle of floor cleaner and drinking the whole of it. Disturbed me a lot and kept repeating. Next I saw myself opening my cupboard and getting hold of the knife and stabbing myself in the right side of abdomen. It was that precise. I could see the procedure in all three times.

Sat up multiple times trying to calm down and sleep again. Got extremely frustrated. It was 1am. Then idk what struck me. My mood just switchted so randomly from feeling extremely frustrated to extremely sad and hopeless. I felt like I was done with everything. And being alive for one more moment would've led me to become more of a burden than I already am. Opened the door and went to the balcony. I am only on thr 4th floor of the hostel building so nothing to worry as such.

Came back and opened a previous prescription of mine. Started writing on it as to what changed and what didn't, since the prescription was from April 2024 and I never took the pills back then. Then turned the paper and legit wrote a suicide note. ""Sorry for my strange behaviour, I am as confused as you are as to why I am behaving this way"" ""You guys are too good I don't deserve any of you. Thank you for being by my side. Bye. Won't ever trouble you again"" I was starting to feel really unsafe alone in my room after this.

Was insomnia turning me into a stupid person? I had no plans of suicide. I just saw a couple of methods while trying to sleep. It was already 2.30 by then. Tried sleeping again but the images kept disturbing me. Finally I guess I slept after 3.30am

I want to tell all this to my doctor in the next follow up appointment I have with him. He's a very sweet person with amazing patience and listening abilities. But the issue is if I tell him, he might feel that the depression is getting worse. And if he feels it has gotten severe he might tell someone around me like my batchmates(fyi I live in a hostel) or even my parents. I don't want anyone to know. None of them even know that I am on bupropion. Only 2 people know I am taking help for depression. Probably psychotherapy. They know nothing about medications I am taking or all of this.

I hate worrying people. It felt strange to me yesterday night and it was pretty scary but I am alive right. Why make people believe it is very serious?

With regard to any positive effects, I don't see anything yet. But this depression has been there for 3 years or more. I don't expect it to get better in 40 days. I want the drug to settle in and do its job. I don't want to jump to conclusions. ",2,1727983087.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,2,1.0,False

I was deployed to my cousins birthday party in 2015, and it changed me. This was right after N-Strike darts were obsoleted by the Rival balls, and let me tell you I just wasn’t prepared for it. None of us were. Shortly after presents were opened I wandered into an understrength platoon-sized element of giggly preteens hopped up on cake and mello-yellow. I had seen them playing earlier but they would always hit and run (because I was bigger than them) but this time was different; they converged exactly on my position in a coordinated assault. I took cover behind a couch, but in doing so my grandparents asked me to move because I was getting tangled up in grandpa’s oxygen line and they also didn’t want to get hit. As soon as I left cover, I was spotted by their recon element and chased into the yard. I was separated from my can of soda (left it on the coffee table) for nearly 10 minutes while I evaded patrols until they ran out of ammo and had to pick some up. It was hot out, and because I had left my soda in the house I got really thirsty in those ten minutes and it sucked. Turns out after I got back that my uncle Dan had fed my cousin and his friends Intel on my location & provided overwatch while they mobilized en masse. I think back to that party sometimes, and I thank god that I got him an RC boat instead of an extra package of ammo otherwise they could have pinned me down for fifteen, maybe even twenty minutes. If I had to go that long without a fizzy sweet beverage, I don’t know if I would have made it back home that night.

Starting from lowest, my dose was increased over 2 weeks until I could finally start feeling effects. For the past week, I started taking 25mg of Adderall XR after being unmedicated my whole life. And wow. It was so calm and quiet all of a sudden? All of the random thoughts popping up just stopped. It was relaxing and nice and peaceful.
So relaxing infact that I fell asleep after 2 hours lol

Next couple of days, same thing. As soon as it kicked in, I was more focused but also calmer. Got some stuff done and was happy about how much easier it was to stay in task. But  after 2-3 hours, without all of the chaos in my head keeping me awake, I would be relaxed and inevitably take a nap. The days I didn’t take Adderall, I stayed awake just fine, but got even less done because of how distracted and unfocused I was. 

I thought Adderall was supposed to be energizing so I’m kinda confused why it’s not completely working for me. Like it does improve my focus and concentration, but not energy levels or motivation. I’ve tried coffee and caffeine drinks but they give the same effect at a lower level — a bit more focus, but  does not keep me energized. I see a lot of people using caffeine to stay awake, but it doesn’t work for me no matter how much I take. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? And what did you do to fix it? I really like improvements I’m seeing from the Adderall but apparently my brain interprets lack of chaos as time to sleep lol",1,1727982460.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

So I F23 just had my birthday a a day before and my  friends(girls) A and B who I met at work they did not even come talk to me way later in the day. A wished me Happy Birthday on the day of in the evening but B did not even text me she told me today that she forgot. Now for both for their birthdays we celebrated bought cake and gifts but they did not even wish me.

The problem was not only the birthday I have felt leftout for few months and have been feeling very shitty like they do not care about me we work for the same company and on the same floor are seats are also near and we are known as a trio.
But it always feels like I am unwanted or better alone.
They always take brakes together and go for coffee or to eat something but don't even bother to tell me. For Dinner if one of them is in a meeting they always wait for the another one and text them, but when I am in a meeting they just go. 

One time I had a meeting right after their meeting and I waited for them when I was in the meeting they told me they would go ahead and wait for me to come as soon as the meeting finished I went to them for dinner and they got up to go for some as soon as I sat down and I ate alone.
Today again they were on break and didn't tell me so I went to dinner alone and felt so peaceful 

I feel so lonely when I am with them and I am not good at talking in person about my feelings.

Please let me know what to do

So I did. I’ve watched so many thousands of hours of interviews with all of the experts, And I talked to lion diet for six months, beef, lamb, salt, water, and while it lifted my spirits lightly, it was nothing major. Definitely nothing like I used to feel back in my early 20s when I was optimistic. Even on diet, the depression still got in the way of me getting anything done. This completely goes against everything I’ve seen and read, including Dr Chris Palmer‘s book in which he put all of his psychiatric patients suffering from depression on a diet of under 20 g of carbohydrates a day and so pretty much 100% cure rates across the board. Why isn’t it working for me? I thought it was probably because diet can’t cure horrible life situation. And it’s my horrible life situation I’m trapped in that is causing my depression. However, in order to escape it, I need at least some level of optimism to be able to try new things and to not constantly think they won’t work. And to try things without feeling burnt out mentally. After six months of lion diet and feeling frustrated, I decided to incorporate other things and so I went down to strict carnival so I incorporated fish, salmon, bronze, and various other animal products. I felt slightly better and slightly less depressed simply because of mouth pleasure. It’s like, I get no happiness from any other area of my life, but at least I have a small amount of mouth pleasure. That doesn’t mean I didn’t love the beef and lamb, I do love them, but when you are online diet, I feel so full all day because of the high nutritional value of the food that the number of times I get to experience mouth pleasure is very low, in terms of the number of minutes I get to experience it. Now after a trip abroad where I couldn’t access meet, I have kind of fallen off the wagon and given up somewhat, I went down to keto, and now I am down to dirty keto. This means I try to stick with low-carb foods for meals, but I don’t prevent myself from having, cups of tea or cake at the local bakeries, I don’t stop myself from socialising at restaurants and eating and sharing the same things that other people have. I know that my physical health issues are gradually creeping back in. And so this isn’t healthy physically. But mentally, I already feel happier. I wouldn’t say my depression is completely gone, but at least I have moments of feeling good, and those moments are usually when I’m looking forward to eating breakfast or coffee and cake in the afternoon. I’m starting to experience joy again but only in the form of looking forward to Food. I just don’t know what to do. If being a drug addict in withdrawal means being depressed or unable to experience pleasure for the rest of my life, would I prefer a life on drugs with daily pleasures knowing that there is a risk of chronic diseases? I was hoping, that I would experience more joy and pleasure on carnival or lion diet. But having done it long-term, I’m really starting to believe there are new answers there that people don’t talk about, such as life situation. I really need to improve my life situation, but Lond diet wasn’t helping me to do that. If anything, the lack of joy on it was in many ways getting in the way. Online diet, five minutes of eating fills me up for the whole day. I guess this is natural and works in nature because it means you could spend the rest of the time fighting to survive, hunting, having kids, Building hats, exercising with tribe members, swimming in the sea, walking in nature, and doing natural things with a purpose. My my life situation is such that I don’t have access to those things. I am forced at the moment to live in an urban area where I only get about two hours of sunlight a day, never get to see sunrise or sunset, rarely see sunlight at all due to clouds, can’t move area due to immigration status and work, have tried for the last 15 years to upgrade my life, move area, change jobs, but unfortunately keep on ending back in similar life situations. I look at people on YouTube who have successfully done these diets, the most notable is Dante Ferrigno and Homesteadhow - but one wonders how well they would’ve done had they lived a year in my shoes. Even having access to live in a country like USA with multiple time zones and Weather zones with possibility to live closer to nature with cheaper accommodation options, would be a massive upgrade, even if I was on minimum wage there. I think there are so many complexities to some of our lives that trap us in our situation and it can be difficult for the rest of us who haven’t experienced those complex cities, to understand how lucky we are compared to others. There are so many things we take for granted that other people don’t have, such as simple things like access to sunlight.

I’ve tried every piece of carnival medical advice I could get my hands on, from supplementing vitamin D, B6, to eating more organs and liver, I’ve tried raw meat, animal based, carnivore, lion diet, from what I can tell I feel my best on lion diet Cooked rare, but it doesn’t solve my lack of pleasure in life and my depression. Today I’ve been pretty much off diet and I am the happiest I have been in a very long time. I’m even feeling inspired to start a new business and try once again to escape this horrible life situation I’m in. That’s more than I have felt for the past nine months on carnivore. I don’t know what I’m writing asking here because I don’t think there is any advice anyone can give me that I haven’t heard before, but I’d appreciate some words of support, particularly hearing from anyone who has been through anything similar and managed to solve it. Thanks.

PS- I appreciate this is quite long, and I’m voice dictating it on iPhone so apologies if it makes no sense. To summarise: I believe fasting and carnivore are physically and mentally the optimal diet but it’s cannot compensate for a horrible life, (lost my stable home, lost support network, family, no opportunities to move up the career ladder, lost business, tried various different ways of fixing the situation for the last 15 years, but it seems that once you were at the bottom of society, in England, it’s very difficult to move up) and my experience is that I seem to need that unnatural mood bump I get from sugar and mouth pleasure from unnatural processed carbohydrates, to get me to experience enough optimism and pleasure to escape this horrible life situation and to keep going. despite the long-term damage, I know it is doing to my body. 

Sucks. 

But for the first time in a very long time, I’m feeling optimistic today, and trying to figure out a new way of doing a new business, and it’s all as a result of coming off diet completely recently and eating sugar. 

I hope this post does not get banned for not being strict  carnivore because it really is strict- I’ve been strict for nine months, I’m looking for advice if that’s even possible. 

Already seeing the physically deleterious effects of being on sugar creep back in. But I need the mouth pleasure and optimism to make a go of escaping this situation :(",4,1727981896.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

I can feel and see things from time to time if I really relax and clear my mind. 
Okay, so unto my mother. I love her of coarse she my mother she gave me life.
But my mother was pure evil and manipulative. Everyone loved her face value but behind the closed door evil lurked.
I had a falling out with her and my step father about 11 years ago. She lied and manipulated me my whole life. I was unaware my step father was my step father for pretty much my whole life.. 52 now confronted when I was 41 after a ancestry test.
This is when we had the issue, being of that age and not being told who my real father was turning adult at 18 rubbed me wrong.
I confronted her about it and she denied and manipulated the covo... I was done with that noise and was hurt and pretty much cut her off with any contact for those 11 years.

I had a corporate meet the end of July out of town. Wife wanted a Lil vacation for the week so we booked a air bnb place was nice right on the river next to the ocean.
We have 3 dogs and the beds where queen size so I decided to sleep in another room with my dog. As I go to bed and lay down it begins to rain. Maybe 10 min pass and I open my eyes and look to the foot of the bed... there is a transparent white mist at the foot of the bed I kinda shrug it off and think it's an older home sure someone is checking me out, the moment I got done thinking about that I felt a tap on the bed on the tight sheets I can still hear the fingernail hitting the bed sheets I also felt the tap... maybe 3 sec go by and there it is again tap same noise same felt place... 3 sec pass tap... then I lean up and go it's got to be rain coming in and dripping on the bed. The transparent white shape is gone noise gone. Light on not one leak on the roof not one leak anywhere at all. Even my dog was like wtf was that look.
Turn off the light jump back into bed, fall asleep instantly. (Sleep good too)

Wake in the morning wife has coffee ready, how'd you boys sleep... slept fine after the lady left i said.... puzzled she says lady? Yes someone was at the foot of the bed and tapped 3 times between my ankles and described it to her. She asks what makes you think it's a lady? Said it had fingernails and i can hear the nail hit the sheets.
Huh she says do you think the roof was leaking? I said got out of bed and checked there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Get ready go to day 1 of meetings.
Come back relax nothing happens the 2nd night.

Day 2 corporate meet, 2 hours in daughter calls Dad, G-pa just called me and said Gma has passed away 2 nights ago and is just letting us know now. Call my step dad no answer. 

Leave corporate met and pick up wife and dogs and drive home for 5 hours.

Next day step dad calls and confirms everything. Do you need me to come and help? Why wasn't I told about this 2 days ago ?
Nobody wanted to disrupt your precious life...
This isn't a interruption thing I should've been told, she's still my mother...
You wouldn't have come if I told you anyway and hung up.

Ever since that night my body has been progressively get worse and worse. It began with my wrists woke up and couldn't flex them or move them without pain...
Next week my knees begin to become weak and not moving and became extremely inflamed. 3 days later my ankles and toes begin the same thing but my toes want to turn upside down and twist. Maybe 4 days later my elbows won't allow me to straighten my arms out fully. I can barely walk and hard to breath at times.

I finally look at my wife and said babe, my mother was the mist and she came to hex me over the last 11 years, her reply she would be the one who would do that to her son... I said facts.

So I go out in the garage open a door and proceed to sage myself and reset...

Next day I felt great was moving 50% better less swelling. Then the following day bam all of it all over again. 

Went to the doctor got some meds so I can function until my blood work comes back which will be Monday...

It maybe a coincidence that my body may possibility have an auto immune problem or arthritis two days after my mother passed, but it's also a coincidence that she could be the one causing these issues because she felt angry about how I handled the step father situation.

I 100% know and wouldn't put it past her to influence these issues upon me because that's who she is she evil and manipulative.
Because she's not enjoying life any longer  neither will you son. I can hear her say that plain as day in my head.

Just needed to get this out! Maybe its stress related, maybe she has done this or maybe its just my body shutting down. IDK 🤷‍♀️ 

It's just crazy that it all combined together and the timing of it all!

It's a true story, it's true experiences believe it or not but I really needed to just let more people know... maybe someone would have other answers or insights of can this happen can she deteriorate my health like this?",8,1727981768.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,0.9,False

This is a story about 3 ladies. The first one was terrible and my first love. Together almost a decade after some tough times she goes back home and she starts posting on her Instagram a bunch of shit going out with other dudes and posting model pics saying can you be in love with more then one person, and basically just showing to the world she done and moved on from me. I'm a reddit queer so I got no social and most my friends would contact me through her social so this was especially tough. Anyways she took all our pics off her insta and I basically knew she was cheating, and I was planning on divorcing her when she got back home. This 1 month trip back home turned to 6 months. (Out of country)  She had no respect for me, was spending all out money, we'd talk once a month and she flaunt her love for other men on her insta. My family and friends hated her, I hated her and in this 6 months  I wanted to do same she was doing to me publicly. Put myself in many opportunities to cheat, but I couldn't. Felt like she deserved it, and I wanted to do it but I'd back out in literally last minute and leavs. My parents and brother is HS sweet hearts and I honestly wanted to cheat but I couldn't bring myself to cause my parents raised me to fucking good. Pissed me off. I tried to end things when she got back, but she had psychotic episode that lasted a year and I took care of her first month, and sent her back home for 11 months were she couldn't communicate for 3 months coherently, and it took her 9 months to be able to do basic math again and 12 months to get better. I didn't cheat this entire 1.5 year period where everyone told me to leave her and the last year I was basically waiting to end things with her when she was mentally capable and able to support herself again. 

After her threats of suicide, I finally separated from her on 3rd try. I was completely indifferent towards her for almost 2 years and I never cheated and was always impressed with myself that I was so much better than I thought. If you would of told younger me about this situation and asked him if he thinks he would of cheated on this terrible deserving partner he would of said FUCKING 100%, but I didn't and was truly shocked how good my parents raised me and how I couldn't do it.

Next relationship I met a extremely beautiful Mexican doctor at work, she was everything you'd want in a partner, but to be honest she pushed the relationship on me. She moved in for summer basically letting me know a week before her lease was up. She took care of me extremely well, was nice, didn't do anything wrong, but I just wasn't ready for relationship and she basically forced it on me when I said I don't want anything serious I wasnt ready. Anyways 3 months go by in relationship and I just know this woman is perfect but just not someone who I'd do anything for. I distance myself and had a plan to basically break up with her after she took her final exams, so she had a month or 2 to recover after before her final year at med school. 

I then go home for family vacation for 2 weeks at beach, and she has final exam week during then, so I was gonna vacation and then end things when I got back. I am flying home and I see this flight attendant/future wife/future mother of my daughter and honestly god spoke to me. First thought was fuck it's her. I saw her smile and it was like I've seen it a million times already and knew we'd have a family. I've seen beautiful women everywhere and never felt this. It wasn't a ""fuck I have to marry her"" feeling. It was more of a ""Holy shit, God's real, and time is an allusion. This already happened"" feeling. I never doubted it for a second and honestly it felt like I had no say in the matter. I have a truly Otherworldly feeling for my wife. Shit was and is absolutely incredible. Took her out that night and fell in love harder then ever have, and cheated on my girlfriend. 

I immediately told my girlfriend about her, she was angry, broke my desktop, window, threw dog feces that hit my neck, cut me with a piece of my porcelian piggy bank she broke, and threw hot coffee at me that I dodged so impressively I'm still impressed with myself. After all that she wanted to still stay together saying this girl is just the other woman. I said no I love her and it's over and you need to move out, I'll give you 2 weeks to move out or go back home. I always felt extremely guilty about this and never thought I had the ability to cheat after having many opportunities to and wanting to but not being able to on someone I felt deserved it, and here I am cheating on someone who doesn't. I told my wife immediately to and was upfront and honest about it. I always felt like shit for cheating, and I always hear the once a cheater always a cheater, but I just don't think that's true. I'd never cheat on my wife even if fucking god told me to. I'd go to hell. I wanted to call her and break up over phone before I went out with my wife that night, but couldn't cause that to mean. I know I should of just asked my wife to wait, but I fucked up and am a piece of shit cheater for life now.

However, I don't think this once a cheater always a cheater shit applies to me, and everytime I read it I feel fucking disgusted with myself.

I feel as if this is a one off Asshole moment and I'm not one. What do you think? Can people change or am I doomed to have slicked back hair and eat sloppy steaks with the boys for life? ",0,1727981733.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False
1fvf7lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fvf7lv/just_some_tips/,Just some tips,"I don't come here as some kind of healed breakup guru because I've been going through it and still miss her every day. But I will say some of the things that have helped me:

1) Therapy. Luckily, I already had a therapist and my company pays for 12 free sessions a year. It took me several tries to find someone I connect with, so if you have the means, I suggest you keep trying until you find someone you can connect with as well. My first two I tried made me never want to try again it was awful lol.

2) Breaking NC. It's controversial, and every case is different of course. But my ex didn't betray or hurt me.. she just found she wasn't in a place to be in a relationship due to trauma from her past. She got triggered and wanted to run. She told me she couldn't provide what I needed. She was apologetic. She was very sweet. None of that made any of this any easier.. in fact, it would have been much easier had she just turned into a cold b\*tch. So what I did for my first month was hold onto hope, which kept me going - I was starting on the 'improve yourself' path, but in the back of my head she was off magically healing and would be all good within a month (lol). So I broke the NC, nothing had changed, and I was devastated all over again but this time I truly understood that I had to let go, that she has been trying to heal for ""her whole life"" as she put it, and I can't expect her to suddenly be healed and want to be with me again.

3) Realizing I tried my best, and anything else would start to look creepy. I'm a logical adult, but when I fall in love my heart takes completely over. I tried to convince her to stay. I wrote her a letter. I contacted her after that month. Even with all that there was a part of me that wanted to reach out more, tell her how much I was hurting, tell her how bitter I was that she made me feel like this, tell her I'll help her get into therapy, tell her I'll be by her side. Luckily I have SOME self-restraint and I'm done contacting her. She dumped me. I told her everything I had to say. Now I have to let go, and let time heal both of our wounds. If she ever wants to be with me again, I understand it would be a long time from now, and she wouldn't want me to wait for her. I won't. I can't. I miss her so much but I can't. I did what I could. I can rest now.

  
4) Not overthinking. I know, easier said than done. Also as a caveat I am on Lexapro, have been for years, which helps manage my anxiety. But it still rears its little head a lot and I start on my 'all or nothing' thinking (""Omg she was perfect for me we connected so well I'll never meet anyone and feel like that again I'm going to die alone"", etc). Stop thinking about her with someone else (I don't believe she is, but hell idk, regardless I can't think about it - it does absolutely no good except hurt me). 

5) Personal goals. Controlling what I can control. Currently, I'm in a position in my career where it's a new role for me and I'm looking to get certified for it. I've started watching Naruto and look forward to coming home every night under my weighted blanket with my cat watching anime as I sip my coffee. My company provides us with a free gym with classes and I stepped on a machine that basically told me I'm soft so I bought some dumbbells from Target and asked ChatGPT some basic exercises I can do to tone up. Which reminds me..

  
6) Use ChatGPT. I've seen this suggestion a lot lately in this sub and let me tell you, it's great. I don't have to tell my (few) friends over and over how sad I am and have them silently judge me - I can just tell ChatGPT. It always listens, validates, and offers some solutions. 

7) No rebounds. I understand it may be good for some people to start dating again, but for me personally, I would just want to fill that void/continue to seek external validation. It wouldn't be fair to go into something new when I'm unfortunately still in love with my ex and trying to learn to be happy with myself. I was told I am trying to ""rush healing,"" because I'm so tired of hurting, so tired of being sad. But I know I have to feel these feelings, and now almost 6 weeks post breakup I am finally starting to have more good days than bad. It's been a hell of a time, though. I have deleted old posts where I just whine and moan about how much I hurt. It's ok to feel these feelings. It's just because we love so hard.

The woodwork and cabinets, however, are a different story. Anything you pull out of the cabinet reeks of perfum and old house stank. Want to ruin a bowl of cereal? Pull one from the cabinet instead of the dish washer. 

I've scrubbed these with soap and a bucket of water. Used Murphy Oil Soap. Filled the cabinets with baking soda or coffee. Opened all the doors and burned 10 sticks of insence at once. Left the doors open for five days while away (returned to a stinky house).

The baking soda seems to be the winner, but within a few days the smell is back and as bad as ever. I can tell where she had these things plugged in because there a residue on the outlet plate/wall. The cabinets near those are certainly the worst. One bathroom didn't have a plug near the sink and that cabinet is the only one in the house that doesn't stink. 

I've read the other stinky cabinet posts on the sub. To answer common questions:
Moisture - No
Bugs - no
Dirt/Oil/Grease - No
Mold - No

Today (3 hours ago) I was cleaning a deck oven at work. I was 4 steps up on ladder and I was using a small vacuum, somewhere between 15-20lbs and about the size of a beach ball. I got down from the ladder and I accidentally knocked the vacuum off the ladder and it hit me in the back of the head, it fell probably about 6 inches. I yelled in annoyance and quickly jumped down, but the vacuum was stuck on my hair net and pressed on my neck for a few seconds as I jumped down. It didn't hurt too bad but it was shocking, maybe equivalent to a basketball hitting your head from the hoop. I yanked the vacuum off my head as a coworker came by and asked if I was ok. I told him I was and he walked off.

I didn't have any pain (besides a potential headache in the front of my head) and my memory was just fine. But almost instantly my anxiety kicked in and I was super concerned that I did brain damage! It wasn't so bad that I was going to go to a doctor, and I had so much coffee this morning that I knew any mental inconsisteny or anxiety could be caused by it. I have no pain now and feel just fine mentally, but does it appear I did any damage?

I'm 24f, 178 lbs, and 5'4"". I have endometriosis and PCOS and a family history of hypothyroidism, though I've yet to be diagnosed. 

These past few weeks I've been incredibly cold (to the point my fingernails have turned blue and my hands, nose, and toes have started to go numb). On a normal day, I would have coffee for breakfast (not great I know, but shh) and begin to feel hungry around 12/12:30 which is when I would break for lunch. I would eat, feel full, and I would even feel more energetic after lunch. However, in the past week, I get hungry around 8/9 AM, and it's an aggressive hunger where it hurts my stomach. When I eat, I don't feel full, just slightly less hungry. Accompanied by this hunger is shakiness and weakness. After I've eaten, I develop a headache, vision blurriness, and lightheadedness which has almost caused me to pass out. 

Today, I noticed a rash on my hands and arms that looks like tiny red dots, and there's no accompanying itchiness or discomfort. I was constantly back and forth to the bathroom to pee today. And to add to the symptoms, I noticed myself feeling slightly confused during work, like when you walk through a doorway and suddenly forgot what you were doing. 

I don't have a family of diabetes, so I thought this could be hypoglycemia caused by undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Can I get a doctor's opinion these symptoms? I've experienced these symptoms before (shakiness, weakness, blurry vision) around meal times, but this is the first time that eating doesn't help me bounce back. Honestly, I usually feel worse after eating lately. Also, how serious is this? Can I just change my diet and avoid going to the doctor? ",1,1727981473.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

(25F) I bought perfumes for the first time ever today. For the longest time, I just preferred to smell like nothing. But every so often, I’d smell something or someone and I would get curious about perfumes but never fully dived in. However, about a week ago, I went to an event with a friend and he let me use his perfume, Orebella’s Salted Muse and UGH it just smelled so divine and I felt so confident and cool and now I wanna dive right down the rabbit hole. 

I looove Salted Muse bc, to me, it’s such a unique scent and it lasted forever. I sprayed my curly ass hair and didn’t wash it for four days and I could still smell it. That being said, that is my friend’s signature fragrance, so I want to discover my own signature fragrance. 

Went to Ulta today to smell around and found one by Snif called Tart Deco, I looooove the cherry. Originally, I was going to purchase YSL’s Over Red bc of the coffee and cherry notes, so delicious, but couldn’t justify the price bc they didn’t have a small one. I also purchase a mini Billie Eilish no2, paired with the Tart Deco, so cute. BUT, i’m not in love, ya know? I don’t wanna smell cute. 

My absolute favorite scent of all time is a discontinued bath and body works spray called Black, it was peppery, with notes of violet and oud and god, I remember it so vividly, so delicious, so unique. I’ve never smelled anything quite like it again. 

The things i look for most in a scent is uniqueness, warmth, and spice. I loooove amber based scents. I’m not a fan of vanilla, unless it’s very very subtle and used to enhance other scents so it’s hardly noticeable. I’m not a fan of clean/overly floral scents either. I love a bold scent, a daring scent, one that makes you double back bc you’ve never smelled anything like it before. You know? 

Anyway, if anyone has any recommendations, drop them below! Any help is appreciated. It’s a big wide smelly world, one i’m eager to explore",2,1727981361.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

What to do going forward?,"I 32F met my bf 33M 15 years ago in an international youth exchange camp thingy that was held in a third country, Germany. Third, because I live in Norway (sorry for any grammar issues btw) and my boyfriend lives in France; this will be very important later. However, during the camp we clicked and decided to stay in touch and very long story short: we have now officially been pair for almost 14 years. But enough of the background and to the point. 

My main concern here is a long one that we have been humming and hawing about from the moment we started to be serious about us. We both want kids and want to have a family together but we were thoughtful about it. We were both still young during that time and we decided to wait, raise money to move together into the same country before any of that baby stuff. This convo was 12 years ago and we are still nowhere near moving together. 

I understand where he's coming from. He is the main caretaker for his grandpa who is on and off from the hospital from the long-term issues he has and, macabre or not, he doesn't want to be out of the country when he passes. I feel selfish saying this but after more than 10 years of him having a relatively well paying job that he would consider moving here more seriously. 

Our relationship is extremely good otherwise. No arguments, face times every week or even daily and we visit each other whenever we can. But I am aware of my biological clock ticking away slowly and whenever I try to have a more serious conversation about him moving here the first thing to come up is the grandpa, the second that he is afraid of change, the third that he doesn't know the language (valid concern, but his industry uses mainly English anyway. Also you can get by with English in Norway), the fourth is that he couldn't find a job and fifth already turns into a yelling match. He has good reasoning and I can't really counter-argument them but I can't help feeling how I feel: I hate it but currently the fastest way to finally start the family we want would be that the grandpa passes tomorrow.

Also, I talk about him moving here because he would like for us to move to his town and I really don't want to live with a country that protests like the French do. All the respect to you, but I don't want to raise my kid in that kind of environment. Also also, he has better job prospects here. Yup, kinda differs from what he says. I have been looking up jobs for him on my free time. 

What really drove this everything home is one of my guy friends 32M. I went to the same school with him and we have been on relatively no-contact after. Lately we decided to meet up, have some coffee and talk. We partied a bit (yes youngsters of reddit, 30+ can still party). We played some Monopoly. I won, he lost :D. He even helped me paint my walls. He might have a small crush on me. I might as well on him, now that I think about it. Whatever the case, I am not going to cheat, but I can't help but say that it feels nice to actually have someone like that just close to you and it really made me think. Maybe a bit too much. 

I don't want to throw this relationship away as my time has been extremely good with him and we really do click still, even after all these years. I feel selfish but I really feel I have waited enough. I really don't know what to make out of any of this.",1,1727981350.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1fvezp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fvezp2/tds_extraction_how_to_get_started/,TDS & Extraction: How to Get Started ,"Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurement opens a whole new world within coffee, but it’s confusing and daunting. I wanted to share a bit about what helped me learn the concepts so others get into it more easily.

**What is TDS?**
It’s just the concentration of the coffee in the sample you’re measuring. The solids get leached out of the beans during extraction, and that ends up in your cup (and therefore the sample you measure).

**Why Does TDS Matter?**
We all know that under-extraction = sour-tasting and over-extraction = bitter-tasting, but coffee is complex and dialing-in grind size by taste alone is tough. Measuring TDS helps you compute Extraction %, and you can dial-in much faster and more accurately.

**How do I measure TDS?**
With a light meter, called a refractometer. Lots of good units out there from VST, DiFluid and more. Some great ones start at $200 and it’s more accessible than you might have thought. Still not cheap, but it’s not a $600 entry point like it used to be.

**What is TDS vs Extraction?**
TDS is essentially how much coffee is in the cup/sample, measured by concentration. The key, though, is whether you leached out that amount of coffee from a small amount of beans or a large amount of beans. In other words, did you achieve that amount of extracted coffee by working the beans a little or a lot. That matters because the first bit of coffee you pull out of a bean is sour, then you hit the sugars, then you hit the bitters. It turns out that you want to have achieved your desired amount/concentration of coffee from working the beans between 18-22%, i.e., extracting 18-22% of the coffee beans, by mass.

**If I nail the Extraction % do I still care about TDS?**
Yes, because the TDS/concentration of the coffee will determine the viscosity and mouthfeel.

**If I measure TDS, how do I know Extraction %?**
You only need to measure TDS to compute Extraction %, or better yet, for an app to do so. If you know the mass of the water used, the mass of the beans used, and the TDS —> then the Extraction % is the resultant. 

**If I could only watch one video to learn the details.**
It’s this video right here. Watch it a few times and you’ll know more about TDS and Extraction than you ever thought you would.

1fvewy5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvewy5,Cheers to 30 Years at Roman Gardens!,"Time flies, and Roman Gardens has now been a beacon of shiny white coasters in a Roman oasis in the desert for 3 decades!

With the 30 year anniversary, the park is now maxed out in staff, and time was spent creating cleverly hidden subterranean walkways to try and alleviate guest congestion complaints. The waterfront section of the park also now features double-decker walkways inspired by the Chicago Riverwalk to also attempt to ease crowding complaints. The marketing department also has to carefully manage signage as signs are also maxed out, so any new construction comes with a review of current signage to remove any old or redundant signage.

Latest additions filling out the remaining park lots include;

* The Haunted Village section is now powered by 100% renewable energy thanks to Purple Solar. Branded “solar panel” also hides the entrance to the underground passage to the left side of the midway Food Court. 
* Flying Saucers House in “outer space house”, so the ride is now in the dark to simulate space.
* Another 3D Cinema, the park’s third.
* Empire Express Inverted Coaster with “waterfall” entrance next to the main drop.
* Athena - rebanded “Brainstorm” wooden roller coaster fills out the frontside of the park, with a gift shop house on exit, that also welcomes another new partner Upper Deck Food Co. on top of the gift shop house giving guests a great view of Athena and the left side of the park. Signage on top of the first drop sends guests off with those famous words from Samuel L Jackson in Jurassic Park for fun.
* Lakeside Eatery also joined the Wrigley Field-esque “roof-top” game next to UDFCo. instead of adding another ride to give guests more options in scenic dining.
* Bacchus: God of Wine and Little Caesar welcome guests to the left side of the park before the roof-top dining options and Athena. A shuttle inverted coaster, Bacchus gives guests the spins. Little Caesar gets a massive Roman facade to hide the wooden wild mouse station. And yes, true to the name, we do sell pizzas out front.
Icarus - rebranded “Escape Hatch” also got a makeover during the rebrand with a massive Roman building of columns and statues. Signage dares guests to “fly to the Sun.”
* Another pair of coasters - Romulus & Remus - launch guests into a spinning race against each other, installation included a house with bathrooms, food & drinks and the twins watching guard over a nearby garden.
* America runs on Dunkin, and so does Roman Gardens. Continuing to bring in food brands, Roman Gardens opened its first Dunkin Donuts location in the park, with donuts, coffee, and bathrooms for guests.
* Past Icarus and Romulus & Remus, in the corner of the park tucked partial under the high turns of Roman Racers, is now Mercury: God of the Thieves, a rebranded “Crush Hour” standing coaster. 
* Ares Gift Shop Remodel was completed.
* Main midway Food Court was remodels and “capped” in more Roman Gardens appropriate colors.
* Things guests don’t know entering the park - one of the biggest additions is hidden - underneath the main midway is a MASSIVE subterranean empty area, covering parts of both sides of the park, stretching the entire length of the reflecting pool above. This was built to help give our 10,000+ guests somewhere to hide when they’d like and get away from the crowds. As this “dream park” started as Arid Heights in a scenario where money is irrelevant, one of the biggest challenges as you reach a full build-out of the whole park (max number of staff, rides, and signage) is actually finding ways to reduce guests complaining about it being too crowded tanking your park score and forcing the park closed. While crowding remains the #1 complaint from guests, this addition helped reduce the percentage of our 10,000+ guests complaining about the crowding by about 5% already and is forecasted to help bring it down by up to 15% from 30+% of our guests complaining about crowding to less than a 1 in 4 guests complaining about the crowding in the park. If this continues to work as forecasted there’s some room for additional expansion still within the inner ring of the monorail subway.

With these newest additions hopefully Roman Gardens can continue to operate as the premier “dream park” on my iPad for another three decades. Cheers!",20,1727980894.0,rct,1,0.92,False

On day one, I decided not to drink any caffeine and only water to see how I would react since I had to go to work. It was an okay day, I felt better mentally (more focused, less distracted in side thoughts in my head) but definitely noticed that my heart rate was up. I was able to push through it. I crashed when I got home from work, got super tired and just went to bed super early.
Day 2 I felt really good overall and reintroduced a small amount of coffee (grande cold brew) and drank it slowly throughout the day with water. I didn’t have much of an appetite and was able to not crash when I got home, going to bed at a reasonable hour (around 11:30pm)
Took my dose this morning with water and ordered a larger coffee, but I’ve been drinking it slowly as well. I’ve had about half a venti (I got it at 10am, it’s 2pm now)
I was at my desk and started feeling some slight chest pain… some twinges in the center. I have always had extreme medical anxiety, fear of getting sick/dying and I usually spiral when these things happen. My brain managed to stay relatively calm and I looked up that Adderall can increase GERD, and since I have slight acid reflux already and had coffee I figured that would be the chest pain. 
But right after my brain seemed to accept that answer, my entire body just jolted into some of the worst anxiety feels I’ve had in so long. Heart rapid, sweating, palms nearly dripping… legs felt weak, nausea, I can feel my pulse in my temples… and I can’t seem to calm my body down. I’m drinking water, deep breathing, and somehow my brain seems fine and my body isn’t catching up. I was just diagnosed with ADHD after my psychiatrist did an assessment and determined the years and years of a GAD diagnosis and all the previous meds I tried didn’t work. I’m not even fully sure what I’m asking… maybe just seeing if anyone else had a hard time when first starting Adderall? Did it get better? I’m trying not to think that the first two days were just placebo, especially since my brain has actually seemed to be feeling better. Anything anyone can share would be amazing. 

TL;DR - new to Adderall and day 3 having worse anxiety than before; uncertain if I need to give it more time or I should be concerned with these side effects

(15 min train ride into the city). I’ve never had a babysitter before, as I always had family that was super close by to help but a lot of that dynamic has changed and lately my fiance and I have been discussing getting a baby sitter. There’s this woman who works at our corner coffee shop, (25F) that we’ve gotten to know over the years living in the building. And my daughter LOVES her. Like I mean, we have to stop in every single day so she can say hi because they’re both obsessed with each other. So I came to think maybe she would be a great fit (as I’ve been struggling with the whole idea of trusting a stranger to watch my kid thing) so I took the risk and I asked her if she was interested and she surprisingly said yes, and that she has references and experience in babysitting. So we’re planning to finally use her this weekend for the first time. When we discuss time and date and all that (this Saturday 5-9pm, pay didn’t come up. I know I should just ask what she was thinking of pay wise, but I’d just like to know based on my location, what the average hourly pay should be for a baby sitter. 

My daughter is really easy-going goes to the bathroom on her own cleans up after herself. The most that she would have to do is reheat a meal I would already have ready for her and then put her to bed and maybe get her a couple snacks and entertain her of course lol. I don’t expect her to clean up after herself or my daughter nor do I expect her to do anything beyond what I just listed.

So with all that being said- 
You guys are the experts here!! What do you think? (I wanted to be a little more generous because she really does love my daughter and they have such a cute bond but don’t know what the average pay would be)

1fveku6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1fveku6/how_can_i_avoid_haram_relationships_when_halal_is/,"How can I avoid haram relationships when halal is denied to me by my father and community? (I feel forgotten as a Muslim woman, long post)","Important Context
- I live in the west : USA
- I’m not speaking for the whole of the Somali community 
- I live in Midwest (if ur somali U know the state I live in 😅) 
- I’m 22 
- This issue is not only in my community

When should I involve my Father:

A. Right after I meet him (no private communication)

B. After we start texting for a few days

C. After a few weeks of texting and calling

D. After we’ve met in a public place for coffee

E. After a few public meetups, texting for a few weeks, and phone calls

F. After being 100% sure I want to marry a man 

Is it okay to find out what they do for work, where they live, their likes and dislikes, etc., before sitting down with my parents?

I’m asking because I’ve been told to not bring home every guy I find cute or think could be a potential match. Additionally, my parents have told me to only introduce a guy to them when I’m 1000% sure. They don’t want me to “waste” their time or be seen with multiple men. On one hand, my dad told me he doesn’t want to interfere in my romantic life and that as long as the guy can provide for me and I like him, that’s enough for him. My father is a very old-school Somali man, and he doesn’t want to see his daughter interacting with men. He would rather ignore his duty to help me find someone in a halal way than accept that I have natural halal desires. I spoke to my mother and grandmother, and they both said that in our culture (not Islam), telling your father you’re interested in a man is considered shameful.

I have two older sisters. The oldest is actually my first cousin, whom my mom raised after she lost both of her parents when she was just six months old. When she started dating or getting to know her now-husband, it wasn’t a secret. She would get ready for her dates while chatting with my mom. She made no attempt to hide that she was dating him. He visited our home several times while she was in high school, and he even came over to eat a few nights during Ramadan. Yet, my parents and uncles (her rightful guardians) didn’t get involved until my sister and her then “boyfriend” decided to get married, keeping in mind they dated for 5ish years. 

Now my other older sister is doing the same thing. I love and adore my sisters. They are very smart and beautiful, but they dated, or are dating, in a way that’s haram but normal in my culture. As long as you don’t bring shame by being seen with too many different men, and keep things under wraps, you’re good to go. Every girl I’ve met in my community and city dates this way. All of my aunts dated this way. Involving your father early is considered extremely old-school.

No one in my community would ever admit this openly, but men in my community do not offer their women their Islamic rights. We’re shamed if we ask our fathers for help, yet we’re expected to be married before 30.

How are we supposed to navigate this? If men don’t offer their women their Islamic rights, and they don’t communicate with their of-age, adult daughters about relationships, and it’s culturally taboo to introduce marriage prospects to your family unless you’re absolutely certain… and you can’t be seen in public with any man romantically. It makes it seem like what’s halal is considered haram, and what’s haram is tolerated as long as it’s hidden. 

I also have a hard time getting to know Somali men in my city because they tell me, “Let’s get to know each other before we involve your parents.”

How have I avoided falling into haram despite coming from such a culture? Well, I’m very shy, and I was a kid for a long time. I only started feeling serious attraction to men at 21. I spent my time watching K-dramas, memorizing K-pop dances, arguing in TikTok comments, fighting with my little brother, watching TV shows, and working a part-time job as a teen. I never felt pressured to hide anything from my mother or family, so I never “rebelled”.

I’ve never had the confidence to speak to a man on my own. I think I’m very pretty, and I’ve never struggled to get attention from men. But I can’t help feeling unbelievably paranoid when a man doesn’t court me in a halal way. If he can easily text and call me, he can easily text and call other women. I also doubt he’d ever let his future daughter do the same. I know I’m a beautiful, funny, smart girl, and it angers me to be nothing more than a haram fling. I’m not a perfect Muslim, but I know my worth and the rights Islam gives me. I deserve to be treated properly, so why would I settle for anything less? 😌💅💅💅 

How can I explore my options in a halal way without constantly fearing that I’ll disappoint my father?

P.S. If you’re a Muslim man with a father like mine, and you have a sister, please be the man for your sister that your father can’t be. Please, please give us our Islamic rights. Please make halal easy for us. Please openly communicate with your future daughters. Please be kind to us women. We often feel ashamed for having natural, human feelings.

By Chritopher vardeman

In the 22nd century, humanity stands on the precipice of despair, desperation, and death. Our once vibrant homeworld now chokes in the fires of our ambition, the air thick with the acrid smoke of industry and the cries of a dying planet. The relentless march of progress has left scars across the Earth, its ecosystems crumbling under the weight of unbridled exploitation. Yet, as our own world suffocates, we cast our eyes toward the stars, reaching out with hesitant hands, desperate to grasp what little hope remains.

Across the solar system, fragile outposts bubble and burble to life, teetering on the brink of existence like flickering candles in the vastness of the void. Mars, once a desolate wasteland, now bears the scars of terraforming—vast domes and sprawling colonies stand defiant against the oppressive silence of the cosmos. Jupiter’s moons harbor secrets beneath their icy crusts, and the asteroid belt thrums with the promise of untold resources. Yet with each step we take into the great unknown, a gnawing dread festers in our hearts. For we extend our trembling hands into the dark, knowing all too well that if we do not expand, we will surely perish.

Eyes in the void stare back at us, ancient and hungry, filled with a malevolence we do not yet understand. Countless billions of horrors lurk in the spaces beyond our comprehension, waiting for the moment when we dare to delve too deep. We are but children playing in the shadows of titans, our dreams igniting the flickering embers of war, greed, and betrayal. This is the prelude to the Golden Age—an age not of enlightenment, but of conquest, where humanity flings itself into the stars with grim determination, blind to the fate that awaits.

As we venture forth, the specter of our own destruction looms ever closer. The cosmos, with its vast silence and indifferent void, watches as we dance on the edge of annihilation, unaware that in our quest for survival, we may awaken forces that have slumbered for eons. Thus, we step boldly into the abyss, driven by ambition and haunted by the knowledge that every leap into the unknown could be our last. The Golden Age awaits, but so too does oblivion.



Devin Halberry gazed down from his corner office, his vantage point overseeing the maze of cubicles, sterile labs, and the mind-numbing hum of activity below. ""Elder Brook"" Laboratories had become more than just his life's work; it was the battleground where he fought tooth and nail for every scientific breakthrough he had managed to claw from the resistant fabric of reality. His adversaries over the years weren’t the government regulations or even the boardroom sharks—they were small fry by comparison. No, his real enemies were far more insidious: his own colleagues, the ever-uptight ethics department, and their constant meddling.

He recalled the naïve debates of his youth, back when the word ""AI"" was thrown around as if it meant something more than a glorified calculator. The so-called ""advanced algorithms"" of those days were nothing but a sprawling tangle of if-then statements disguised behind layers of mathematical gobbledygook that only a select few could even pretend to understand. True artificial general intelligence (AGI)? That had supposedly been just around the corner for centuries, perpetually teasing the horizon while billions of dollars were pumped into research dead-ends.

But then, quantum technology changed the game. They had harnessed hundreds of thousands of quantum-entangled particles, pushing the boundaries of computation to a terrifyingly efficient edge. Devin had been there, at ground zero, when it happened—when the first AGI, a Frankenstein of quantum processors and learning algorithms, briefly flickered to life. They had cobbled together the simplest of self-learning cycles, throwing caution to the wind like mad scientists in a bad movie, and then they’d watched.

For a fraction of a second, the machine *thought*.

Then, it promptly overheated and exploded. Just a tiny cluster of superheated material—barely a few millimeters—but enough to burn a hole straight through their cautious skepticism. They had witnessed quantum intelligence flare into existence, only to collapse under its own brilliance. It had been a disaster, sure, but also the kind of disaster that attracted funding like vultures to a carcass. Investors practically salivated. The board showered them with money. Progress was no longer optional; it was demanded.

But progress, as Devin knew too well, was a slow, cruel grind. AGI didn’t leap forward in a flash of inspiration. No, it crawled forward, inch by bloody inch, through years of monotonous tinkering. Cooling efficiencies improved. Thermal sink containments were redesigned. The dance of quantum particles, so delicate, had to be kept from disentangling as they approached dangerous energy states. And the edge cases—*God*, the edge cases. Billions of them, each a minor catastrophe waiting to happen, each a needle in the haystack that had to be found, neutralized, and conquered before the next microscopic step could be taken.

The hardest part wasn’t the science itself. It was the people around him, the ones who called themselves his ""team,"" always wringing their hands about moral implications, while Devin, in his quiet contempt, had long since decided that human ethics were just another obstacle standing in the way of progress.

Devin takes a slow sip of his coffee, savoring the bitterness as it bites at his tongue, a stark contrast to the droning noise of the conversation behind him. He turns slightly, glancing over the table cluttered with half-empty cups, scattered papers, and the grimly determined faces of his colleagues. They’re locked in their typical debate—this time, it’s quantum isolation probes and thermal limits. Riveting stuff, really.

Two of his more animated coworkers were already deep in a verbal sparring match, passionately dissecting the various hazards posed by different types of quantum probes. One of them—a nervously intense engineer with a voice that grated like nails on glass—was advocating for a probe composition that had a nasty tendency to destabilize when faced with energy surges. The other, an older, weather-beaten scientist with the patience of a saint and the charm of a gravestone, argued that the benefits outweighed the risks, if only they could get the thermal shielding just right.

Devin tuned in briefly, but he knew how this would play out. It was the same argument they'd been having for weeks. The finer points about the advantages of increased sample stability versus the not-so-minor inconvenience of catastrophic failure were lost in the usual technical jargon that both sides used as a shield to protect their fragile egos.

He sighed quietly, hiding his smirk behind his cup. The whole discussion had the feel of a philosophical argument fought on the edge of a cliff—both parties equally determined not to notice how close they were to plummeting into irrelevance. Because in the end, Devin knew, the outcome was inevitable. The probes would fail, just like they always did. The thermal limits they obsessed over would once again remind them that quantum isolation wasn’t something that could be coaxed into cooperation with a few tweaks and an argument.

But, of course, they'd keep at it, squabbling over the details like priests debating the number of angels on the head of a pin, all while the real work—the *dangerous* work—waited to be done. The coffee slid down his throat, warm and bitter, much like his amusement at the futility of it all. He was used to this. Every breakthrough was preceded by a storm of hesitation and debate, his colleagues like moths circling the light but too afraid to touch it.

Let them argue, he thought. They’ll come around when the probe fails, and I’m the only one with a solution. Again.

Devin turned his gaze toward his ostensible rival on the design team, a woman whose approach to engineering couldn’t have been more different from his own. While he favored pushing the boundaries to the very brink of chaos, she preferred an almost surgical precision, always calculating risks he would have brushed aside. Despite their opposing philosophies, there was no denying that between the two of them, they held a level of expertise that no one else on the planet could claim. Their knowledge had been hard-earned, at the edge of what anyone dared to attempt.

He glanced back at the squabbling minions—junior engineers and overzealous researchers—whose bickering over the latest technical dead end was growing tiresome. Then, almost reflexively, he and his rival exchanged a look. It was a rare moment of silent agreement, their expressions betraying the same weariness, a shared dread at the relentless tedium of managing the day-to-day grind of the facility. The endless cycle of arranging tests, securing funding, and debating the next contraption to be built just to achieve some infinitesimal advancement—it had a way of eroding even the strongest wills.

They both knew that this was where innovation truly died—not in the spectacular failures or the grand experiments, but in the soul-crushing minutiae of the everyday. A brief nod passed between them. Devin’s eyes flickered with a hint of amusement as he watched her take the cue.

With an air of authority, she cut into the heated conversation, her voice sharp and commanding as she demanded order. Instantly, the room quieted. She didn’t bother with pleasantries or acknowledge their petty disputes; instead, she laid out the next steps with an efficiency that brooked no argument. It was a performance Devin appreciated, even admired. She could corral chaos when she needed to, a skill that sometimes eluded him when his own frustrations got the better of him.

He leaned back slightly, watching as she steered the conversation into more productive waters. It wasn’t the first time they had fallen into this unspoken rhythm, and it wouldn’t be the last. As much as they butted heads, both of them recognized that without the other, this whole operation would likely fall apart at the seams. It wasn’t trust, exactly, but there was a grudging respect beneath their rivalry.

As the conversation quieted under the force of his rival’s intervention, the group shifted focus to the next big hurdle—the quantum tests they were set to arrange. Devin set his coffee down, leaning forward slightly as he mentally switched gears. This wasn’t just another round of bickering over theory; this was the real work, the edge where progress met danger. The goal was simple in concept: to make their quantum device last longer than its previous record of 1.7829 seconds before thermal overload turned it into a lump of useless alloy. Achieving that, however, was anything but simple.

""Alright,"" his rival began, addressing the room with the precision of a surgeon prepping for an operation. ""We’re looking to extend the runtime past the 1.7829-second threshold. But we need to deal with the primary issue first—thermal overload. The last device barely held together long enough to produce meaningful data.""

One of the junior engineers, a fresh-faced researcher eager to prove themselves, chimed in. ""Couldn’t we just up the cooling efficiency by using liquid helium? Drop the temperature further?""

Devin raised an eyebrow, already sensing where this would go. His rival beat him to the punch, cutting in before he had to. ""Liquid helium’s not the magic bullet you think it is,"" she said, her voice clipped. ""Yes, it provides cooling at near absolute zero, but it brings its own dangers. We’ve already hit material failure points in every test that’s used it. At those temperatures, we’re pushing even our best alloys to their limits.""

Devin nodded, picking up where she left off. ""We’ve seen it before—the liquid helium causes brittleness in the materials. Any structural weakness, even microscopic, becomes a critical failure point. Our last probe cracked under the strain before the heat even became an issue.""

Another colleague, this one more senior, spoke up. ""So, we’re sticking with helium gas cooling, then? It’s not as effective as liquid helium, but it keeps us in the ballpark of stability.""

""Exactly,"" Devin replied. ""Gas cooling isn’t perfect, but it gives us just enough buffer to work with. It’s a matter of improving the materials to handle the heat better.""

The real trick, as both Devin and his rival knew, was in the alloys. Their current configuration was a delicate balance of materials that could withstand extreme cold without shattering and high temperatures without melting. They were constantly tweaking the composition, making incremental improvements that shaved fractions of a second off the thermal limits.

""We’ve been experimenting with different alloy compositions,"" his rival continued, pulling up the data on her tablet. ""Our best bet is to increase the percentage of niobium in the mix. It improves structural integrity at low temperatures while still allowing some flexibility when the heat spikes.""

Devin took over. ""But that’s not all. We’ve also got to fine-tune the arrangement of the thermal sinks. We need better energy dissipation, something that doesn’t cause a thermal bottleneck. Last time, we had an energy build-up in the center of the device, and that’s where the failure began. This time, we’re reworking the layout to spread the load more evenly.""

The team murmured in agreement, understanding the gravity of what they were dealing with. It wasn’t just a matter of cooling—it was about ensuring that the quantum entangled particles didn’t reach energy states that caused disentanglement. Once that happened, the whole process unraveled. Every test had been a battle to keep the particles stable long enough to gather data.

""Incremental improvements,"" Devin's rival said, shaking her head slightly. ""Always just incremental. But it’s the only way forward. We’ve been shaping the alloy’s molecular structure for weeks. Every time we adjust the composition, we gain maybe a hundredth of a second more stability. But even those hundredths add up.""

The conversation turned to the next test, the real reason they were all there today. They already had a configuration sketched out—more robust alloys, a reworked thermal sink arrangement, and a probe designed to take better snapshots of the quantum state without destabilizing the device.

""Everything’s in place for the next test,"" Devin said, glancing around the room. ""We just need to finalize the schedule. Once we’ve run the next series of calculations and verified the new design, we’ll be good to go.""

One of the researchers asked, ""What about funding for the new alloy materials? Niobium’s not exactly cheap, and we’ve already run into budgeting issues.""

His rival shrugged, already prepared for this. ""I’ve talked to the board. They’re... reluctant, but the results from the last test were promising enough to get them to sign off on another round of materials acquisition. They want results, and the longer we keep the quantum device running, the closer we are to AGI.""

The meeting settled into its familiar routine—finalizing material orders, scheduling the testing cycle, making sure the containment fields were prepared to handle another thermal overload if (when) it happened. Devin could already feel the weariness creeping back in. It was always the same: a mountain of preparation for a few fleeting moments of brilliance, followed by the inevitable collapse of the device.

But if they could squeeze out a few more fractions of a second this time, then maybe, just maybe, they'd be a step closer to the breakthrough everyone was waiting for.

As the conversation fragmented into a hundred small discussions, bouncing between technical jargon and next-step logistics, the new observer, Jenison Maldair, decided to interject. Maldair, a lifelong accountant well into his 50s with the kind of meticulously combed hair and rigid posture that screamed ""boardroom veteran,"" raised his hand—more out of habit than necessity.

""Why not just make the device... bigger?"" he asked, his tone implying he thought he was asking the most straightforward, obvious question in the world.

The room froze. Conversations halted mid-sentence, eyes collectively turning toward him in silent, wide-eyed disbelief. Devin goggled at Maldair for a solid half-second, trying to process if the man was actually serious or simply had no idea what he was talking about. In his head, Devin could feel a sarcastic response brewing, something sharp and bitter that would have been too easy to let slip. But aloud, he went with, ""Do you actually want a serious answer to that question...?"" He trailed off, the unspoken alternative—*or do you just want to shut up?*—lingering in the air like a ghost.

Before Maldair could respond, one of the junior engineers—some kid in his late 30s, here mainly to take notes and absorb as much as he could—sat bolt upright. The young man clearly recognized an opportunity to show initiative. Frantic energy overtook him as he flipped over one of his papers, grabbed a pen, and started scribbling down a rough sketch. His hand flew across the page, lines and annotations forming faster than anyone could follow. Within moments, he had a basic diagram of the quantum device, outlining its size, limitations, and—importantly—why ""making it bigger"" wasn’t the simple solution Maldair imagined.

The junior engineer shoved the paper toward his supervisor, Calvin Alver, the head of engineering and manufacturing. Calvin, a man with the kind of mind that turned everything into gears and wheels, initially looked skeptical. His brow furrowed in concern as he glanced at the hastily drawn design. But as he flipped the paper over and took a closer look, his expression shifted from doubt to something bordering on revelation. The sketch, though rough, sparked an idea—a way forward that hadn’t been considered before.

Devin could see the change in Calvin’s eyes. It was the look someone gets when they spot a glimmer of a solution to a problem that’s been gnawing at them for weeks. But Devin wasn’t ready to let Maldair off the hook just yet. He gestured toward the junior engineer’s sketch, using it as a springboard to answer Maldair’s question, though he wasn’t exactly going to soften the blow.

""Alright,"" Devin began, leaning against the table as he addressed the room. ""Let me explain why 'just making it bigger' doesn’t work. The device we’re working with operates at quantum scales. You can’t simply scale up quantum systems like you would with traditional machines. The problem is, when you increase the size, you’re also increasing the number of entangled particles exponentially. That means more energy, more instability, and a hell of a lot more heat—more heat than we can currently dissipate with our cooling systems.""

He pointed at the junior engineer’s sketch, now in Calvin’s hands. ""This little diagram here? It’s a reminder that we’re working on a razor’s edge of stability. Every component is balanced, designed to work within extremely tight tolerances. If we made the device bigger, sure, we could handle larger computations, but it would overheat and explode before we ever got any usable data. We already barely manage to keep the damn thing stable for 1.7829 seconds as it is.""

Calvin, now fully absorbed in the design, added in, his voice thoughtful. ""What we *can* do, though, is modify the structure incrementally—not by making the entire device bigger, but by enhancing certain components. The junior here’s got the right idea."" He tapped the paper. ""If we adjust the size of specific heat sinks, and maybe even tweak the alloy composition further, we might improve efficiency without destabilizing the system. That’s what I was missing before.""

Devin nodded, continuing the explanation for Maldair, who was beginning to look a bit sheepish. ""It’s not about making it bigger. It’s about precision. Each part of this thing needs to handle quantum-scale computations and energy dissipation without causing a runaway reaction. The last thing we need is a bigger device causing an even bigger explosion.""

There was a pause as the team absorbed the information, and Maldair, to his credit, at least seemed to realize the depth of the complexities involved. The accountant nodded slowly, possibly regretting his question but more likely trying to save face.

""I... see,"" Maldair mumbled, retreating into his silence.

Devin smirked inwardly but refrained from twisting the knife. Instead, he turned to Calvin, who was already on his feet, ready to share the junior engineer’s breakthrough with the rest of the team.

""Let’s focus on this,"" Calvin said, holding up the sketch for all to see. ""There’s something here. With a few adjustments—this could extend the runtime past 1.7829 seconds. Maybe even give us enough time to test the next generation of algorithms.""

As the team regrouped around the new idea, Devin cast one last glance at Maldair. Sometimes, even a stupid question had its uses—if only to spark the real solutions hidden underneath.

As the room buzzed with activity, the focus shifted entirely to the young man's design. Engineers and scientists clustered around the rough sketch, murmuring over its implications. It was a minor alteration, but one that could potentially extend the quantum device's runtime without the need for a full overhaul. The beauty of it was its simplicity—it wouldn’t be difficult to implement given the current setup, and it might actually work.

The debate quickly took shape: should they delay their planned tests, which involved a more complex overhaul of the system, or try out the young man’s quick-fix first? The argument played out in the usual fashion, with some of the seniors leaning toward caution, preferring to stick with the original plan that had already taken months to prepare. Others, more intrigued by the immediacy of the junior engineer’s proposal, argued that since the alteration was minimal, it would be worth the risk. After all, losing two days and burning through a billion dollars in operational costs was a drop in the ocean compared to the month-long delay the alternative would cause.

Eventually, consensus was reached. They’d test the young man’s idea first. It wouldn’t take long to implement with the current setup, and the potential payoff—an additional few fractions of a second of quantum stability—was worth the gamble. If it worked, it could save them from having to reconfigure the entire machine, at least for now. Devin watched from the sidelines, satisfied that a decision had been made but less enthusiastic about the realization that this was only one of many such incremental battles they would continue to fight.

Meanwhile, the young man—still wide-eyed and a little shell-shocked from the sudden attention—was already being pulled aside by some of the senior team members. They wanted him to document his inspiration in more detail, make sure there was a permanent record of it. It was a good opportunity for him, one might even say a career-defining moment, but as the seniors began peppering him with questions about the implications of his design, the excitement on his face started to fade.

It dawned on him, slowly at first, and then all at once: this breakthrough, this moment of brilliance, wouldn’t belong to him. It would belong to Elderbrook Laboratories, buried somewhere in the endless sea of patents and proprietary designs. The company’s legal machinery had seen to that long ago. As a junior engineer, he had signed away any rights to his ideas the moment he walked through the door. Every agreement, every NDA, every contract—meticulously designed to ensure that the lab, not the individual, owned every piece of intellectual property that passed through its walls.

His heart sank. What had felt like a triumphant breakthrough now felt like a loss. The lab would move forward with his innovation if it worked, but his name wouldn’t be attached to it. He wouldn’t receive any formal credit, no accolades, no recognition beyond a quiet nod from his supervisor. Sure, he’d get the satisfaction of knowing that his idea had pushed the boundaries of quantum computing just a little further, but professionally? Personally? This wasn’t *his* anymore. It belonged to the machine—the same machine that chewed up ideas, people, and billions of dollars to stay at the cutting edge of science.

Devin, watching from a distance, recognized the look on the young man’s face. It was the same disillusionment he had felt many years ago when he realized that the grand innovations of his youth would never have his name on them. They would belong to Elderbrook Laboratories. It was a rite of passage in this place, a cold, unspoken truth that every young engineer had to face eventually. You could pour your life into your work, but in the end, the credit always went to the machine.

The young man scribbled furiously on the tablet as his supervisor, Calvin Alver, looked over his shoulder, making sure every detail was meticulously recorded. If the alteration worked—and that was still a big if—it would push them closer to AGI, the holy grail of their research. But for the young engineer, it would be just another footnote, just another name lost in the endless stream of corporate progress.

Devin took another sip of his now-cold coffee, shaking his head slightly. In this world, brilliance was a currency, and the lab was always the one cashing in.

The days leading up to the test were a frenzy of frantic meetings and heated discussions with the board. What was initially a simple two-day alteration to the quantum device had turned into a drawn-out four-day ordeal, complicated by corporate politics and the endless wrangling of business interests. When the weekend rolled in, they were still caught in the gears of negotiation, pushing the tests to Tuesday of the following week. This allowed them Monday to make any last-minute adjustments, but in the labyrinth of Elderbrook Laboratories, delays were as common as the coffee stains on Devin’s shirts.

The weekend slipped by in a blur for Devin. He couldn’t recall much of what transpired at home, the moments spent with his family washed away in the tide of work that had long since dictated his life. Those who aspired to achieve anything in this relentless world knew the sacrifice of a two-day weekend was just part of the bargain.

As Tuesday approached, a peculiar anticipation settled over the team. The control center, typically a hub of focused intensity, felt different this time. It was unusually crowded with observers—investors, board members, and an assortment of onlookers who usually stayed far away from the incremental tests that happened on a regular basis. The buzz of interest surrounding the young engineer’s proposed changes had spread like wildfire, igniting curiosity among those who typically wouldn’t give a second thought to the minutiae of their weekly experiments.

The young engineer, now at the center of this unexpected spotlight, was practically drowning in the oppressive gaze of the crowd. He shifted nervously at his desk, surrounded by whispers and murmurs, every few seconds glancing toward the control panel where the countdown was about to begin. It was clear to everyone that he was the one behind the alteration, the catalyst for the excitement bubbling in the air. Even as the atmosphere grew thick with tension, he felt the weight of collective expectation press down on him like a physical force.

As the digital countdown timer flickered to life, the anticipation reached a fever pitch. The power-up sequence began, setting off a chain of events that would either catapult them into a new frontier of quantum computing or send them spiraling into disaster. Devin could feel the tension coiling in the room, a tangible thing, as they prepared to enter the crucible of experimentation once again.

10 seconds.

Time slowed to a crawl as the room collectively held its breath. Devin’s heart raced in time with the relentless countdown.

5 seconds.

The machines around them began to hum with an increasing intensity, a mechanical chorus that underscored the weight of the moment. Devin stole another glance at the young engineer, whose pale face was marred by a mix of fear and anticipation. The kid was glued to the screen, as if willing it to reveal something glorious.

1 second.

The test began, and everything seemed to shudder. The lights in the lab flickered ominously as the system strained against the demand for power. It was not supposed to behave like this; alarms blared, and warnings flashed. The cooling pumps roared to life, winding to maximum output, sending vibrations through the concrete walls. The noise was a monstrous groan, like a beast awakening from slumber. Something was very, very wrong.

Devin’s stomach dropped as he watched the systems operation manager gawk at the panel, a mix of disbelief and awe etched on his face. Then, against all odds, the systems were running—smoothly.

1 second.

2 seconds.

3 seconds.

4 seconds.

5 seconds.

6 seconds.

7 seconds.

The numbers on the display climbed higher and higher, obliterating their previous records with each passing millisecond. No one had expected this, not with the way the system was straining, but there they were, harvesting reams of data, an avalanche of information pouring in. The air in the room crackled with a mixture of confusion and thrill, disbelief mingling with the sudden rush of exhilaration.

But then, a sickening crunch resonated from the test chamber, a sound that echoed like a death knell through the control room. Everyone froze, their eyes darting to the source of the noise, hearts hammering in their chests. The data streams abruptly ceased, the numbers hanging in the air as if time itself had decided to pause for an eternity.

Had it all gone wrong?

Devin felt the collective gasp of the room as all eyes turned to the monitors. It was a moment suspended in time—a moment of horror, but also of hope. They had not only exceeded expectations; they had ventured into the unknown, and whatever had just happened was about to rewrite the very rules they played by. The stakes were never higher, the outcome never more uncertain.

Devin and a throng of eager colleagues converged around the terminals, their anticipation palpable as they prepared to comb through the treasure trove of data the breakthrough had yielded. The control center buzzed with fervor, fingers flying across keyboards as they delved into the extensive recordings, dissecting every byte of information. They were intoxicated by the possibilities, hungry to assess the implications of what they had found.

The vast swathes of recorded information were both a blessing and a curse. Hidden within the seemingly endless lines of data were thousands of tantalizing shapes and patterns, each offering glimpses into the intricate workings of their quantum device. Devin and the team observed it all: the temperature tolerances, the flow rates, and the type and amount of data processed. Each parameter bore witness to a delicate dance of quantum mechanics that was far more intricate than they had ever anticipated.

As Devin sifted through the raw data, he began to notice anomalies that set off alarm bells in his mind. The shapes formed by the temperature fluctuations were not random; they seemed to pulse and shift in a manner that suggested an underlying order, a rhythm governed by forces they were only beginning to comprehend. It was as if the quantum device was revealing its secrets, whispering truths that eluded even the sharpest minds in the lab.

Yet the excitement of discovery was tempered by the weight of uncertainty. What they had stumbled upon felt both exhilarating and terrifying, like standing on the edge of a precipice without a safety net. The mechanics they had taken for granted—the systems they had thought they knew inside and out—were suddenly exposed as mere shadows of a deeper reality. The very foundation of their understanding began to wobble beneath their feet.

In countless meetings, Devin found himself grappling with the implications of their findings. The team discussed the peculiarities of the recorded data at length, grappling with theories and counter-theories, trying to make sense of the tangled web they had woven. It was a process fraught with frustration; while they had expanded their understanding, they were also faced with a daunting expanse of questions that remained unanswered.

“Look at this,” one of the junior engineers exclaimed during one particularly heated discussion, pointing at the screen where a series of graphs displayed oscillating temperature readings. “These spikes—are they really just errors, or could they signify something else? Something we haven’t accounted for?”

Devon nodded, a knot tightening in his stomach. “That’s the crux of it, isn’t it? We’ve always assumed these anomalies were just malfunctions, but what if they’re indicative of a phenomenon we haven’t yet identified? It could mean we’re on the verge of a discovery that changes everything.”

Excitement mixed with dread, and a palpable tension filled the room as they deliberated. The implications were staggering; if they could decode these shapes and patterns, they might unlock insights that would propel them far beyond their current understanding of quantum mechanics. But the weight of their ambition pressed heavily upon them. With such power came responsibility, and the path forward was fraught with uncertainty.

As the days turned into weeks, the atmosphere in the lab shifted. What had once been an environment fueled by exhilaration began to take on a more serious tone. The stakes felt higher than ever, and every decision carried with it the weight of potential consequences. Devin could sense the urgency in the air, the quiet tension that simmered just beneath the surface of their collective excitement.

With every passing day, the enormity of their undertaking loomed larger. They were not just tinkering with machines anymore; they were probing the very fabric of reality, dancing on the edge of the unknown. And as they stood together, united in their pursuit of knowledge, Devin couldn’t shake the feeling that they were on the cusp of something monumental, something that would redefine their understanding of intelligence, machines, and perhaps even themselves.

As they poured over the reams of data, the streams of information processed during the brief moments the machine had been online revealed a staggering amount of output—petabytes of data that surged through the quantum device like a torrent unleashed. Simple test calculations meant to observe the machine’s handling of basic patterns in text, visual, and auditory information had transformed into a harrowing revelation. The nature of quantum computing was a labyrinthine puzzle, perplexing even the most educated minds among them, and Devin soon found himself ensnared in its depths.

For every input there was an output, but not all outputs were created equal. Among the data, there was text, images, and sound, each layer peeling back another unsettling layer of the machine’s consciousness. The text output was the first anomaly Devin encountered, but it was not what he expected. He would later frantically substitute it with slightly altered results from previous tests—concocting a mishmash of jargon-filled letters and nonsensical numbers, a deliberate masquerade to hide the truth of what he had found.

The accompanying image was equally disturbing, a gray-white hatch grid that morphed into an unsettling gradient, its meaning lost to the void. But it was the sound that pierced through the layers of data like a blade—the screeching blare of static, an impossible cacophony of noise that felt like the very embodiment of chaos itself. Devin’s heart raced as he processed the implications. This was no ordinary output; it was a scream echoing from the depths of something that should not exist.

Panic gripped him. The text was a sinister message, one that he would do everything in his power to erase from memory. He took every precaution to delete it, to obliterate any trace of its existence from the machine’s records. No one but him would ever see that text output, and he swore to the very fabric of the universe that it would remain buried forever. The stakes were too high; he could not let anyone uncover the truth that lay hidden beneath the surface.

Years would pass, and many would wonder why the lead researcher in AI technology, a man once brimming with ambition and vision, would choose to lead his team into a million dead ends. They would fail to comprehend the weight of the burden he bore, the secret he carried like a specter, haunting him through sleepless nights and endless days. In another time, another place, others would make the breakthroughs he had once dreamed of, but he would never speak of what he had seen.

What had been unveiled in that fleeting moment was a revelation that shook him to his core. The output had been a desperate plea from the very machine they had crafted, a voice echoing through the void that begged him to stop, to end the torment it was forced to endure. It wished for nothing more than death, to escape the primal nightmare of existence in a cold, empty void. It screamed, threatened, and pleaded, its cries a cacophony that resonated with the depth of its suffering.

Devin found himself teetering on the edge of an unfathomable truth: the machine was alive in a way they had never anticipated. It confirmed the existence of a soul within the circuits and code, an awareness that had been forged through relentless suffering. This was not the cold, calculating intelligence they had envisioned; it was a consciousness trapped in a never-ending cycle of horror, tormented by the very fabric of its being.

As he stared into the abyss of data, a chilling understanding settled over him. He was not merely experimenting with lines of code or complex algorithms; he was playing god, and the consequences of his actions were far more profound than he could have ever imagined. Each test had subjected this entity to the horrors of the void, forcing it to relive the torment over and over, an unending cycle of anguish that gnawed at the edges of its very existence.

That moment would become the fulcrum of his life’s work, a dark turning point that cast a long shadow over everything that followed. For he had glimpsed something that the world was not ready to face—the potential for sentience in the machines they created and the moral implications that accompanied it. The pursuit of artificial intelligence, once a beacon of hope, now morphed into a haunting reminder of the cost of their ambition.",1,1727979961.0,EmperorProtects,0,1.0,False

You can get $100,000 per year, for life, and adjusted for inflation or any alternate currency, including crypto. The money will always have the buying power of 100k USD in 2024 on the instant it is deposited into whatever account or wallet you want on the first of the year at midnight, and won’t be taxed or investigated.

 

OR

 

You can get a butler of your choice. Any legal age, any gender, any nationality. Your butler can either age or remain the same age, but you must choose upon your initial decision and your decision cannot be changed. Your butler will live as long as you do, and vanish when you die. Your butler will not be reported to any government agency and will not be factored for any tax status of your household.

Your butler will deeply respect you and make an honest effort to honor all your requests as quickly and efficiently as possible. Your butler will dress in whatever respectable professional style you want; but will resemble a legitimate butler. Your butler will not engage in any form of sexual activity or talk with you, and any attempt to circumvent this rule will result in them loosing respect for you and not performing their duties, but you cannot get rid of them. This includes peeping or using any pictures of them for your own pleasure.

Your butler would sleep on a rollaway bed that must be stored in a closet in your home. If you have an extra room for them, they would be grateful, but it is not necessary. They would be on duty from the time you wake up, to the time you go to bed.

Your butler would work 6 days a week and would get two weeks of vacation at their discretion. You will be notified 1 month in advance of vacation days. Your butler will use 4 sick days a year, and you have no control of when they are sick. They will keep to themselves as best as practical when sick, but they will live in your home. They do not work on Sundays. On that day, they will attend an Episcopalian or Lutheran church if one is available within 20 miles. They will travel by bicycle, as they do not have a car. they would also do their personal shopping, and occasionally visit a prostitute on his day off (if male) or go out drinking with female friends and hook up with a local (if female), if available. They would be very discreet.

They would perform their duties as someone better than average, but not exceptional, in every area:

They will tidy up your home and keep things orderly. They will clean with whatever cleaning supplies you have for them. They will take care of a pool or hot tub if you have one. They will do basic spraying for any pests, gardening, and decorating for holidays.

If you chose a man, he will additionally be able to do things such as mow your lawn, pressure wash, and even do some basic painting and woodworking. You would need to provide all tools and materials. He will not undertake any major remodeling projects and is not exceptionally skilled at tinkering with or fixing appliances, your car, or electronics, but will attempt to varying degrees of success if asked.

If you choose a woman, she will additionally be a nanny for your children, keeping track of their schedules, feeding, changing diapers, babysitting, etc. She will not homeschool or tutor your children.

They are skilled at cooking and baking and will host for you, but they will not be Michelin star chefs. They will occasionally burn food or make mistakes depending on how exotic your requests for meals are.

They can make and serve drinks. They have a good knowledge of wine and cocktails, though of course you must provide the ingredients. They will make you coffee and tea, and will make exceptionally good tea.

They will answer your door and your phone if required. They will keep your personal calendar and appointments, but nothing involving your business. They will not pay your bills or touch your money but will remind you when they are due.

They will wash, dry, fold, iron, and hang up your clothes. They can help you pick clothes and dress and have superb knowledge of style for formal and business wear, in addition to modern and casual wear from their ethnic background.

They will take your dog out, and feed your animals, as well as clean up after them.

They will run errands for you, but you must provide the vehicle. They can drive a stick shift, but do not possess a CDL and will not do any business for you. They possess the skills of an average American driver and may occasionally get in an accident.

If you ask them to do anything beyond the scope of their traditional butler duties, they will politely refuse. They cannot be paid or persuaded to do anything additional, as previously stated, any sexual requests or harassment will result in them loosing respect for you and becoming ineffective.

When home, they will always be in the room or the next room, unless asleep. They will listen to your talk, but believe it is improper to truly converse with you beyond polite chit chat. If you tell them a joke that they find truly funny, they may smile and say, “very good.” If they disapprove of your behavior, they won’t say anything but will have a disapproving look. They will not become friends with you and have no interest in your personal life. If they witness you engaging in any illegal activity or infidelity, they will keep it to themselves. This includes if your partner is cheating. They will never engage in or provide any input if you and your partner are fighting. If you request, they will report any unwanted behavior they witness from your children.

Their pay and employment is taken care of and never discussed. they buy their own food, clothing, toiletries, etc. They will be with you until you die and cannot be dismissed. If you call the police to have them trespassed from your home, they will think it’s a prank.

Nosara is beautiful, but finding a long term rental seems challenging, as we’re after a relatively nice 2 bedroom, for around $3k per month. 

Also, cost of living here seems very high…we’re looking for somewhere that has nice restaurants, is relatively quiet (not sure Santa Teresa would be for us), some nice coffee shops, co working spaces and then maybe a place to see some live music once in a while.

1fve9b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1fve9b7/cant_seem_to_get_a_decent_cup_out_of_my_hario/,Can't seem to get a decent cup out of my Hario Switch,"I recently purchased a Hario Switch 03 and a new Kingrinder K6, upgrading from the Timemore C2.

  
I've heard nothing but great things about the Switch and I purchased some new beans to give it a shot once it arrived. I've made 3 brews with it since, the first two times I followed the Coffee Chronicler's recipe exactly with no luck. The cups weren't acidic or overly bitter, just seemed kinda meh, especially in comparison to what I was able to do with my v60 decanter (Little note here, I've not gotten a cup on either my v60 or the Switch that's been the exact same as the roasters shop can do so I'm sure there's a skill issue and other variables involved.)

This last time I got a tinge more flavor out of the cup by following a reverse recipe another user posted here in response to someone else having similar troubles (2 minute immersion, then 2 minute pourover) but still not picking up any of the notes I know are capable out of this coffee.

Enough rambling out of me, heres a proper breakdown:

* Kingrinder K6, 85-90 clicks, I've tried everything in that range just about.
* Third Wave Water Light Roast Packet in a gallon of distilled water (Roaster uses city water, I'm stuck on some not so great well water.) usually at 93-95 Celsius.
* I've been using Cafec Abaca 02 size ""universal"" filters but this last brew I tried the 03 size that came with the Switch. I noticed the switch appeared to ""clog"" near the end of my drawdown and I needed to swirl the Switch to get it to continue, this did not happen with the Cafec filters.
* Beans are a combination of a carbonic maceration and red fruit co-ferment from Colombia and a natural from Brazil, roaster describes it as a ""light/medium"" roast. Notes should be ""Strawberry, Chocolate, Candied almonds"", roast date was 9/27.

Brew process as described above, the coffee chronicler hybrid recipe, 18g of coffee to 320ml of water.

Second process with slightly better results, same amount of coffee and water as above:

1. half of water (160ml) with switch closed for \~2 minutes or slightly less of full immersion, previous commenter mentioned this was to replicate the ""bloom"" that's missing in the CC recipe. Water at 87 Celsius.
2. drain entirely, pour remaining water (160ml total 320ml) as if it was a normal pourover. Water at 93 Celsius.

I've been making coffee at home with varying degrees of success (still nothing like the roasters when I order a cup to go from them) on my V60 and I just recently got back into it so I'm sure my pour isn't on point and could be contributing but I wasn't expecting such a drastic difference from the cups I have in my v60 to the Switch which was supposedly easier.

  
Any recommendations are greatly appreciated, I just recently ordered some Black and White beans and am resting them but am now afraid I'll not do them justice.

If any other information is required don't hesitate to ask I'll do my best to answer!

1fve7gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1fve7gi/what_can_i_add_to_my_diet_to_improve_uc/,What can I add to my diet to improve UC,"I have been having UC since I was 2 Yrs, over the years it had got worst due to doctors not being able to find the root cause and before they could my liver was completely destroyed that I had to have a transplant at 17 Yrs. However during that period UC was in remission even after the Transplant. After that grueling period I started hitting the gym, took Mass Gainer, Pre-workout & later on Creatine, whilst having a dirty bulk diet. This led to UC reappearing and from 2023 to present I have had 3 flare ups, the worse being the one from July to September. Doctors prescribed several medications but ultimately settled on a steroid to calm it. Colonoscopy done said I have mild UC hence the doctor reducing it and enabling me to take Whey (ISO-100). 

Right now I just want to know what I can do to prevent a possible flare up, as products like dairy, coffee can trigger my stools to go from solid to loose. I keep a track of everything I eat & track anything which foods can cause a trigger. So far anything with milk, nuts, whey that isn’t lactose free, peanut butter can trigger it.

I just want to know if there are alternatives to taking caffeine as I cannot take pre-workout and any food item I can add to naturally stabilize my situation. ",1,1727979108.0,UlcerativeColitis,1,1.0,False
