Nazlii: orphan, the only child 
22 years old
Works part time at a Cafe and also manages the book store at his neighborhood : Adam :
The no. 1  CEO  of the elevate enterprises
Eldest son 
Parents live abroad
Brother :omar
: Sitting in her small rooftop room that she'd requested her landlord to not throw her out of... She was deep in thoughts or maybe she was just sitting with numb brain.. Outside it was dark with heavy rain.. Making it hard to survive in a cold room with no heating system... Nazlii just came back from her part time at the book store... She went to the bookstore after completing her 8 hour job at the Cafe from morning 7 to 6 in the evening... Nazlii was not always a loner, the cheerful girl who was full of life had changed after the dramatic turn of events in her life.. Her parents died in a car accident at a young age.. No relative took the responsibility to look after Nazlii and being the only sibling she'd no one to rely on.. Growing up  she had dreams... But now all she knows is to find a way to keep her life going.. She thought she could never achieve her dream of being an artist... She dropped out of high school because she couldn't afford it anymore and now all she knows is surviving with no one around her.. No family no friends no one.... On the other hand Adam the heir of his family SOMANs.. Adam soman was well known for his cold personality since university he he'd never talked to anyone if not needed... There was no backstory that made him like this he was just like this cold, distant but caring... OH THE MAN HE WAS.. charming personality taking everyone's breath away from the path he walked on.. .. Handsome- no he was the ultimate definition of perfect.. The only friend he had was his younger brother Omar.. Even though they were like ice and fire still the best duo ever...
: It was  really cozy morning, the sun finally came out after the cold days.. It was warm and comforting today... But Nazlii still felt cold the coldness of the cruel world... She just got the orders from the customers.. She was making a cold coffee for the customers.. The Cafe was buzzing with people but there was a strange quite in the Cafe that was comforting to her.... Just right then the bell of the Cafe ringed slightly indicating someone has entered... Nazlii being herself really didn't care... Until her friend slightly nudged her to which she gave her a strange look... And then Nazlii's gave moved to where her friend was staring with wide eyes and almost a wide open mouth.. And oh there standsthe charming CEO Adam.. With his smugged face.. He was handsome no doubt....
Adam's pov:
I have a meeting in an hour but unfortunately my head is paining like hell and to get some fresh Air I got out of that  suffocating place oh I mean my damn office... I looked around the Cafe for an empty space and saw the women staring at Me... OK not again please... Then a found a nice place near the window.. ""perfect"" he muttered and went to sit there
: Nazlii's pov: when I looked where Marie was staring and saw all the head's turned towards him.. OK he seemed like a man who could rule an empire and actually he does... I recognized him in first glance... Adam Soman the eldest heir of the SOMANS ENTERPRISES ... Who wouldn't recognize him he's  always on the top of the headlines.... I took my attention back to what I was doing and told Marie to go take the orders but no she was not in the mood cause rightnow she was busy clicking the prince charming... Oh this girl... I took deep breath and went to take the order from the newly came customer.
Adam's pov : I tilted my head backwards and was resting it on the chair with my eyes closed I really needed some peace.. That's when I heard a small voice calling ""sir"" and realized someone was asking for attention as I opened my eyes slowly and God forbid I think I lost my senses to think properly... I didn't knew I was staring until she called me again.. And I replied with a simple ""hmm"" oh I was busy staring... Nvm..
""sir what would you like to order""
""ahh.. amm a cold coffee with zero sugar""
"" on the way"" she said with a smile that bearly reached her eyes yk the type where you put a smile for the show... The she went back to her work and ig she was working on my order.. And me oh I was staring   I don't remember staring at someone this much long.  But Oh Man I swear she was different I won't say she was undeniably beautiful... But she was different she had soft curly dark brown hair that fell over her shoulders half straight half curls... Almond shaped eyes that were almost hazel but they seemed so empty so faraway... She was tall figure and ig undeniably mysterious... ""interesting"" he said with a slight smile
Nazlii's pov : I was busy making the cold coffee he ordered with zero sugar....what type of person would drink coffee with zero sugar huhhh nvm.... That's when Marie nudged me slightly.. And I hummed slowly expecting another story she wanted to share... Such a nice and amazing person she is.... I looked up when she called my name and said ""hey I think he's staring at you""
Nazli: who????
Marie :oh girl the billionaire obvio
Nazlii: huh?? Why would he...
I said and moved to look back and oh to my unfortunate thoughts he was actually staring... And not just staring he was smiling... Wth isn't he famous for his cold aura... I took my gaze away but could feel my cheeks heating up.. Wth... After I was done with his order I told Marie to take it cause there was no way in hell I would go there again.... After sometime it was almost the closing time  as it was Sunday boss told us to close the Cafe early also cause of the bad weather... Finally I would have some good time sleep....marie also left early if was me who had to close the Cafe.. I roamed my gaze around the Cafe and found the great Adam still sitting wth is wrong with this man doesn't he has a company to look after... I took a deep breath and went straight to him and called him.. ""sir would you like to order something else..??""
Adam :oh not really
Nazlii :oh I see but I want to inform you that we are closing up early cause of bad weather... Umm if you don't mind...???
Adam: oh no absolutely no I was just about leave just waiting for my brother but ig he's late
Nazlii : oh you can wait if you want I can delay the closing...
She gave a lip tight smile and WAs about to leave.. When suddenly he called me again
Adam :umm hey Nazlii!!!
... I halted on my steps... What the-  how does he knows my name... I knew for a reason he was stalking me... I'll not leave him if it is so... This damn human is following me wth.... She started blabbering in her mind with herself without realising she is facing him now...
Adam: umm.. I-
He was about to say something but oh wait who was even listening..
Nazlii: how dare you.!
Adam: huh?? What....?
Nazlii : I thought you're such a noble man and a respected figure but wth heck you're are you by any chance stalking me his the heck you know my name... My friend told me that you were staring... And I saw you staring like a creep but I thought no u was imagining things but wth.... You little piece of shit-... How the heck you got my name.....
She kept on blabbering without noticing the smile on the face of the man who was standing in front of him... Damn he was trying to control from laughing out loud but she was wayy too adorable for it.... And finally she saw him smiling she got caught offgaurd well his smile was also charming but... Hey that's not the point rightnow...
Nazli: hey you! Damn Adam Soman why the heck you are laughing like that you sickbustard
Adam bursted out laughing damn!... No one called him like that and bastard oh no never.... 
Adam:cleared his throat* ahmm sorry.. For that but oh hey you also know my name so that's a mutual thing isn't it.. * he said teasing her*
Nazliii: Ik your name cause you're always on the damn TV like you own it huhh!!!
Adam:oh I see *he said smiling softly.. Oh the insult *
That's when someone called out 
""oh my lovely brother I didn't knew you'd a thing for the hardworking Cafe staff.. Oh but wait that's cute... He said his lips tilting in to mischievous grin...
To which our cold girlie Nazlii found herself being a whole damn tomato...
Adam: oh Omar!  Since when are you standing there...
Omar : oh my brother since you two are fighting like a cute lovely dovey couple... *he said still grinning * 
Nazlii:hey you! Wth is wrong with you we are just talking that's it... Nothing more nothing less..
Adam:*smirked * hey Omar wait outside I'm just coming..
Omar :yay! Brother.... OK see ya soon to be sister in law....
Nazlii:*blushing* hey what the-
Adam :ok calm down.... Now miss know-it - all.... And here the bill *he handed it to her there hands slightly touching * he was about to walk away when he turned with a slight smile and came closer to her...
Adam: BTW you have your name card on your uniform.. *he said holding his smile* but if you want I can also call you beautiful... He slightly winked and left leaving a whole damn tomato behind him...
: That night the damn man called Adam took her peaceful sleep away he won't leave her head making it harder for her to sleep....
Nazlii:aahhh that damn billionaire * she said getting frustrated * but couldn't hold her thoughts that were drifting back to him again and again
Situation was no different for Adam but the difference was he had a peacefull sleep after many days... The night was free of any other stress...
AFTER 1 MONTH
it had been one month since their first encounter... Except for the feeling that had bloomed in their hearts .... They were falling for each other in a dangerously romantic way... But never  talked about it.....   Adam kept on visiting the Cafe only to see her beautiful... Nazlii only thought that Adam only saw her as a good friend... And oh that hurts but she didn't expected what was coming her way....
One evening again the Cafe was empty and the prince charming *that's what she called him * was sipping on his coffee enjoying the view which was Nazlii...
That's when Nazlii came up to him and told that we are closing... And he told her to sit with him he had something serious to talk about....
Today he was gonna test her limits.... Let's see beautiful *he thought *
Nazlii:hmm.... So what is it???
Adam: actually I want to get married as you know I'm getting kinda old *he joked he nowhere looked like and oldy it was as he just came out of magazine *
Nazlii:  *after hearing what he said... It fastened her heartbeat *but she managed to breathe... ""hmm so anyone - you have your eyes on?? She tried to joked.. But her eyes betrayed her... And Adam saw it...
Adam:umm... Actually yess.. I have been seeing her and she's totally my type... And I want to ask her out..
Nazlii: oh I think I stopped breathing.... Heart shattered... What was I even expecting... This damn rich perfect billionaire to be with me who is hardly managing her meals... *she thought she's gonna burst into tears.. But held herself... * that's... That's such a nice thing I mean go ahead and confess or maybe take your mother or Omar... I mean she won't deny you... And I mean why would she even do that... Just go ahead *she said the last sentence in a low voice... Slowly * umm... I'll just take the keys and close the Cafe you should also leave.... I mean go.... Go have your time with her... *she stood up and was about to like really run but Adam held her hands...
Adam: hey beautiful! Why are you running away...?
*he actually saw her face which was on the verge of crying.... Oh he hate himself for doing this...
Nazlii:uhh.. What?? Nooi.... I'm not I'm just... Just getting late...
Adam:but I'm not done yet.. * he stood up and came in front of her and held her hands *... So Nazlii Aman.... Will you  beautifully be mine..??
Nazlii: *stood there shocked  wth is happening... Was he... Was he talking about me...?
""what- I mean you were talking about me..?
Adam : of course beautiful... Who else could it be..??. He smiled softly... Ahh the smile Nazlii lost her heart to... She didn't realize a tear slipped down her eyes...
Adam hugged her slowly.. A comforting Hug.... And Nazlii hugged her tighter.... Oh she never felt this much safe in how much long she doesn't even remember.....
.... And that's how Nazlii's destiny took a turn to a beautiful journey...

1lw7af7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1lw7af7/my_sweet_dream/,My sweet dream,"At night I had a dream:
Dasha was taking Vika to the gym in my car. When they arrived, I got behind the wheel of my car and it turned out that I was riding an electric scooter. It was raining outside and when I turned on the road, I fell. My clothes quickly soaked with water from the road and one side of my clothes was completely wet.
But I didn't feel the cold, although it was autumn outside.
At the intersection, a woman was riding a bicycle and a small dog was barking at her. A man was driving past, he drove the dog away from the woman and this dog jumped onto my scooter and then we rode together.
I was riding up a strange street, it looked beautiful: stone steps, greenery grew on the fences on the sides.
On the way, I met a girl, she was with a guy. And I immediately understood that this was her boyfriend. I don't remember how she injured her finger, but for some reason I helped her treat it. We were walking up the stairs and it turned out that she lives in one of these houses.
She stopped on the porch of her house, and I wanted to continue my journey. But she held out her finger and there was a question in her eyes: ""Are you going to leave me with a pain in my finger?""
I didn't know how to react?! Looking at the wound, it seemed as if she had somehow received a burn. I touched her hand, looked at her finger and the first thing that came to my mind was to blow on the lesion. It's a burn, so the cold should help it, so you need to blow.
When I finished my manipulation, I looked into her eyes. But now I saw a call there to ""continue treatment""
I didn't know what else I could do in this situation?! For some reason I wanted to kiss her finger (as in childhood when I got some kind of injury, my mother always kissed me and said that it would heal soon. At that moment I felt that I was loved)
She looked at me with surprise, but a smile played on her lips. Looking into her eyes, I wanted to show tenderness and care for her. But we don’t even know this girl??
At some point I felt that I should continue my journey (I don’t know where I was going, but I was going somewhere?!)
She is standing near her house, and I was going somewhere. This means that our paths should diverge now. I tried to take a step forward, but she stood in my way. Our eyes met and there again the question “Are you just going to leave like that?”
I leaned over to kiss her on the cheek, but she didn’t turn her head very much and my kiss fell on the corner of her lips. Her eyes met mine and she looked... in love... with me.
We stood very close and I hugged her waist, I gently touched her hips, controlling my movements I enjoyed this closeness.
Looking into her eyes I leaned towards her, our lips touched, it was a gentle, uncertain, calm kiss. With every second this kiss turned into a breath, just as uncontrolled, natural, calm, as if our lives depended on it.
She uttered the first words: ""Mi piace il tuo bacio"" It seems it was Italian.
I could only say: ""I don't speak your language. I'm Ukrainian.""
Her eyes continued to look at me, there was so much tenderness in them, I had long forgotten what it was like to look into such eyes?!
She, remembering the words, slowly, said ""I can... speak Ukrainian... I studied in Ukraine. I like... to feel your kiss""
I could only stand and smile at her. She was so cute: she had black hair. Her skin was tanned. And her eyes... beautiful, too beautiful to describe.
The next second, my friend and I were sitting on the upper deck of the ship. My friend suggested we go down for coffee. I don't know why we were on that ship. When we started to leave the deck, after coffee, the same eyes looked at me through the glass... They were so sincere that if I saw them in reality, I think I wouldn't be able to take my eyes off them. Never...
I went up to her and she asked ""Are you going to leave like this? And I'll never see you again?""
With all the tenderness in me, I touched her wrist, took her fingers in my hand, raised them to my lips. I kissed her wrist. And looking into her eyes I said ""I will love you with all my heart for as long as you allow. And now I'm just going to buy coffee""
She smiled. I have no idea where I found the strength to take my eyes off her, but as I headed for the exit I felt her gaze on me.
Looking into her eyes the whole world ceased to exist. There was only her and me...

About a month ago, my friend- total tech nerd and crypto geek- stumbled upon a super simple method to make money online. Sounded scary at first, but it worked (crazy, right?)  
Instead of selling it or setting up a paywall, he just dropped it publicly on his Reddit: almantas07  
No idea why – guy’s a machine... or maybe he just likes helping out.

I tested it with $20 and got back $100 the same evening. Since then I’ve been running it for 5 days straight and making a steady $220+/day.  
If you’re reading this and you’re in doubt – give it a shot. Costs less than a coffee, but could set you up nice.

The barista who hums off-key while steaming milk—do they write poetry in their free time? The person scrolling through their phone, a half-smile—are they replaying a childhood memory or drafting a text to someone they love? That split-second curiosity, that quiet “I wonder what it’s like to be you”? That’s sonder: the awe of realizing every human is a universe of secrets, struggles, and symphonies, just like yours. Welcome to r/SkinDeepSonderInfo, where we chase that feeling like stargazers chasing constellations.​This isn’t a forum for surface-level small talk. It’s for the moments that crack open the world: the elderly neighbor who waters her flowers at dawn—you later find out she’s honoring her late husband, who loved roses. The coworker who never eats lunch with the team—turns out they’re saving money to send their sibling to college. Post the snippets that made you pause: “I saw a teen crying in a bookstore, then noticed they were clutching a book about grief. I left a note: ‘You’re not alone.’ They wrote back, ‘This is my first Christmas without my dad.’” Share the “aha!” realizations: “I judged the guy who always speeds past my street—until I learned he’s a single dad rushing to pick up his kid from daycare.”​Here, we trade the stories behind the faces. Swap the tiny epiphanies: “I sat next to a woman on the train who kept checking her watch. She finally said, ‘My daughter’s having surgery today.’ Now I think of her every time I hear a ticking clock.” Celebrate the connections that bloom from sonder: “I posted about the barista who remembers my order, and someone replied, ‘I asked her once—she’s been working two jobs to put herself through nursing school.’ Now we all tip extra and write her encouraging notes.”​You don’t need a PhD in psychology—just eyes that notice, a heart that wonders. Bring the moments that made you think, There’s more here than meets the eye. We’ll marvel at the invisible threads: the teacher who stays late grading papers because she once had a teacher who gave up on her, the homeless man who shares his food with a stray dog, the person in the grocery store counting pennies who volunteers at an animal shelter every weekend.​Welcome to the place where we don’t just see people—we unearth them. Let’s swap the snippets that make you go, “Wow, they’re a whole world I never knew,” and remind each other: the most extraordinary thing about being human is how ordinary moments hold galaxies.

I’m 34M, 167.8cm (5'6"") and 75kg (\~165lbs), and just started hitting the gym regularly about 1 month ago. My main goal is to grow bigger arms, especially triceps. But progress feels slow.



I’m currently training arms 2x a week. My main movement is close-grip bench press. Right now I’m doing 40lb plates + the bar, and I can lift it, but not for 10 reps straight. I’m working on form and control, not maxing out.



As for food:

\- \*\*Breakfast\*\*: 3 slices of bread, coffee milk, 1 egg, 1 sausage, 1 apple or banana, turkey slices with some mayo

\- \*\*Lunch\*\*: 2 boiled eggs and a scoop of protein powder

\- \*\*Dinner\*\*: usually steak + rice, or pasta with beef + onion + tomato sauce + mushrooms



I sleep around 8 hours a night and drink water throughout the day. I'm not tracking calories, but I suspect I might be eating a bit too little.



I know it's still early, but do you think I should:

\- Train arms more frequently (3x/week)?

\- Add more isolation (like skull crushers, curls)?

\- Change my diet (increase calories? add carbs or shakes?)?

\- Or just be more patient?



Any advice from people who've been here would really help! 🙏

Why don’t we cry for ourselves? Why don’t we get angry for what we went through? We keep missing someone who damaged us. Enough of that bullshit.

1lw75tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1lw75tj/are_the_openings_in_final_destination_meant_to_be/,Are the openings in Final Destination meant to be avoided so that the ending of each film can be set up for the Visionary or Final Characters to ultimately die ?,"Hi , for starters I really want to apologize if this is worded poorly or if it is a dumb question/post , I am a semi-new fan to the FD series , I love them so much and I started by watching the 6th one in theaters , watched the rest a month or so afterwards and fell in love so this is all only coming from a fan who want to understand more and seeking for other fans to feel free to drop their thoughts on this or theories or opinions on this or whatever else relating to the films :) 

Now , for my question. I know all the people in the opening vision are meant to die ultimately in some way , shape or form but I was just wondering if anyone else had considered the possibility of what if the visionary or final group (the trio/duo of “survivors” at the end of each film) in the opening was never really meant to die at that exact point in time in the beginning and instead this was Death’s way of showing the visionary how to avoid this situation in order to set up the ending sequence of each film? The question stems mostly from  FD3 , specifically when it came down to the photos but this could apply to any film. The photos are used in tandem with the visions Wendy has to foreshadow each death of every character and with that , as far as my understanding goes and based off the photos Wendy was originally intended to die by the McKinley sign/Cherry picker as one of the clues/foreshadowing hints for this is her shirt reading McKinley the same as the sign but her death was skipped over because Ian didn’t die originally in the store but instead his girlfriend died which caused Death to skip him and then Ian stopping Wendy from going any further , blocking the path of her to go further , stopping her death and eventually lead Death to return for him and to be smashed by the McKinley sign instead. That is my understanding of things and this event is what causes everything to eventually lead to the train sequence. On the train , Wendy realizes something is wrong bc of all the blurry faces passing by her (just like how the person in the photo next to her has a blurry face , foreshadowing her death right before the train crashes) , if she was truly meant to die by the sign (or by any other means), why would her picture have a blurry face in it only for this to occur at a later point in the future ? Maybe I am misunderstanding something about Death’s design or maybe I’m misunderstanding that Wendy was never meant to die prior to this ? I hope none of what I am saying sounds like a dumb “No one has every thought of this” type of opinion or post or me trying to be a know-it-all about the films , it just genuinely had been kinda bugging me in the back of my mind ever since I started really investing myself into the movies. The only other thing that personally made me also wonder about if the Visionary/Final Survivors are actually meant to die at the very end rather than how it was showed in the opening vision is because in FD4 where Bobby , at the coffee shop with Lori and Janet , he state “What if we didn’t change anything? What if this was the plan from the beginning?” Right before a truck comes in and runs them all down which to me suggests that the deaths that were avoided in the beginning were never meant to be how they were actually intended to die. I also recall a scene of him looking down at the coffee table earlier in the film and looking at what’s scratched into it as he did at the very end which I can assume may be another foreshadowing to their deaths at the coffee shop at the end , at least for Bobby.

Again , I apologize if I worded any of this poorly or if this is a very badly asked question regarding the film and I do not want to sound dumb but if I am missing anything or if anyone else has anything else worth sharing I would love to hear about it! I haven’t watched the films since finishing them and I’m sure there are a few things I missed or might have not properly remembered but I would really , really love any feedback or just some friendly thoughts about this or anything else regarding the films. Thank you to anyone and everyone who took the time to read this very dumb 4AM rambling. Please don’t cook me alive in the comments if this post is really bad though , I just really am a big fan with questions. XD - Thanks ! ",1,1752134794.0,FinalDestination,0,1.0,False
1lw75p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1lw75p3/complete_75k_womens_fictionya_the_beautiful_kind/,[Complete] [75k] [Women’s Fiction/YA] The Beautiful Kind – Young woman rebuilds her identity after a quietly controlling relationship,"Hi all,

I’m seeking honest, constructive feedback on the **first chapter** of my manuscript *The Beautiful Kind*, a Women’s Fiction/YA crossover (approx. 75k words).

**Premise:** After a young woman moves to a picturesque Southern town to build a new life with her fiancé, she slowly begins to lose herself to subtle emotional control. As she rediscovers old pieces of herself—through community, found family, and a dusty little library—she must choose between a curated life and an authentic one.

**What I’m looking for:**
- Does the voice feel engaging and grounded?
- Does the pacing work for an opening chapter?
- Do you connect with the protagonist and want to keep reading?

**CW:** Emotional manipulation, past trauma (non-graphic)

I’m planning to pursue traditional publishing eventually, so please do not share outside this space. Feedback can be posted in the comments or sent via DM—whatever’s easier for you. Thank you so much for your time and honesty!

– Emily




[The apartment smells like old coffee and cardboard. Not unpleasant—just lived in. The kind of smell that settles into the floorboards, into the corners of your clothes, into memory.

Eva crouches beside a half-filled box, tucking the edges of a sweatshirt around her ceramic mug. The chipped one. White with a faded floral pattern, the handle just starting to crack. She hesitates, then wraps it a little tighter and slides it into the box like something sacred.

The walls are bare now. Just faint squares where old posters used to hang. The bookshelf is half-empty, a few paperbacks lying sideways like toppled dominoes. Her satchel leans against the door, slouched from years of use. It’s too big for her frame, always has been, but it carries everything important.

She exhales slowly and presses the packing tape down with her palm. The sound rips through the quiet.

In the kitchen, her old kettle still sits on the burner—dented and reliable. There’s a single magnet left on the fridge: a cartoon frog with a crooked smile and a speech bubble that says, “Hang in there.” She doesn’t remember where it came from. She doesn’t want to leave it behind.

She peels it off and tucks it into the side pocket of her bag.

Outside the window, a late spring wind stirs the trees. A bird lands on the porch railing and stares at her like it knows something she doesn’t.

Eva stands and takes one last look around.

There are fingerprints on the light switch. A stain on the carpet that never quite came out. The faintest smell of lemon from the cleaning spray she borrowed from her neighbor.

It’s not perfect.

But it was hers.

She slings the satchel over one shoulder, picks up the box with both arms, and nudges the door open with her foot.

Time to go.



Eva blinked in surprise as she stepped out of her dorm, nearly running into Julian’s tall frame.

“Surprise,” he said with a grin. “Figured I’d make the trip easier. You hate driving.”

“Julian?” she asked, startled but smiling. “What are you doing here? I thought we were meeting in Bellhurst.”

He took her bag before she could protest. “I took the bus. Thought I’d earn some points for boyfriend of the year.” He winked. “Plus, I know the way better than you do.”

“I haven’t even finished packing yet,” she said softly, mostly to herself.

“Good thing I’m early, then.”

Eva smiled as she slid the aux cord into her phone. “I made a playlist,” she said, her tone light, maybe a little proud. “All the songs that felt like this summer.”

Julian gave a soft laugh. “That’s cute,” he said, but his fingers were already twisting the dial on her dashboard. “Signal’s good out here—this station always plays real music.”

He settled on a grainy local rock station. A song she didn’t know blared through the speakers. Something gritty and loud and nothing like the summer she’d imagined.

Eva kept smiling. It wasn’t a big deal. People had different tastes.

Still, a flicker of memory surfaced: road trips with her dad, taking turns picking songs—half for each other, half to annoy each other, always laughing. Even the ones she hated felt like inside jokes by the second chorus.

She looked at Julian. She couldn’t picture him handing over the aux cord just to hear something that wasn’t his style. Not even as a joke.

She adjusted the air conditioning and didn’t say anything.

 
They crossed into town just as the sun dipped behind the trees, casting gold across rooftops and sidewalks. Eva leaned forward in her seat, fingers grazing the window.

“Oh—look at that tree,” she breathed.

A massive old willow curved protectively over a playground fence, its branches swaying like a curtain in the wind.
“It looks like something out of a storybook.”

Julian glanced over but kept driving. “Huh. Never noticed it.”

She pointed again, this time at a small shop on the corner.
“That’s the coffee place, right? With the hand-painted sign? It’s adorable.”

He nodded, already turning the wheel. “Haven House. It’s kind of a dive, but everyone knows it.”

His hand lifted casually, gesturing out the window.
“That bar has the best whiskey sour in town. And that steakhouse—overpriced, but the ribeye’s worth it.”

Eva smiled, still watching the trees.

“That sounds nice,” she said softly.
But her eyes stayed on the crooked sign swinging above the coffee shop. The lettering was slightly uneven, like someone had done it with too much love and too little planning.

They both thought they were seeing the same place.
Eva was still glowing from the day—fresh off graduation energy, her heart open and beating loud with hope. The road trip hadn’t been perfect, but nothing ever was. She wasn’t analyzing. She wasn’t supposed to be. She was just here, letting herself believe this new chapter could actually be beautiful.

And then they pulled up.

 
The house was exactly what Julian described, but somehow... more. Or less. It was small, neat, tasteful to a fault. The shutters were the perfect shade of sage green, the lawn trim and hydrated, the porch swept clean like it had been waiting.
Of course it had—Elaine would never let it be otherwise.

Eva’s first reaction was awe.
This wasn’t the kind of place you live in. It was the kind of place you pass on a Sunday stroll and wonder who gets to have a life like that.

It was… lovely. But also curated. A kind of loveliness that was hard to relax into.
Every coaster exactly where it should be.
Every throw pillow matching the seasonal wreath on the door.
There was even an antique butter dish on the counter she was afraid to look at too long.

It smelled like lemon oil and clean linen.
It sounded like quiet.

She took a deep breath, trying to let the perfection settle in her bones.
She wanted to feel at home.
She needed to.

“It’s beautiful,” she said softly.

Julian smiled, proud. “You really think so?”

She nodded, still half-lost in the space. It was almost too much—too grown-up, too precise. Like stepping into someone else’s life instead of building one together. But she swallowed that thought. This was what people dreamed of, wasn’t it?

“I thought maybe we could just… stay in tonight,” she said, setting her bag near the stairs. “Order takeout or something. I’m a little wiped.”

Julian didn’t miss a beat. He crossed to her, warm and reassuring, his hands settling gently on her shoulders.

“I know,” he said. “I’m tired too.”

She exhaled, relieved—until he added, gently,
“But my mom’s been planning this since I told her you were coming. She even set the table.”
He smiled. “I’ve never brought a girl home before, Eva.”

The words were tender. Intimate. Like a secret just for her.

Her heart softened. Guilt crept in to replace the unease.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Yeah. Just for a little while.”

She kissed his cheek, and he beamed—like she’d passed some invisible test.

She didn’t see the shift in his posture when she turned away to grab her bag.
Just a flicker of satisfaction.
Then it was gone.

Julian offered his arm with a grin—old-fashioned, maybe, but charming. Eva slipped her hand through it, letting herself believe this could still be romantic.

The walk to Elaine’s wasn’t long. Just a few tree-lined blocks, the sidewalks smooth and well-kept, the lawns all perfectly squared.

Streetlights blinked on as they went. Sprinklers ticked quietly in the distance.

Julian pointed out a few things as they walked—a neighbor’s koi pond, a bakery that only opened on Saturdays, the house where he broke his arm falling from a dogwood tree. Eva laughed at that one. It felt real. Easy. Like maybe she could love this town too.

They paused at the corner before Elaine’s.

Julian turned to her, his voice soft.

“You look amazing, by the way.”

She smiled, caught off guard. “Thanks. I wasn’t sure the heels were a good idea.”

“They are,” he said. “Trust me.”

She adjusted her dress. Smoothed her hair.

Told herself this wasn’t a test. And if it was—she was ready.]

In October of that year he cheated on me with his child's mother & for some reason my 16 year old self was willing to forgive that. A week later he left me for a different girl. That kicked off what would become years of infidelity. Coworkers here & there for a few years. Married in 2018, he would stay out late with coworkers but nothing ever came up. 
 In 2022 he was messaging an old friend but the conversation was flirty, she wanted coffee & he said she'd need to earned it & she was quick to send a nude. He deleted the nude & told her thank you but he has too much to lose for that but in the next message he thanked her again and tried to keep the conversation alive. I was livid & annoyed at the fact that he didn't block her then & there.
 He says he has a sex addiction & hes always on the side of X & TikTok that have girls who are naked, taking videos & going live & such. It wouldn't bother me if it was porn. He's happy to interact with them, I find it odd, why can't regular pornsites be enough?
 Last year it got bad, he would have like 2 only fans subscriptions, made a whole discreet Instagram to comment on these videos. I was pregnant at the time & was livid he was on Omegel because why else is a 26 year old on that? Nudes. He claims it was just for talking but last night I found a screen recording of him being indecent waiting for a female.
 I guess the point I want to make is I'm tired. Last week he had a flirty convo with someone he knew in 6th grade, didn't mention me when he's always so proud to & turned off the notifications for it. I'm at the point where I want to do it too. I want to flirt. The way he looks at named women online, I want to be that too. I think anger & resentment are building up. I want this too work & for awhile thinks seemed fine but its getting to me. I know its wrong but the idea of revenge, I can't get it out of my head lately.
That isn't me though. I hope things get better. Thank you for reading, I don't have much people to talk to as I'm very embarrassed about the situation. Thank you.",2,1752134751.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

1lw74sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1lw74sx/caught_in_the_middle/,Caught in the Middle,"I (46F) left a terrible marriage back at the end of May and moved in with both my partners ""Brian"" (50M) and ""Stella"" (57F) They've been together for ten years or so.  I date both of them and every once in a while we'll have a threesome, but overall we date separately. I'm not an unicorn, just to clarify. 😂

When Stella was at belly dance in Monday night, Brian and I fooled around. Nothing out of the ordinary, just some sexy fun. However, I kind of fucked up by posting about it on FetLife. 

When she returned home from dance, the three of us watched Jeopardy together and Brian went to bed. (Such is the life of polyamous sex fiends, of course. LOL)

I watched a few episodes of ""Yellowjackets"" with Stella before going to bed around 11. We have a group chat on FB Messenger where we share memes, etc. Stella had seen my post on FetLife and was feeling neglected. She had been in the mood for the past few days, and due to some extremely stressful things happening over this last weekend, our usual Sunday group make out sesh got indefinitely postponed. 

Since Tuesday morning, Brian has been moody, standoffish and antisocial. I went to give him a good night kiss last night and it was like kissing my uncle. I actually told him that I was sorry to have bothered him. I have RSD and was in tears afterward. We have incredible sexual chemistry and I honestly can't get enough of him. Generally, the feeling is mutual. 

Tonight was belly dance again, so Stella was out of the house. Brian and I had a relatively nice evening;
we watched sleight of hand videos on YouTube while he made dinner. No affection, but I also know that he's not going to be in the mood *all* constantly. I'm okay with that most of the time; watching the magic videos was fun and I got to taste test some things while he was cooking.

Then Stella came home and the mood completely changed. The easy comraderie that he and I had earlier was completely gone and I think I literally felt the energy change in the room. Even my dog, who had been playful and goofy earlier, curled up on the couch and picked up on it. 

Last night on Messenger after Brian has gone to bed, I sent him a voice message asking what the best way to love him when this happens would be. I want to be as supportive and encouraging as possible. I got a vague non-answer like ""thank you for cleaning the countertops earlier"". 

Tonight I reminded him that I love him and that he's my first thought in the morning and the last one at night. He told me that he didn't have the empathy to deal with how I was feeling (and although that sounds harsh he added that it wasn't meant to - one of the things I love about him is that he says what he means and means what he says.) Because I am also Stella's partner, he said he wouldn't talk to me about what's going on with him because it's an issue with the two of them. 

Brian is bipolar and I'm wondering if this shift in energy is because of that. Honestly though, I don't know and he won't tell me. All I can do is discuss my hurt feelings with Stella. She's been dealing with this sort of thing from him for years now, so it's not her first rodeo. 

Brian and I have plans to spend the day together on Friday - he has an appointment and then we'll drop some books at the Little Free Libraries around town, get some coffee, and maybe go for lunch. I hope this will be good for all three of us; it'll give Stella a chance to relax without him in the house, and then he and I can hopefully have a nice afternoon together. 

I love them both very, very much and feeling like I'm caught in the middle absolutely sucks ass. My hope is just that this blows over soon and things can get back to how they were before this shit started. *sigh* ",1,1752134683.0,polyamory,3,1.0,False

Neither you nor dad did anything to learn and grow. I agree you had to tolerate the abuse from my grandma but come on you guys were her son she wasn't that harsh with you. You are much harsher than her to me. How could you not think ""I don't want to repeat the same things"" how could you just remain the same?

You guys didn't get to follow your passion but you're doing the same to me. Why are you not thinking that maybe...maybe let's try to be less harsh.

Instead you guilt trip me into thinking that I'm getting all the freedom in the world and that I'm obliged to follow your orders. For you love is never unconditional. 

You expect a child, me to provide you with unconditional love. You feel that no matter how wrong you are as a kid I should shut my mouth and listen to you guys but when I am wrong the hell loose break. Then you go on and on about explaining me that love is transactional. Oh almost how much I did believe you.

Why didn't you just take 1 extra step to make sure your kid is loved? Why is your primary goal money and not connecting with your child? I know it's hard for you guys too to be away from your child but phone calls exist. You didn't dad. You never ever were there for me. You never loved me. You never hugged me when things were wrong and you never comforted me. I was the one who had to grow up with all this chaos but I can't now.

I will betray you and run away because if I don't betray you I'll betray myself. I'll curse both you and me for not letting me live my life to fullest. I'll be much harsher on me than to you because to me you're still trying your best while also doing...nothing. it's as if I have stopped expecting from you guys.

I love you guys but I have to love me more. I hate myself in every way but I want to start loving me because you guys won't. And so I'm choosing to betray you and lie to you every single day until I run away because I want to be free. 

I want to travel, get lost and end up finding my favourite coffee shop. I want to know every single corner of the city that I live in. Funny how I need to use Google maps in my own city because I have never ever travelled. I can't betray myself anymore dad and mom. 

You always cry saying nobody helps you but mom were you there when I was crying in the same room as you were? Were you even there when I harmed myself? You saw and you chose you ignore my scars. How could you expect me to comfort you while being my chaos?
You always cursed me saying that I'll live the worst life but how could you do that to your own daughter? How could you? Why are your eyes filled with hatred for me but filled with love for your son? Whyyyyy ",2,1752134365.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

# What Changed in 2025? Google’s Core Updates Slapped Everyone

Remember the days when you could set it and forget it? Yeah, forget about it. The March and June 2025 updates didn’t just move the goalposts, they dug up the pitch and sold the grass for crypto. Freshness isn’t a bonus anymore; it’s life or death for your rankings. If your SEO still focuses on “keyword density,” you might as well sign it off as digital compost.

# Search Intent: Not What It Used To Be

“Search intent” in 2025 means something else entirely. AI Overviews and SGE are rewriting the rules. Users want answers, not essays, and Google’s AI modules are ruthless about it. If your content isn’t laser-focused on what the searcher wants *right now*, it’s invisible. Don’t waffle, get straight to the point and answer the question, or someone else (probably an AI) will.

# How the Big Players Adapted

The top sites? They’re not snoozing. They update constantly, slap on structured data like it’s going out of fashion, and polish their E-E-A-T signals till they shine. They’re serving what Google wants on a silver platter, with “last updated” dates front and center, and trust signals everywhere you look. That’s why they’re still top of the pile while everyone else wonders what happened.

# No Nonsense

* Updating isn’t optional, it’s the price of staying in the race.
* Ignore new ranking signals and you’ll be relegated faster than a dodgy football club.
* Want to win in 2025? Keep it fresh, nail the search intent, and prove you’re the real deal.

Stick around, and I’ll show you the exact steps to drag your old content back to the top, no fluff, no faffing about.

# Let’s Audit: Find the Dead Weight

First things first: If you haven’t audited your content in months, you’re leaving money on the table and asking Google to ignore you. Grab your tools, Semrush, Screaming Frog, whatever you fancy, and pull the data. I’m talking URLs, traffic, keywords, last update. Don’t just stare at your dashboard like a lost puppy, export the lot and get ruthless.

# What Needs Updating? Here’s How To Tell

Now, don’t waste time “refreshing” everything for the sake of it. Here’s how you spot the stinkers:

* Traffic fallen off a cliff? That’s one.
* Lost your spot in Featured Snippets or AI Overview? You’re out.
* Content that talks about 2022 like it’s ancient history? Bury it or bring it up to speed.
* No schema, no E-E-A-T, dodgy Core Web Vitals? Into the update pile it goes.
* If it reads like your nan wrote it, bin it or fix it.

Don’t forget a “last updated” changelog, Google loves it, and so do real people. If your pages look like they haven’t been touched since the pandemic, you’re asking for a slap.

# Spotting Entity Gaps - Get Competitive

It’s not enough to look at your own navel. Stack your content up against what’s topping the SERPs *now*. What entities are they talking about that you’re missing? If they’ve got schema, Q&A blocks, or AI-ready signals and you’re sitting there with plain text, you’re playing in the wrong league. Use those competitor tools and fill the gaps before they do.

# Prioritize - Don’t Be a Headless Chicken

You can’t fix everything at once, so rank the mess. What’s worth updating?

* Highest traffic and best linkers get top billing.
* Pages that *could* win features or AI Overviews with a quick fix? Fast-track them.
* Split your list: evergreen, trending, technical, whatever fits your biz.Get your priorities in order, and automate the list if you’re allergic to spreadsheets. No excuses.

# Map Out Your Update Plan - Or Keep Running in Circles

Half the battle is having a plan. Create a schedule, monthly, quarterly, whatever stops you from “meaning to update” and never doing it. Plug your audit into Trello, Asana, Notion, pick your poison. And assign actual humans: writers, editors, the lot. If it’s just a to-do list with no owner, you’ll be back here in six months whinging again.

If you don’t know what to update or why, you’re just rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic. Audit hard, get competitive, and make sure every update is a step up, not a paint job on a crumbling wall.

# Refresh Like You Mean It - Entities & Intent First

Stop slapping on a fresh date and thinking the job’s done. You want to win in 2025? Tear into your headlines, intros, and meta like you’re renovating a derelict pub.

* Start with what searchers actually want: the answer, up top, first 100 words.
* Drop in your main entities, don’t hide them halfway down.
* Every update should shout, “I get what you need, and here’s why you should trust me.”Still waffling? That’s why you’re on page two.

# Add Some Substance - Expand & Enrich (or Be Forgotten)

You want AI Overviews? Give them something to chew on.

* Find the gaps - new questions, SGE angles, fresh entities your competitors missed.
* Use your synonym clusters: don’t say “update” five times in a paragraph, refresh, revise, modernize.
* Swap stock images for real, updated visuals or charts that *actually* help.
* Drop in real-world examples, even if it means quoting Reddit or YouTube. Prove you’re not just rehashing the same old spiel.

# Schema & Structure - No Schema, No Glory

2025 is the year Google stops pretending it can “figure it out.”

* FAQ, HowTo, About, Speakable schema, all of it. If you’re not marking up your updates, you’re leaving traffic on the table.
* Make your schema bulletproof: validate it, cross-link it, update those “last modified” fields.
* Connect your new pages with the old; Google loves a neat Knowledge Graph.

# Don’t Forget the Tech - UX & Performance Are Non-Negotiable

Google’s Core Web Vitals don’t care about your feelings.

* Make sure your pages load fast, are mobile-friendly, and don’t jump around like a drunken leprechaun.
* Fix crawl issues, check your canonicals, and make “last updated” so obvious even a distracted bot can’t miss it.
* Update visuals, polish those CTAs, and for feck’s sake, test everything.

# Internal Linking - Build Your Own SEO Web

Nothing says “authority” like proper internal links.

* Link new guides to old winners; use anchor text that means something (“Content Pruning Guide,” not “click here” - are you twelve?).
* Keep your entity clusters tight - don’t scatter links like confetti.
* Use schema’s sameAs and mainEntityOfPage for that extra Knowledge Graph punch.

Updating isn’t just ticking a box. You’re rebuilding for a new game, with new refs, new rules, and zero patience for “good enough.” Nail your entities, prove your intent, structure for both bots and people, and watch your old content rise like a phoenix (or at least something less embarrassing than where it is now).

# Set the Bar - Or Watch Your Work Go to Waste

You went through all that trouble updating, but if you’re not measuring, you might as well have written it on the back of a beer mat.

* Track your rankings, traffic, impressions, don’t just trust your gut.
* Monitor “Last Updated” dates and make sure they’re showing up.
* Keep an eye on your E-E-A-T signals - if you’re not building trust, you’re building sandcastles at low tide.- 

# The Tools That Matter

Forget random spreadsheets and dodgy browser plugins.

* GA4, Search Console, Semrush, Screaming Frog - get a dashboard that shows AI Overview wins, SERP features, and Core Web Vitals in one place.
* Plug your changelog right into your analytics. No more guessing what worked, see the bump, celebrate, repeat.
* If you’re not watching entity and schema tracking, you’re half-blind in a gunfight.

# Know What Success Looks Like - Or You’ll Miss It

* Are you winning new featured snippets or AI Overview spots? Shout about it.
* Are users sticking around, or bouncing like you charged them admission?
* Has your authority shot up - backlinks, brand mentions, Knowledge Graph nods? Or are you still stuck in the “who?” crowd?

# Don’t Get Lazy - Iterate or Die

This isn’t a “set and forget” game.

* Block out time every quarter - re-run your audits, check for new AI features, and don’t get caught napping by another Core Update.
* Keep your update checklist sharp. Docs, workflows, and processes are living things, treat them like it.
* The minute you stop iterating, someone else takes your spot. Simple.

# When Things Go Sideways

Not seeing results? Don’t moan - diagnose.

* Lost a feature or dropped in rankings? Check your schema, look for technical screw-ups, see if Google moved the goalposts again.
* Be ready to jump - response checklists for new updates aren’t a “nice to have,” they’re the difference between survival and obscurity.
* Make “adapt or die” your team motto. 

Your job isn’t finished when you hit publish. Measure. Improve. Repeat. Or get left behind, again. Be the site everyone else checks to see “what’s working” - not the cautionary tale at the next SEO meetup.",1,1752134141.0,SEMrush,0,1.0,False
1lw6zw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lw6zw5/long_story_need_insight_met_while_traveling_in/,"Long story, need insight. Met while traveling in Asia","I am in a foreign country, got no friends and got broken up with late may, I work remotely as well so I don't meet people at all

I had what I thought was a wonderful relationship with a girl I met while solo travelling in Asia beginning of last year, we met and travelled for about a month, we were almost like a couple instantly, holding hands, she even took care of me while I was sick, towards the end of the month she said out of nowhere that she wasn't looking for a relationship.

Fast forward another month and I went to her country from mine to visit,(only one hour with flight) we also kept in contact daily by text and video, it was wonderful and we did so much, travelled throughout her country and visited so many places.

Then she visited my country and we travelled for almost two weeks, roadtrip, during this time she was also so loving and caring and we really were like a couple.

During the beginning of the summer, I was visiting her again and then she mentioned that she was starting to get feelings for me, and that after I went home she wanted no contact, I was of course sad but accepted it, when I went home it went a few days and she started talking to me again like nothing happened.

Fast forward to July 2024, middle July.

I visited her again for a few weeks, and then I had a conversation with her where I explained that if we were to keep going forward with each other I wanted a relationship, otherwise I saw no point in all this. She said no but the next day she changed her mind and we became official

A month later we travelled to a festival in my country and we both got drunk, she randomly said she wanted an open relationship, I of course said no and said that its nothing I would accept and that she's free to leave at anytime if she wants that.
She didn't leave.

I moved to her country at this point and in November of 2024 we moved into an apartment of our own, and I started getting depressed, i really had no friends in this country and i as I worked remotely it was hard for me to find ones, i also believe everything i mentioned above also played a role somehow, but at that point I didn't see any of that.

I noticed that she also became more distant at some points, she brought up things like I was messy in the apartment or that I was drinking beer sometimes, the beer drinking and messyness was not at all big things, i even cleaned more than her after she told me all this, and I was drinking 1-2 beers in the weekend alone to just relax sometimes.

We travelled abroad in 2025 January for two months to the same place we met each other, and after a few weeks one evening she suddenly told me that she wanted us to travel alone for two weeks, that she needed space. I got upset and asked if she wanted to break up, she broke down and said yes.
I then packed my things and left for an hour and came back. She was totally destroyed when I found her in the bed and i comforted her and held her while talking through our problems, she brought up the same issues like before. But we decided to keep going.

After this day she became depressed and started having symptoms of throwing up each day, she didn't throw up but her body made her do this gag-reflex everyday. I tried to support her as best as I could in this.

Fast forward to end of april, we were then back in our county and our apartment and she then told me that she's going abroad to her best friend and that it's not working anymore. Blaming the same things, I want to mention this is things I didn't even do anymore at this point. 

We still had the lease for the apartment for 3 more months so we decided to live together, she came back after 5 days and was a bit cold, but she then started warming up and we did so much things together and talked through everything, we wanted this still, she mentioned couples therapy and i accepted happily. 

Fast forward end of may, she broke up again and told me she didn't want to see me anymore, the next day was going to her friend again to stay there until I had moved out.

The next day was very weird, she was acting very cold but during the evening when she was going to go to her bus she started warming up and just sat at the couch and was staring into my eyes, she asked for a ride to the bus and when we parted she kissed me and hugged me for many minutes.

At this point I moved out to another apartment.

I contacted her a few days later and we talked for a bit by texting, she then said she wanted no contact and didn't want to keep texting me, which I of course accepted.

A few days later she contacted me because of a bill which had already been paid, which was obvious.

Then she texted me happy birthday a few days later.

We then had no contact fully for 10 days but she was still watching my story on Instagram during this time, and she had unfollowed me, I felt I was getting breadcrumbs.

During the end of June this year, so 10 days of no contact she sent me a message regarding practical things for our old apartment, these are then things that we already had solved together a month earlier. She knew I had said she can take/sell/throw away everything that was still there. But I mentioned a chair to her at this point as I was still very much and I still am, in love with her.

We met up a week later for her to give me the chair and she was a bit flirty with me, I had given her a book about attachment styles earlier and she had thanked me for it and said she was mostly secure, i had no comment really.

I texted her the same day asking for a coffee and she was hesitant and asked why? I then told her to call me later and we had a talk.

I explained everything I had learned during this time and we went through our relationship, she didn't want to see her own faults in this and put the blame mostly on me, she said she had no trust due to inconsistency from my side and that she would never be able to trust me again, that it was 0 chance  to get back together, she also told me that she'd block me if I kept texting her.

I still texted her the next day because I still wanted clarity in why she kept me on all social media, she of course didn't block me but lashed out, said I was gaslighting her, and that I was cruel and disrespectful, I only wanted clarity, because it felt I was getting mixed signals, I told her this but she was still defensive, I then asked her to tell me that she didn't love me anymore, I wanted her to say it so I would be able to move on easier, but she said she couldn't say it.

I've been in no contact since then. This post is very long but I made it for myself to vent and also get more clarity in all this, and I also would love any comments on all this to get a different perspective as well.

Some more information: We're in our late 20's 
It was my 5th relationship, and I was her 2nd relationship, she had been in one for 4,5 years 3-4 years back.


I also want to mention that I brought up all the big issues, so I could also see it more clearly, and that throughout the relationship she was the perfect girlfriend except for these things, very loving, caring, showering me with small gifts, very intimate as well and supportive to me. 
We travelled a lot together and went on tons of dates, the spark was there pretty much the whole time for both of us.

1lw6wcc,https://v.redd.it/ihy3pbk150cf1,Found this dusty old blues record in my step dad's basement,"Lyrics:   

Got up early this moanin'    
bird lookin for a worm   

Walked down to Speedy's    
Made every woman's head turn   

I put my money on the counter   
So I could buy my swigs   
That's Two hot large columbians    

I was thinkin bout my future    
reminiscing bout the past    
Prayin the lord to help me get more cash   

On my way out tha door I saw a real nice rig    
Like the one my daddy had when I was a kid    

I seen a couple workers doin what they do   
I said yes sir I is a worker too   

Got a crown on my head and cleats on my feet   
Ain't got a dollar to my name    
walkin' down the middle of the street   

When I got home could not believe what I seen    
A tiny man named Harold Gee trying to step to me      

I said, ""you talk a big game for such a little man""    
He told me ""if you keep talkin you can catch these hands""    

I stood my ground that's what a real man do   
Said ""Alright partner, you make the first move""    

In seconds flat he had the wall to my back    
For 7 long days he been plotting his attack   

Wrapped his baby hands around my neck    
Tried to choke me out but here's what happened next    

I look to my left and I looked to my right   
I could not find a weapon in sight    

He squeezed and squeezed and it got hard to breathe    
I had to get this motha sucka off of me   

I gave him one hard push across the place   
Then I grabbed a hot coffee and splashed it in his face    

I could hear the sizzle and his skin turned red   
He let out a scream when I broke the mug on his head    

He hit the floor    
as I ran I  for the door   
my Momma said son don't you come round here no more   

I heard the sirens in the distance so I made my escape   
I knew the jail house would soon be my fate   

Hid out in the country till the heat died down   
Had no where to go   
I turned round  and marched my ass right back to town   

So listen here brothers and heed my tale   
When you out wear your welcome ya gotta hit the dusty trail    
Even if Intimidation and jealousy follow you 'round        
Take some ladies man advice and always stand your ground

1lw6vr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lw6vr0/the_gender_gap_is_really_starting_to_worry_me/,"The gender gap is really starting to worry me, especially as it pertains to Christianity.","I want to preface by stating that I am saying all of this as a woman and a feminist. I have my own gripes and complaints against men, but I’ll do my best to not let my emotions get the best of me, and to lay all of this out in a respectful manner.

As much as we all want to separate politics from every other aspect of life or as it were “not be political” in 2025 America there isn’t really a way to do that. Increasingly people are pressured to “pick a side”. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. Truly, some of the things currently happening are so egregious that to not stand up and say something against them, is in fact saying something in favor of them. The age of fence sitting appears long gone from real possibilities, and in many instances it should be.

With all of that in mind, here are my current thoughts: Women and men (as demographic groups, not necessarily all individuals at ground level) are not getting along or seeing eye to eye right now. And that gap seems increasingly wide as it pertains to Christianity specifically and the church. Many women taking part in the American version of the 4B movement are Christians, and not all of them progressive. I personally know women who have only ever been republicans who themselves have sworn off men, relationships and marriage at least for the time being if not for longer. Vowing not to have kids with or even date a man, and bisexual women choosing to strictly pursue women and not even give men a glance.

The issues of reproductive freedom and healthcare, gender roles as assumed by conservative thought and philosophy, and people completely misusing Bible verses like ones that say women aren’t supposed to be preachers, and saying we’re supposed to sit down and shut up and obey our men. Women are getting tired of all of it and not all of the ones who are are democrats. The truth is, we aren’t upset because most men don’t know what it’s like to be a woman. We’re upset because most men don’t know what it’s like to be a woman and also can’t be bothered to care. When we try to tell men what it’s like to walk in our shoes we get looked at with a shrug as if the respondent is saying “ok and? What’s that got to do with me?”.

The truth is there is no individuality in this issue. If you talk about sexual harassment you get “not all men” but if you say that in response to a guy who is good to his wife you are met with hostility. We all remember the bear experiment. Where women were asked if they’d rather be alone in the forest with a man they didn’t know or with a bear, and we overwhelmingly chose the bear. Then as if to prove our point a bunch of men got mad, were cussing us out in comments, saying they hope we do go camping with a bear and that it eats us and we learn our lesson. The irony in the fact that they were proving our own point for us was and is completely lost on them.

And that’s not all, they posed the same question to fathers of girls. They asked a whole bunch of dads if they’d feel better with their daughter alone in the forest with a bear, or with a man she or he didn’t know. Even this group, comprised entirely of men ALSO chose the bear. So they DO get it. All men reading this you DO get it. You only pretend not to when it’s us saying it. How many times have we heard a dad say “I’m protective of my daughter because I know how men are”. But when a woman who he doesn’t know says it we’re just overreacting and being hysterical, or should pick better men or whatever. There is zero empathy.

Likewise there isn’t any empathy a lot of the time from women either. I’m not too proud to admit I’ve contributed to it. If a man gets cheated on, I’m automatically assuming things about him, giving the woman a perceived pass even though I don’t know her or her boyfriend/husband. Judging him based on her actions before details come out, and men do the same thing to us.

We see in comments about equal rights, the jokes about “equal rights and lefts” and “does this mean we can hit women now?”. It’s passed off as “comedy”, but I think it reveals a lot about these men’s character. We’re seeing a lot now about what conservatism truly is. When they kept a brain dead woman on life support in order to gestate her fetus inside her corpse long enough for it to maybe survive. Against the wishes of her family and against the advice of doctors. When the baby was born prematurely and only at barely over a pound, news stories were triumphant. Saying she gave birth or “delivered a baby”. And us women are tired of the sane washing. Neither of those are what happened. They extracted a baby from the corpse of a woman who had been dead for months but kept barely “alive” enough by machines because it couldn’t survive a minute longer inside her decaying body.

Women in Texas and Louisiana have died from miscarriages because they couldn’t get post care because of abortion bans. And all of this, and we still can’t get mandatory maternity leave in most states laws.

Women are tired of being viewed as property and being treated like trash, especially by men who claim to love worship and follow Jesus. There was a woman who was raped and she managed somehow to record it without the guy knowing. At trial the recording was presented as evidence. Not only was the man acquitted but now she is charged with unlawful recording and on trial herself. A similar case happened a few years ago in which a woman was raped by a marine at a party, and the only charges were against a peeping tom who had recorded the incident. In South Carolina, a man who’s wife had consented initially to having sex with him but then begged him to stop because it was hurting her, at his own trial he claimed he couldn’t stop because he was already “all worked up, and it’s impossible for a man to shut that down once it’s that high” and was found not guilty.

These men aren’t atheists. A lot of them are Christians, and a lot of the men making excuses for them are also Christians. The only way we can ever get men to care about us is by pointing out that the woman is someone’s daughter, sister, or wife. Before that though she’s a person, a human being. But far too many men don’t care about that. They can only start caring when it’s revealed to them how much one of their fellow men might be being hurt by her pain. Her own pain just on its own isn’t enough to win their empathy and care.

And yes, that has caused a rebound effect, and now men are largely viewed with disdain by women. We don’t want to talk to you, hang out with you or be your friend. We certainly don’t want to date you or have kids with you. I can’t even get pregnant myself but I’m still very careful and selective, and because of that I’m single right now. Which gets me made fun of by men, a 35 year old single childless woman, so I must be crazy and unloveable.

Again the people saying these things a lot of the times are Christians, and a not insignificant number of them are leaders in their churches. I am going to close by giving you a small insight into my daily life as a woman. The men in the comments will shout me down and give me many variations of “not all men” and “you’re just being paranoid” and the women will agree with me. And the men will keep saying that no matter how much I and every other woman tell them they’re wrong. These are things I do every single day or every single situation as a woman, that most men have never even had to think about:

- When I get an Uber, I’m uneasy about riding with a male driver. I won’t cancel because I don’t usually have time, but it does worry me until I’m out of their car again. I love Lyft’s “women connect+” feature, which purports to match women and nonbinary riders with women and nonbinary drivers, but that isn’t always guaranteed.

- When I go literally anywhere, I have an escape plan. Where is the nearest exit, where is a nearby staff member I can flag down if I need to. I also never leave my drink unattended at a bar, even for 5 seconds. If I turn around to chat with a friend I’m conscious enough to pick it up so it’s in my hand when I turn. My eyes are never off of it. 

- Many places have codes, for example a bar will have special “drinks” a woman can “order” that all mean different things. One drink might mean a guy won’t leave you alone and you need a bouncer. Another drink might mean you need the bartender to call law enforcement because the situation has gotten entirely out of hand. Women have gone to the restroom and left a note, saying what she and the guy she’s with look like, and asking the finder of the note to call the police because she’s being beaten at home and is too damn scared to report it any other way.

- If a man in public asks me out or for my number, I have to think of a reason why I can’t. Am I a lesbian today? Do I have a boyfriend already? Am I late for work? I can’t just give him a flat no, because a woman who did that on a train in Dallas he came back and stabbed her over 20 times, and a train full of bystanders did absolutely nothing except stand there and record it on their phones. She later died from her injuries and wounds. We all joke about “the rejection hotline” but there’s a reason that was created, and that reason is far from comical.

- On a date, especially a first date with a new man at least 3 different friends know exactly where and when the date is happening, and at least one of them has my live location share. That friend also has a photo of the guy and if I can get one, his license plate. She usually is also on standby not far away in case anything happens.

- I have pepper spray on my keys. I couldn’t forget it if I wanted to. I never go anywhere without it or my phone. It’s a joke that I’m “addicted to my phone” and maybe I am, but in these times it’s more in case I need it to call someone.

- Even on dating apps I have to be careful, because men have found me on Facebook and real life from there, and my profile isn’t even that extensive. A Korean woman was murdered by a man who found her by a reflection in you think I’m gonna say sunglasses? Try her freaking iris. He saw a reflection of the sign of a coffee shop she liked to frequent. From there he sat in the parking lot waiting for her to show, and then just stalked her for awhile, learning her routines. One day she went to that coffee shop again and then was never heard from again.

When we tell these sorts of horror stories and then men say “not all men” it is extremely dismissive. Yes, we obviously know not all men are bad, but we can’t tell which ones are just by looking. So we have to be protective and on guard with all of them. Because that’s better than the alternative. There isn’t a single woman reading this who hasn’t thought about an escape plan if a date goes south, and there isn’t a single man reading this who even if not now, at one point wouldn’t have been offended if she told him that, because “why would you think I’d do that?”.  It’s not always the obviously creepy ones that are an actual danger, in fact it’s almost never them. It’s the well groomed charmers, the ones who seemingly have their act together, the one who has friends and a family and a life.

And there are many more than those bullet points above. But this was this way even before our current political situation. This has just exacerbated it and made it worse. And right now, I don’t see any way it gets better. Because the only way it will is for men to do what Jesus would have done and meet women where we’re at and listen to us. Instead we get dismissive comments about how we’re overreacting and being mean to men, because even now men’s feelings are leaps and bounds more important than women’s safety. And frankly, we’re just sick of it.

I don’t hate men. I have many male relatives and friends in my life who I love and who I know for a fact love me. But even they have the dismissiveness I described, the accusations of paranoia I listed. If even men who already know and love us don’t get it, what hope then do strangers have?

That’s the only way it will get better, but it won’t. Because instead of finally doing some soul searching and self reflection, men will again put the onus and burden on women, call us selfish and stuck up, hysterical and crazy etc, or jokes about how we “have too much estrogen”.

If you are a man reading this, and the women in your life have never opened up to you about any of this or confided in you, I think that tells you some things about yourself you may need to work on. The worst thing you can do is gaslight the women you know and treat them like it’s their fault for not feeling safe enough to tell you these things, and that’s exactly what most of you will do.

I wish for nothing more than for this gap to vanish, but this time it’s gonna have to be on men. Women are tired of always being the ones to sacrifice and pretend like nothing is wrong when everything is. Yes, I am in fact someone’s daughter and someone else’s sister, but you shouldn’t need to look at me through that lens for me and my life and safety to matter. Before any of that I’m a human being, so try looking at us as that.",0,1752133659.0,Christianity,2,0.5,False
1lw6vg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1lw6vg3/i_think_im_going_to_lose_my_job_because_of_my/,I think I’m going to lose my job because of my disabilities,"I’m 19, and have fibro and HSD. Ive been working part time (mon-thurs) as a solderer since september, and i still live at home. I walk with a cane and have explained to everyone at work and home whats going on.

My boss (who is also my grandpas acquaintance and thats how i got the job) knows about my disability and what ive been going through. (Though hes a bit weird about it, i will explain more) 

Initially i just had days off when i had doctors appointments and really bad days, but then my doctor put me on SSRIs (first fluoxetine then sertraline) and i had a horrible reaction both times (convulsing and spasming, one time it happened at work and my mum had to come pick me up). Since ive been much worse, finding it harder to walk, and my contraceptive hasn’t been working so I’m back on that time of the month (debilitating pain, nausea, su!c!dality, its really horrible) and now I’m having more time off than I’m actually in work, ive used up all my sick pay, and I’m scared I’m going to lose my job because of this.

I’m on 50p above minimum wage (UK), and i barely make enough to cover food and my car and rent when I’m in full time, without this job I’m going to lose my car and be unable to eat properly (mothers funny about it, she also believes since i pay my rent to my dad, i dont pay any rent at all. She doesnt work and she only pays for food shopping once a week which is mostly for her and some main meals for me and my siblings)

I’m so scared that i’ll just get worse and worse as i have been for the past year and a bit, and i’ll lose my ability to walk and work and drive, and i will end up with nothing. Ive applied for so many jobs before i got worse, and none would even interview me. 

My boss however has made some really strange remarks about my disability, including “why dont you cut off your legs since theyre not helping you anyway” (completely seriously) and “someone I’m related to had a mysterious illness and they solved it by pulling some teeth out, you should go to the dentist and have some teeth pulled out”. He doesnt pay me enough to afford the dentist, nor do i want to have my teeth taken out?!! He witnessed my convulsing spasming episode at work and when i was well enough to come in again, he asked me to work that friday to make up for it, despite me having told him i cant work all the time or ill be too exhausted to work at all, and that that would tip me over the edge. 

It is also not the safest work environment, my co worker had to fight to get any sort of extractor fans for the fumes (we do not have good ones but at least we have them), one of the machines broke, and tipped my boards into the molten metal, which made some of the components explode, giving me a minor burn from where the molten metal landed on me. The lid was only up for this to happen because the machine hadnt been properly calibrated so we had to watch for overflowing. This was only fixed after i got hurt. They dont provide any sort of personal protection (ie gloves or goggles for when the solder spits, if i didnt wear glasses, i would have got some in my eye by now), and my co workers had to help negotiate with my boss for him to not try and make me work upstairs (i cant do stairs without great pain and fatigue and he knows this). My work bench has a shelf under it at exactly my knee height so i cannot sit properly close to my desk, and so i have to lean at a funny angle to even see my work.

The only good thing about my job is my co workers, and the only “perk” is free tea and coffee, not even on site parking.

Initially i started the job under verbal agreement that it would be casual, working when i could, and when he gave me a contract after the probation period was over, i had to ask for him to reduce the hours on it or i wouldnt sign it, because i couldnt possibly work that many hours. I get one half an hour unpaid lunch break for the seven hours i work.

I know its time for me to start looking for jobs i can work from home part time/full time or ones where I’m in an office environment, but if i couldnt find any when i was looking, and with agencies, what hope do i have now that i can barely go into the job that i do have? /rh

Is there a job agency in the uk that specifically helps disabled people find jobs?
And is there any way to get financial help regarding my inability to work full time?

I know if i lose my job and thus my car, itll make my mental health much worse (i dont have diagnosed depression, but when i was on the antidepressants i felt emotionally better than i ever have), and i cant be stuck in this house. The only qualifications i have are GCSEs (nothing below a six) and DDB in a level french, computer science, and business, and i will not go to uni.

They pretty much spent the weekend together, she swapped numbers with him and added him as a friend on facebook and agreed to meet up back in the UK for a 'playdate' with the kids.

She didn't tell me any of this.

I discovered it when she spent an evening in bed messaging someone on her phone, so I looked at her phone the next evening when she was asleep and found a single message from the guy saying ""so how's your week been then back at work? Do you and daughter want to meet up next weekend for a coffee?

He'd sent this friday at 6pm and I found it saturday night and she hadn't replied.

I checked her facebook and she'd searched his profile over 20 times since adding him as a friend a few weeks before.

I confronted her when she was at work 48hrs later via whatsapp and asked her who he was. She said it was the Dad from Paris (as if I'd actually know!!). She said she took his number to arrange to meet up with daughters but there had been no messages between them because they turned up where they'd arranged to meet. I said if there were no messages, send me a whatsapp screenshot. She sent me a blank whatsapp, as she clearly didn't know I'd seen the message from him which she'd now deleted.

Once I told her I'd seen the message, I said I was going to speak to him. She said ""he took some photos of daughter and vice versa...had no intention of meeting him and only deleted messages because I didn't want you to think there was anything more...i know I shouldn't have""

However, in her google photos (yeah, I'm scum for searching her phone again but felt justified) there was a video off his daughter replying to my daughter saying ""I miss you too and yes I would like to meet for a play date"" so there was obviously an intention for them to meet up.

The guy's name was Thomas - and the final straw for me was she'd been for drinks with her best friend and the next day her friend messaged ""have you watched Thomas the tank today?!""

my wife replied with three laughing emojis and her friend replied ""I love how you could translate!"" with laughing emojis. I only found this message weeks after I began to believe her story that it was innocent.

My wife's explanation for this was she told her friend about Thomas, but just saying he was a sleazey dad and was creepy so that's why her friend wrote that message. I think personally she was telling her about a guy she'd been flirting with.... if he was really a sleaze then why add him on FB, give him your number etc?

When I first found out about this I went on a drinking binge and kicked off - obviously not physically as I've never hit a woman but my wife left the house with our daughter to stay with her sister and phoned my family to go and get me. The family believe I now have a serious drink issue and that I was paranoid and made the whole thing up in my head - I haven't told them any of the details, other that I thought she was cheating.

Can someone read this statement and give me their thoughts please?

For the record, I don't think she'd cheated, but in my opinion I caught an affair before it started.

I can actually forgive infidelity but not the fact that she still won't admit there was anything going on and the fact that I have some mental health issues lately and she's caused me to almost think of doing something crazy because I thought I was going mad.",3,1752133502.0,relationship_advice,5,0.8,False

I just wrapped up a short monsoon trip through India and wanted to share a few underrated places that look absolutely magical during this season (June–September). If you're someone who doesn’t mind a little rain and wants to see nature in full bloom, this is *the* time to explore!

# 1. Mawsynram & Cherrapunji, Meghalaya

Yes, it's the wettest place on Earth — but it’s also home to living root bridges, surreal misty landscapes, and thundering waterfalls like Nohkalikai. Tip: Go with locals or guides, trails can be slippery.

# 2. Tamhini Ghat, Maharashtra

Perfect for a weekend escape from Pune/Mumbai. Scenic drives, lush greenery, and lesser-known waterfalls like Devkund make this a great monsoon hotspot.

# 3. Coorg, Karnataka

Monsoon transforms this coffee region into a rainforest-like retreat. Fewer tourists, amazing homestays, and the smell of wet coffee plantations = heaven.

# 4. Agumbe, Karnataka

They call it the **Cherrapunji of the South**. If you’re a nature/wildlife enthusiast (especially reptiles), this is the land of King Cobras and insane biodiversity. Don’t forget your leech socks! 

# 5. Valparai, Tamil Nadu

Nestled in the Anamalai hills, Valparai is peaceful and uncrowded — tea estates, misty hills, and plenty of wildlife. Ideal if you’re looking to disconnect.

**Why travel India in the monsoon?**

* Everything is cheaper
* No crowds
* You see a greener, moodier, quieter India most don’t!

**Quick Tips:**

* Carry quick-dry clothes & waterproof gear.
* Be flexible! Weather can delay transport.
* Avoid trekking in areas with landslide warnings.

I’m posting on behalf of a younger writer friend (they’re a minor and not on Reddit yet), who created a deeply emotional and stylized BSD-inspired OC.

Red decorated restaurant, more retro style. No one's been here. I was sitting on the edge of the room with a perfect view when suddenly someone walked in.

He was a young, tall, slender boy who repressed something I could feel inside him and didn't have to look back. With my luck, he sat down an aisle over.

""Everyone who walks in here has a problem, Ethan. Some get resolved and others are left hanging in the air until someone gets it right.""

He looked at me with an annoyed look, and the conversation began. 

""How do you know me? I've never seen you, and just out of curiosity, I have no problem!""

Throughout the debate then and in the future, I kept a dark face that did not catch his eye.

""Of course you do, everyone does and has. It has to be handled, Ethan. I wouldn't want me to start talking about you instead of the man I'm telling about.""

“What story?” He said with a curious tone.

""You know how many people come here. People of any background, style, or religion? Young people come here for fun, to enjoy life. But I once met a guy who shunned everyone. He wasn't like the others; he ended up the worst of all people.""

“Wait, you're comparing me to someone who died?” He said with more indignation than I thought.

""I didn't say it would be you, Ethan. But a human doesn't realize when one is nearing one's end until it's too late, whether it's death or losing oneself.""

I finished, and he began to change. I sat, not speaking for a while. He kept looking at me, and I knew I had guessed him right.

He looked around and asked again, “Why was that man avoiding everyone?”

I smiled a little and started with a story you don't know yet.

""Ethan, I once knew a man who was different, but the one thing he had in common with us, he had emotions. He was vulnerable and curious.""

Without fully realizing it, he sat down across from me.

""There was a beautiful house next to this restaurant - a larger, white-coloured house with a family that was not the one presented. It had no garden, only woods behind and meadows around, where the sun's rays rarely reached. You can see the path, but I don't know where you would go.""

I digressed for a moment.

""The weather hasn't changed; it was just like it was then. The dark clouds, the sounds of the storm, and the rain, which was just as heavy and resounding as the day it all ended.""

""Would you like a refill?"" A kind, young, shy waitress asked.

Ethan looked up quickly and said, ""Yes, please,"" he replied, and poured us an equal volume of coffee to the edge. She left, and he waited tensely.

""The end is near, Ethan. At midnight, a man named Evan walked into a house that had gone from a beautiful, surrounded place (no one knows how) to a wooden, outdated, run-down, uninhabitable, and in some way interesting.

He walked in to the sound of a creaking door in the background. To the right, a faded blue kitchen where cabinets hung, food was strewn on an island, and a space where a refrigerator stood. Leftward, the living room, two dirty beige sofas that no one ever sat on. An empty hallway with scattered drawers and stairs.

It's thundering.

He was coming upstairs. Where the space wasn't covered by a roof. Cold, wet, and speechless. He stood on the edge of the last step when it thundered again. The wind picked up with a group of people breaking through the door.

""Evan! Say something! What's wrong?"" They called out to him. Evan turned, and at that exact moment, the loudest, longest lightning bolt of thunder irradiated him. The question is, why didn't he say anything? He needed help; he could have said something, or everyone thought he could.

Evan stood there with a frightened look in his eyes. He looked up again. One last glimpse of something bright, of what he loved and where he wanted to go. The house shook. Another hour passed. Another resounding thunder accompanied the flash. It was quick, so unexpected. The ground shook again, but so that no one could utter a word, make a move, anything. It continued until suddenly.

He fell.

There were pieces of wood where the stairs stood, and a body buried there. A body that no one had pulled out. He would have killed himself, Ethan. It was a tragedy, but there would be a different one, the one he wanted, the one he planned.""

I finished and showed him my face for the first time. A face of fear, anger, loneliness, and seriousness.

""It's important to say things Ethan and admit there's a problem.""

He looked out the window. Rays of light emerged from the clouds, illuminating Ethan. He looked puzzled, but when he looked into the sun, I felt the peace he needed. He said nothing, getting up from the couch. He was turning towards the door when I managed to say, ""Nice to meet you, Ethan,"" with a small smile on my face.

The cups were empty.

""Would you like a refill on your coffee?""

""Yes, thank you. Would you bring me a new one just as full? In case anyone comes over.""

""Sure,"" she replied and left.

I sit here all the time. I have things in me that people don't want. They give me emotions. I'm glad I have them because I can recognize problems they may not be aware of.

## What is Lunoro Chain?

Lunoro Chain is an **automated crypto trading platform** that helps users analyze market trends in real-time and place trades more effectively. It’s like having a smart assistant that watches the market 24/7, crunches data, and helps you decide when to buy or sell. 

What makes Lunoro Chain different is its use of **AI-powered algorithms** that reportedly learn from previous trades and market behavior. This means it doesn't just follow charts blindly—it adapts. Whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets, Lunoro Chain aims to optimize your trades without requiring you to sit in front of your screen all day.

## Who Created Lunoro Chain?

There isn’t a ton of official information about the exact people behind Lunoro Chain, which is pretty common in platforms like these. But from what I’ve gathered, it's developed by a group of **fintech experts and crypto enthusiasts** with experience in building automated trading systems.

The platform seems to follow a similar model to others like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, which also use AI to power their trading features. While the lack of a transparent founder may raise eyebrows, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s shady—it just means you should approach it with the same caution as any other crypto platform.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:
- You deposit funds into your account.
- The platform uses your balance to place trades based on its algorithm’s predictions.
- You can choose **manual or automated trading** depending on how hands-on you want to be.

The cool part? You don’t need to be a crypto expert to use it. The automation handles most of the heavy lifting while still giving you control when you want it.

If you're unsure whether it’s available where you are, you can check during the sign-up process. It’ll let you know pretty quickly.

## Lunoro Chain – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Lunoro Chain really shines. Its **AI engine analyzes live market data** to spot trends and predict price movements. Think of it as having a financial analyst who never sleeps—constantly scanning for the best opportunities.

The system learns and updates itself regularly, which means it doesn’t rely on outdated data or static signals. Super useful if you want to stay ahead of the curve.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never touched a trading platform before, you’ll find Lunoro Chain **ridiculously easy to use**. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t bombard you with technical jargon.

It’s perfect for people (like me) who don’t want to be glued to a computer all day.

### Customizable Alerts

### Multiple Asset Trading

This isn’t just a Bitcoin-only deal. Lunoro Chain supports a variety of assets, including:
- **Ethereum**
- **Litecoin**
- **Ripple**
- **Bitcoin Cash**
- And more

It’s great if you want to diversify your strategy beyond just BTC.

## Is Lunoro Chain a Scam?

This is the million-dollar question. Based on my experience and research, **Lunoro Chain does not appear to be a scam**. It offers real trading tools, has a responsive support team, and processes withdrawals.

That said, it's still a relatively new platform. So while there’s **no major red flag**, it’s smart to:
- Start small
- Use the demo account
- Keep your expectations realistic

Crypto trading is risky no matter what platform you use, so always do your own due diligence.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Lunoro Chain?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is fairly standard for platforms in this category. This deposit acts as your initial trading capital—it’s not a fee, and you can start trading with it immediately.

It might seem like a lot if you're just testing the waters, but the demo account lets you practice first, which helps build confidence.

### Lunoro Chain Customer Support

Customer support on Lunoro Chain is surprisingly good. You can reach them via:
- **Live Chat (24/7)**
- **Email Support**

They’re responsive and knowledgeable, and I didn’t have to wait more than a few minutes to get help. That’s a big plus in my book.

I’m posting on behalf of a younger writer friend (they’re a minor and not on Reddit yet), who created a deeply emotional and stylized BSD-inspired OC. They can’t draw and they can’t pay, but they’d be so grateful if anyone would be willing to bring their OC, Kozuki, to life!

—

🧷 About the OC:
• Name: Kozuki (小月) – “Little Moon”
• Pronouns: she/they/he (genderfluid)
• Age: Ambiguous (\~15), can be drawn older if needed
• Affiliation: Port Mafia
• Vibe: Cheerful and giddy like Kenji, intense like Chuuya, brooding like Akutagawa. Comic relief… who *isn’t* comic relief.

—

🎨 Appearance:
• Black skin with uneven pigmentation (not vitiligo), with freckles
• Puffy cheeks, round face, cloudy cyan-blue eyes (look like sky behind fog), tired or annoyed doll-like expression
• Fluffy light blue hair (dyed), white bangs, two long strands to shoulders, rest cut under ears
• Sabito-style cheek scar (left side); possible self-harm scars on hands/legs

—

👕 Outfit (Layered Y2K / Glorp-inspired):
• Glorp cat hoodie with scarf/turtleneck style collar, tons of keychains
• Y2K-style “glorycore” pants with a skirt over top, fluffy legwarmers, chunky shoes
• Oversized keychain-covered backpack (could contain plushies, coffee, or knives), plus gloves

—

💥 Ability: *Embody* (also called “Proxy”)
• Kozuki channels a warped, emotional version of someone else’s ability
• Not copying — they convince the ability that its original user is in danger
• Drawbacks: temporary blindness (fogged eyes), insomnia, emotional residue
• Can activate remotely through emotional attunement
• Refuses to use some abilities (like Chuuya or Yosano’s) out of guilt

—

🧠 Personality:
• Joyful and bouncy, but deeply traumatized
• Learned to smile through punishment; often smiles at pain or abuse
• Grew up in a cyberpunk mountain city, moved to Yokohama for “chaos”
• Autistic, reactive, misunderstood; most animals are afraid of them

—

💬 Art Request:
• PFP/bust (priority!)
• Optional: meme/chibi style (“POV: You’re the comic relief friend”), or full-body sheet
• Any art style welcome (anime, sketchy, chibi, etc.)
• The OC belongs to the writer, not me. Artist will be fully credited, and you’re free to post your work as long as you don’t claim the OC.

Thanks so much for considering helping bring Kozuki to life!

If you've only got one day on this stunning Hawaiian island, you need to make it count. After experiencing it firsthand, I can tell you the best way to see the most breathtaking spots in just 24 hours.

Start your morning early at Poipu Beach. The sunrise here is unreal, and you might spot some sea turtles coming up to bask in the early morning sun. Grab breakfast at Little Fish Coffee - their acai bowls are perfect fuel for the day ahead.

But here's the real game-changer: book a helicopter tour. I cannot stress enough how this completely transformed my Kauai experience. After trying several activities, the helicopter tour I took with Blue Hawaiian was hands-down the most memorable part of my trip (you can check availability and book here: https://athometouch.com/Kauai).

In just 50 minutes, you'll see more of Kauai than you could in a week of driving. The Na Pali Coast's massive cliffs, Waimea Canyon's red rock formations, and countless waterfalls that aren't accessible by land - it's mind-blowing. My pilot even took us past the famous Manawaiopuna Falls from Jurassic Park!

After the helicopter tour, head to Waimea Canyon lookout point. The afternoon light makes the colors pop, and you'll appreciate it even more after seeing it from above. 

End your day in Hanalei Bay. The sunset here is spectacular, and there are several great restaurants nearby. I recommend Bar Acuda for dinner - their Hawaiian-inspired tapas are the perfect way to end your day.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Book the helicopter tour in advance - they fill up quickly
- Bring a light rain jacket (Kauai's weather can change quickly)
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Keep your camera ready

If you're worried about motion sickness on the helicopter tour, don't be. The Eco-Star helicopters they use are incredibly stable, and the pilots are experts at providing a smooth ride. It's worth every penny for the views you'll get.

I've tried various activities on different Hawaiian islands, but this combination, especially the helicopter tour, gave me the most complete Kauai experience possible in one day. The aerial views of the Na Pali Coast alone were worth the trip.

Remember, while one day isn't long enough to see everything Kauai has to offer, this itinerary helps you experience the island's highlights in the most efficient way possible. The helicopter tour is really the key to making the most of limited time - it's an investment you won't regret.",1,1752132577.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I wonder if it’s my mindset—like I’ve gone so long without real close friends that I assume I don’t have any, and that affects how I show up.

I’m working with omni/light roasted coffees, and I keep facing the same issue across several origins and roasters: espresso tastes clean, sometimes bright, but completely lacks body — watery and thin. Even if the acidity is nice, the texture is just not there.

Here’s what I’ve already ruled out:
	•	Even puck prep (WDT + Normcore distributor/tamper combo)
	•	No visible signs of channeling
	•	I using a washed Nicaragua (variety Pacamara)
Ratio: 18g in / 36g out, 28–30 sec
	•	Brew temp: 93.4 C
	•	Pressure tested both 9.0 bar and 8.5 bar — slightly better at 8.5-8.8

The pucks look fine post-shot (no major cracks or uneven saturation), and extraction seems consistent. Still, the cup lacks texture and mouthfeel.

My theory is: these roasts are underdeveloped (too fast or too short development time), so not enough caramelization and solubles to provide body. But I’d love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences:
	•	Do omni/light roasts inherently struggle to deliver body in espresso?
	•	Can pressure profiling or lower flow rate help in this case?
	•	What are your go-to techniques for coaxing more body out of light roasts?

Would really appreciate insights — especially from folks working with lever machines, Decent, or Slayer-style profiles.

Thanks in advance! 🙏

That I have to maintain overall care of myself or I could just go bam L on the floor. To maintain a Mediterranean diet so I can keep that overall health intact. Now mind you I’m a (22m) that’s overall is just like a white lean build but I dress emo as HELL, like full black boots, baggy jeans, black hoodies, black shirts and silver rings to you know compliment the black attire.

I fear I’m so out of the loop or that I appear that I’m just not that good looking but I’m just trying to be me. I even got a full black suit I need to wear on special occasions or just when I want to dress       ✨spiffy✨. I put in my bio on dating apps about that I need an heart like an oil change to help make it very obvious I don’t mind talking or joking about. I’ve lived with that shit long enough to laugh but I got that tism without the rizzem. Moreover I feel like they can feel how awkward I am through the screen and either back out because let’s be real here I appear either unapproachable or like some sort of weird dude with issues. 

I just want to find someone who is willing to go with me to my appointments and willing to watch me gain some new battle scars. I want someone who is okay to just chill out and be there along for the ride wether on a motorcycle ride, late night drive or going on a hike because that’s literally one of the things my doctor said was my best hobby to have. So how do I fit all of 👆that into a conversation seamlessly without it sounding weird or stressful for the other person because it’s just difficult.

I’ve also been trying to get out and do hobbies like go to the libraries, the gym and coffee shops (when I absolutely hate the smell of coffee but I do get a hot chocolate) to just meet someone but approaching them always felt weird to me. I’ve always felt bad for them because I just feel like I have just too much baggage with medical and diet so unless they’re an either really nice person that loves fish I just don’t know. Sure I find some people I find cute or adorable in what they do, but just can’t build the nerve to talk to them and it’s not like I could find the right words to say. 

Overall what I’m trying to say is how do I just not become an idiot with words and fumble what could’ve been and stop feeling like I’ll just drag them down. I feel like it’s a confidence issue thing but when you’re told you weren’t making it past 20 for your entire life it’s kinda hard to just easily talk to people. I used to be a people person could easily talk to anybody but when I start getting closer to 20 I started shutting myself off, just so I wouldn’t hurt them for when I’d eventually croak. I just didn’t want them to start either liking or loving me and I just don’t show up again.

Well that started sounding depressing but oh well already 22 can’t say that I’ll just croak anytime soon. Made it past 20🎉 so f you to my og heart dr who knew my valve was replaceable at 18 when I literally could’ve dropped dead at 20. However I lived my life to the fullest with my close group of friends smoking weed which I can’t even do anymore bs heart saying nooo, can’t even drink as much either. 

Just the point I’m getting at is I wanna be more approachable in my own style, just know how to make it easier to bring up my medical issues and having to active while on a diet, know what to bring up when and not just have that awkward moment where the only thing I can think of is sending a random meme, talk about boundaries and not letting myself bring them down. 

P.S. My bad for the long read.

Anyone else feel like every other day there's a new trading platform popping up promising “insane returns” and “automated profits”? Yeah, me too. But every once in a while, one of them actually holds up under scrutiny. That’s how I stumbled upon **[CezrustMax](https://tinyurl.com/yvxz2bjv)**—a name that’s been floating around crypto and trading subreddits more and more lately.

With the surge in interest around algorithmic trading and auto-bots, platforms like CezrustMax are skyrocketing in popularity. Whether you're a total beginner or someone who's already been dabbling in online trading, you're probably curious if it's worth the hype or just another flashy interface with little substance.

In this review, I’ll break down what CezrustMax is, who’s behind it, how it works, its pros and cons, and whether it’s actually worth your time and money. I’ll also walk you through how to get started, what devices it works on, and even how to delete your account if you change your mind later. No fluff—just everything you need to know.

## What is CezrustMax?

CezrustMax is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms and real-time market data to help users trade various financial assets like crypto, forex, stocks, and even commodities. Its goal? To simplify trading for newcomers while still giving enough tools and customization options for more seasoned traders.

Think of it like an autopilot for your trading journey. You set the parameters, and the platform does the heavy lifting—analyzing market trends, executing trades, and supposedly maximizing your returns. It’s similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, but with a more modern user interface and a few extra bells and whistles.

## Who Created CezrustMax?

This is where things get a little vague. CezrustMax doesn’t have a high-profile founder like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong behind it. The team is reportedly a group of fintech and crypto developers who wanted to make trading more accessible. While their names aren’t plastered all over the homepage, the platform has been verified by a few third-party review sites and seems to have a legitimate backend team.

Honestly, the lack of a flashy founder isn’t necessarily a red flag. Plenty of solid platforms operate without a celebrity CEO. What matters more is how the platform performs—and CezrustMax has been steadily gaining traction.

### [🔥 Start Trading with CezrustMax Today](https://tinyurl.com/yvxz2bjv)
## How Does CezrustMax Work?

CezrustMax uses a combo of **AI algorithms** and **real-time data analysis** to scan markets and execute trades based on user-defined settings. You can either let the bot make decisions automatically or trade manually using the platform’s tools.

Here’s the basic workflow:
- You sign up for an account.
- Deposit funds (minimum of $250).
- Choose your trading preferences (manual or auto).
- The platform starts analyzing trends and executing trades.

It’s kind of like setting up a Spotify playlist for your investments—once you’re done, you can sit back and let it play... just hopefully without the ads or bad songs.

## CezrustMax Pros and Cons

Like any platform, CezrustMax isn’t perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super easy to use, even for total beginners.
- ✅ Real-time data helps make smarter trades.
- ✅ Demo account available for practice.
- ✅ Multiple asset classes supported.
- ✅ No app download required; works in-browser.

**Cons:**
- ❌ No info about the founding team.
- ❌ No native mobile app yet (mobile browser only).
- ❌ Automated trading isn’t 100% foolproof—still requires monitoring.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access CezrustMax?

CezrustMax is **web-based**, which means you don’t need to download anything. It works smoothly on:
- Desktop (Windows & macOS)
- Tablets (iOS & Android)
- Mobile phones via browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)

The interface adjusts nicely to different screen sizes, which is great if you like checking on your trades while waiting in line for your coffee.

## CezrustMax – Supported Countries

CezrustMax is available in **over 100 countries**, including:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- South Africa
- Most of Europe and parts of Asia

That said, it’s always a good idea to double-check if there are any local restrictions before signing up. Some features may vary slightly depending on where you live due to regulatory stuff.

## CezrustMax – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where CezrustMax really shines. The platform uses **live market data and AI-driven insights** to help you make better trades. It constantly scans charts, trends, and price movements and adjusts your strategy accordingly. You don’t need to be glued to your screen 24/7.

### User-Friendly Interface

The layout is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overload you with jargon. If you’ve ever used Robinhood or Coinbase, it feels similar—just more focused on broader asset classes. You can easily navigate between your dashboard, trading options, and settings.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no dedicated app (yet), the **browser-based mobile interface** is responsive and smooth. You can do pretty much everything from your phone without downloading anything. Perfect for trading on the go.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts based on price changes, trade confirmations, and market shifts.** These come in handy if you’re not using the automated mode. It’s like having a little assistant whispering, “Hey, Bitcoin just dropped 5%—maybe it's time to buy?”

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not stuck with just crypto. CezrustMax lets you trade:
- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- Forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, etc.)
- Stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc.)
- Commodities (Gold, Oil)

This is a big plus if you want to diversify your portfolio without using multiple platforms.

## Is CezrustMax a Scam?

From everything I’ve tested and read, **CezrustMax doesn’t show the typical scam red flags**. It has transparent pricing, a working demo mode, active customer support, and real-time trading features. Does that mean it guarantees profits? Nope. But that’s true for any trading platform.

If you treat it like a tool—not a magic money machine—you’ll be fine.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on CezrustMax?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this category. This gives you access to:
- The full trading dashboard
- Demo account
- Customer support
- All trading tools

It’s a manageable entry point for most people and gives you enough room to test different strategies.

### CezrustMax Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested both, and the live chat response time was under 5 minutes. The agents seemed knowledgeable and weren’t just reading off scripts. That’s a win in my book.

## How do you start trading on CezrustMax?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the CezrustMax site and fill out the basic registration form. You’ll need:
- Name
- Email
- Phone number

Once you verify your email, you’ll get access to the dashboard.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

To activate trading, you’ll need to:
- Upload a valid ID (standard KYC process)
- Deposit at least $250 via credit card, bank transfer, or crypto

The process is pretty smooth. I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either:
- Use the **demo account** to practice
- Set up your **automated preferences**
- Or go manual and pick trades yourself

The platform walks you through the setup with simple instructions and tooltips, so it’s hard to mess up.

## How to Delete a CezrustMax Account?

If you decide the platform’s not for you, deleting your account is straightforward:
- Go to Settings > Account > Delete Account
- Confirm your identity
- Wait 24–48 hours for the request to process

Make sure to withdraw any remaining funds before deleting your account. They won't do it automatically.

## The Verdict

So, is CezrustMax worth your time? **If you’re a beginner looking for a user-friendly trading platform with automation features, then yes—absolutely.** It’s easy to use, offers multiple assets, and includes real-time analytics that actually help you make smarter trades.

Sure, it has a couple of downsides—no mobile app and limited info about the creators—but the pros definitely outweigh the cons here.

I’d recommend starting with the demo account to get a feel for it. If you like what you see, throw in the minimum deposit and see how it performs live. Just remember: **no platform can guarantee profits**, but CezrustMax gives you solid tools to improve your chances.

I laid back and snuggled under a jacket I pulled over myself like a blanket. I rubbed my feet together under the low blowing heat and breathed deeply to start drifting into sleep. Wind blew dry leaves off their swaying branches and I could hear them tumbling down the pavement. It started to rain and I could hear drops softly falling on the hood and windows. It was so soothing. My last thought before falling to sleep was what a comfort it would be to wake up to my McDonalds coffee still being hot, and it was.

Waiting just outside the Temple door were Garnet, Pearl, and Bismuth — all alert, their expressions shifting from concern to curiosity the moment Amethyst stepped off the warp pad.

“You’re back,” Pearl said, rushing over. “What did they say?”

“Yeah,” Bismuth added, “How’d it go? Are you okay?”

Amethyst gave a tired smile. “Yeah. I’m okay. But… it was a lot.”

The group moved inside, gathering in the main room. Greg gently nudged Amethyst to sit while he poured everyone some water, like he always did when things got emotional.

Garnet sat across from them, watching quietly.

Amethyst took a breath. “So. The Diamonds ran a ton of tests. Used Steven’s data. Ran simulations. And every version of the outcome… if I have a baby like Rose did…”

She hesitated.

“…I disappear. Just like her.”

Pearl’s expression fell, and Bismuth’s shoulders dropped.

“No way around it?” Garnet asked calmly.

“Not with what they know now,” Amethyst said. “My gem just can’t hold two full existences. It’s not built for that.”

The room went quiet.

Then Greg cleared his throat. “But… I asked something.”

All eyes turned to him.

“I asked them — since Gems are made of light and all — if there’s a way to, you know… *back Amethyst up.* Like, before she gave up her form, maybe they could store her light, her essence, her personality, and then… after the baby’s born… bring her back in a new gem.”

Bismuth blinked. “Whoa. That’s... *brilliant.* Like building a second chance.”

Pearl was stunned. “That kind of preservation has never been done. Even our tech can’t store a full Gem identity without corruption risk.”

“But the Diamonds didn’t say no,” Amethyst added. “White said it’s possible. They’d need time, research, and I’d have to agree to a lot of scary stuff, but… it’s not impossible.”

Garnet leaned forward. “It would mean trusting them. And it would mean a leap of faith.”

Amethyst nodded. “I don’t know if I’ll ever go through with it. But just knowing I *could*... that maybe I don’t have to lose myself if I want this… That means everything.”

Pearl’s eyes softened. “Amethyst… I’m so proud of you.”

“You really are incredible,” Bismuth said. “Going all the way to Homeworld, asking those questions… taking control of your future like that.”

Amethyst looked around the room — at her family.

“I’m not rushing into anything,” she said. “But it doesn’t feel impossible anymore. And that’s something.”

Greg smiled beside her. “Whatever happens… we’ll build it together.”

Garnet nodded. “The future just opened up. And whatever path you choose, we’ll be with you.”

Amethyst leaned into Greg’s side, her gem glowing softly.

For the first time in a long time, she wasn’t just reacting to life.

She was planning one

Later that afternoon, the others had spread out — Amethyst was sitting with Pearl by the ocean, talking about nothing and everything, while Garnet stood watchfully on the hill, letting her future vision cool down.

Bismuth approached Greg, who was standing near his van, fiddling with an old radio antenna for no real reason. She motioned with her head.

“Hey, Greg. Walk with me for a sec?”

“Sure,” Greg said, brushing off his hands. “What’s up?”

The two strolled down the beach, their footprints trailing behind them in the sand.

“I just wanted to say,” Bismuth started, “that was some next-level thinking back there.”

Greg blinked. “You mean the ‘light back-up baby plan’?”

Bismuth chuckled. “Yeah. That. Most Gems wouldn’t even *think* to question something that heavy. But you did.”

Greg shrugged, modest as always. “I didn’t really do much. Just… I couldn’t stand the thought of her giving up everything. Not after how long it’s taken her to feel like she *is* someone.”

Bismuth nodded slowly. “She’s changed a lot. Used to be, Amethyst wouldn’t sit through two minutes of this kind of talk without shapeshifting into a couch and pretending to snore.”

“Yeah,” Greg chuckled, “now she actually wants to build something real. A life. A future.”

They walked in silence for a moment, the waves lapping nearby.

“You know,” Bismuth said, “I used to think you were kind of a slacker.”

Greg laughed. “Fair.”

“But now I see it,” she continued. “You’re not lazy. You’re just patient. You let people be who they are. And when it really counts, you show up.”

Greg looked out at the horizon. “I don’t know if I’m the best at this. But I do know that Amethyst deserves every chance to figure out what her life could be. I just want to give her *options* — not ultimatums.”

Bismuth smiled. “You’re a good one, Universe. Don’t let the goopy beach dad act fool you — you’re part of what makes this family stronger.”

Greg rubbed the back of his neck, touched. “Thanks, Bismuth.”

She grinned. “Now come on. Let’s go back before Pearl starts explaining molecular bonding theory to Amethyst using seashells.”

Greg laughed. “Too late.”

They turned and headed back toward the Temple, two very different beings — a builder and a dreamer — both trying to build a future no one had ever imagined before.

As Greg and Bismuth neared the Temple again, their footsteps slowing, Greg glanced sideways at her. The sound of the waves was steady, grounding.

“Hey… Bismuth?” he asked casually, rubbing the back of his neck.

“Yeah?” she replied, kicking a pebble with her boot.

“I was just thinking… we don’t really get to hang out much. You know — just the two of us. No Gem missions, no space drama, no Steven-level emotional revelations.”

Bismuth raised an eyebrow, curious. “You wanna hang out with *me*?”

Greg chuckled. “Yeah. I mean, we’re part of the same weird extended family now, right? You and me — we’ve both been through it. I think it’d be cool to, I dunno… just talk sometimes. Check in. Maybe once a week or something?”

Bismuth blinked, surprised — then her face lit up with a grin. “You know what? That actually sounds pretty great.”

Greg smiled. “Really?”

“Yeah. I mean, come on — you’re the only other person around here who actually *listens* without pulling out some future vision or pulling apart a warp engine mid-sentence.”

Greg laughed. “I don’t have a visor or a gem, but I’ve got ears and a coffee thermos.”

Bismuth nudged him with her elbow. “Then it’s a deal. Every week — Bismuth and Greg Time. Could be at the forge, the boardwalk, even just sitting around doing absolutely nothing.”

“Perfect,” Greg said. “We’ll be the least magical part of Beach City, and proud of it.”

They both chuckled as they reached the front steps of the Temple, where Amethyst waved at them from the porch, a knowing smile on her face.

“Looks like your girl’s watching,” Bismuth teased.

Greg smiled warmly. “Yeah. But I’m glad she’s not the only one I can count on around here.”

Bismuth gave a thumbs up. “You ever need to talk, I’m here. No Diamonds required.”

They bumped fists, and walked back into the fold of the Temple — two friends with a new routine and a quiet understanding that even in a world full of light projections, galactic wars, and cosmic mysteries, sometimes the most meaningful moments were the small ones.",1,1752131197.0,stevenuniverse,0,1.0,False

Pondicherry (officially Puducherry) is a charming coastal town where **French colonial heritage meets Indian culture**, making it a uniquely **family-friendly** getaway. This union territory offers a relaxed vibe that appeals to travelers of all ages – from colorful colonial buildings and bustling temples in the city to quiet spiritual retreats and scenic beaches along the Bay of Bengal. As one guide notes, Pondicherry is a “treasure trove for families” with a “vibrant atmosphere” that **captivates visitors of all ages**.

Indian families will find no shortage of activities here. Kids can run freely in leafy parks, splash in the surf on safe beaches, or discover history and culture in small museums and heritage sites. For example, the **Botanical Garden** in the heart of the city is a peaceful green retreat perfect for a picnic, and the **Pondicherry Museum** showcases ancient artifacts and elegant bronze statues that tell the region’s story.

Religious and cultural sites also offer engaging experiences. Pondicherry’s **Sri Aurobindo Ashram** is a “peaceful and holy place” of meditation and learning. Nearby is **Auroville**, an experimental international township founded in 1968, whose golden **Matrimandir** dome symbolizes the “City of Dawn” (Auroville) for human unity.

Whether you’re strolling along **sunset-lit beaches**, exploring lush gardens, or soaking up culture and spirituality, Pondicherry has something for everyone. In this guide we’ll cover the **best family spots in Pondicherry**, including historical and cultural context, child-friendly activities, and practical tips for each location.

***Discover peace and purpose in the City of Dawn.***

Auroville is an **experimental township** founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (known as “The Mother”) with spiritual leader Sri Aurobindo’s vision in mind. Its name literally means “City of Dawn,” reflecting hopes for a new era of human unity. Located about 10 km north of Pondicherry in Tamil Nadu, Auroville is a unique place of **international community life and sustainable living**. UNESCO has long supported Auroville as a cultural township that brings together diverse cultures in harmony. For families, Auroville is a fun day trip where the pace is gentle and the atmosphere is welcoming.

A great way to start is at the **Auroville Visitors Centre**. This hub has interactive exhibits explaining Auroville’s history and ideals, plus boutiques selling locally made handicrafts and cafes for snacks. Kids can explore a mini model of the famous Matrimandir gardens and browse for organic products. Be sure to catch the Matrimandir video here – after watching an introductory film, you can obtain free passes to the **Matrimandir Viewing Point**. The Visitors Centre also has a food court with vegetarian options (try the solar-powered cafeteria) and restrooms. It’s open daily 9:00 AM–5:00 PM, and staff happily answer questions.

* *Visit the Auroville Visitors Centre:* Discover how Auroville works through exhibitions and models of its core project, the Matrimandir. The Centre houses boutiques and a bookshop of spiritual literature.  
* *Get a Matrimandir pass:* Families can walk about 10 minutes (or take a free shuttle) through lush paths to the Matrimandir Viewing Point. Passes are free after a short film. (Note: The actual inner chamber is reserved for meditation – children under 10 are **not** allowed inside, but everyone can enjoy the view point.)  
* *Bike or walk around Auroville:* Rent a bicycle near the Visitors Centre and tour the community villages, tree farms, and art studios. The streets are flat and peaceful, perfect for kids to ride along safely.  
* *Relax at Auroville Beach:* Just past the township lies a **Black Sand Beach** (Miramare). It’s a quiet spot for sunset watching – children can collect shells or dip toes, though the surf can be strong, so exercise caution.  
* *Join a workshop or yoga class:* Auroville offers family-oriented workshops (arts, crafts, eco-activities) that children love. You might find pottery classes, organic farming tours, or even live music events.  

The centerpiece is the **Matrimandir**, a large golden globe at the heart of Auroville, surrounded by 12 gardens. While the Matrimandir itself is primarily a meditation hall, families can admire its stunning dome from the Viewing Point surrounded by gardens. This serene spot is “not a tourist site” but a place for quiet reflection. Kids should understand it’s a calm place: no loud talking or running. As one official source cautions, all visitors are asked to behave with physical and mental silence around the Matrimandir.

**Tips for visiting Auroville with family:** Arrive early morning to avoid midday heat (the Visitors Centre opens at 9 AM). Wear modest clothes (shoulders covered) for temple respect at the Matrimandir. Carry water and snacks (though eateries are available). Keep track of children on the nature trails. And remember, while the township welcomes children, entry to the meditation hall is only for ages 10 and up – younger kids can stay at the Visitors Centre until adults return. In all, Auroville is a peaceful, eco-friendly spot that many children find intriguing. It’s a memorable part of the Pondicherry family vacation experience.

# Botanical Garden

https://preview.redd.it/9prkkf5uwzbf1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca4ca6422986a0ff38a3320f6b3e45883a3fd783

***Breathe in fresh air and family fun among nature’s wonders.***

The **Pondicherry Botanical Garden** (Jardin Botanique) is a historic and well-kept park in the city center, founded by the French in 1826. It was originally an elegant French-style garden for studying how different plants adapt to Pondicherry’s climate. Today the garden spans about 7 hectares and is divided into 30 sections containing over 1,500 varieties of plants. Stroll through giant palms, rare ferns, orchids, and fossil tree specimens — it truly is “a nature lover’s paradise”. Exotic and endangered species are prominently displayed, making it educational as well as beautiful.

The Botanical Garden is peaceful and family-friendly. Its entrance gate itself is an example of classic French colonial architecture, and once inside you’ll find *cool, shady groves* where kids can run and parents can relax. The garden’s primary goal is to educate the public about plant conservation, but for families it also offers simple fun:

* *Wander among the flower displays:* The colorful floral gardens are divided by theme (such as orchids, succulents, or medicinal plants). Kids can spot their favorites — the garden often hosts seasonal flower shows, which are a delight for the whole family. The soft colors and sweet scents here add to the charm.  
* *Relax under the trees:* A highlight is the grove of vibrant trees that bloom and fruit in different seasons. Each season brings new scenery and shady spots for picnics or naps. You’ll often hear birds chirping, creating a soothing backdrop for parents to unwind.  
* *Watch the musical fountain:* One of the garden’s big draws is the dancing fountain. In the evening (if timed right), water jets leap to music in colorful patterns. Children are entranced by the light and water show. Even if you miss it, the fountain area is fun to splash around during the day.  
* *Kids’ play area and toy train:* There’s a small playground with slides and swings, plus a merry-go-round and other rides for young children. Don’t miss the miniature toy train that circles the park – kids love riding it to get a quick view of the gardens and fountains.  
* *Fossil and aquarium attractions:* In one section you can see fossils and palm tree trunks that are over 150 million years old, which can be intriguing for curious minds. The garden even has a small aquarium housing local fish species, adding to the diversity of things to see.  

The Botanical Garden is a year-round escape. It’s particularly gorgeous in cooler months when flowers are in full bloom. Families can linger here for hours at no risk (except the low entry fee). Speaking of which, the garden is open **daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM**, and the fee is just ₹10 per adult and ₹5 per child – very affordable for a full-day outing. Winter (November to February) is the **best time to visit**, when the weather is mild and the flowers flourish. The garden usually takes about an hour to tour at a relaxed pace, but many families stay longer to play and picnic. The Botanical Garden truly deserves a spot on your list of *places to visit in Pondicherry with kids* – it offers education and entertainment in equal measure.

# Puducherry Museum

https://preview.redd.it/wr812ubswzbf1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee800c159a163839af716de6e10a723b7a2ff9b8

***Take a walk through time with your loved ones.***

For a dose of history, head to the **Puducherry Museum** located in the White Town area (St. Louis Street), near the charming Bharathi Park. Housed in a former 18th-century French law building (built 1788), the museum itself is an architectural beauty with its yellow-and-peach colonial façade. It preserves antiques and artifacts that span Pondicherry’s past – from ancient Roman trade ties to French colonial times. In fact, the museum’s exhibits celebrate Pondicherry’s role as an ancient port and cultural melting pot.

Inside, families can explore three main eras of history:

* *Arikamedu Excavations:* On display are relics from the nearby Arikamedu site (dating around 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE), which was a bustling Indo-Roman trading port. You’ll see pottery, pearls, and other artifacts unearthed by archaeologists – a fun discovery for history buffs (and a quick treasure-hunt game for kids!).  
* *Pallava-Chola Sculptures:* The museum boasts one of India’s **largest collections of Chola bronzes**, over 80 exquisite metal idols of Hindu deities dating back a thousand years. These gleaming statues, many of Lord Vishnu and Lord Nataraja, are beautifully detailed and rank among the museum’s most impressive pieces. Even children admire the craftsmanship and might spot familiar gods among them. The center hall also displays ancient transport relics – an old royal palanquin, a horse-drawn carriage, and an original rickshaw (“pousse-pousse”), which always fascinates young visitors as it shows how people traveled long ago.  
* *French Colonial Artifacts:* The European-era wing contains relics of Pondicherry’s French colonial days. You can see antique furniture, crockery, religious items, and even gramophones that reflect daily life under French rule. This gives a glimpse of 18th–20th century culture. Many artifacts have informative labels so families can learn together about the city’s colonial history.  

Visiting the museum is like stepping through time. Parents will appreciate the well-curated displays, while kids can touch the buttons of an old time clock or marvel at the enormous carved stones. There are also glass cases filled with fossils and coins to check out. The Puducherry Tourism site notes that the museum’s collection “depicts Pondicherry’s importance as a trade port” and encourages visitors to “marvel at the diversity of the history” here.

**Practical tips:** The museum is open **Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM** (closed Mondays and public holidays). Entry is very inexpensive (about ₹10 for adults, ₹5 for children). Allow about 1–2 hours for a full visit. Note the museum can get warm inside – summer visits may be shorter. It’s also near other attractions (Bharathi Park, beachfront), so it’s easy to combine this cultural stop with a stroll around the French Quarter. Overall, the museum is an educational yet leisurely break – a good outing when you want something indoors, especially on a hot midday.

# Chunnambar Boat House 

https://preview.redd.it/9e0f7cxqwzbf1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ea1d84dfeb36f4ac1f68b0502114eb460189ee

***Sail into joy with boat rides and beach vibes.***

The **Chunnambar Boat House** (sometimes called Paradise Boat House) is a **waterfront park** on the Chunnambar River, about 8 km south of Pondicherry city on Cuddalore Road. It’s a favorite family spot for **boating and beach fun**. The boat house area is managed by the Pondicherry Tourism & Transport Dev. Corporation (PTTDC), and the facility includes a parking area, play areas, and restaurants. The highlight is the ferry/boat rides to a sandy riverside beach known as Paradise Beach.

At the boat house, you’ll see dozens of colorful boats docked along the mangrove-lined backwaters. From here you can choose various activities:

* *Boat ride to Paradise Beach:* The most popular excursion is the ferry trip to Paradise Beach Island. It’s a short 10–15 minute ride by motorboat. Once on Paradise Beach (a quiet, soft-sand beach on the river’s edge), you’ll have about 4 hours to play in the sand, splash in the water, or try beach sports like volleyball. (Beach chairs and umbrellas are available to rent.) Make sure to take life jackets for the whole family. The ride back leaves by late afternoon (around 5:30 PM) to avoid darkness.  
* *Water sports and fun:* On Paradise Beach, water adventures abound. Kids and adults can enjoy banana boat rides, kayaking, jet-skis, or even a rain-dance area. There are other rides on dry land too (ATV bikes, trampolines, etc.) that may be open in peak season. Even if not doing the beach excursion, the boat house itself offers small boating (rowboats/paddle boats) right on the river for kids.  
* *Houseboat cruise:* Another unique experience is hiring a traditional houseboat or large ferry to cruise through the backwaters. The tour glides past rice paddies, coconut groves, and sleepy villages – you might even spot birds or (rarely) playful dolphins.  
* *Treehouse and camping (resort activities):* The PTTDC-run resort near the boat house offers a “treehouse” and bonfire experiences for an overnight stay. (Contact Pondicherry tourism in advance if interested.) For families looking for adventure, there are areas to set up a tent and camp on the riverbank. Even a simple picnic by the shore is lovely under the coconut palms.  
* *Kids’ playground and snacks:* Back on land, there’s a small play area for young kids with swings and slides. Food stalls and a sit-down restaurant serve Indian snacks and continental dishes, so you can grab juice and samosas before heading out. The beachfront resort also has extra amenities like kiosks and changing rooms.  

Chunnambar Boat House operates **daily from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM**. Note that Paradise Beach ferry rides typically stop by 4:00 PM (last return by 5:30 PM), so plan accordingly. The entry fee to the boat house area is quite low (about ₹15 for adults, ₹5 for children over 4) – this lets you use the grounds and playground. (Separate fees apply for the boat ride and any activities like water sports.) According to tourism sources, the best months to visit are **September through March**, when the weather is pleasant and the river is calm. Avoid the monsoon season (June–August) when boating can be closed due to heavy rains.

**Tips:** Bring swimsuits and quick-dry clothes if you plan to go to Paradise Beach – you’ll get wet! Also, wearing water shoes is helpful on the rocky river edges. Carry towels and sunscreen. If your kids are sensitive to the sun, go early or late in the day. On busy weekends, the boat house can get crowded, so arriving early means a better spot on the boat and more time on the beach. Finally, keep valuables locked in your car or with someone – the park is safe but open. Overall, a visit to Chunnambar Boat House is a **must** on your family itinerary: the **boat adventure** combined with beach time makes for endless fun and relaxation.

# Beaches of Pondicherry

Pondicherry is blessed with an East-facing coastline, so there are several beautiful beaches in and around the city that families will love. Each has its own character, and together they cover everything from long promenades to secluded islands. Our top family-friendly beaches are **Rock Beach (Promenade Beach)**, **Paradise Beach**, **Eden Beach**, and the newly developed **Pondy Marina Beach**. All offer soft sand and safe wading (compared to surfier coasts elsewhere). Below we describe each and its highlights.

# Rock Beach (Promenade Beach)

https://preview.redd.it/8c450ftowzbf1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=637c132fd739b19568682dbf542b20ff3b4adf49

***Waves, walks, and warm memories***

Rock Beach is the **city’s main beachfront promenade** – a 1.5 km stretch of shoreline right by the French Quarter. Locals also call it *Promenade Beach* or *Mahatma Gandhi Beach*. The beach is lined with weathered seawalls (hence “rock beach”), so don’t expect golden sands deep in the water. Instead, it’s famed for its **azure waves, ocean sprays and scenic coastline**. Despite the rocky bed, Rock Beach is very family-friendly: the water is relatively calm here and children can paddle in the shallows or play on the sandy patches by the promenade. The wide paved promenade is perfect for strolling, cycling or even roller-skating (especially in the early morning when vehicles are often restricted).

At Rock Beach you’ll find several pleasant spots to stop:

* *Walk by the water:* Take a hands-in-hands walk along the 1.5 km of coastline. Let kids walk on the seawall under careful supervision for the thrill of the waves breaking around them. Look for the bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi and small war memorials along the path for photo opportunities.  
* *Sunrise/sunset vistas:* Rock Beach offers lovely ocean views (sunsets over the horizon). It’s a great spot to catch a colorful sky; some families like to have evening snacks from food carts. If visiting early (around 6–9 AM), you’ll even see women jogging and doing yoga at the promenade park.  
* *Snack breaks:* The beach has been revitalized with a French-style arcade. The famous Café Le Café is right on the beach – stop for a cold drink, French pastries or local seafood with an ocean breeze. Nearby ice cream and juice stands also tempt kids. (With no entry fee, Rock Beach is essentially an open public park with lots of amenities.)  
* *Playful gadgets:* In recent years, Rock Beach added some kid-friendly installations. There are a few safe sand play areas with miniature slides and swings (mostly on the Gomathinayagi Park side). It’s a simple play spot in the shade.  
* *Evening entertainment:* On weekends you might catch street performers or vendors selling local crafts and toys along the promenade. Families often join locals for casual cricket games on the sand (free to play).  

According to the Puducherry Tourism site, Promenade Beach is an “ideal holiday spot for photographers and nature lovers” and is “considered a must-visit” on any Pondicherry tour. It is very easy to reach (in the city center along Beach Road) and is open 6:00 AM–8:00 PM daily. There are no facilities like lifeguards, but since it’s more of a leisure beach than a swimming beach, you can let young children splash safely under watch. The gentle waves here are fine for paddling, but full-on swimming is limited by the rocks. In short, Rock Beach is perfect for *family walks, photos, and casual beach fun*.

# Paradise Beach

***A slice of paradise for every generation.***

Just south of the boat house lies **Paradise Beach**, one of Pondicherry’s best-known sandy beaches. It is accessible **only by boat** (except for a marshy walk) – the ferry from Chunnambar Boat House takes about 10–15 minutes. This little island beach is often called *Plage Paradiso*, and it lives up to the name with its **unmatched charm and tranquil beauty**. Capped by thick mangrove groves, Paradise Beach has unusually soft golden sand and clear shallow waters, perfect for kids to play and explore. Tour guides emphasize that it’s a destination “for holidaymakers of all ages” who want to “relax and rejuvenate” in serenity.

At Paradise Beach, families can:

* *Play beach sports:* The open sand at Paradise is ideal for games. You can bring a volleyball or cricket ball (or ask beach staff to borrow one) and spend hours playing on the shore. The soft sand makes it safe to run and dive without hard ground. Kids and parents alike enjoy friendly matches or just digging in the sand.  
* *Try water activities:* Adventurous families can rent kayaks or take jet-ski rides on the lagoon. The water is relatively calm here. Note that parts of the water can be fairly deep (parents should use life jackets and watch small children). There’s also a designated swimming area, but always keep an eye on little ones.  
* *Relax and picnic:* Under the shade of coconut trees, you’ll find places to spread a mat and snack. The beach has snack shacks and food stalls (and even an occasional rain-dance arena) so you can grab lunch on the sand. Kids often build sandcastles or simply chase crabs along the waterline.  
* *Photography and sightseeing:* Paradise Beach is famously photogenic. The scenery of palm-fringed shore and sunlit water is great for family photos. Don’t forget to walk along the water’s edge during sunset – it’s truly a picture-perfect moment.  
* *Relax by the river mouth:* On one side of the beach, the Chunnambar River meets the sea, creating a gentle estuary where children can wade with their feet in the sand while watching boats pass by.  

No visit to Chunnambar Boat House is complete without spending time on Paradise Beach. The tourism department calls this an “incomparable” spot that has “everything you need to make the most of your trip”. The beach is open roughly 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM (depending on ferry schedules) and tends to be busiest around midday, so mornings or late afternoons are nice and quieter. Remember to bring swimwear and towels for everyone. Because the waters can be deeper, younger children should wear life jackets or floaties at all times here. All equipment rental and boat fees are paid on site (boat rides are separate from the entry fee of the park).

# Eden Beach

https://preview.redd.it/316npe4nwzbf1.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=7210853a56b306d90b9d4eef2563b8062612f53f

***Clean, calm, and perfect for the little ones***

About 7 km south of the city, **Eden Beach** in the village of Chinna Veerampattinam is a rising star among family beaches. It’s Pondicherry’s **first Blue Flag-certified beach**, which means it’s recognized for being exceptionally clean, safe, and well-managed. The sand at Eden Beach is sparkling white and the water is surprisingly clear, giving it a bit of a tropical vibe. On one side, the backwaters of Chunnambar spread out past thick palm groves, making the sunrise view **truly mesmerizing**.

Families will appreciate Eden Beach’s modern amenities: there is a **safe swimming zone** (with lifeguards on duty in peak season), marked off so you and your kids can swim with confidence. Remarkably for a public beach, Eden has a clean restroom and shower facility, changing rooms, and even an open-air gym and children’s play area just off the sand. Food kiosks and a small arcade selling snacks are on site too. Visitors can park easily for free and walk a short distance to the sand.

Here are some highlights of Eden Beach:

* *Safe swimming:* The designated swim area is roped off to protect swimmers from currents. Kids can splash in the clear water here while parents relax nearby. Do note that Pondicherry’s beaches can have undercurrents, so it’s still wise not to venture too far from shore (especially outside the blue flag zone).  
* *Play and exercise areas:* Eden Beach features a free outdoor gym facing the sea, plus a bright play park with slides and swings for children. After a swim, kids can run around the playground while adults use the shaded benches to take in the view.  
* *Bird-watching:* If your family loves birds, Eden Beach is a little haven. During migratory season (October–March) you can spot many shorebirds and waders on the nearby wetlands. Keep an eye out for golden plovers or little terns during winter mornings.  
* *Picnics and sunsets:* The beach tends to be very clean and not overly crowded. Many families lay out picnic mats under the palm trees lining the beach. It’s especially lovely early morning – locals say Eden Beach has some of the **best sunrises** in Pondicherry. As the sun sets in winter, the sky often turns pink over the water.  

Eden Beach is open **6:00 AM–6:00 PM** every day (the best time to visit is early morning when it’s quiet). There is no entry fee, and it’s wheelchair-accessible. Because the climate is tropical, plan to come with plenty of sunscreen, hats, and water – shade is limited to the palm trees. The Blue Flag status is a good indicator that Eden Beach is maintained to international standards, so you can feel confident bringing young children here.

# Pondy Marina Beach

***Where food, fun, and sea breeze come together.***

The newest beach in town is **Pondy Marina Beach**, just north of the city’s old lighthouse at Dubrayanpet (about 1.5 km from White Town). What makes Pondy Marina special is its *theme-based development*: the entire promenade is lined with dozens of food stalls and food courts! It’s been called the **“food-theme beach”** of Pondicherry. Here families can stroll along a sandy stretch of shore while sampling treats from 30+ vendors – everything from artisanal ice creams and pizzas to South Indian biryani and seafood. Children will be thrilled by the variety of snacks (Italian gelato, churros, fresh-cut fruit) and by the open play areas near the water.

Other attractions at Pondy Marina Beach include:

* *Wide sandy beach:* Unlike Rock Beach, Pondy Marina has an actual broad stretch of clean sand right by the water. Kids can run freely here or splash in the shallow shoreline. On calm days you might see a few small boats or canoes. It’s one of the few spots where you can safely enter the water in White Town (there are no strong waves or rip currents).  
* *Food courts and dining:* With 34 food stalls planned (most of which are open now), parents can sample special cuisines while kids stay entertained. Favorites include gelato at Richie Rich, Turkish ice cream cones, pizza at Pizza Marina, and Kerala-style biryani. Many shops have beachside seating – try scooping up some dosa or ice cream while watching the sea. Nighttime lights and occasional cultural performances (e.g. folk dances on a small stage) make it lively after sundown.  
* *Mangrove boat rides:* At the north end of Marina Beach, PWD offers small boat rides through the adjacent mangrove creek (similar to Chunnambar, but on a smaller scale). It’s a fun mini-trip for families that lasts about 10–15 minutes (look for the ticket counter by the main stage).  
* *Sunrise viewing:* Pondy Marina is a great spot to catch the sunrise. The beach faces east and early morning crowds often gather to watch the sky turn gold over the water. The gentle cool of morning and a cup of filter coffee from a nearby cafe make it a refreshing start to the day.  

Pondy Marina is also open throughout the day (many food shops stay open till late evening). There’s no formal entry fee – you only pay for what you eat or for any rides. The atmosphere is clean and modern, and children generally feel very safe here. It’s a fun blend of seaside scenery and a food market. If your family loves to sample local and international dishes, this beach is a unique and delicious stop on your Pondicherry itinerary.

# Temples and Churches

https://preview.redd.it/m1o5q97lwzbf1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c4d214768906cc5853c68d091d2ce437707ce7d

***Feel the divine connection in Pondy’s peaceful shrines***

Pondicherry is notable for its harmonious mix of spirituality and culture, with colorful temples and grand churches often just blocks apart. Visiting a few of these sites gives a glimpse into the faith and history of the region – and most are very welcoming to families (especially outside of service times). Here are the most significant **Temples and Churches in Pondicherry**:

* **Sri Aurobindo Ashram** – Although technically an ashram, this is a must-see spiritual center. Founded by Sri Aurobindo and Mirra “The Mother”, it’s a peaceful oasis spread across several acres. The white Ashram buildings are home to meditation halls and Sri Aurobindo’s samadhi (tomb), but families will likely enjoy browsing the ashram bookshop and garden cafes. One travel guide calls it a “peaceful and holy place” that is a *favorite tourist venue* for those seeking inner peace. Entrance is free; just remember to be quiet and respectful (no flash photography inside halls).  
* **Sri Manakula Vinayagar Temple** – This is the most famous Hindu temple in the city, dedicated to Lord Ganesh (Vinayagar). It’s over 300 years old and features a **gilded elephant-carved entrance** and a full-sized gold chariot inside (7.5 kg of gold!) which is pulled by devotees during festivals. The temple is always bustling with worshippers and decorated with marigolds and lamps. For families, it’s lively: kids often love the temple elephants nearby (which bless newcomers with *prasadam* while you offer coins) and the colorful sights. As one source notes, it’s “a popular pilgrimage site and tourist destination in Puducherry”. Plan to arrive in the morning or evening (dress modestly and remove shoes). There’s no entry fee, but you may pay to have the kid fed by elephant or to offer on behalf of your family.  
* **Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus** – This is a grand **Catholic basilica** built by French priests in the early 1900s (consecrated 1907). From the street, its tall red spire and gothic arches command attention. Inside, the architecture is a striking blend of French and Indian styles. Stained-glass windows depict saints and biblical scenes, and Corinthian columns line the nave. The basilica is known as one of the most beautiful churches in India. Families can explore the serene interior (mass is held daily, but tourists are welcome outside service times). It’s especially festive during Christmas and New Year’s. Worth a quick mention for kids: there are often friendly church cats and a peaceful courtyard to sit in.  
* **Immaculate Conception Cathedral** – Also called the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, this is the “mother church” of Pondicherry, over 300 years old. Its white and sky-blue exterior with gilded trim stands out on the French streets. Inside, you’ll find golden pillars supporting a high central aisle, with paintings of the life of Jesus on the ceiling. The architecture is a mix of French and Portuguese (reflecting Pondy’s colonial history). It has a charming garden in front and a small bell tower. The cathedral is quiet and cool, giving kids a chance to light a prayer candle and look up in awe at the ornate ceiling. There is no entry fee here either, and it’s usually open 6:00 AM–8:30 PM.  

**Other notable sites:** The town also has dozens of smaller Hindu temples (Murugan, Vishnu, etc.) and historic churches (like the Church of Our Lady of Angels). Even if you don’t go inside all of them, walking the streets near Goubert Avenue and Mission Street will naturally bring you past many spiritual landmarks. Temples in particular ask that shoulders be covered and shoes removed (bring socks if needed). Most places welcome visitors outside of prayer hours. A relaxed visit to these temples and churches rounds out the family experience, adding culture and a bit of adventure (kids enjoy ringing temple bells and collecting prasad!) to your Pondicherry trip.

At Chunnambar Boat House, entry is about **₹15 per adult and ₹5 per child** (boat/ride fees extra); it’s open 9:00 AM–6:00 PM. Paradise Beach ferry rides and fun rides are additional (but reasonably priced). Churches and temples have **no entry fee**, though donations are welcome. As a tip, many attractions open around 9 AM (some temples at 6 AM), and everything closes by early evening (5–6 PM). Check local signage or tourism websites for exact schedules on the day of your visit.  
* **Q:** *Can young children enter the Matrimandir at Auroville?* **A:** **No**, only children aged 10 and above are allowed inside the Matrimandir meditation chamber. Younger kids must stay at the Auroville Visitors Centre while accompanying adults go inside. However, the **Matrimandir Viewing Point** (a beautiful garden lookout a short walk away) is open to all visitors. Day passes to see the Matrimandir from outside are free and issued at the Visitors Centre. So families with toddlers can still admire the golden globe from a distance and explore Auroville’s other attractions.  
* **Q:** *Any tips for traveling around Pondicherry with family?* **A:** Pondicherry is very walkable in the core city, and many families rent bicycles or autorickshaws for short trips. The city is relatively traffic-light compared to bigger metros, but always hold children’s hands when crossing streets. If you plan to visit Auroville or the beaches, hire a car or take a tourist taxi for comfort. Be sure to carry sunscreen, hats, and water bottles on any day trip, as it can get hot. Most restaurants and cafes in Pondicherry are family-friendly; local food is mostly vegetarian-friendly. Finally, Pondicherry is considered a safe destination for Indian families (petty crime is low), but always keep an eye on belongings at crowded spots.  

# Conclusion

Pondicherry is a **wonderful family vacation** spot that balances relaxation, culture, and fun. With its mix of **sunny beaches, lush gardens, vibrant temples, and quiet ashrams**, there is truly something for every member of the family.

Remember to go in the cooler months, follow simple safety tips (like watching the kids at the water and securing valuables), and respect local customs at religious sites (covering shoulders, removing shoes).

All in all, Pondicherry stands out as one of the **best family spots in India** – it’s a safe, clean, and friendly place where families can have both adventure and relaxation. Whether your kids are building sandcastles on paradise beaches or spotting butterflies in the botanical gardens, this little coastal town is sure to delight.

I tried Portugal yesterday and noticed that my Coffee Plantation Companies HQ was established in my Colonial Holding in SE Africa.

I am a clinical hypnotherapist and a writer. 
Since my husband got transferred, the company was bearing the cost of relocation. The company asked us to take our valuables (gold, silver or any other precious items), any special clothing item that has a chance of getting damaged during shipping and some basic kitchen use items with us, while rest of our household items (furniture, clothes, gym equipment, shoes etc) will be come via sea route and that will take upto two months. 
My neighbour Linda (not real name) is a kind lady who lives alone. She came to my home asking if I need any help, she got me food after knowing that my kitchen is not set up, basically an angel. She told me that she has a daughter, Mary (22 F), who was to get married in a few weeks’ time. I bumped into Linda and Mary when I was returning from the supermarket. We exchanged greetings. Mary was excited to see me, a little overly excited I should say. That day around 4pm, Mary and Linda called me to ask if they can come home to which agreed. Mary directly said - I want you to come to my wedding as a guest. I was surprised and confused. I was happy that I will get to see a Christian wedding which is very different from Indian weddings. Indian weddings are crazy (this is not a whole other story- will share later). So I was happy but I was confused as to how can she invite me when we barely know each other. I honestly told Mary that I am new to the country, I am not aware of the cultural practices followed here, of what is appropriate and what’s not (though I have seen A LOT of Charlotte Dobre videos and I have a vague idea how not to be a bad person in a wedding).
I also told Mary that I don’t have all my party wear clothes except a few sarees which are for special occasions. She told me not to worry, she wants ‘variety and diversity’ in her wedding and her bridesmaid too are not all white (she has five bridesmaid - one Asian, one black and three ‘normal’ - read white). She also told me that it will be better if I come in a traditional Indian attire. Again I knew from Charlotte’s videos that one must not wear white to a wedding. So I did not want to take any chance and showed her all three party wear sarees that I had. 
1. A Banarasi handloom pure silk saree with hand embroidered golden work. This saree is very wedding-ish. It was dark pink/magenta with gold details. 
2. A cream coloured saree with golden horizontal lines and the edges of the saree were frilly and made out of cream coloured satin with golden embroidery.
3. A pink and orange ombré or shaded (not able to explain) pure silk saree from another state in India. Handloom again. 

I showed these to Mary and asked her to choose what to wear and when. She suggested that I should wear the cream and gold saree for the ceremony and the magenta one for reception. I was a little surprised because cream would have looked close to white but she insisted. So I agreed. 

I don’t put much make up. And since the sarees are heavy and have so many details, a subtle make up makes for a good balance. 
Anyway, the day came and I went to the ceremony. Dressed as she asked me to. For make up, I did not wanted to spend so I did my own basic makeup with — a tint cream/foundation, face powder, Kaajal (kohl), a small bindi (stick-on dot on the forehead) tinted lip balm and for jewellery I had earring and bangles. I kept my hair open (my hair is not that great. No styling at all only shampoo and conditioned hair. 
Now, it is to be noted honourable judge Charlotte that I was not aware of practices like - assigning a particular seat to guests and gifts to be given from the registry, also I was tight on budget due to relocation and all. But Mary had mentioned that she likes Indian traditional home decor item and I had bought new brass ware a large lotus shaped brass bowl can be used in many way - home decor with scented water and floating candles, serving platter, any kitchen use. It also had some hand painted details on the outer rim. Though I had bought it for my home, I decided to gift it (it was new and packed) because I can get more when I go to India next year. So I went with that gift and kept it on the gift table and I took a seat at the back and sat there quietly. Linda came and she took me to introduce to her family and friends. Everyone complimented me and my outfit, my make up and also my polite behaviour.
The turning point — The photographer there came to me personally and asked me if she can take my singles in various poses and backgrounds because she was new in the business and having a Indian model (I am not anything like a model, I am 5.3 and plump) with traditional attire will help her get business from expats or other communities too. I had an idea that they charge per photo and I did not want Mary to pay for my singles so I politely declined. After a few minutes, Mary came to me with the photographer and told me to go ahead with those photos since the photographer won’t charge any money for that (photographer was getting a free model). I agreed and we took a few photos in different poses and then she got busy with her work. 
I came home happy rested a while got ready for the reception in the saree chosen by Mary. I went to the venue in a black BMW with my another neighbour (female) who was also invited and she offered to give me a lift. Heads did turn when I stepped out of the car in my magenta saree (not sure if in awe or whatever) But I don’t care much. My husband and my kids told me that I looked beautiful. And I felt beautiful. That’s what matters. Period. Only change in my look was that I had put jasmine garlands (thin strings) covering my hair bun which I kept in an unkempt way (I have mentioned my hair is not good). Putting flower in hair is also common practice in India and women put one or two strings of jasmine in their hair everyday. The photographer incident repeated since my this look was more ‘royal’ and ‘wedding-ish’ and will be more helpful for photographer’s portfolio. I obliged after RECONFIRMING about the payment with Mary. This time, Linda came and told me to go ahead. But I could see that Mary was avoiding me, not responding to my good wishes or anything I said.

She asked one of the bridesmaids (the black one) to tell me to sit in the corner table and not ‘disturb’ the guests. The bridesmaid came to me and told me how Mary invited me to make fun of brown people and their gaudy sense of style. She said (the bridesmaid quoted), “(Me) will look like a flower bouquet and will be a laughing stock. If only (Me) could come to the venue riding an elephant”.  She said many more racist things about me, like
1. she chose those colour sarees for me because she KNOWS that those colours will not suit my brown skin tone. 
2. I will be more like an exotic item for guests’ free entertainment 
3. I will realise my place in society and understand what is ‘real class’ after witnessing a real classy white wedding.🙄 without all pomp and show. 
4. She KNEW (but it did not happen) that I will wear all the jewellery and come to wedding looking like Santa’s reindeer with bells jingling in my neck. 
5. Since I am plump and sarees were heavy, I will look like a tent and a clown. 

She said more unspeakable things. The bridesmaid (black) also said that Mary did the same to her by saying that she is making her MOH and giving her a dress different from white (fair) bridesmaids and what she got was an awful looking dress but I told her that awful dress also could not hide her beautiful face and she looked glamorous even in that dress.

I was appalled at this racist attitude. The bridesmaid also told me that Mary had expected that I wear come all caked up with ‘blush/rouse applied with the help of a cookie cutter’. But my very simple make up irritated her and foiled her plan. She wanted me to look like a table centre ‘piece’, well, too bad for her, I ended up being centre ‘of attraction’

Anyway, the ceremony vibe also repeated where people walked up to me and talked to me nicely. They asked what I did and my interests and work. They also asked about significance of wearing garland, bindi and bangles etc. and I answered those. 
I could sense it in my gut that Mary was not happy and regretting her decision to invite me. She looked grumpy and irritated. She also told the photographer to not include me in any of the reception photos. Which is fine. 

I kept quiet, ate little and left early. 

After a week, Linda came to my home with the gift that I had given and she said that Mary did not like it so she wants to return. Linda apologised profusely but I told her it’s okay. We got taking about Indian rituals and I mentioned that after the wedding, relatives invite the newly wed couple to their home for lunch or dinner and give them gifts (mostly clothes of jewellery) and then see them off by giving rice, turmeric and money to the bride. Rice turmeric and money symbolised that may their household prosper and always have good luck, food and wealth. Linda suggested that I should invite Mary. I absolutely did not want to invite Mary after knowing about her racist thoughts. But I agreed since Linda insisted. This was only to respect Linda’s wishes since she is elder and a good person. 
When I was able to settle down completely (after 2 months), I invited Mary and her husband over for lunch. Though the food was according to how and what people eat here - no curry or Indian food. Mary still complained that how the food was not very good. Her husband just kept quiet. 
Anyway, I remember when I had shown my sarees and jewellery to Mary when she first invited me, she picked a silver anklet and told me to get exactly same anklet for her and she will pay me for that. Since she did not like my previous gift, I thought of giving that anklet (new and unused) to her since she has said it clearly and specifically that she wanted that anklet. So I gifted her that. When I was cleaning up after they left, I saw that Mary forgot to take the gift that I gave. She also left the rice and turmeric thing. I called her but it went unanswered. Then I received message saying she left it because she did not like and it is of no use to her. This was the universe’s loudest hint to me that I must distance myself from this entitled and racist woman and I went no contact.
Later, though I was not interested in knowing, Linda told me that Mary is behaving rudely with me because she thinks that I stole lime light, lemon light, orange light or whatever freaking citrus light during her wedding with my simple make up and traditional dressing. She said I tried upstaging her. I don’t know if I upstaged Mary in being the centre of attraction, but with her racist plan and plot she definitely upstaged me in being an a-hole. 
Again, after a few days, Linda came to my house and again apologised and said something unbelievable. Linda told me that Mary wants me to gift her few of my furniture (coffee table and a cabinet - they looked like antique because of distressed wood and unique colour). I was shocked at this demand and told Linda politely yet firmly that I invited Mary for lunch to respect Linda’s wishes and I won’t be able to entertain Mary anymore. Mary is racist, toxic and insecure. 
Though this is written under the title AITA, I know I am not. And I pray and wish that Mary too gets some wisdom and maturity. And Linda should stop being her daughter’s messenger.

Ever wonder if AI can really help you make smarter trades? Yeah, I was skeptical too. 🤔 But with all the buzz around AI-powered trading platforms like **[InvestGPT](https://tinyurl.com/yq62csjj)**, I had to check it out for myself. With crypto, stocks, and forex markets moving faster than my morning coffee kicks in, having a tool that claims to analyze everything in real time and give you trading insights sounds kinda dreamy, right?

AI in trading isn’t new, but platforms like **InvestGPT** are making it more accessible for everyday users. Whether you're a total beginner or someone who’s been messing around with charts for years, the idea of having an AI assistant sounds *pretty helpful*. In this review, I’m diving deep into **InvestGPT**—what it is, how it works, what I liked, what could be better, and whether it’s worth your time (and money). Let’s get into it.

## What is InvestGPT?

**InvestGPT** is an AI-powered trading platform designed to assist users in navigating the complex world of financial markets. It uses machine learning algorithms and real-time data analysis to suggest trading opportunities across multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities**.

The platform acts like a supercharged trading assistant—not a broker per se, but a tool that helps you make smarter decisions. It’s automated, but you still maintain control over your trades. Think of it as a **co-pilot** rather than an autopilot.

## Who Created InvestGPT?

The creators of InvestGPT haven’t exactly put their names front and center, which is pretty common with these kinds of platforms. From what I could gather, it was developed by a team of software engineers and trading experts who wanted to bring **AI-driven insights** to retail traders.

It’s likely a product of the same ecosystem or team behind platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, judging by the UI/UX similarities. While anonymity might sound sketchy, it's not unusual in the fintech space—especially for tools that operate globally.

- **Step 1**: You sign up and deposit funds.
- **Step 2**: The AI analyzes market conditions and flags potential trades.

What’s cool is you don’t need to understand every candlestick pattern or RSI level to start. The system does the heavy lifting, but you still get the final say.

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The **real-time analysis engine** is where InvestGPT really shows off. It constantly scans market movements and uses predictive models to identify potential trades. This is like having a data scientist whispering trade tips in your ear 24/7.

It’s especially helpful in volatile markets like crypto, where timing can be everything.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overload you with data. Even if you’ve never touched a trading platform before, you’ll feel at home here. Everything is laid out clearly: dashboard, market trends, trade suggestions, and account settings.

It reminded me of platforms like eToro or Robinhood—but with a more AI-focused twist.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no app (boo), the platform is **mobile-optimized**. You can log in via Chrome or Safari and it adapts well to smaller screens. You won’t get push notifications, but you can still place trades and check your portfolio on the go.

### Customizable Alerts

This is one of my favorite features. You can set alerts based on **price levels, trend reversals, or asset-specific movement**. It’s like having your own digital lookout scanning the horizon for you.

Super useful if you don’t want to sit in front of charts all day like a stock market goblin.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not just limited to crypto. **InvestGPT supports multiple asset classes**, including:

- Bitcoin and altcoins
- Stock indices
- Forex currency pairs
- Commodities like gold and oil

This makes it a solid choice if you want to diversify without juggling multiple platforms.

## Is InvestGPT a Scam?

Based on my experience and what I’ve seen online, **InvestGPT doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It’s a legit platform with actual functionality, not one of those fake ""get-rich-quick"" traps.

However, like any trading platform, success depends on **how you use it**. The AI helps, but it’s not a crystal ball. And always be wary of fake websites or impersonators—use only the official site for registration.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on InvestGPT?

The platform has a **minimum deposit requirement of $250** to unlock live trading. This is pretty standard in the industry and aligns with platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

You can use this deposit to start trading immediately, and it’s not a fee—it’s your trading capital.

Support is available via:

- **Live Chat** (during business hours)
- **Email** (24/7 response time varies)

I tested support with a few questions and got a helpful response in under an hour. Would be nice to see 24/7 live support in the future, though.

## The Verdict

So, is InvestGPT worth your time? If you’re looking for a **smart, beginner-friendly trading assistant**, I’d say yes. It’s not going to make you rich overnight (nothing will), but it can definitely help you make better-informed trades without spending all day on analysis.

I like that it supports multiple assets, has real-time alerts, and doesn't charge sneaky fees. The lack of a mobile app and limited transparency about the developers are drawbacks, but overall, it’s a solid platform for getting into AI-assisted trading.

**Would I recommend it to a friend?** Yeah, especially if they’re just getting into trading or want a simpler way to stay on top of fast-moving markets.

It started with the right hand in September 2023, just weeks later I had the same issue with the left hand too. Pain in the wrist, pain in the fingers, nerve irritations, sore arms… I even lost my job to it.

This year around February, I started experimenting with my diet. I jumped onto the keto bandwagon and found myself working on the computer and even making art for several hours a day with almost no issues. I sometimes still have that fragility feeling in the wrists. But the real pain is basically gone. Back at working.

I’m not here to tell you that keto is the way. I don’t even know if it’s the right way for me. Maybe it’s just the coffee that I don’t drink anymore or the sugar and highly processed food that I don’t consume anymore. But I don’t think it would hurt you to try some kind of diet change.

1lw626p,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lw626p/processing_a_disturbing_dream_about_my_dead_friend/,Processing a disturbing dream about my dead friend,"My close friend of many years died. His family hasn't disclosed the cause of death, but I suspect an accidental overdose. He was a successful lawyer but had past problems with hard drugs. A few years back he asked me to throw them out somewhere he wouldn't be able to find them. But then he was in rehab and found a good therapist....

His mom told me at the funeral that family had to get a locksmith to open the apartment after he didn't show up to work and the calls went to voicemail. I felt like an asshole because I never ended up using the set of keys he had given me a couple months ago. The makeup could not hide the bloat in the open casket, and so he must have been dead for at least a couple days before they found him. 

I was supposed to crash with him the week of the funeral. My last text had been a picture of a bird I found on a walk. He had been a bird watcher, and my picture was an excuse to say hi after a week of slow texting.  His last text back was some nerd nonsense about another bird.

A week after the funeral, I had a dream. He was lying in a gutter among filth and needles. I asked what had happened and where he had gone. He rolled his eyes. ""What do you think?"" He didn't bother trying to get up, as if the gutter was where he would stay. He switched to a foreign language. In life, his hobby had been languages, and he flaunted it at bars when trying to make friends or get laid. When we were out, he'd sometimes switched to the only second language I knew to gossip without getting in trouble. In the dream, I could somehow understand that he was asking in the foreign language for candy (which his family had given out at the funeral) and money.

I woke up from the dream early in the morning. It felt like a visit. I wrote down his request for candy and money, but then realized he had switched to a foreign language because it was a euphemism for drugs. As I made coffee, a hummingbird flew up to the window, looked at me for a long moment as it slowly hovered up and down, and darted away. 

This dream has stopped my healing. I don't necessarily believe that his ghost actually visited me in my sleep from the afterlife to make it known that he had gone to some kind of hell, but I will say that in the dream he felt more present to me than in that casket. He was a good man and helped a lot of people, and I don't think that drug addiction is a moral failure, and so the image of him condemned has disturbed me. I know I need to accept that this dream was just my subconscious processing of the grief and does not have a basis in reality. But in my heart, it feels like the dream was the true goodbye, and it was only darkness without hope.  ",2,1752130335.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False
1lw6138,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1lw6138/any_landlords_in_hoi_an_or_da_nang_who_might_be/,Any landlords in Hoi An (or Da Nang) who might be interested in free substantial upgrades to their property?,"I've lived in Vietnam for five years, and it's become my second home. One of the things that I miss here in Vietnam is being able to design and build my own space. I originally studied architecture and design in university, and have renovated or rebuilt the homes that I owned in the US and the apartment I bought in Hanoi.

Living in Hoi An is different. I can't purchase land to build or renovate the style of home that I would like, and I miss being able to customize my space. In addition to construction, I also used to refurbish and restore wood furniture as a hobby back in the US, and I don't have space to do that here, as well.

Here is the idea that I've been considering.

I've been looking for property in Hoi An to rent in the range of 30m to 40m VND per month, and I've found lovely homes - but what I really want is to find a fairly large fixer-upper with good bones, and terrible finishing. Preferably 3 to 4 bedrooms, targeting in the range of 10m VND per month in rent and a guarantee that I can rent at least 2 to 3 years.

In exchange for a guarantee that I can live there for at least two to three years without a rent increase, I would agree to hire a renovation crew to renovate to a plan agreed to by myself and the landlord - fixing flooring, replacing cabinets, bathroom fixtures, possibly adding or removing non-structural walls, installing additional AC in key rooms, etc. I would cover 100% of these upgrades, with a guarantee of spending at least 180 to 240m VND in the first month or two of moving in. I'd then spend the rest of the time building and improving the property myself. I'd take care of it, essentially, as if I would my own home.

All permanent upgrades would, of course, stay with the apartment when I moved out. My intention would be, over the course of the first six months, to upgrade the property so it could rent for 25m to 30m per month after I move out. I'd leave the apartment in substantially better condition than I found it, either for future rentals or whatever the landlord likes, in exchange for reasonable creative control of the apartment in the time I'm there, in partnership with the landlord, and a guarantee I can live there a minimum amount of time.

If anyone were interested in this, I'm happy to share designs and renovation images of what I've done in the past, but it's nothing too crazy. I'd be working with as reputable a renovation crew as I can find, and my goal would be to have most of the major renovations done in the first month of renting to my standard, so I could move in.

**Why spend money to fix up someone else's property?**

Both financially and personally, this approach works well for me. If I rent an apartment for 30,000,000 a month over 12 months, it's a total of 360m VND over a year. At 10m VND a month, I'll be saving 240m VND compared to the more expensive unit, but I won't like my apartment as much.

All I'm planning on doing is redirecting that 240m in savings into an initial investment in renovations, hopefully getting the same quality apartment, but also having the fun of designing where I live. If I stay for the second year at the same rent, it becomes a good financial arrangement for me compared to 30m rent, as well.

I believe this is a genuine win-win for myself and the landlord. For the landlord, they're able to collect the same 10m per month that they would otherwise have collected, but also getting an additional 240m in property upgrades at the same time. It would provide a path for someone to renovate the property at no cost to them, and allow me to do what I love at the same time.

If the approach works well, I'll end up repeating this every few years, moving from apartment to apartment, leaving them in better condition as I go.

I know this approach may be a bit unusual, but I can't think of any reason that it is inherently difficult. It depends on finding the right partners/landlords, and is relatively little risk for the landlord after the first month. For everyone's sake, we'd want to do it under a carefully discussed agreement so there are no misunderstandings.

Do you think there are any landlords who would be interested? Do you know of any? Please feel free to DM me if you think it may be something worth discussing. If it's crazy... then that's ok, too. :)

**Just in case, here are the features I'm most interested in from a potential property:**

* 3 to 4 bedrooms
* 2 or more bathrooms
* 200+ sq m property (150+ sq mts of built space)
* A place for a shop, place to set up and work with power tools, etc.
* Adequate space in the property for storage
* Prefer single story or two story house, stand alone (space between the house and others on most sides).
* Square property, with some space for greenery and garden area around the house.
* Interesting layout, potential for unique renovation
* Rural surrounding area, not too noisy - pretty things to look at when going on a walk OR coffee shops within walking distance.
* No more than 15 minutes from Hoi An's downtown, or near pleasant things in Da Nang. Really the key for location is that Grab delivery needs to be able to get there. haha.
* Condition needs to be good enough to make renovation possible. Walls have to be solid and repairable. Roof needs to be solid, so that the renovation focuses on design beyond basic repairs.",0,1752130217.0,VietNam,1,0.2,False

Sounds brutal. Sounds clean. Sounds like a match to your message.

But it wasn’t.

Because while he was dismantling the search, he was **performing enlightenment.**  
He dressed as the man beyond the system.. Then kept showing up to talk about the system.  
He claimed freedom from the market of transformation.. T**hen sold the story of having transformed.**

Not through products. Not through promises.  
But through **persona**. Through mystique.  
Through the same seduction mechanics every guru uses.. Just inverted.

Instead of “I have something for you”..  
It was:

>

That’s the new carrot.  
**No path. No effort. No belief. No payoff.**  
And yet.. **He got something**.  
He became something.  
He lived differently.  
He functioned beyond thought.

Or so the story goes.

>

The power play was simple:  
Deny the role of teacher while modeling the final state.  
Refuse the title while enacting the authority.  
Laugh at seekers while being the only one who *apparently* isn’t seeking.

It wasn’t humility. It was bait.  
**The new spirituality: Post-spiritual posturing.**

He didn’t sell the carrot.  
He said the carrot was fake.  
But he held it anyway.. And smirked while people reached for it.

>

He never walked away.  
He didn’t dissolve into silence.  
He didn’t drop out of public life.

He became a character.  
A brand.  
The anti-guru people quoted like scripture while he called it all garbage.

>

This is the core of guru mutation:  
When “nothing happened” becomes a story..  
And the teller becomes sacred through refusal.

**He performed freedom by denying he had it.**

Which is how the self survives its own disintegration.

>

While every room he walked into turned him into the axis.

That’s not dissolution.  
That’s marketing.  
That’s **refined guruism**..

With all the same mechanics, just no robes.

And it works better.

Because the carrot isn’t hanging in front of you anymore.  
It’s being denied entirely..  
**While still being waved behind his back.**

## What is AverionTrader 2.5 Nova?

AverionTrader 2.5 Nova is an **automated trading platform** designed to execute trades in crypto and other markets using AI-driven algorithms. Think of it like a virtual assistant for trading—it analyzes market trends, makes predictions, and executes trades based on your preferences.

What makes it interesting is that it’s **designed for both beginners and experienced traders**. Newbies can use the automated features, while advanced users can tweak settings and strategies. It’s kinda like setting your coffee machine to make the perfect brew while you’re still in bed.

Also, it's web-based, so you don’t need to download anything. Just log in, set your preferences, and let the bot handle the rest. 

## Who Created AverionTrader 2.5 Nova?

The creators of AverionTrader 2.5 Nova haven’t exactly gone public with their identities, which is a little frustrating. From what I could gather, it seems to be developed by a team of financial software engineers and crypto traders who’ve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**. 

That said, the platform operates through regulated brokers, which adds a layer of trust. It’s not uncommon for trading tools to keep their dev teams low-key, but I’d still prefer more transparency here. 

Still, based on how polished the interface is and how smoothly it runs, it’s clear it wasn’t thrown together overnight.

You can set your trading preferences—like how much to risk per trade, what assets to focus on, and whether you want to use stop-loss or take-profit strategies. Once you’re set up, the platform does the heavy lifting.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of the workflow:
- **You fund your account** with a minimum of $250.
- **The software scans markets 24/7** for trading signals.
- **Trades are executed automatically** based on your chosen strategy.
- **You can monitor or adjust settings** any time.

It aims to reduce human error and emotion in trading. It’s not magic, but it’s a big help if you want to stay active in the market without being glued to charts all day.

## AverionTrader 2.5 Nova Pros and Cons

- **Desktops and Laptops** (Windows, macOS)

The interface is mobile-optimized, so while there’s no native app, I had no issues checking trades from my phone on the go. It’s pretty slick and responsive.

## AverionTrader 2.5 Nova – Supported Countries

This part’s important: **AverionTrader 2.5 Nova is available in most countries**, but there are a few exceptions due to regulatory restrictions.

Currently, it works in:
- **USA**
- **UK**
- **Australia**
- **Canada**

It may not work in countries with strict financial regulations like **North Korea**, **Iran**, or **some EU jurisdictions** with tight crypto laws. Best bet? Try signing up—if it’s not available in your country, it’ll let you know right away.

## AverionTrader 2.5 Nova – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where the platform flexes its AI muscles. It constantly sifts through **massive amounts of market data** in real time. That includes price charts, trading volume, news headlines, and historical patterns.

The idea is to spot short-term opportunities before they disappear. It’s not 100% accurate (no bot is), but it’s surprisingly quick at reacting to market shifts.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, AverionTrader 2.5 Nova makes it feel manageable. The dashboard is clean, with **easy-to-read graphs, toggle switches**, and helpful tooltips. You won’t get lost in a sea of technical jargon.

It’s like using Spotify—you don’t need to know how it works internally to enjoy the benefits.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no standalone app, the web interface works seamlessly on mobile devices. I used it on both iPhone and Android browsers and didn’t notice any lag or scaling issues.

Perfect if you want to check your trades during your lunch break or while lying in bed.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **notifications for market moves**, trade confirmations, profit/loss thresholds, and more. These alerts can be sent via email or push notifications, so you’re always in the loop.

No more FOMO or missed opportunities.

### Multiple Asset Trading

It’s not just for crypto. AverionTrader 2.5 Nova supports:
- **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin**, and other cryptocurrencies
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities** like gold and oil

Pretty versatile, especially if you want to diversify your trades without using multiple platforms.

## Is AverionTrader 2.5 Nova a Scam?

Honestly, I don’t think so. It works with **regulated brokers**, uses **SSL encryption**, and doesn’t make wild promises (like guaranteeing profits). That’s a good sign.

But like any trading platform, there’s **risk involved**, and profits are never guaranteed. If someone tells you otherwise, they’re probably selling snake oil.

I tested it myself and was able to **withdraw funds** with no shady delays. That said, always start small and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on AverionTrader 2.5 Nova?

To get started, you’ll need to **deposit at least $250**. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this (same as Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge).

The deposit goes to a partnered broker account, which the bot uses to place trades. You can fund it via:
- **Credit/debit cards**
- **Bank transfers**
- **Some e-wallets**

No crypto wallet required to start, which is great for beginners.

### AverionTrader 2.5 Nova Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested both, and response times were decent—within a couple of minutes on chat, and a few hours via email.

They also have a decent FAQ section, but I wish they’d add a bit more detail to their help docs.

## How do you start trading on AverionTrader 2.5 Nova?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official website and enter your basic info—name, email, phone number. No weird questions or long forms.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll be paired with a broker where you’ll need to verify your identity. Once that’s done, deposit your initial $250 to activate your trading bot.

### Step 3: Start Trading

This time around the side effects are kicking me. I’ve gained 30lbs in a year and wake up feeling hungover everyday. 

My therapist thought it might be good to throw in 75mg of Wellbutrin, which I have never taken before. She said it’s “activating” and would help with energy and possibly weight loss.

I talked to a few friends about it and their results seemed very mixed. Anyone who had anxiety as their main complaint seemed to have had a horrible time with the med(agitation and extreme anxiety). My friends with depression/adhd seemed to do a lot better. Obviously I know it’s different for everyone but, I could use some reassurance.

I tend to not do well with “stimulants” and can’t even handle drinking coffee as

I got into drinking coffee 2 years ago and the only coffee drink I like is an iced vanilla latte (sorry to the espresso gurus). I have tried some flavored cold brews that are fine, but I think I mostly only enjoy some sort of sweet iced espresso/milk combo. I don’t drink any hot drinks at all and don’t really see myself changing that.

After doing research in this sub I’m thinking of picking up a DeLonghi Magnifica Evo, from their website, for about $530. This is probably the most I’d want to spend, and I’m in the US.

I’m just trying to replicate my local coffee shop, they make their own syrup but other than that don’t do anything fancy. I can’t replicate anything nearly as good (honestly barely drinkable) with my Nespresso even using homemade syrup and the best milk so after about a year I think I need to upgrade my espresso. I was using the double espresso dolce pods, I guess I could try others before committing… 

My question is does the Evo make sense. Is there something I’m neglecting with cold drinks? I saw a post where someone recommended skipping espresso and going the cold brew + milk route but again I’m really just trying to replicate my favorite coffee shop.

I think the steam wand system will be nice to have if I have guests and want to make them coffee, but it’s lost on me. I guess I just want solid espresso shots and I’m not really interested in the whole operation behind semi-automatic machines.

And out of the entire global population of slaves in 2025, an estimated 75-80% are women. Roughly 54% in forced labor are women and girls. 

Examples of Everyday Items Linked to Forced Labor

-Smartphones and laptops: Cobalt (DR Congo), semiconductors (China, Malaysia)

-Clothing: Cotton (Xinjiang, India, Uzbekistan), sewing factories (Bangladesh, Vietnam)

-Coffee & chocolate: Harvesting (Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana)

-Seafood: Fishing industries in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries

-Construction materials: Bricks and tiles (India, Pakistan)

-Other electronics, textiles, footwear, fishing, agriculture, and mining that are high-risk industries for forced labor.

Many goods are imported from countries with documented labor abuses, especially involving:

-China (e.g., Xinjiang region — cotton, solar panels)

-Bangladesh, Vietnam, India (garments, textiles)

-Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana (cocoa)

-DR Congo (cobalt mining for batteries)

Much of the ""invisible labor"" that sustains economies - caregiving, teaching, medicine & healthcare, computing - has been largely done by women. And much of women's work and credit unfortunately has always been undocumented, unpaid and deliberately suppressed.

I’m trying to remember the name of a browser-based online multiplayer game I used to play in the early 2010s. I think it was Flash-based, but it ran directly in the browser (possibly Shockwave or Unity Web Player too).

Here’s what I recall: 
• Top-down or isometric perspective, with point-and-click movement 
• Fully customizable avatars (not chibi-style, more realistic or stylized). You could buy them or buy clothes themselves I believe. 
• Your username and a custom status/announcement displayed above your character in white chat bubbles. 
• A persistent social world with a main central hub you could walk through 
• You could warp/teleport to different roleplay zones, including: a high school, a coffee shop, a beach or resort area & custom made areas by players 
• You could build and decorate homes or plots of land, with a modular building system where ut almost seemed like you placed posts and connected walls or windows or stairs
 • There was a public chat system, with chat bubbles potentially appearing above avatars or in a side chat
• You could drive vehicles like cars or bikes in some areas 
• The game had a zombie combat area, but zombies were not the main focus—just a side event or minigame where you could fight cartoonish zombies for currency. 
• There was no overarching storyline or quests, more of a sandbox/social environment
 • The game was free to play

I’ve looked through well-known social MMOs like Meez, Woozworld, Club Marian, Free Realms, There.com, and others, but none fully match. I want to say that the logo was white and red.

If anyone remembers a game like this, or has played something similar, please let me know! Even partial memories or links to archived gameplay would be super helpful.

I do have experience in the BDSM & Fem/Findomme scene. Starting off as switch-leaning dominant before fully transitioning to a dominant. SSC, RACK, PRICK, and the 4C’s are crucial to my D/S relationship. If you are not into that, then we will probably not fit well. I am also very big on aftercare and will provide it unless it is made clear that you would rather go without it.

Tribute is NOT mandatory in your approach but your respect is. Do not waste my time. Please feel free to ask questions to see if we will match well as D/S but I will not engage with any kink talk until tribute is paid so that I know you are serious. 

I am interested in a variety of different subs:
-small send/coffee subs
-task subs
-worship subs
-therapy subs
-whale subs
-fincucks
-etc.

But my ideal sub is one that I can build a long lasting D/S relationship with. A sub so enamored by me that it will feel like torture if we go a few days without speaking. I want to be my sub’s siren song that they crave throughout the day. When something bad, sad, important happens on their lives, I want my sub to tell me about it first. To think of me and worship/spoil me from the moment they wake up until they fall asleep. A genuine friendship even outside of the kink aspect. That is my idea sub.

My payment methods are Throne and Cashapp. I will not use any other forms of payment so if you can’t use either then we probably aren’t a good fit☺️.

👑And last but not least Respect, Communication, and Honesty are very important to me. If I cannot trust you to provide those in our D/S relationship then I cannot have you as my sub.👑

If you have read this and feel like we will be a good match then DM me when you are ready to begin. Just don’t keep me waiting for long…😉😈",1,1752128629.0,u_MistresssMulatto,0,1.0,False

People always point to that coffee shop from Friends as an example of a third space but I always assumed that sitcom sets were in public areas to provide more dynamism in the background. No way everyone in the 90s had a barista friend that let them hang around on all the couches for hours.
