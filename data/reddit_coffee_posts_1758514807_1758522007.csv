Tapos may narinig akong sigaw ng babae, yun pala, nasagasaan ko yung aso niya na biglang tumawid. Hindi po ako nakainom, tumambay lang kami ng gf ko sa coffee shop.

Madilim yung kalsada at mahina yung street lights, kaya aninag lang talaga yung nakikita sa gilid ng daan. First time nangyari sa’kin yun kaya sobrang nanginginig ako nung nakita ko yung dog at yung may-ari na iyak nang iyak.

Ni-rush namin yung aso sa nearest vet and thank God wala siyang pilay, namaga lang yung chest niya. Nagbigay din ako ng pera para sa hospital bills.

Pero hanggang ngayon, mula kagabi, hindi mawala sa isip ko yung nangyari. Jusko, ang bigat ng feeling.",1,1758521989.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False
1nnexf5,https://i.redd.it/2jezlfjbsnqf1.png,"I thought I was the perfect wife –They stole my marriage, my dignity, my future... but they don't know that I'm about to take it all back –All Chapters at One Place | Full Story Ready (First Comment Link)”","I thought I was the perfect wife—until I walked into the penthouse in Manhattan and found my husband, Adrian, the golden prince of the Delacroix family, riding another woman.



At that very moment, a decade of love shattered - something darker, colder, and more dangerous was born within me.



They stole my marriage, my dignity, my future... but they don't know that I'm about to take it all back.



……



The elevator chimed softly as it reached the thirty-ninth floor of the Delacroix Tower, our Manhattan fortress of glass and steel. I stepped out, heels clicking against marble, carrying a tray from my favorite French patisserie—an indulgence meant to surprise my husband, Adrian.



Ten years of marriage, and I still believed in surprises. In gestures. In the fantasy that love could be mended with sweetness.



The penthouse was quiet—too quiet. No staff bustling. No music humming from the sound system. Just silence.



“Adrian?” I called, my voice echoing against the vast walls.



No answer.



I set the tray down, slipped off my heels, and padded toward his study. A faint sound reached me—low, breathless laughter. A woman’s laughter.



The world tilted before I even saw them.



Adrian, my husband, the golden prince of the Delacroix family, sat sprawled on the leather couch. His shirt unbuttoned, his tie loose. And draped across his lap was her—a cascade of dark hair, red silk slipping down smooth shoulders, lips pressed against his throat.



My chest clenched. My pulse roared. The air itself seemed to thicken into glass.



Her name surfaced instantly: Juliette Moreau. I had seen her at galas, flashing her perfect smile, a family friend with whispers of ambition clinging to her like perfume.



Now she was in my home. On my husband.



The tray of pastries slipped from my hands, porcelain shattering across the floor. Adrian’s head jerked up, his eyes locking with mine.



Not guilt. Not shock. Just recognition.



“Elena,” he said, his tone maddeningly calm. “You weren’t supposed to be home yet.”



Juliette turned, lipstick smudged, smirk curling. “Oh,” she said lightly, smoothing her dress without shame. “Well. This is… awkward.”



Awkward?



The life I had built, the years I had given, crumbled in a single word.



Before I could speak, another voice cut through the room.



“Better you found out now.”



I turned. And there she was—Vivienne Delacroix. My mother-in-law. The queen of the dynasty. Her diamond necklace glittered like armor, her gaze sharp enough to slice bone.



“You were never meant to carry this family forward,” she said coolly. “Juliette will give us what you cannot—a future. An heir.”



The words landed like daggers. My infertility—the scar I carried in silence—now wielded like a weapon against me.



Juliette leaned against Adrian’s shoulder, victorious. Vivienne’s lips curved, satisfied.



And Adrian? My husband? He said nothing. He just buttoned his shirt, as if I were already irrelevant.



In that moment, something inside me broke.



The Elena they knew—the loyal wife, the woman who still believed in love—died.



What rose in her place was colder. Sharper. A woman who would not be discarded, not by Adrian, not by Juliette, not by Vivienne.



I forced a smile, smooth and perfect. “Of course,” I said softly. “I understand completely.”



Vivienne tilted her head, faint surprise flickering. She expected tears. Rage. Collapse. Instead, I gave her poise.



But behind my smile, fire ignited.



They thought they had ended me.



They had no idea they had just created their worst nightmare.

\## Chapter 2



Morning light spilled across the Delacroix penthouse, gilding every polished surface with a deceptive glow. From the outside, it was paradise: floor-to-ceiling glass, million-dollar art, and the illusion of harmony. But inside, something rotten pulsed beneath the marble floors.



I adjusted the strap of my silk dress in the mirror, forcing my reflection into perfection. Red lips precise, hair glossy, smile fixed. The kind of smile that says: I am fine. I am unshaken.



Downstairs, Juliette lounged on the sofa, draped in one of Adrian’s shirts as if it were a crown. Her bare legs stretched out over the cushions, a glass of green juice in hand. She didn’t even look up as I entered.



“Adrian prefers the curtains open in the morning,” she remarked, gesturing vaguely at the drawn drapes. “You should’ve known that by now.”



My nails bit into my palm. “You’re right,” I said smoothly. I crossed the room and pulled the curtains wide, flooding the space with sunlight that made her flinch. “Better, isn’t it?”



She smirked, but there was a flicker in her eyes—uncertainty. I stored it away like a gem.



By afternoon, I was trailing behind Vivienne Delacroix as she toured the Hamptons estate with her architects.



“The east wing will be remodeled for Juliette,” Vivienne declared, her tone crisp as glass. “A nursery, three bedrooms, staff quarters. Elena, you’ll coordinate with the designers.”



I nodded, jotting notes in a leather notebook. Perfect secretary. Perfect ghost.



“Yes, of course, Vivienne.”



She barely acknowledged me, too busy discussing wallpaper and imported chandeliers. But I wasn’t just writing notes. I was cataloguing every indulgence, every reckless decision. Evidence of greed. Evidence I could twist when the time came.



When Juliette paused to press a hand to her stomach, her smile coy, Vivienne’s eyes softened with pride.



“She’ll give us heirs,” Vivienne said loudly, so I wouldn’t miss a word.



I smiled sweetly, lips sharp as knives. “I hope for your sake it’s true.”



That night, I retreated into the sanctuary no one knew existed. Behind the false back of my walk-in closet lay a hidden room: walls covered with financial maps, contracts pinned with red thread, a web of connections only I understood.



I added a new file—an unsigned contract from Arthur Moreau, Juliette’s father. His company was bleeding money, desperate for a lifeline. I had drafted the lifeline. It looked like salvation, but it was a noose disguised in fine print.



Once he signed, the Moreau family would be in my debt. And debt, I knew, was sharper than any knife.



At dinner, Adrian appeared late, his tie askew, Juliette glowing by his side. He didn’t look at me as he poured himself a drink, didn’t notice the way my smile never faltered.



“Darling,” I said softly, sliding his glass across the table. “I took care of the estate plans today. Everything Juliette wants will be ready.”



Juliette smirked, but Adrian paused, suspicion flickering in his eyes.



“Good,” he said finally, drinking deeply.



They believed I was compliant. They believed I was broken.



But beneath the mask, I was sharpening my blade.



And soon, they would bleed.

\## Chapter 3



The next morning, I arranged lilies in a crystal vase on the breakfast table. Their perfume filled the air—sweet, intoxicating, almost suffocating. I adjusted a stem until it was perfectly aligned, because if my life had collapsed, at least the flowers would obey me.



Juliette swept into the room in a silk robe, her hair cascading like dark satin, her eyes gleaming with the kind of triumph only someone too foolish to fear can wear. She paused just long enough to ensure the staff had gathered within earshot, then pressed a hand against her stomach with theatrical precision.



“I have the most wonderful news,” she announced, her voice ringing like a bell. “Dr. Rutherford confirmed it yesterday. I’m pregnant. With twins.”



Gasps echoed around the room. Forks clattered against china. Even the butler froze.



I smiled, my hands steady as I poured myself coffee. “Twins,” I repeated softly. “How… efficient.”



Juliette preened, mistaking my calm for surrender. “Some women,” she added, her gaze locking on me with deliberate cruelty, “are simply destined for motherhood.”



Her words struck like a blade to the scar I’d carried for years—my infertility, the whispered shame I had endured in silence. For a moment, I thought my mask might crack. But I pressed the recorder in my pocket, its tiny red light glowing like a heartbeat, capturing every venomous syllable.



They would regret underestimating me.



That evening, Vivienne Delacroix presided over a formal dinner in the family’s marble dining hall. The chandeliers blazed, the wine sparkled, the servants moved in choreographed silence.



And Juliette sat beside Adrian, in my chair.



Halfway through the meal, she reached for her glass with exaggerated grace, her bracelet clinking against crystal. With a flick too precise to be an accident, she tipped her hand. Burgundy wine cascaded across the tablecloth, splattering my ivory silk gown.



“Oh dear!” she gasped, her performance flawless. “How clumsy of me. Elena, you really should sit straighter—posture matters so much.”



Laughter rippled from one corner of the table. Vivienne’s lips curved in satisfaction. Adrian didn’t even glance at me.



I dabbed delicately at the stain, lifting my eyes to Juliette with a smile that never touched my soul. “It’s fine,” I said evenly. “Some things can’t be replaced. Others…” I let the pause stretch, long enough for the silence to sharpen. “…are disposable.”



The room stilled. Juliette’s smirk faltered, just slightly. I savored it.



Two nights later, Adrian took me to his private club downtown. The scent of cigars and whiskey clung to the air, the low murmur of powerful men filling the paneled room. I sat quietly, the dutiful wife, sipping champagne while they laughed over stocks and scandals.



After his third glass of scotch, Adrian leaned toward his friend Charles, careless, arrogant, forgetting—or ignoring—that I was within earshot.



“Trading in an old model for a brand-new one,” he chuckled. “Elena was reliable, but Juliette? She’s the Ferrari. And she’ll give me heirs. Real heirs.”



Charles roared with laughter. “Twins, I hear? Impressive.”



Adrian raised his glass, pride oozing from every word. “Proof I made the right choice. Elena knows her place. That’s why she lasted this long.”



My smile never wavered. My hand rested casually on my clutch, where the recorder hummed, capturing every syllable.



They saw only what they wanted: a humiliated wife pretending to endure.



What they missed was the truth.



The mask I wore was not weakness. It was armor.



And soon, I would wield it like a blade.

1nnewht,https://i.redd.it/f0eieuibsnqf1.jpeg,My car will most likely get repossessed tomorrow,"It’s a 2015 Honda Fit whom i love so much, but i owe $13k on it, which truly is not what it’s worth at all. I’m 3 months late on my payment ($900) and I don’t have the means to pay it. Up until today I was convinced I could figure it out, but i have to choose between paying that or paying my rent. I got withdrawn from all 4 of my college classes for nonpayment because I realized too late that I no longer qualify for federal financial aid. So basically I spent the last month cutting back hours at work so I could focus on school, just for that to not even matter! My friend recently had a medical emergency that will prevent him from being able to drive for another 4 months (he is ok!!!) and has already said he would let me use his car so long as I get it an oil change first. That would give me roughly 4 months to figure out how to get my own car. Unfortunately, not having a car isn’t an option. I live in a non walkable area and I work nearly 23 miles from my house. I don’t know how to feel. On one hand, Id be more than happy to not have a $300 car payment looming over my head every month, but on the other…..my family is going to be so disappointed in me. I just wanted to rant to someone who would understand and not judge me too harshly. 

I’m open to advice on what you would do in my situation. I’m 27 and I have horrible credit. I make anywhere from $1600-2000 a month and I pay $1100 in rent. I’ve had all subscriptions cancelled for months now, I make all my meals and coffees at home, yada yada.

Reviewing transactions I see a third transaction (€6.60) for the same coffee shop chain but 3km away from the location of the other two legitimate transactions. Clicked the Map function and it shows a clothes shop not a coffee shop. I was not in this location at any time. Also transaction is listed as happening at 4.11pm and I have one coffee a day in the morning and never at 4pm. I can't figure it out, nothing makes sense on this tranaction

Tried to do a charge back on Revlout and it asks me why I haven't reported this to the police. Explained that but then to complete the charge back it says my card will be terminated. But I obviously need it for holidays so can't do this. 

Wondering what's the best thing to do. My Rev account is basic so I can't talk or chat to anyone as far as I can see. Can I charge it back in 2 weeks time when I return home or would that be deemed 'too late, tough'. Should I just terminate the card in case of further fraud?

After a week of combing through RW, Thursday, Grant Stone, Luos Jiet and a few others, I have managed to make… no decisions.

I mostly work indoors, and I can get away with pretty casual attire (usually jeans and flannel about 8 months of the year) though it does rain a lot here.  I wear a lot of black, dark indigo, grey, with colour in the flannel or patterned shirts.  I’m aiming probably for something in black or a dark brown (Thursday’s Mustang and Black Coffee caught my eye) or something like Grant Stone’s crimson or dark burgundy kudu, or crimson CXL.  Nothing too light in colour, in other words. I’m not fully sold on the Red Wing Copper rough and tough - but I could probably be persuaded.  Ideally I’d love something that goes well with black AND dark indigo denim.  I’m really torn about style - my first instinct were cap toe IR/Captain/Garrison styles, but honestly some of the plain and moc toes look fantastic too, which leaves me exactly… nowhere. 

My only restriction is price (you’ve likely noticed, given the makers I mentioned).  Like yes, I could go with Viberg - they’re even local, but I’m a firmly middle class suburban dad - it’s just not happening.

1nneprk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuySmartHQ/comments/1nneprk/are_pod_coffee_makers_wasteful/,Are pod coffee makers wasteful?,"The debate over whether pod-based coffee systems are wasteful is nuanced and requires looking at both environmental and practical factors. From a professional perspective, the answer depends on which dimension of ""waste"" is being considered — material waste, energy use, or resource efficiency.

From a material standpoint, the single-serve pod has historically been criticized because of its plastic and aluminum composition. Early-generation pods were difficult to recycle, leading to billions ending up in landfills. However, manufacturers have made strides: many leading brands now produce fully recyclable or compostable pods. For example, aluminum capsules from certain manufacturers can be returned in bulk for recycling, and some third-party brands use biodegradable bioplastics that break down under industrial composting conditions. Still, the responsibility often falls on the consumer to follow proper disposal protocols, which limits the actual recycling rate in practice.

When we examine energy and water usage, pod systems often perform better than traditional drip coffee makers. Single-serve brewers heat only the amount of water needed for each cup, reducing standby energy losses. A study from the University of Quebec found that single-serve coffee systems can have a lower overall environmental impact per cup compared to drip coffee, mainly because they minimize overproduction and reduce wasted coffee grounds. Brewing a full pot and letting half go cold — a common occurrence — can result in a higher carbon footprint per serving than using pods.

There is also the issue of coffee supply chain efficiency. Pods are pre-measured, which means less coffee is wasted due to incorrect dosing or spoilage. For offices or households where coffee consumption varies throughout the day, pod machines can be a resource-efficient solution, preventing leftover coffee from being discarded.

In summary, pod coffee makers can be considered wasteful if their capsules are not recycled or composted properly, but they can also be more resource-efficient when measuring waste in terms of energy, water, and unused coffee. For the environmentally conscious user, selecting brands with proven recycling programs or compostable options, and consistently following through with proper disposal, is essential to mitigating their impact.",1,1758521163.0,BuySmartHQ,0,1.0,False
1nnepfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sanjaypancholi/comments/1nnepfn/5_natural_secrets_for_long_lasting_hairs/,5 Natural secrets for long lasting hairs,"A 26 year old boy once came to me for consultation. He said sir I lose more than 100 hairs every single day and slowly I am going bald. He had already tried everything, oils, shampoos, serums, even multivitamins, but nothing worked. That is when he realized one important truth. It does not matter how many products you apply, if your lifestyle is poor and unbalanced, your hair fall is guaranteed.

**What Science Says**

Almost 90 percent of hair thinning and baldness cases happen because of genetics and hormones. But there are still some habits that are in our control. If we follow them properly, we can maintain our density, keep hair thicker and stronger. The best part is, these five habits are free and anyone can do them.

**The 5 Habits That Actually Matter**

**1. Sleep**  
When you are in deep sleep, the body releases growth hormones that repair and grow hair roots. If your sleep is disturbed, these hormones reduce and hair fall increases. Poor sleep also raises cortisol, the stress hormone, which makes hair thinner. That is why during exams or stressful times, many people suddenly notice more shedding. To avoid this, focus on 8 to 9 hours of quality sleep, and cut down on late night phone use, heavy meals or TV before bed.

**2. Diet**  
Hair is made of keratin protein, so if your diet lacks protein, your hair will become weak and brittle. Include eggs, paneer, curd, dals, sprouts and milk in your daily food. Along with protein, you also need iron, zinc and B vitamins which you can get from spinach, nuts and seeds like chia or pumpkin. On the other hand, junk food, colas, chips, burgers and too much tea or coffee block nutrient absorption and disturb hormones.

**3. Exercise**  
Oil alone cannot improve your hair. Your scalp also needs good blood circulation. Exercise improves blood flow to the roots and releases happy hormones that reduce stress and push hair into the growth phase. Cardio, yoga and weight training all help in different ways. Even 30 minutes a day is enough. Avoid extreme workouts, creatine or steroids as they can disturb hormones and worsen hair fall.

**4. Mental Peace**  
Stress is one of the biggest hidden reasons for hair loss. High stress increases cortisol and reduces serotonin, which weakens blood supply to roots and pushes hair into the shedding phase. In some cases, 100 to 300 hairs can fall in a single episode of stress. The solution is simple, laugh more, practice meditation or yoga, try deep breathing, and spend time in activities that calm your mind.

**5. Toxic Trio**  
The last factor is the toxic trio, pollution, smoking and alcohol. These three are silent killers for hair. Smoking narrows blood vessels and cuts oxygen supply to the roots. Alcohol dehydrates the body and blocks nutrients like zinc and biotin. Pollution increases free radicals, which damage cells and disturb hormones. Long exposure to these three makes hair thin, weak and even turns them grey early.

**Final Thoughts :-**

If you really want to save your hair, do not depend only on shampoos or oils. Focus on these five simple lifestyle habits, sleep, diet, exercise, mental peace and avoiding the toxic trio. These are the real foundations of healthy hair.",1,1758521131.0,u_sanjaypancholi,0,1.0,False

1nneerl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Digman2/comments/1nneerl/i_did_not_like_the_season_2_finale_what_did_you/,I did not like the season 2 finale.... What did you guys think?,"I know it's already been like a month since the finale aired, but I've been wanting to write about this for a while now because the more I think of the finale, the more I think about just how bad this episode was. I'm curious to know what others think or if anyone agrees with me on this. I really like Digman and was willing to overlook it's flaws because of how entertaining and exciting the show was. This finale just felt like the culmination of the show's flaws that it previously overcame in the past episodes. This finale felt poorly paced, which is something the show usually handles very well. Even though the pacing can be a bit excessive in the show at times, I usually was able to overlook it because it allows them to do a lot of fun and interesting things in the story without feeling to overstuffed. But in this episode every other scene is the characters just going to a new location just to move the plot forward all for just one small detail, like going to Quail's place, Rip going to the coffee shop, and the area for the christ figure. It just goes from one scene to the next and unlike other episodes, it feels like the episode can't take a long enough break to give us some scenes with the characters or to let the story sink in, or any real room to breathe. I hate how the second act immediately begins by showing a flashback of Rip, Bella, and Zane stealing the christ figure and they immediately reveal that this random little girl was the villain Vindita. The twist has no impact because we barely met the character in the same scene. Why not just show the flashback at the beginning of the episode so it has a better flow? That way we can have the scene of Rip giving the little girl the coin and then later you reveal it was Vindetta. At least that way they can have a little build up to a plot twist in context of the episode. She's trying to kill our main characters for god's sake, give the scene some scope. I think this episode would've been better if it just took place in the church and focused more on the conflict and action aspect of it, instead of wasting time by having the entire second act revolve around finding the christ figure. What's the point of having them find it if she was just gonna lock them up anyways? It wasn't even of any consequence they immediately break out and then Bella encourages everyone to fight back like 'We're the greatest arkys for a reason!' Why didn't they just that before? They have the numbers. The last thing I hate about this episode is the twist ending. Rip's sacrifice shocked me when I initially saw it, but unlike other fans I wasn't saddened by what happened to him. I was stunned by how ridiculously over the top this scene was. Like honestly, all of this buildup for that? Rip sacrificing himself and paralleling Jesus Christ? It feels so random and comes completely out of nowhere. The tension felt completely non existent in this episode, and there was no indication that this was what the climax was gonna build up to. It felt so melodramatic and completely overblown for a story that felt incredibly lackluster and it all basically built up to Rip acting like he was Jesus Christ. It was major letdown and felt way to overdramatic for this show's standards, like it gave too much scope to this scene to the point where it just feels out of place. Honestly I can go on and on about every little thing that bothers me about this episode, but I'll sum it up with this. This show has a lot of flaws that turned some people off of this show. That's fine, I get that this show isn't for everyone. But what I like about this show was that it used it's flaws to it's advantage and made generally entertaining show that had a lot of heart and soul put into it beyond trying to make you laugh. It stood out amongst the other comedy central shows in more ways than one and that's what made it so unique. It really makes me sad that this finale dropped the ball so hard and exhibited all of those negative traits that people criticized the show for, the same traits the show successfully overcame in the past. What happened here? I'll fully admit that this wasn't the worst episode of the show, I still hate A Sari Sight way more, but this is still the most disappointing episode of the show and I can't help but get upset whenever I think about how they took so many good ideas in this one and made such an underwhelming mess of a storyline out of it. But what do you guys think? Did you like or hate the finale? What did you think of my points? Thanks for reading.",2,1758520059.0,Digman2,0,1.0,False

It's been >6 months since my last review (previous posts: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1jbng0d/0_yoe_me_grad_w_9_months_experience_in_nuclear/)  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1jhtc1p/0_yoe_revised_recent_meche_graduate_seeking_an/)  [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1joow3a/0_yoe_2nd_revision_recent_mechanical_graduate/))...and now that I've reviewed a few dozen resumes myself, I'd like to ask a favor in fine-tuning my current one.

*Stats:*  
\- 85 apps  
\- 53 denials  
\- 6 phone screens  
\- 3 interviews: Pratt & Whitney (RTX), Rolls-Royce, Boom Supersonic (internship lol)  
\- 1 ""coffee chat"" w/ someone @ a top aero startup who allegedly forwarded my resume to recruiter

**What roles are you targeting?**  
Level 2 Design or Structures Engineer roles. Primary interest is in propulsion/gas-turbines, but since that's modestly niche I'm open to general aerostructures & aviation-related component design roles.

Was previously targeting propulsion cycle analysis roles (i.e., aerothermal or compressible flow), which was actually what my Rolls-Royce interview was for...but I don't foresee me getting any future aerothermal interviews.

**Employment & Job-Hunting Situation?**  
US citizen working full-time in nuclear ☢ industry and doing AE master's part time. Current role is analysis heavy & I get 0 design experience, which was a big drawback in my Pratt & Whitney interview (the panel directly asked about it).

My official title is `Mechanical Engr`, but I've got several valid job titles that I use depending on the role I apply to: `Component Engr`, `Structures Engr`, `Stress Engr`, etc. **Every** resume I submit is tailored via the objective statement and skills section.

I've connected w/ a few recruiters and managers on LinkedIn, but no leads thru that yet.

**Why seeking help? Any particular section?**  
Fine-tuning. I've got a decent call-back rate, but want to further improve. Questions:

1. Now that I've got > 1 YoE and I'm focused on structural/design roles, *is the objective statement still useful?* I originally put it there to clarify my intent to pivot, and I adjust it w/ every app.
2. Should I move `Education` below `Experience` or `Projects` so it doesn't seem like I'm a full-time grad student? Had 1 phone screen and 1 cold email contact assume I was even though it's obvious I work full-time.
3. I'd like to emphasize that some of the components I analyze are made of high-temp, corrosion resistant alloys, which are also used the hot sections of gas turbines and could catch a recruiter/managers eyes. *I've partly done this already...any suggestions on how better to implement?*
4. Since June, I'd been using a 2-pager that includes 3 propulsion-focused projects and 2 publications, but I'm switching back to a 1-pager for design/structures roles. *Correct move or no?* I figured the extra propulsion projects would help signal background knowledge about gas-turbines, but I don't have room for 'em.
5. I got crushed in my Pratt interview since they kept pushing me further & further on the ""`tell me about a time you handled conflict`"" question. I used the `STAR` method in responding, but in hindsight I was a bit light in the `AR` part of it. *Is there a way I can respond in a way that will satisfy the panel on the first go?*

We’d like to either stay in one place the whole time or possibly switch to a second location half way through. Our goal is to get a somewhat locals experience and not have it be a typical vacation packed with checklist of things to do. We want to experience the culture and town, find a go to coffee shop, grocery store, etc. In addition to spending time in the town, we also want to take mini vacations and explore, so love the idea of someplace central or near a lot of cities or an international airport. 

Ideal wishlist:
- English speaking/American friendly 
- A town in or near a large metropolitan area
- Within an 1 or so from an international airport
- Safe
- Cute town☺️
- Somewhat affordable
- Nice mild weather 

Bonus
- Walkable
- Near water

Areas we’re considering:
- Somewhere in Portugal (heard it gets pretty touristy)
- Neighborhood in Amsterdam (been here a lot already so want to explore new spot)
- Copenhagen (worried it’s too expensive)
- Malmo (worried about weather or too far off beaten path)

Thanks in advance to those who have some advice for us! ",0,1758519839.0,Europetravel,6,0.5,False

My bf & I have been really in love and attracted to each other. But in March I fell sick, got to visit emergency every 2 days sick so it was bad. I had couple of infections & body was way too weak.

Thing is my bf & I couldn’t meet coz of my studies and then later I went on some religious trips. He got super busy with his exams.

Few days back, his centre of exam was near my location. He took his exam & left without meeting me.

I had exam was day after that day & I was hoping he would call me & we will meet for a coffee or something.

I wanted him to feel like to meet me on his own accord. I didn’t want to nudge or create a need. But he just didn’t bother at all. He took his test, didn’t call me & went straight to his home.

Well, truth be told that exam was big deal and i get that he might just have wanted to feel free and relax.

But deep down this is bothering me. Now we both are free and we are planning to meet but something inside me tells me this relationship isn’t worth jumping the hoops over.

He is gentle and caring but he is not nuanced or perceptive. He has emotional depth of a 7 year old and I’m double PHD when it comes to being emotionally perceptive & mature in general.

I need some advice guys. Thank u for reading all this and I would really appreciate your insight.

Tldr bf didn’t visit me for 6 months after i fell sick. He recently came close to my location but didn’t drop by. I’m having 2nd thoughts about our relationship. Need advice. ",2,1758519756.0,relationships,3,0.75,False

It is Day 23 of no nicotine. I started smoking and chewing when I was 16 years old, and I'm now in my late-20s. I'm feeling overall very good, and am enjoying experiencing the world, in some ways, for the very first time.




The only thing that's really giving me a hard time and triggering cravings is that I feel very unfocused and foggy brained. I'm a teacher and a writer, so being able to focus on what I'm doing is a big deal for me, and I can't afford to just wait it out for a few months. Drinking some coffee made it better, but I'm physically full of energy (more than ever!) already, so if I overdo it on coffee I'll just get fidgety and anxious.



Anyone have a similar experience? Know why it's happening or how to make it better? I've normally been going on walks in the afternoon as a way to stay focused and get a natural dopamine boost, but it's raining today, so I can't, haha. ",3,1758519644.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Galatasaray vs. Konyaspor: A Turkey Trot of Triumph and Trauma**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s crunch numbers like a stadium full of squirrels at a nut sale. Galatasaray is priced at **1.18 (FanDuel)** for a win, implying a **84.7% chance** of victory. Konyaspor? A staggering **12.0** implies they’re about as likely to win as me understanding my cable bill—**8.3%**. The draw sits at **6.5 (15.4%)**, which feels generous given these teams’ history.

Galatasaray’s dominance? They’ve won **35 of 48** meetings, including a **6-0 thrashing** in 2007 that probably left Konyaspor questioning their life choices. This season, Galatasaray is a fortress: 15 goals scored, 1 conceded, and a **100% record** in the league. Konyaspor, meanwhile, has lost five of six matches since March 2023—proof that even turkeys can’t escape a long winter.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Rotations, and a Dash of Drama**  
Galatasaray’s recent **5-0 start** is as flawless as a Turkish coffee (if coffee could be flawless). But their Champions League loss to Eintracht Frankfurt? A speed bump, not a catastrophe. Coach Okan Buruk plans to shuffle the deck, resting some starters and reinstating three players from the Frankfurt match. Key scorers like **Mauro Icardi** and **Barış Alper Yılmaz** are presumably sharpening their boots, while **Eren Elmalı** chases his third goal of the season.

Konyaspor’s plight is comical in its despair. They’ve lost six straight, with their last victory coming in March 2023—**over 18 months ago**. Their 2021 **4-3 win** over Galatasaray feels like a distant memory, like a dream wh

First is it is along the train line along the Connecticut shoreline, just east of New Haven. Rod would have taken this train himself many times in his early career to and from New York. Next, it's a small town, and a quaint, and charming one. Like much of New England. 

But it's also where Willoughby's cafe is. This is a very small chain of 4 cafes in Connecticut, the most quintessential being in Madison, and I can't imagine the owners weren't inspired by the Twilight Zone. If you ever get a chance to go to Willoughby, I mean Madison, you'll know where to get coffee, and feel right where you belong.

I currently have this [DeLonghi ](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/delonghi-all-in-one-cappuccino-espresso-coffee-maker-15-bar-pump-stainless-steel-0435273p.html)machine, which I've had for close to five years. It's starting to fail so I'm doing some research into what to get next. 

In terms of what I'm looking for, I'm just looking for the espresso machine itself, I'm not really looking for anything that's two in one or all in one anymore since I hardly ever used anything other than the espresso maker.

Milk frother is optional, I hardly used it, although part of the reason was that the frother that came with this machine wasn't very good for latte art, which was something I was interested in doing.

Built in grinder is optional as well, but if it were to come with one, I'd like for it to be easy to clean and ideally be accurate with the espresso grind. I once bought one in the past, but it didn't actually achieve all the grind sizes that it said it did, so I only used it for a short period of time

Budget wise I put $500 but don't have a set one at the moment, since this is the kind of thing I won't buy again until it breaks I'm more open to spending more for it but I'm also not looking for something super fancy; maybe something that's more in the mid range. I do want to avoid overspending though if it's going to be pricey I want it to be for a good reason not just because of the brand or whatever ",1,1758518956.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'm missing the back teeth on the upper and the lower and what's left of the top teeth are starting to fall apart. Chipped broke off rotted even had what was called oral thrush they gave me medication twice so far had a couple people like warts on my tongue not sure if it really fully went away. This time don't know if that's part of having bad dental, hygiene but it probably is.


So anyways, I was just kind of looking for some insight on what my next steps would be. I kind of don't look so attractive with messed up teeth. I'd imagine from all the years of smoking blunts filled with marijuana and drinking coffee and soda probably didn't help. I don't really drink a lot of soda now I mostly drink coffee. One intern lady at my dentist pretty much said that coffee isn't that bad for your teeth really even if it's black. 


Clearly they have suffered abuse. When I was younger  I would twist  off soda caps with my teeth bite fishing string instead of cutting it rip open plastic bags! Put my teeth like candy bags instead of pulling them open. I'm sure some of that didn't help either. When you got brittle teeth and you start biting on things you don't need to. 

I didn't really see myself as a big soda drinker because didn't really have a lot of money growing up, but maybe I drank more than I thought. I mostly just smoked weed for years.

Anyways, I'll provide a couple pictures. Hopefully I can get something done to help me. I feel like at times I can barely chew on steak or any kind of meat if it's too tough can  barely chew on anything that's hard if I chew on something crunchy it's hard to break it down if I try to eat some nuts out of a can, it seems like pieces of it are not broke down and it's like I'm going to choke. If I swallow it or whatever just get a little piece stuck in my throat which can be annoying. 

One time like a year or two ago I was eating a tuna fish sub and I went to take a bite and the bread didn't break down that good and I swallowed and it was kind of like a round ball. It basically got stuck in my throat and I was choking. 

Luckily I found some water in the back of my car that was old, an old bottle of water and I was able to open it up and splash some in my mouth and it was able to help me loosen up piece of bread and it got unstuck. 


I will provide a couple of pics.

and oh my god. even with the same machine, beans, water and puck prep after figuring out the right setting there is such an big difference. the espresso is cleaner, sweeter and tasted generally much better.

I was ready for some differences, but not this extreme (in a positive way), since the K6 is already a good grinder going by all reviews and tests

is that just the difference between conical vs flat burrs? or has the df54 a better grind consistency? I swear, I feel again like back then when I started the deep dive from instant to real (and good) coffee lol",2,1758518634.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

A big bulk of the cost is the average Miscellaneuos expenses for each voter needed to win which was computed at P100 (not even the entire population) for items such as snacks, coffee, softdrinks, etc for one speech each Brgy, and not even paying myself during this 30-day campaign period. And no radio or TV Ads, and no social media boosting as I feel I can get those organically, and with your support.

Fuel I computed at P100 per Brgy (it could also be fare, Jeepney, e-Bike), one tarp each Brgy which I can hang on a house or establishment of a supporter, for free.

Assuming I win, my lone term would be a net loss of P9,423,346

I received the first three at the start of June, and the last two in middle of August. Being a student in a management school (AC classes and halls to preserve the scent during daytime - you can draw parallels to anoffice environment), I wanted two freshies (one blue and one green) and a playful evening fragrance. I reached out to more than 10 people of this sub (both reviewers and sellers)- many of whom helped me with my choice.

Afnan 9PM Rebel 9/10 7+ hours  
Very loud, announces your arrival. Think pineapple cotton candy opening that settles down to a caramel, musk and spicy musky drydown. 2 sprays are enough because it starts off very synthetic and very very loud. Better people than me can discuss if it is a Aventus+BR540 baby or a better QAF. An addictive fragrance that makes you keep sniffing your wrists.  
The seller (Whiff Culture) recommended this to me after I had already decided on the Dylan Blue and Suqraat. [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Afnan/9-PM-Rebel-99238.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Afnan/9-PM-Rebel-99238.html)

Versace Dylan Blue 8/10 4+ hours  
Safe blue freshie. Very corporate. An expensive bodywash that leaves you smelling clean. Starts off as citrusy talcum, drydown smells like a piece of wood that has been left at the sea shore. very versatile, but doesn't project as much after the first half hour or so (turns into a skin scent).

Lattafa Suqraat 6/10 4+ hours  
Pushing for a ADG Profumo (RIP) clone made me buy this. While the ADG base is present (smoky woody green), it doesn't resemble the Profumo until you spray it more than 6 times and you tell yourself that it does. The drydown is a lavender moss peppery scent. Other than my bias, it's a great starter pack perfume. Very versatile but weak. again, doesn't project well. Almost couldn't smell it after I had to travel by bike for half an hour.

Rayhaan Lion 10/10 8+ hours  
JPG Ultra male is a top three perfume for me, and this is a 1 to 1 replica for me. I was pushing for a Afnan 9PM and the seller and their whatsapp channel told me to get this instead. Smells like a million bucks straight out of the box - pear, citrus and lavender that forms a cloud around you that everyone wants to be in (2-3 sprays). The dry down has vanilla and amber. It's a very ""comfortable"" scent and you keep feeling better about yourself because of the insane projection  (keeping in mind it hasn't fully macerated yet). Always gets complements. Will buy a full bottle soon. [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rayhaan/Lion-105031.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rayhaan/Lion-105031.html)

Liquid Brun 7/10 7+ hours  
Very cloying in the day time, not yet macerated enough to distinguish properly. Think of it as a toasted vanilla marshmallow being dipped into coffee infused with orange. Will be a great winter scent. Opening is very synthetic for now. The depth isn't yet evident but the fragrance is very interesting to say the least - you'll feel like you're stepping into a Moroccan cafe with an in-house bakery. Great longevity (will smell it on your clothes the next day). Also haven't tested much because it's a 10 ML decant.

1nndwon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nndwon/aitah_for_cutting_my_friend_off_after_her_birthday/,AITAH for cutting my friend off after her birthday ?,"so my friend has been going through a rough time. in our friendship im usually the one who holds the financial burden when it comes to outings and i felt bad that this birthday she was facing a lot of stress of possibly getting evicted and also quit her job to work on her mental health. her boyfriend is also jobless and trying to find places to work. 

so a week before i am supposed to visit, she quits her job to work on her mental health because she claims shes burnt out and the stress of work is too much. now they have no income. i decide to be generous, i tell her i can fund the activities were going to be doing. we create a schedule of things to do, things were going to buy for the trip. 

im more proactive about the budget and i put down that were buying groceries for the food we will cook there, listing possible ingredients for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the first and second day ill be there. i also list my ubers and the shrooms we agreed to get for her birthday. my flight leaves at 6:40 am the third day so i told her i wouldnt do too much on the second night besides buy the uber. we agree on a schedule:

day 1:
buy the groceries and alcohol, buy the shrooms and weed, cook at home.
day 2: 
buy more weed if needed, cook at home, maybe drink a little before i go. 
day 3: uber and leave

i charted every possible expense and i asked her how much everything would be. she doesnt give me straight answers and im left to guess how much everything is. the thing is, i live in cook county where things are very expensive while she lives in a rural area. so i estimated how much everything would be based on chicago prices. everything added up together was 560. i told her that id like to not spend that much and the goal is for me to spend less than that. 

she doesnt tell me how much the items on the list and schedule are, she just says that everything will be cheaper. she says the budget looks good and under 500 is a good range. 

i come over and we go to a bookstore where her boyfriend offers to buy me a coffee. im kinda surprised because she emphasized to me before coming that they both had 0 dollars to their name and that theyre focused on rent. 

this hits me weird because he agrees to get her a lemonade there and i turn down the drink but ask him to buy the uber instead, since he has money hes willing to spend on a drink and id rather it be on the uber. the uber is only $8. 

we get to the grocery store and in my head im thinking about the list of ingredients i put down and im thinking we will only get those. she buys 2 of every thing listed, massive portions. her boyfriend is also asking to buy extra things like caramel apples. i say i want to see how much it is at the end. in the end the things i ended up buying for her were: 

6 boxes of uncooked pasta, 2 bulk packs of buldok, 8 shaker things of seasoning, a whole rotisserie chicken, 2 cake batters, 2 whole frosting cups, 5 lemons, 1 block of cheese, 5 whole packs of shredded cheese, heavy whipping cream, 4 sticks of butter, pads for her period, and a cheese grater. 

a lot of these arent on the list, im kinda scared because im thinking of chicago prices. i ask about the amount of food and all she really says is that its part of the recipe and itll be under 100. 

im kinda hoping it is but the cart is so much fuller than i wanted it to be and i decide its fine, at least we can eat this food while im here and i dont need to worry about buying more food. 

we end up not buying alcohol because the place doesnt sell hard liquor. we check out and the total is $92. im feeling relieved, that even the excess things we buy are still under the estimated price for this run. she never said thank you, only said “see i told you its under 100”

she says we should get the alcohol. i ask what place we can go, and say we have dairy products so id rather go back first. she says we should get it all now so we can be done. when she tells me this she says that the liquor store is within walking distance. so im thinking we dont need to uber. 

i ask her boyfriend if he can uber himself to his place and then put away the groceries while me n her walk to the store. he says the store needs an uber there and back and we should get an uber thatll make two stops. and also working in that his phone died and he needs me to buy all the ubers. 

theres just too many factors, i decide ill call an uber to bring it to her place and we put the groceries away and get the shrooms. saying we can get the alcohol early tomorrow. 

we get the uber and go back to the place. we go to the smoke shop after and im ready to buy the shrooms for us. its a lot and i say, i want her boyfriend to be sober because ive done shrooms before and i freak out before i settle and i need to have someone sober to watch us. he keeps saying some shit like, “theres bugs crawling under your skin” ; “theres a demon in the house” 

i tell him to shut up because he shouldnt say that to people who are tripping and its fucked up. he says he really wants to be high too and pushed to also trip with us. i humor him and say if were having a good trip you can have some. in my head i know im going to be anxious and hes not taking my reasoning. my friend isnt defending my point either. 

so i buy the shrooms. we cook one of the bulk
packets of buldok. 5 of the packets are in one bulk. i cook it for us, she makes cupcakes, her bf shreds the rotisserie chicken for the pasta were going to eat for dinner. we eat our lunch, buldok. i ask her if we should cook the pasta first, which she says shell be fine to cook on shrooms. shes done shrooms before so i dont question it. 

we take the shrooms. i take 1.4 g she takes 2.5 g. we feel it pretty fast and she laughs so hard she pees herself. shes just non stop laughing and her boyfriend is also loud with her. i keep telling them im anxious and its loud but they dont pick up what im saying at all. and she just keeps laughing.

he picks her up and takes her to the bathroom. im left alone in their room just hearing all of this loud noise in the distance and im shaking and not feeling good. i tell her boyfriend to call mine so i can have someone to ground me and he does. i tell my boyfriend i want to be outside and its too crowded and im feel trapped and scared. 

he talks me through putting in my ear plugs and then when her boyfriend finally comes back we agrees to let us go outside. 

when were outside its bright and warm and i instantly feel better. i sit by a tree and look at the leaves in the wind and play a song that always helps me feel better. 

my friend falls on the floor is is demanding to have more of the stuff and so is her boyfriend. he says he wants to be high and i tell him to wait because his girlfriend isnt doing so good. i zone out and try to chill out by watching the leaves and rubbing one on my face. 

i tune back in and i hear that her boyfriend took 3. im kinda salty because he didnt ask and he said he would trip sit us. but i just want to be outside. 

eventually they say we should go inside. i disagree and say i cant because it feels so crowed. her bf says he would then have to leave me alone and i would get bugs on me and i could fall or something. i dont want to be alone so i finally go inside. 

inside i start feeling anxious immediately and i try to find audios i can listen to so i can feel less trapped. i settle on playing morning bird calls. 

im sitting on the bed watching the walls move and their cat comes in and i lay next to him and honestly my memory goes blank here. 

when im back i see her grab the cat by the scruff and they put the cat in the living room. my friend says she took more, idk how much but probably the rest of the stash. she asks if i want more and i say no not yet and she finishes it. 

i ask about if she can cook to which she says she doesnt want to cook. says she wants to take molly and get more high. i say its a bad idea, not wanting to be rude and point out she already peed herself. her boyfriend asks his friend if he had molly and shes saying we both want some. 

i frequent raves and i did molly a month ago so i turn it down. she keeps pushing for us to take more stuff and shes giggling about how she finally feels relaxed. 

they cant get more drugs until tomorrow and i say lets just wait this one out until we can cook the food. my friend says we should just order. i say what if jake cooks the pasta, she says hes going to burn the house down. i say we should finish out bowls of buldok, she just turns down everything. 

she starts saying she wants burgers. then she talkd about how we can doordash mcdonalds. i say lets wait a bit longer till u sober up more. she says we should smoke the joint. i again say we should wait. 

both her and her boyfriend say lets smoke the joint and he gets a cup filled with water. i say its a bad idea and they both keep pushing for us to smoke. so i give in because it feels like im being singled out. and we smoke half of the joint. i put it away after my friend lies on her back and starts demanding food. i say lets wait a bit longer till we can cook. 

her boyfriend brings us grapes. we eat the grapes. she demands more food. i say lets eat the cupcakes we made. shes eating cupcakes then starts crying about how shes eating like a pig and says she wants real food. 

i feel bad because i dont want her to cry so i hand her my phone to order something from a pizza place. we talk about a pizza. she hands me my phone back. 

i see she ordered 2 things of crazy bread, 6 dipping sauces, and 1 large pizza with 8 toppings. she pressed pay before she handed it to me. im thinking okay shes high. at least we will eat all of it. 

she says we should smoke the rest of the joint. both of them start chanting for the joint so i feel like i have to light it. im worried because theyre both fucked up and im not in the place to baby sit.

but we smoke the rest of the joint. as the food is on the way, her boyfriend keeps looking at the door saying there’s something outside. i keep telling him not to say that shit and he keeps saying hes got a third eye. im freaking out inside, i do believe in that stuff and he doesnt stop looking at the door. 

i get ip and close the door. tell him hes ruining the vibe and im scared. he says he can take care of it and lights incense and walks around the house frantically darting in and out of the room. im praying inside, my friend is just there giggling. shes eating her plate which i set up for her. 1 slice of pizza and 4 bread sticks. shes just eating and on her phone. eventually she falls asleep. 

its just me in the dark. i cant sleep, im scared. but her boyfriend finally comes back. we talk about their relationship and he opens up about how he always feels like shes mad at him. i give him advice on anxiety.

he asks about alcohol, i say i spent the budget on the pizza and he doesnt fight it. just says we should smoke tomorrow. 

i wake up the next morning. my friend is cooking. she walks in with plates of pasta and we eat. as we eat i say i want to shower, her boyfriend mentions we should get weed. i ask if i can zelle him to go pick up the stuff. he doesnt have a bank account so i download an app he can use. i send him money for the 2 joints. 

after my shower i smoke with him, my friend is napping. we talk about the open mic night later in the day that were going to. i fall asleep watching a youtube video. 

my friend wakes me up and says that we might miss the mic night. i ask if we can still go. she agrees and then we get ready. 

before we go, i notice that their cat peed in my shoes, and i look around the living room and i dont see a litter box anywhere. il they cant afford to wash it and they just kinda stare at me. i say ill just pay for it to get cleaned and its fine. 

we leave for book store. we smoke the last joint on the way to the book store with the open mic night. when we’re inside, i ask her boyfriend to get us water thinking he would get a cup of water. he gets a bottled water for him, me, and another lemonade for my friend. 

im having fun, but the meeting was short so i go to the craft table. my friend goes to the counter talking about a snack. they come back and sit on the couch as i make a card to bring back to my boyfriend. 

as im making the card she talks about wanting sushi. i mention that we could eat the second pasta i got ingredients for. she says that the portion of pasta she made is too big for her to want to make a second batch. i ask if she could make a smaller portion than the other one. she says no. she really wants sushi and wants to enjoy her birthday weekend. 

i ask her if we could eat any of the other foor i already bought, the pizza, the pasta, the buldok. shes having none of it. she says we should go bc theyre closing and as were walking out she keeps pushing for sushi. saying its a good idea. 

i say if we get sushi can your boyfriend pay? her boyfriend says he only has $4. she looks at me expectantly. im sober now so i dont give in and i tell her, “if its okay with you guys i dont want to spend anymore money today.”

she says its fine. and her energy and mood shifts. i ask if she wants to walk around down town, she says no. i ask if she wants to watch a movie, she says no. i ask her if shes okay, she says shes fine. i ask if shes tired, she said no shes just not feeling the vibe. 

i stop trying to talk to her and i just kinda sit with the feeling that shes mad at me for saying no to sushi. in my head this isnt the plan we agreed to. 

her boyfriend tries to get her to do something, saying im leaving at 3am. we should do something together. we get to the house and she lays in bed not talking or facing us and watched tiktoks. 

me and her boyfriend discuss movies to watch and we try to include her but she keeps saying stuff like, “you guys can watch.” “you guys can do that” “i just want to watch tiktoks right now”

the energy is so tense. i dont know why shes being like this theres so much food we could have and i want us to stick to the schedule and budget. 

we sit there in silence for 6 hours. every so often i would ask if shes okay and she would say the same things: “im fine.“ “im not tired, im just not feeling the vibe” “im just watching tiktoks“

so i start texting my boyfriend, im complaining because i dont know anyone here and im anxious i dont know why shes mad at me. i think shes mad because i didnt get her sushi. etc. 

i ask her boyfriend if he can ask his friend to smoke. his friend says he has to do a couple things first. then my friend rolls over says shes going to sleep and turns the light off. 

her boyfriend texts me asking if i think shes mad at him. i say i think shes mad at me, i think its because i didnt buy her sushi. he agrees and says shes been ignoring him too.

im just sitting in the dark on my phone so i go to the bathroom and i text my boyfriend about how im not having fun anymore and idk what to do, how my friend is just going to sleep. its only 10pm and i was going to uber to the airport at 3 am. 

my boyfriend asks if i want to leave now and i kinda like the idea so i go back to the room. turning on my flashlight and start packing up my things. both her and jake are sleeping. i wake up her boyfriend and ask for some bags bc the cat peed in my shoe. 

my friend asks me if i want to wait 5 hours at the airport. i say i think i might fall asleep here not wanting to upset her more and say shes just sleeping and im bored here and anxious. she just nods and goes back to sleep

i bag them up and im just sitting in the dark corner while theyre both there sleeping. i want to go outside so i wake her boyfriend up and ask him to wait outside with me for the uber. 

while were outside i say to delete our texts because i dont want her to be more mad at me for saying i think shes being unfair to me. he says he already deleted them and agreed with me more that shes being unfair when i already did so much for her birthday. 

while were talking his friend is free and comes down with a cart for us to smoke. his friend asks me how the trip went, and i lie saying it was chill. 

her boyfriend laughs and tells his friend about how tati is being really entitled and how i bought so much food and shes mad because i didnt want to buy sushi on top of it. 

i share too saying how i was being so subtle to say no so she could get the hint because he idea of sushi being pitched to everyone was basically her asking me to buy sushi. i stated a fact that they dont have money to afford food and that shes not sticking to the plan and just trying to get more and more. 

i bring up the pizza and how she ordered so much before clearing it with me too. they both agree with me and i leave in my uber. 

after the flight i text her saying i thought the trip was unfair to me and i didnt like how she made me buy so much food that was “for us” and a lot of it went uneaten and unused. 

to this she replies that i wasn’t spending any time with her, she felt like she wasted the first day, i never spent any time with her, i changed the budget, i made this whole weekend about me, i was only thinking about myself, i ruined her birthday weekend that was supposed to be about her. 

im just in disbelief because i thought i was being so accommodating and went out of my way to even be here to pay for this whole thing. i didnt even ask for her to pay me back, just for her to have fun with me and she ignored me for hours on end and wanted me to sit there in a dark room alone. she didnt even want to stay up with me to wait for my uber. 

so i cut her off. i told her its unfortunate she sees it that way. im drained and i dont think shes going to understand my perspective on what just happened since her whole list of events was so different from what happened. 

so AITAH for cutting her off ??
TLDR: i still came over after she quit her job a week before my flight. i said i could fund the hangout. i tell her what ill pay for and make a budget. assuming the food im agreeing to buy is more expensive. she doesnt tell me how lich the stuff really is. she buys a weeks worth of groceries promising we were going to eat them for the weekend. trips too hard, doesnt want to cook and doesn’t let us cook. and orders a lot of food and add ons, paying for it with my card before handing le my phone. and then the next say says she wants sushi and gets upset i said no. 

—
i also want to add, when we made the budget i made it clear we were going to get everything day 1 and cook so its cheaper. since the groceries were so much cheaper than she lead me to believe i think she thought that i was going to spend the rest of the money on other things too for her day. which wasnt the plan we agreed on before i got there. i said what we will do and what im going to buy for us.

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

I just wanted to share what I’ve used as skincare in hopes it can help someone else. I know everyone’s skin is different but I have found that the expensive skincare products at the derm’s office, Rosiver (Ivermectin) and Doxycycline have not and did not help me at all. Once I stopped all the prescriptions and expensive skincare regime and focused on the products that were being used on my face, that’s when my skin started improving. Also diet, stress, coffee and alcohol (mainly wine) were and are still massive triggers for the red face flare up.

Wishing you all the best in finding the right treatment and getting back to healthy skin :)

- Round lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser

- Avene cicalfate+ protective cream in the winter months for extra moisture

I see friends getting into serious relationships, getting married, having kids… and I’m still out here trying to work up the courage to talk to someone at a coffee shop.

I’ll admit, social anxiety plays a big part in this. Approaching women, starting conversations, or even just being vulnerable feels like trying to climb a mountain without any gear. I overthink everything – how I’ll come across, whether I’ll seem weird, if I’ll be rejected. So I end up doing… nothing. And then I beat myself up later for not even trying.

It’s not that I don’t want to put myself out there – I do. I want connection. I want something real. But it feels like I’m stuck between the fear of rejection and the fear of being alone forever.

Is 27 really that late to still be figuring this out? I know everyone says ""you've got time,"" but it doesn't always feel that way. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and ask — has anyone else felt like this? How did you overcome it? What helped you build confidence or find peace while being single?

Any advice would really mean a lot.

TL;DR: I’m 27, single, and struggling with social anxiety, especially when it comes to talking to women. It feels like time’s running out and I’m falling behind in life.

With it being out first time there were areas we really cost ourselves through lack of knowledge & poor planning. Add to that that it was absolutely scorching so we ended up buying things purely due to the heat - ice creams, extra cold drinks.

I think food is somewhere we could save somewhat as breakfast (50EUR) and dinner (80EUR) in the hotels really caught us out. I wasn't expecting that price.

That's a breakdown of our spends. I forgot to add on travel insurance but yeah that's absolutely everything. Some things...

\* We booked through Disney at the time.   
\* Didn't realise using some cards, even at home, will incur a fee. Thought this only applied when spending abroad so we wont make that mistake next time.

\* PREMIER ACCESS - is this a must all year round? For our visit in August I'd say it was 100% a must unless you have godly levels of patience. I don't know if it's quieter at other times. I'd have been miserable as hell without it when we went. Initially we were only doing it for 1 day due to the cost but after day 1 & seeing how bad the queues were, we bit the bullet & bought one for the next day.

\* Some of the things on that list weren't really 'needed' - e.g. the doughnuts. We could've planned better with the going out food & packed (Boots). The coming home food we had was poor & expensive (Gontran). Probably wouldn't buy any ride photos next time round. We don't usually but it was our first time & didn't think we'd be back so soon.

We stayed in Cheyenne. I think next time we'll do Santa Fe to save a little more. Cheyenne was nice enough but struggled with the 1) noise next door initially - (did take ear plugs) 2) not much comfort with the bed & pillows - but then I struggle in ALL hotels. I appreciate we could stay out from Disney. Not sure how much that would save but 1) I hate driving places I don't know in my own country, never mind a foreign one which drives on the opposite side of the road and 2) Walking in is no big deal to us.

1nndper,https://i.redd.it/fjmye08ffnqf1.jpeg,Amul Blueberry & Chocolate Shake Review,"Ordered 6 Pack of 20g Blueberry Shake & 6 Pack of 10g Chocolate Shake a week ago.

Blueberry - 5/5, Will Repurchase.

Definitely very thick. Can’t be consumed standalone without adding a bit of water. I would transfer 50% of the shake in a glass by squeezing the bottle and then add a bit of water to thin down the rest of the shake. 

Taste-wise it’s actually good. It’s barely sweet which I like. Doesn’t have a strong artificial blueberry flavour. Very mild Tart + Sweet taste profile. Similar to Epigamia’s Bluberry Shake.

This is something you can truly enjoy as a thick cold drink at night to satisfy your sweet cravings. Especially when it served cold. It’s also very value for money. No doubt about it. 

Chocolate - 3/5, Won’t Repurchase. 

Not as thick as the blueberry one but thick enough to have a creamy mouthfeel. Like it’s the perfect amount of thickness. 

But taste of chocolate is a bit artificial. It’s very evident that they added a chocolate flavouring agent, not real chocolate. However at this price point, expecting real chocolate is just stupid. 

It’s also a bit on the sweeter side. So another thing I didn’t like about this. It has no refined sugar but uses artificial sweeteners like maltitol. 

6 months ago, I had tried another flavour of the 10g line - Arabica Coffee. Even that was a bit too sweet. That’s why didn’t repurchase. 

Conclusion - It’s a no-brainer to get the 6-pack Blueberry Shake if you’re trying the Amul Protein line. I would advise you to skip the chocolate and cold coffee versions.

It was one of thlse low-key afternoons where nothing much was happening, but it kinda hit me all of a sudden how happy they looked, just being so lost in the momment. 

I dunno, it made me think about how often I'm lost in my own thoughts or caught up in scrolling through my phone, missing out on the actual now. Seeing those kids, I felt an unexpected sense of calm wash over me. It was like a gentle nudge to just breathe and take in the good stuff happening all around. Sometimes, just being present is the best thing you can do. 

Might sound a bit chesy, but honestly, I walked away feeliing more at peace than I have in a while, just by letting myself be fully there, riight then. Life’s a lot more colorful when you’re actuaoly part of it, I gess. 😊",10,1758517365.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False
1nndlpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mr_Outlaw_/comments/1nndlpn/so_it_turns_out_that_i_have_actually_published_a/,So it turns out that I have actually published a novel. I just hadn't realized it.,"So earlier this year I had written a novel for a smaller publishing company. I guess it was more of a novella. Only around 36k words. Though it was still a big deal for me because technically it'd be the first thing that I wrote that was actually going to get published. 

But then I ran into a weird situation. After I had finished and submitted it, I thought that they had ended up scrapping it. Because they never actually told me that it had been published. I guess the person who I'd been corresponding with had quit and they had just forgotten to follow up with me after the fact. 

So for a few months it's just been sitting there and I hadn't realized it. Not until I decided to search it up on my own. 

It's fine, though. I've gotten over it. The important thing is that it has indeed been published. 

I'll link it here below (keep in mind that this is a link to the US amazon page and I think you have to change regions if you live somewhere else in order to purchase it, I don't really know how it works): 

[https://www.amazon.com/TRIGON-Hugh-Lu-ebook/dp/B0F3XVRM4Q](https://www.amazon.com/TRIGON-Hugh-Lu-ebook/dp/B0F3XVRM4Q)

You can also just google it. It's titled *Trigon* by Hugh Lu, which is me. I don't actually love the title, I should've thought about it more. 

I'm also not going to pretend like it's one of the greatest things ever written. After all, it's my first real project. I'm bound to improve. I know I will.  But if you've enjoyed the stories that I've posted so far, then you should enjoy this as well. 

Now I'm going to try and sell the premise to you because the Amazon description doesn't really do it justice:

*One day, a gigantic black pyramid appears hovering above the Atlantic Ocean about ninety miles off the coast of Florida.* 

*The US government reacts swiftly, sending an armada out there to observe and ultimately investigate it.* 

*Chaos ensues. What they find challenges their understanding of the universe and their place within it.* 

If this sounds interesting to you, I'm going to ask that you please go ahead and take a look at it. I think it's about $2.99 USD so if you're willing to give up your morning coffee to buy it, then you are the best, you are #1 in my heart. And if you hate it, then I'm sorry, but I'm sure you'll like the next one! 

Of course the money's not even the important part. This is really my first step towards getting my work out there. 

If you do buy and read it, please leave a review if you like it. I think literary agents and publishing companies really care about that stuff and it'll make me stand out more if there's at least a few good reviews. 

Ultimately, I really do want to make a career out of being a writer. I know some people aren't lucky enough to ever discover what they're passionate about, so I'm really glad that I've discovered mine. 

I promise you all that I will outlast and outcompete generative AI. No way in HELLLLLLL I'm working in an office until I'm seventy. That shit is NOT happening. 

Now, if you're wondering what happened to that novel I was working on earlier, the one I had made a post about several years ago, I will explain below. 

I did complete it. But quite frankly, it's terrible. I still like the concept and the general premise, but the writing is just horrendous. And the same goes for a lot of my earlier stories, even the ones that have garnered some popularity. If those happen to be the only stories of mine that you've read, I promise that I have improved. And I will continue to improve. 

I guess that's about it. Once again, if *Trigon* sounds interesting to you, go ahead and buy it and leave a review. Much appreciated. 

I will also try to answer any messages that I haven't yet responded to.

So, are there industry-specific compliance requirements in Bahrain? Absolutely. Whether you’re launching a fintech startup in Bahrain Bay, a consultancy in the Diplomatic Area, or a manufacturing plant in Hidd Industrial Area, each sector faces its own regulatory maze. Here’s exactly what you need to know—and how to maneuver efficiently, based on real-life, on-the-ground experience.

Financial services, ICT, and logistics now account for over 45% of non-oil GDP (Bahrain Economic Development Board, source), with 2025 FDI inflows projected to exceed BHD 1.2 billion.\
The Seef District now rivals Manama’s Diplomatic Area for sheer business density, while Bahrain Bay’s waterfront is a beacon for fintech and global consultancies. A noticeable trend: multinationals and SMEs appreciate Bahrain’s relatively low company formation costs and its new, friendlier foreign ownership policies.\
And yet—compliance isn’t just about ticking boxes. In 2025, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) introduced new sectoral licensing rules effective January 8, 2025. All regulated activities (from healthcare to crypto assets) must now submit enhanced KYC documentation and demonstrate robust internal controls prior to Commercial Registration (CR) issuance.\

Step-by-Step: How to Navigate Industry-Specific Compliance Smoothly\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, businessman with laptop, office workflow., S.P.C., branch, or partnership? Your sector may dictate the formats allowed.\
- Some activities demand Bahraini shareholders; others now permit 100% foreign ownership. See approved activities here and 99% foreign ownership list.\
Step 2: Prepare the Right Documents (Shortcuts + Insider Tips)\
\
CR application: Prepare in both Arabic and English. Sijilat has templates, but I recommend tweaking for clarity.\
Sector licenses: Initiate MoICT and sectoral regulator applications simultaneously (don’t wait for CR approval first; it can save you 10+ days).\
ID, business plan, tenancy contract, NOC if in shared office.\
Insider tip: Go to the Seef Mall LMRA branch after 3:00pm—lines are shorter, and staff are less rushed.\
\
Step 3: Optimize Your Office Location\
\
Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area rentals are premium but offer the fastest government processing due to proximity.\
Seef District: Lower cost, ample parking, but avoid LMRA at opening hours (queues spill out the door!).\
Some free zones offer virtual office options accepted by the MOICT—perfect for startups avoiding hefty rents.\
\
Step 4: Master the Application Timing\
\
Avoid Ramadan for submissions unless unavoidable; business hours shift and approvals slow down.\
Early Thursday mornings are golden—most government offices process pre-weekend paperwork with surprising efficiency.\
\
Step 5: Ongoing Accounting and Compliance\
\
Use a strong local accounting and bookkeeping partner. Recommended: see trusted service options—they’ll keep you ahead of the new quarterly VAT and ESR filing rules.\
\
\
Personal aside: My very first audit was triggered by a missed ESR deadline—I narrowly avoided a BHD 10,000 penalty by having an accountant intervene last-minute. Don’t risk it.\
\
Step 6: Annual and Ongoing Audits\
\
CBB, NHRA, and some MOICT sectors require annual compliance certificates—budget at least BHD 1,500 for a basic audit.\
\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs neglect updates to Sijilat when their business model pivots. Always amend your CR for new activities—failure can freeze your bank account and LMRA permissions.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: The Subtle Side of Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professional handshake, business agreement. still matter, even at the MOICT counter in the Diplomatic Area.\
Bahrain differs from Dubai or Riyadh: processes are faster, less rigid, and you’ll often get direct access to senior officials provided you are polite and patient. But don’t mistake this friendliness for laxity—paperwork must be precise.\
\
Insider’s Tangent: Why Bahraini Dates Matter for Compliance\
During one memorable Ramadan, I nearly missed a critical CR renewal window—business hours changed, and the Sijilat portal maintenance coincided with Eid. I’d brought a box of premium Bahraini dates for the receptionist (a friend’s suggestion). That small gesture ensured she flagged my file for priority processing the following morning. Sometimes, the soft skills matter as much as the regulatory expertise.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New, What’s Next\
Effective January 8, 2025, MOICT began enforcing electronic UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) declarations across more sectors, including consultancies and IT. All business owners must digitally submit and update UBO data within 30 days of changes—failure triggers automatic BHD 500 fines. The EDB (Economic Development Board) now offers direct assistance for compliance questions. Check MOICT’s official updates for details.\
\
Professional Resources and Help for Smooth Compliance\

Just step off the tourist track and you will easily find amazing gifts to take back home that are actually Italian.

1. Find local shops run by Italians. These can be food shops, wine shops, ceramic shops, bakeries, art shops and hardware shops.

2. Ask if things are “Fatto a mano” which means “Made by Hand” and ask where they are made.

3. Shops carrying true Italian products will almost always be run by Italians. They won’t necessarily be set up to draw tourists in the doors and they definitely won’t be at the front of the shop hawking their wares.

4. Authentic food makes great gifts! Look for an Italian flag on the label, or 100% Italia. Often these are found in local butchers, bakeries, food markets and coffee bars.

5. Ask your hotel concierge for recommendations on neighborhoods with artisans, or the best known local artisans.

Below is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of how to activate the quantum field and become magnetic to what you want (principles and techniques drawn from a talk by Jessica Connor, which I turned into step by step process).

**The simple physics of manifestation (what's actually happening)**

Thoughts = electrical charge. When ideas, images, or intentions run through the mind they register as electrical signals in the field.

* **Feelings = magnetic charge.** Emotion is the magnetic component, it draws in the equivalent.
* **Thought + feeling = an electromagnetic broadcast.** Together they send a signal that both points the direction (thought) and pulls the match (feeling). In plain terms: *the thought gives the map; the feeling brings the attraction.*

**Three laws to keep in mind:**

1. **Law of Attraction:** Energy projected by thought, emotion, and action is mirrored back into experience.
2. **Law of Reciprocity:** What is given out influences what returns. Dominant thoughts, paired emotions, and consistent actions determine the circumstances that come back.
3. **Law of Reversibility:** Transformations of force are reversible, if an event can change your emotional state, an emotional state can be used to change events. In short: *feel the result first, and the result can be created after.*

Neville Goddard summed this up simply: if it’s possible to feel a state from an event, it’s equally possible to produce the event by first feeling the state.

**Why create the feeling first (and why it’s more effective)**

* People often wait for the external event to happen and then feel the emotion. This is the backwards approach.
* Instead, *assume the feeling of the fulfilled wish now*. Emotion is the end product of an event so generating that emotion first flips the process: internal state → external experience.
* Practically: when the internal chemistry (elevated emotions like gratitude, joy, calm) is present, the nervous system shifts out of fight/flight and into growth/repair (parasympathetic activation), which supports clearer perception, better health, and a body that’s aligned with creative functioning. This isn't just woo elevated states change hormones, immune response, and behavior.

**Step-by-step practice to activate the quantum field**

1. **Dissociate from the old self.** Observe current patterns, thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs that didn’t create what was wanted. Treat them like an old outfit notice them without judgment and decide to change them.
2. **Get crystal clear on the intention.** What specifically is wanted? Write a short present-tense sentence: e.g., *“A loving, supportive partnership is part of my life now.”*
3. **Create the feeling in the present.** Use daydreaming or imaginal acts: imagine a scene that implies the intention is true and *feel* it as if it’s happening now. Focus on sensory detail and bodily sensations, not on timelines. Stay in the present tense.
4. **Anchor the feeling.** Let the image sink into the heart/mind. Repeat often enough for the brain to “freeze the frame” it forms a memory-like trace and becomes part of how the system recognizes the world.
5. **Live from the new state.** Move through the day with this vision active. Align thoughts, emotions, actions, and choices to that state rather than to the old evidence. The more consistent the alignment, the stronger the personal “Wi-Fi” signal becomes.
6. **Reverse engineer using gratitude and elevated emotion.** When something favorable occurs, notice the emotion (gratitude, love, joy). Use that feeling as proof that the field is responding and deliberately recreate it as a daily practice to magnetize more of the same.
7. **Repeat and deepen.** A few minutes a day of surrendering into the vision, beyond body, environment, and time is enough to start reprogramming habitual responses.

**Practical micro-exercise (5 minutes)**

* Sit quietly. Breathe for thirty seconds to settle.
* Bring to mind one concise scene that would be true if the intention were already real (e.g., laughing over coffee with someone who gets you). Keep it in present tense.
* Hold the scene and deliberately feel the emotion in the body for 2–3 minutes, sense warmth, relief, joy, gratitude. Don’t narrate the future; *be* in the feeling now.
* Release gently and carry one line of that feeling into the next hour. Repeat daily.

**How this changes everyday life**

* This method changes the internal lens: the “new you” sees opportunities differently and acts differently, which then produces different outer results.
* When done consistently, external triggers lose their power because baseline emotion comes from the inside-out rather than being dictated by circumstances.
* It’s not about forcing outcomes it’s about aligning physiology, psychology, and intention so universal intelligence (call it quantum field, higher self, God, or innate intelligence) can work through the person more effectively.

**Practical notes & cautions**

* This is training the mind and body patience and repetition are required. It’s not a one-off trick.
* Emotions should be genuine and pleasant; forcing fake emotion tends to create resistance. Begin with moments that feel believable and expand from there.
* Keep daily life practical: matching actions (small aligned choices) to the vision is just as important as the imaginal work.

**Master yourself → master your reality**

Master meditation, the imaginal act, intention, language, emotions, reactions, and routine. These internal skills are what create the consistent energetic signal that the field responds to. In short: practice being the person who already has what is wanted and the environment will follow.",13,1758516590.0,livingfromtheend,1,0.94,False

I skipped all of the story.

As an avid deckbuilder fan, I had to try CZN for myself to see if it could capture the heights that Slay the Spire and Chrono Ark did for me. For context, I have beaten both A20 in Slay the Spire and Blood Mist 4 True Final Boss in Chrono Ark (IYKYK) so while I'm not the greatest deckbuilding player, I'd say I'm qualified enough to discuss some of the systems that currently shape the game. I will also not be discussing the gacha system in detail as it's already been harped on to death. Yes, it's trash. Yes, I left a review saying it's trash.

##### The Basics

CZN is a roguelike, turn based deckbuilder. Much like its predecessors, the main meat of the game is a roguelike mode known as [Chaos Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REFjniuVW-A
). You clear what is essentially an Act from Slay the Spire, fighting monsters, events and elite mobs along the way with a final boss at the end. Every turn, you draw 5 cards from your deck made of 3 units, [who all start with 4 cards at the start of each run](https://files.catbox.moe/35ogla.webp), and have 3 AP to play your cards in hand. Enemy turns are shown in a little diamond to the left of their HP bar, counting down when you play a card until it reaches 0, where it will then perform an action.

From what I played of the beta, I have 3 main issues here with this system already.

1. **3AP means your turns are VERY binary, and cards are very underwhelming.** In Slay the Spire, 3 AP cards exist, and they tend to have insane effects attached to them (Bludgeon 42 damage, Echo Form's repeat, etc.) in exchange for basically wasting a turn played. However, you can mitigate this issue by grabbing an energy relic at the end of an act, effectively giving you the ability to block and empowering these cards even further. In CZN, no such thing exists. I ran into a single neutral card that gave you 1 AP at the start of each turn and it is one of the biggest bricks I have seen in the game. For 2AP, your units EACH lose 3% HP per turn in exchange for 1 extra AP per turn. You're paying 2 AP to do nothing and then lose 9% HP per turn. Chrono Ark tackles this issue by letting you increase your AP out of combat, so high cost cards don't matter when you can have 7-8 AP to play your turns. What does this mean for the card design CZN? It just means most, if not all cards are 0, 1, 2 AP. The only character I saw that had a 3 cost card autoplays itself when you play a 2 cost card. When compounded with the next issue, it makes turns very boring because all of it is just ""Oh, I have enough mana to play these 2-3 cards and then end my turn."" Very rarely did I have to stop and think about what to do during my turns, but that's also probably because the 5 stars I got were quite unga bunga (Mei Lin my beloved).

2. **Card manipulation is ass.** You can see from my video in Chaos Mode that there's really not a lot of draw in the game. Nia is probably one of the best 4 stars in the game currently (next to Cassius) and even she doesn't really do anything other than recycle cards that you've either played or haven't played. This makes it so most runs just feels like Act 1 Ironclad, where you just vomit out heals/shields, attack and then end turn. The lack of any card draw whatsoever is compounded by the fact that neutral cards are not only painfully annoying to get (you pick 1 of 3 at a campfire and that's pretty much the only way to get it outside of events), but also fatten up your deck (They're better than basics but worse than the unique you can get from Epiphany) which just makes it feel even worse. 
This is probably why Cassius is the best support in the game currently, since he actually enables you to cycle your deck properly and fish for certain cards. The two big deckbuilders bypass this by either just giving you good draw cards in STS (Pommel Strike, Shrug it Off) or embedding it to the Main Character in CA (Lucy cards, recycles, your hand isn't shuffled back every round). CZN has none of these, and when compounded with the earlier 3AP issue, makes turns feel very linear.

3. **There is zero good ways to manipulate turn action in this game.** It feels like they just ripped this off of CA without understanding why it works. In Chrono Ark, you can advance the turn action once per round, and you can pay AP to advance it even further. Most bosses are designed to have their attacks go off in the middle of the round, so you are able to adjust with your remaining AP. In CZN, because you have 3 AP and 5 cards, most of the time, monsters that have 6-7 action counts are just dressing. There's no real reason for this action count to exist because you can only play 3, maybe 4 cards a turn and then when you end your turn their attacks end up going off anyway.

##### The Epiphany system

This is a pretty interesting system that adds a lot of flair to Chaos Mode. [Every unit has an RNG chance each turn to get either an epiphany on one of their drawn cards. These allow you to acquire one of their four unique cards or to see an upgrade in the card that has an Epiphany.](https://files.catbox.moe/cwkb1w.png) It's a pretty neat way to give diversity to Chaos runs, as some of the Epiphanies seriously change what a card does. No issues from me with this system, although I think the -cost upgrades are far too valuable to ever think about picking anything else. I'm also pretty worried that epiphanies will end up being too rare, as I have gotten multiple runs where you can't gain access to your full unique deck, but that's par the course for a deckbuilder.

##### Thinning your deck

The shop only ever appears in a few campfires. In STS, you can path towards shopkeepers and always make sure your deck is lean. In CA, deck thinning is free. Because you can't guarantee the shop shows up more than once in a Chaos run, decks can usually end up quite large, filled with garbage basic cards that you can't get rid of. This also makes picking neutrals pretty important because you don't want to just pick up garbage.

##### The stress and mental breakdown system

Perhaps my biggest disappointment when I played given how much they advertised this system. It's clearly inspired from Darkest Dungeon's stress system, where units take stress damage when hit with attacks (Incidentally, this makes shielding better than healing). When a unit reaches 100 stress, they go into mental breakdown mode, reducing your HP by 33% and turning all of their skills into brick cards. You have to play 5 of their cards for them to recover. After they recover, their Ego Skill (Essentially an ultimate), is discounted by 4.

The system just feels half baked. Stress damage isn't told to you. Stress healing doesn't exist in the game outside of a pittance -1 or -2 on healing skills. When you hit 100 stress, there's zero actual interaction with it unlike DD where the unit can still take actions (or even become Virtuous!), you just have to fight against it. In CZN, every affliction is dealt with the same way. I was kind of hoping that instead of just being completely out of combat, they'd still fight but they can now either disobey your commands or their cards have additional effects tacked to them. There's no units that interact with this stress system either. It feels like the system was added because they liked the stress system from DD1 and they just didn't know what to do with it ~~and also as fanservice for mindbreak fans~~. I could see this system being something really interesting to play with, but it's pretty much just an annoyance currently. It doesn't help that the recovery from breakdown in the Ark City can only be done three times a day, and the items required for it are the same items you use to go out on dates with your Combatants.

##### Enemy design

This one felt pretty solid, but it's also pretty shameless how much they took from other deckbuilders. In the first rank up mission, the first wave of enemies you fight are literally just the triple sentries from STS Act 1. Still, good design is good design, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I also really liked the elite that can spawn after a regular mob stage, the idea of having to alternate cards in order to not activate the enemy's soft enrage is great dynamic design. The final bosses from both Chaos worlds that I played were nothing really special, I liked the elite designs more, and the general mob designs suffered from the turn action issue I described above.

##### Combatant Deisgn

I didn't get to fiddle around with very many combatants, but the general rules of deckbuilders still apply. From one glance, you can tell Nia and Cassius will be very good just simply from the utility they bring to the team that no one else does. (As well as a general lack of supporters in general). Generally it does seem like certain Chaos worlds will benefit certain units more (Mei Lin was very strong in World 1, but I found Khalipe was insane for general mob clearing in World 2 thanks to her cleaves) but you could probably make most things work as long as you brought a healer and/or a shielder. I couldn't find a way to make Rei not a useless brick, so for anyone that managed to make her work, please tell me what team you had. It seemed like if you wanted a 4* DPS Beryl would probably be the way to go as Retain cards make her damage very consistent.

##### Card UI

Just atrocious all around. Cards can read like ""Wave 1 Seam 2"" with nothing else, and you can't tap the keywords to understand what they mean. You have to go into a battle with the combatant, use the card and only then will you be able to know what the keyword does. A card game that doesn't have a keyword encyclopedia in 2025. Imagine that.

##### UI

This might unironically be the most soulless UI I've ever seen. [Everything](https://files.catbox.moe/j4djb3.webp) [about](https://files.catbox.moe/018uyc.webp) [the](https://files.catbox.moe/j6ia8k.webp) [menus](https://files.catbox.moe/qg8pea.webp) just makes me think ""Wow, they really just ripped off Genshin/HSR for this one!"" For fucks sake, have some creativity. Lost Sword looks like it was made with a duct tape and 5 dollars and it has a UI design that makes more sense in the context of the game than CZN does. 

##### Ark City

A city where you hang out with your fellow combatants. You can get coffee here that gives you either 80 energy or 60 energy that you can hold for use at anytime. Honestly, I don't even understand why this is a thing. Just give us 80 energy that we can hold, it won't kill you Supercreative, trust me. There's also a policy system in place where you are assigned a (Weekly?) mission to keep certain bars (Political Administration, Economic Activity, Happiness and Public Order or something like that) above a certain gauge by the end of the policy. The system is kind of weird and very badly explained. You get a policy every 6 hours or so and I think you can have a max of 3. Each policy fast forwards the big event by 1-2 days and at the end of the big event you receive rewards for how well you did in maintaining the four bars. You can also have recreational events with your combatants in the Ark City, unfortunately they aren't voiced and are very barebones.


##### Closing Thoughts

The game has... a lot of potential. I want to like the game, but as it stands there's a lot of work that needs to be done still. I think the UI really does need a major overhaul. Every time I see it, I think I'm just playing some genshin/HSR ripoff when the game has NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING to do with either game. Visually I think the actual sprite/2D based artwork is absolutely beautiful, I just wished the systems that surrounded it were more well fleshed out. As it stands, if the game releases as is, I'd probably play it for a few weeks than get the itch to boot up Chrono Ark/Slay the Spire until Slay the Spire 2/Deception Engine is out, because why would I want to play a poorly balanced deckbuilder when I have two absolutely amazingly designed deckbuilders in my Steam library. If the devs said they were ready for release, they're wrong, there's so much more that needs to be done in this game.",26,1758516579.0,ChaosZeroNightmare,5,0.83,False

Strings Of The Past

Under the canopy of the kastletion forest, the night unfolded like a velvet tapestry, studded with stars so bright they seemed to whisper ancient secrets. Jason sat outside his cabin, the cool summer breeze brushing against his face as he sipped his cup of coffee. The logs he had neatly stacked for the campfire crackled gently as he added another, and the warm glow of the flames danced in his eyes.

In these moments of solitude, Jason’s mind often wandered back to the fragments of his past. He remembered the hazy, disjointed moments of awakening in a dingy barn, the confusion of not knowing who he was, and the strange, heightened awareness that set him apart from everyone else.

As the fire dwindled, he felt a lingering sense of mystery about his own identity, as if pieces of a puzzle were forever out of reach. He knew he was different, not just in his senses, but in the way he perceived the world — every sound, every movement, every subtle detail seemed amplified.

When he finally retreated inside his cozy log cabin, locking the wooden door and blowing out the candle, the quiet of the night wrapped around him. He eagerly anticipated tomorrow’s journey into town. And with his thoughts calm and composed. The cabin fell silent. As the first rays of dawn touched the treetops, Jason’s resolve grew stronger. He packed his gear with care, his mind a blend of anticipation and lingering questions, and stepped into the forest 
As Jason ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, the towering trees stood like ancient guardians, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind. Each step he took was accompanied by the soft crunch of pine needles beneath his boots, and the cool, earthy scent of moss and damp soil filled the air.

He found a small clearing by a bubbling stream, the water glinting in the soft light filtering through the leaves. With careful hands, he set up his camp, arranging his tent beside the stream and laying out his gear with precision. The serene atmosphere brought a sense of calm, yet beneath it lingered the undercurrent of mystery that had accompanied him since he awoke with no memory almost two years prior. laying down beside the dancing flames of his campfire, he rehearsed his supply list trying not to forget anything. As he was now fighting the heaviness of his eyelids, he heard a sharp sounds just to his left towards the dimly moon lit forest, as his eyes pierced through the trees.he saw what looks like a figure, standing, haunting him, or was it just a bush. Moving his head as to find another angle, his heart beat now slowing down, breathing out with a sigh of relief and hesitation, he leaned back and drifted out of consciousness

As noon approached, he followed the stream toward the nearby town, the rhythmic sound of the water blending with the rustle of leaves. The forest gradually gave way to the outskirts of the town, where quaint cottages and narrow streets awaited, colorful red and yellow banners welcomed him as he walked up to the brick road leading into the town of krey, 
As he walked past the town’s edge, the sense of being watched returned, more palpable than ever. Every glance over his shoulder revealed nothing, yet the feeling clung to him like a shadow. He reached the town square, the familiar sights of the local market and the gentle murmur of townsfolk offering a sense of normalcy, but also a tinge of unease.
As Jason stepped into the town, the vibrant life of the marketplace unfolded before him. The laughter of children, the cheerful banter of vendors, and the rich aromas of fresh bread and ripe produce created a comforting normalcy. For a moment, Jason allowed himself to blend into the rhythm of daily life, enjoying the simplicity of the town’s bustle.

But as he wandered from the general store to the food market, he couldn’t shake the subtle sensation of being watched. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a shadowy figure, always lingering at the edge of his vision, never fully coming into focus. Each time he turned his head, the figure seemed to melt into the crowd, vanishing just as quickly as it appeared.

Jason’s unease grew with every step, the town’s lively atmosphere now tinged with an undercurrent of mystery. He visited the butcher, the baker, and the florist, each time catching glimpses of the figure, always at a distance, always elusive. The figure’s presence cast a shadow over the otherwise ordinary day, and even as the sun began to dip below the horizon, Jason felt the weight of the unseen gaze.
As Jason stepped out of the bustling marketplace, the afternoon sun cast long shadows on the cobblestone streets. He paused for a moment, glancing around, and that’s when he noticed a young lady approaching. She had a warm smile and a spark of curiosity in her eyes.

“Hello there,” she greeted, her voice light and friendly. “I couldn’t help but notice you look a bit lost. Are you looking for a place to stay?”

Jason offered a polite nod, his voice deep and measured. “Yes, I’m hoping to find an inn for the night. I’d rather not camp out in the woods.”

Beatrice’s eyes twinkled with curiosity. “Of course! There’s a cozy little inn just down the road. But… if you don’t mind me asking, what brings you to our town?”

As they conversed, Jason’s mind suddenly drifted back to a distant memory. In a fleeting moment, he saw a glint of a ring resting on a nightstand, glowing softly. The flashback was so vivid that he almost stumbled mid-step, but he quickly regained his composure.

Beatrice noticed the subtle shift in his demeanor and tilted her head. “Are you alright? You seemed… a bit lost there for a second.”

Jason offered a reassuring smile. “Just a moment of recollection. Nothing to worry about.”

And as they continued their conversation, the air between them filled with a gentle curiosity and a hint of mystery.she guided him toward the cozy inn just a few streets away. Her questions were gentle and curious, but Jason kept his answers brief, maintaining an air of mystery. When they reached the inn’s doorstep, Beatrice offered a warm smile and a friendly wave, and Jason thanked her sincerely before heading inside.

As Jason stepped into the inn, the warm, inviting atmosphere wrapped around him. The clerk behind the counter, a friendly middle-aged man, looked up with a welcoming smile.

“Good evening! How can I help you tonight?”

“I’m looking for a room for the night,” Jason replied, his voice carrying a hint of fatigue. “I’ve been hiking and could really use a comfortable place to rest.”

“Absolutely,” the clerk nodded. “We have a cozy room available. That’ll be forty kazelz for the night.”

Jason handed over the payment, and as he took the room key, a sudden flash of a glowing ring on a nightstand flickered in his mind. He paused, momentarily disoriented, then quickly regained his composure.

“All set! If you need anything else, just let me know,” the clerk said with a reassuring smile.

“Thank you, I appreciate it,” Jason responded, making his way to the stairs.As Jason reached his room and closed the door a behind him, the quiet comfort of the inn enveloped him. He unpacked his gear, the day’s  dust still clinging to his clothes, and he settled into the modest bed. The room was simple, with a small window letting in the moonlight, and the soft creak of the floorboards accompanied his movements.

As the clock ticked toward midnight, the inn fell into a deep silence. But then, in the stillness, a sudden, sharp sound jolted Jason awake. He sat up, heart racing, and listened intently. The noise echoed through the hallway, something abrupt and unexpected, pulling him from his rest.

He rose, curiosity and caution warring within him, In the stillness of the night, as Jason’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he noticed a shadowy figure emerging from the corner of the room. The figure moved with an eerie, silent grace, and as it drew closer, its presence seemed to chill the air.

A harsh, grinding voice broke the silence, laced with a strange familiarity. “Where is it?” the figure demanded, its tone both menacing and urgent.

Jason’s heart raced as he tried to comprehend the question. The figure’s gaze pierced through him, as if it knew something Jason himself had forgotten.Jason, now on edge, leaned forward, his voice trembling. “Where is what?” he demanded, panic creeping into his tone.

As the shadowy figure stepped into the dim light, Jason could see that it was a man, but his face was marked with a haunting asymmetry—half of it scarred and almost unrecognizable. The man’s eyes glinted with an unsettling intensity.

The figure’s voice, still harsh and grating, came closer. “You know what I seek,” he hissed, his voice carrying an eerie familiarity that sent shivers down Jason’s spine.
As the shadowy figure’s menacing gaze fixed on Jason, the man slowly drew a spear-like sword from beneath his cloak. The blade extended with a sharp, almost sinister hiss, and in an instant, it was poised just millimeters from Jason’s neck.

Panic surged through Jason, but something instinctive kicked in. With a swift movement, he pushed the blade away, his reflexes sharper than expected. At the same time, he hurled a metallic ball with his hand, the object cutting through the air toward the figure.

The hunter staggered back, momentarily thrown off balance, and the room was filled with the tension of the encounter.As the hunter stumbled back from the impact, Jason looked down at his hand, confusion clouding his thoughts. The metallic ball was gone, leaving his palm empty. He couldn’t shake the bewildering question of where it had come from and how it had ended up in his hand in the first place. His mind raced, trying to piece together the mystery, but all he found was the emptiness of his hand.

The hunter, now gathering himself, watched Jason with a mixture of anger and realization. “It chose You,” he said through gritted teeth, his voice laced with frustration. Jasons brow furrowed in confusion,As Jason posed his question, “What chose me?” the hunter’s eyes flared with fury. In a swift motion, the hunter flung a smaller blade toward him. Instinctively, Jason leaned his body back, and the blade narrowly missed him, slicing through the air where he had just been.

Stunned by his own reflexes, Jason straightened up and turned quickly, but the corner where the hunter had stood was now empty. The room was silent, and the shadows seemed to swallow the figure whole.Jason stood alone, his heart pounding, and the mystery of the encounter lingering in the air

The highway is clear, the commute easy and unremarkable, as you often wait for the pass of rush hour to travel. There is no sense of late when you make the hours. The high, gleaming windows of your office stand tall against the skyline. You take a moment and smooth your hair in the visor mirror before entering, walking across the freshly cleaned floors in heels that sing loudly in the wide, open space. You don't need to sign in, you are known by sight, and deferential glances follow you to the elevator. A man is watering a collection of flowers in the corner of your office. You do not know his name and do not bother to notice as you walk to your desk.

I am in an email marked ""high priority- staff injury"". It is one of many. The tale is not old. But the tale is an common now as a car crash- we pass by the twisted metal and think 'how sad' and never think on it again. There is no caught breath or stuttered breath. Your adrenaline is saved for the press or the darkly lit rooms of stockholder meetings. You don't open it right away. The secretary, whose first name you recall but whose last name you never bothered to learn, is bringing you fresh coffee. The soft morning light streams through the high windows, gently warming your faces as the steam curls upward and you make small talk about the cooling weather. 

Eventually you open the email. Your coffee sits half-drank beside you. It is not very long. There was an unfortunate incident at the St. Vincent's Psychiatric Unit. During a restraint a patient care technician was injured. She was transferred to the ED, where she died at 2205. Your first thought will be the press. How can you spin this? What immediate action can you take to pretend you care? The PR department is already working on a statement. Damage control was underway before I was even pronounced dead. 

You click on the link for the security camera footage as you take another sip of your coffee. It is lukewarm now and you message your secretary to bring you another one, with slightly more caramel please. 

It was the adolescent unit. The CREW had been called. The male patient was pacing, fists clenched, mouth open as he screamed threats you can't hear on the soundless video. Will you be able to see the silver flash of my rosary as I take it briefly from my scrub pocket? Will you be able to see on the grainy footage the small movements of my lips as I said a quick prayer? Because you didn't know this patient but I did. I knew him when his fist broke my charge nurse's nose. I knew him when he flung me against the wall. I knew him when we tried to press charges and the police officer said, ""he will have to rape or kill someone before we take him out of here"".  

Just an hour earlier, he had been flashing gang signs again. We didn't see it at the time but another patient did. They began to antagonize each other, curses here, threats there. It grew into a fight. One patient stood down. He didn't. Did you watch the dread on my face? Because you were at home, warm and safe, but for me it was another weekend night and the staffing was skeleton at best. Ever since you cut the bonuses, no one picks up. People came running, as many as the other units could spare, but it wouldn't be enough. 

Everything happened so quickly. You can pause, and rewind, and slow the speed. I couldn't. The patient lunged at another tech. We all jumped in. Security got one arm. I went for another but it caught me across the chest and I stumbled back. You'll make a note that our technique was not optimal. A mean kick caught one of the older nurses and she went down. I won't know what happens next, not really, You know the security officer loses his balance on a floor tile that had started rising months ago and had never gotten fixed. You know the patient focused on me as I went back in to the battle. 

It means nothing to you, but I was scared. I wanted to go home. I wanted my mom. When my head cracked against the floor I think I saw her, even. I think I even felt her hold my hand as he lifted me up by my neck and slammed me back down. After that, all I knew was black. My rosary laid curled in my scrub pocket. 

You will hold a heavy hand against your face, and sip your new cup of coffee. 

They tried to save me. But it took them approximately 13 minutes to secure the patient into the restraint chair. By that point the shards of my skull had lacerated my brain. And you can't see it on your video, but at her home my mother felt a chasm open in her chest. You make a note that the code blue team took 2 minutes longer than required. 

The police will not charge him with a crime. He will be moved to another adolescent unit, in another hospital. You will create a policy that requires nurses to document in a new way to prevent a similar tragedy. Everyone will be required to take an additional self-defense class. 

You will watch me die on that dirty floor and you won't even remember my name. You will not think of me at your Michelin-starred dinner or at your charity gala. You won't be there as my family sobs at my funeral.  I meant nothing to you alive, I mean nothing dead.

I giggle, whoch catches his attention, and he turns to me with a wink, 'Sorry for blowing my cover.' I can't help but laugh and reply, 'Well, 007, hopefully your mission is to get the best cappuccino in town.'

He cuhckles and says, 'Mission accepted! But only if I can buy a coffee for this charming witnness.'

We ended up chatting while our oreers came through, and it totally made my day. Turnns out, his real name is not quite as cool as James Bond, but he's definitely got the charm.

She’s the firstborn of all nine of us, and honestly, she’s like the boss of our whole family. She works in a big office building, wearing fancy clothes and carrying her shiny handbag, always looking so confident and important.

Jennifer is also the richest person in our family. Whenever Mom gets stressed about bills or unexpected costs, Jennifer is the one who calmly steps in. She’ll tap her calculator, sip her coffee, and say, “Relax, Mom. I’ve got this.” To her, everything about money and finances is just a piece of cake. I sometimes think she has magical powers that turn numbers into solutions.

I really admire her. But then I got nervous—what should I give her for her birthday? She can buy anything she wants herself! Should I buy her something small, like a keychain? Or something sweet, like chocolate? But then I looked at my belly in the mirror and laughed… Maybe I should just give her a hug so big her worries melt away, the way she melts ours with her smarts.

On my way to breakfast, I whispered to Mom, “What do you think Jennifer would like as a present?” Mom smiled kindly, “Amy, for Jennifer, the best gift is knowing her family appreciates her. A little gift from you will mean more than anything expensive.”

So now I’m thinking… maybe I’ll make her a little handmade card, and write inside: ‘Happy Birthday, Jennifer! Thank you for always helping Mom and all of us. You’re the best big sister!’ I bet she’ll smile and pat my head, even if my belly growls while I give it to her.",1,1758516267.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

You know what I've always wanted to do? Take a year off from life and rent a boat and sail around diving on sunken ships. That would be fucking awesome, right?

But you know what would be even better? Just a cool friend to chit chat with through out the day. One to celebrate wins with, support during losses.

1nndc21,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nndc21/chronic_emptiness/,Chronic emptiness,"I’m a very goal-oriented person. My entire life, I’ve had clear goals that I constantly worked toward: graduate from school, obtain a career, buy a house, and have a loving relationship. January ‘24, I accomplished all of these things. I have a well-paying career that’s fulfilling (though somewhat stressful), I bought my dream house (I skipped the whole starter house step), and was in a committed, long-term relationship. 

It didn’t take long until some anxiety and confusion sunk in im 2024. Now what? Life started to feel dull. I worked, I went on some vacations, I hiked some mountains, and I hung out with my then-boyfriend. Sounds pretty great, you’d think. But something was, and has been, missing since. 

In Nov ‘24, my boyfriend (of 7 years) broke up with me, and that was a dark time. But, I healed and moved on and really dove into making friends in my new town. I took more vacations, decided to work on starting a business, and bought a banjo to learn a new hobby. 

I have many other goals and hobbies. I have a goal to hike all of the 14ers in the contiguous U.S., and I just spent a month in CO living and working remotely in my van while hiking on my days off. Once this goal is completed, I want to move onto bigger peaks, like Kilimanjaro. I also love camping/backpacking, skiing, spending time with family (most live 3 hours away), hanging out with my dog, reading/learning, craft beer, coffee, and lifting weights/running. 

I’m still single, but not ready for a committed and serious relationship again. 

On the outside, my life seems rich and fulfilling. It SHOULD feel that way. But for some reason, I feel this anxious pit in my stomach, this emptiness, this aimlessness, and this lack of fulfillment and confusion about my future. There’s this, is-this-it- feeling. 

I do spend a lot of time alone and I wonder if this is part of it. But I’m an introvert and have limited social batteries, plus I talk to people 40 hours a week for my job (through the computer). I don’t know if I want kids one day, but it feels okay not to know. I do crave intimacy and recognize my loneliness, but at the same time would feel uncomfortable pursuing a serious romantic relationship so soon. I don’t know what else I want my future to look like but I do feel this need to know, to have a plan.

I have done intermittent therapy throughout the year and while it’s been helpful, I can’t shake this feeling. I don’t feel depressed, however. 

I apologize for the length of this. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. Any thoughts, insights, and perspectives would be helpful. I just want to feel ALIVE, to feel passion, joy, contentedness, and fulfillment. I feel that most when climbing a 14er, but then the high wears off two days later.

I’ve noticed a lot of small business owners (restaurants, salons, contractors, local shops, etc.) aren’t fully aware of **Local SEO** and how powerful it can be. So I thought I’d break it down in simple words.

**What is Local SEO?**  
[Local SEO](https://rankwithmanish.com/what-is-local-seo-how-it-works/) (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving your online presence so your business shows up when people search for services *near them*. For example, if someone types “pizza near me” or “plumber in \[city name\],” Google shows them businesses closest to their location. Local SEO helps make sure *your* business is in those results.

**Why does it matter for small businesses?**

* 🔍 **More visibility** – Your business shows up when people are actively looking for your service.
* 📍 **Google Maps ranking** – Optimizing your Google Business Profile can put you in the “map pack” (top 3 businesses Google highlights).
* 💰 **Higher sales with lower cost** – Unlike ads, you don’t pay per click. Once you rank, customers keep coming.
* 🤝 **Builds trust** – Good reviews + consistent online presence make your business look reliable.
* 📱 **Mobile searches = more customers** – People searching on their phones often want something *right now*.

**Example:**  
Let’s say you own a coffee shop in Austin. If someone nearby searches *“best coffee near me”* and your shop shows up with good reviews, there’s a high chance they’ll walk in. Without Local SEO, they might never even know you exist.

**Bottom line:**  
Local SEO is one of the simplest yet most powerful tools to grow a small business locally. Even just optimizing your Google Business Profile and getting consistent reviews can make a *huge* difference.

Curious to hear—how many of you here are actively using Local SEO for your business? Has it helped you get more customers?",1,1758516189.0,u_manishblp,0,1.0,False

“Summoned again,” I announce to no one in particular as I trek toward the kitchen for a cup of coffee.

That’s how I feel about my visits with my mother.

She beckons, I go.

Our time together is never enjoyable and often results in me sitting impassively and glaring daggers at the woman who gave birth to me while she speaks—which is rarely with me, unless others are within earshot.

When I was younger, I fought for my relationship with my mother, making excuse after excuse for her horrible behavior until I saw her for what she was: a narcissist too consumed by her own selfishness to see those of us who would have loved her if she had given us the chance.

My desperation turned to disdain, then apathy over the years as I realized there was no place in her life for anything other than her own needs, and that included me. I was merely a tool to help her get what she felt she deserved.

Growing up, I thought my parents had it all, but I blame my starry-eyed ideals on the naivety of my youth. Money is never important to a child. Not when you have attention, affection, and an endless supply of long, sunny days spent playing with your parents at the summer beach house.

I learned quickly how important money is to adults. I’d listen to my parents’ late-night arguments.

Don’t get me wrong. My father made a good living. We were considered rich by many standards, although we never bought many extravagant things. My dad always said, if it worked, secondhand was as good as new.

My mother didn’t share his views. According to her, there was always room to go bigger. She continuously pushed him to work harder so she could buy everything brand new, saying to me, “If someone else didn’t care enough to keep it, it was trash, and we don’t own garbage.”

My father pushed back. He opted to spend his time with us instead of striving to make more than enough at the expense of his connection to his family. I remember him saying, “We have enough money, but I’ll never have enough of the both of you.”

But it was never enough for her.

We were never enough.

Eventually, she left in pursuit of her own treasures, but she didn’t go alone. She made sure to fight for custody since I would come with a hefty monthly check from my father.

The final custody ruling broke my dad’s heart, but we made the most of the time we got to spend together.",1,1758516126.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1nnd9o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1nnd9o9/ex_roommate_just_being_friendly_or_is_there/,Ex roommate just being friendly or is there something more?,"So here’s a little backstory: I had a female roommate for about 8 months. We recently parted ways I’m 27, she’s 29.

When she first moved in, I was stuck in a very toxic long-distance relationship. Over time, as we got more comfortable, I started venting to her and asking for a female perspective. She told me straight up that my girlfriend was toxic and just using me for attention and validation. Eventually, in May, I broke up with my ex. The first couple of months were rough, but I’m in a much better place now.

Here’s where things get tricky: while I was still in that relationship, I noticed myself comparing the way my roommate treated me to how my girlfriend did. And honestly? It shocked me. A roommate, a roommate was more caring and supportive than my partner ever was. She’d initiate plans for dinner, suggest fun things to do, and always checked in on me. She’s a homebody, very passionate about her career, super philosophical, and always sparks deep conversations that make me see life differently. Basically, she has all the qualities I’d want in a partner.

Since moving out, it’s been about a month, but she’s already invited me to dinner twice and also told me to visit her place for tea, coffee anytime(just being genuinely polite I think) Both times felt like informal dates we had a great time. It was my birthday on 7th of this month, she gave me a thoughtful gift with a note that said: “Hope you find a kind, loyal, and caring 10.” That one kinda threw me off.

I also just bought a car, and she was super excited about it. Yesterday we grabbed dinner(she asked if I was down) went to her fav dessert spot and then went for a drive together it honestly felt amazing having her in the passenger seat. Its a M5(glory to god) and the 0-60 really made her laugh with excitement cuz its her first time sitting in a sports car. But here’s the thing: I’m completely clueless when it comes to knowing if a girl is dropping hints or just being friendly. She does keep asking me if I'm going on dates or seeing someone quite a few times

She hasn’t dated in about 5 years after being in a 8 year long term relationship and has told me she wants to meet someone organically when we first met, not through apps. That’s why I’m stuck part of me feels like there’s a spark, part of me feels like I might just be imagining things. All my friends say that “the way y'all hangout is almost identical to being in a relationship but its just informal right now” ",1,1758516040.0,CoreyWayne,6,1.0,False

Until five years ago, when my father suffered a massive aneurysm.

He died before I could get to the hospital.

Losing my father crushed me. He was the only person in my life who had enough.

When I was with him, I was enough.

But in the end, I was alone.

I went to the funeral alone. Evelyn, which is what I call my mother now, couldn’t be bothered to leave her charmed life for a one-hour drive to the funeral home. She couldn’t support her only daughter in saying goodbye to her dad.

In the church, I sat among his business associates, staff, and some of his friends. I pretended they were part of my social circle as well, but they weren’t.

I stood on the beach in front of our little cabin and spread his ashes alone, crying my goodbyes against the wind as it came in off the lake to take him away from me.

And now I am alone.

My mother uses me for her own means as she sees fit. She pulls me out and dusts me off when she needs to show how amazing she is. Then she puts me away and forgets about me just as quickly, and for the next six weeks I have to go along with it, as she is holding the one thing I so desperately want over my head.

We weren’t enough. I wasn’t enough.

Now, I’ve just about had enough.

Just about.

\* \* \*

“Hello, Mother. You called?” I try for a cordial tone, but the word “mother” always seems to come out sounding trite.

“Yes, my dear Jayne. I never get to see you anymore.” I roll my eyes at the high pitch of her insincere tone and grit my teeth to hold in my tongue.

Her mock warmth is my first clue that someone else is within earshot, and it is someone she is trying to impress.

“Oh, well, you know me: always busy and stuff. What do you want?” I’ve learned to get to the point quick with her.

“I’m having lunch in the garden with Howard, darling, and I was telling him how you were between jobs, and he said one of the companies he’s invested in is hiring. He doesn’t own it, but he can send over your information if you are interested.” She sounds like she’s trying to be helpful, but I bet she was attempting to feign understanding of her out-of-work daughter, and dear Howard, with his heart of gold, swooped in to help. Now she has no choice but to play along and hope that it will be me who turns down his generous offer.

Not today.

An offer is an offer, and I need a job. Evelyn is the last person I would dare tell my troubles to, but I can only afford a couple more months of rent before I’m forced to grovel for her help, and that is not going to happen.

“That sounds wonderful, Mother.” I jack my sweetness level up to a ten and ask her to put Howard on the phone so I can thank him personally.

Her voice hitches in her throat as she reluctantly passes me off to her newest sugar daddy.

Howard is a nice guy.

I met him when my mother first sank her claws into him and moved into his home a short month later.

He is my mother’s big fish.

Since divorcing my father, she has slowly climbed the ranks of suitors. If they are ever married, Howard will be her fourth husband—although she’s probably told him that he will be her third since she doesn’t count her marriage to Mike. That lasted only two months before she caught him balls deep in the maid and settled with a huge payday.

I still think she bribed that maid to set him up.

Howard is too good for my mother. He reminds me of my dad. The first time I saw them together, he looked content. It was the same look my dad used to have when he talked about having everything he could ever want.

It breaks my heart to see her play a character around him. I know in the end she will only leave him feeling bitter and alone, and I hope he sees her true colors before he gets in too deep.

“Hello, Jayne. How are you doing today?” Howard’s voice is genuine, and it makes me smile into the phone even though there’s no one around to see me.

“I’m wonderful, Howard. How are you?”

We exchange our pleasantries, and he tells me about Hale Property Management. Apparently, due to growth and restructuring, some new departments have been created, and administrative staff is required.

As I thank him for sending my résumé over, he tells me such consideration isn’t required. He says he is close with the owners, and I can report in on Monday unless I hear otherwise from him.

“Yes. Thank you, Howard. I appreciate this.” I don’t hide my excitement.

Howard doesn’t know how much he’s saved me. I’ve been unemployed for three months, and my bank account is dangerously close to overdrawn.

I loved my last job. I did data entry and online research, so I was pretty much left on my own. I put in my time, and I left. All good things must come to an end though, and the company ended up going through massive layoffs. Our department was the first to be outsourced.

I’ve been applying for work ever since.

I’ve had a lot of interviews, but nothing further. The job market is tough right now. Every position has more than enough applicants.

I say another thank you and make up an excuse about shopping for new work clothes, then I ask Howard to say goodbye to my mother for me.

I’m ending my week on a high note, and she’ll only knock me down a few pegs.

1nnd85x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1nnd85x/gd_but_low_blood_sugars/,GD but low blood sugars?,"Hello! 

I was diagnosed early (12 weeks) because of a borderline A1C. I failed the 1 hour and received an automatic diagnosis. I have been monitoring via finger pricks ever since. 

I haven’t had to make any major adjustments other than cutting out sugary drinks (soda, sugary coffee, etc). My fasting and post-meals have always been spectacular. Fasting usually in the low 80s and my post-meal is usually around 110-120. Nothing has spiked me yet - I’ve eaten everything (burger + fries, pizza, pasta (two bowls), bread, donuts, fruit, etc). 

The only symptom I have had is low blood sugar. If I don’t eat the right kind of carbs or enough protein, I start to get clammy, dizzy, and irritable. The result is I have to eat constantly and have a lot of snacks. I’ve had to start carrying hard candy and glucose tabs as a result. 

My question is - can GD swing the opposite way? Instead of causing spikes - causing low readings? I’ve always been perplexed since I did absolutely fail the glucose test but seem to have the opposite experience. My nutritionist has said to keep doing what I’m doing - which is nothing.
 
FWIW I’m 33 weeks and have yet to see any dramatic change in my readings. I think I would have seen it by now. Any insight is appreciated. ",2,1758515907.0,GestationalDiabetes,1,1.0,False

1nnd7p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1nnd7p4/hoping_my_experience_will_help_even_one_or_two/,Hoping my experience will help even one or two people (but not expecting that): Insomnia Victory,"Melatonin. St. John’s Wort. Valerian. Lavender. Ambien. Triavil. Valium. Meditation. Warm milk. Soothing music. Herbal tea. Benadryl. Trazodone.  Tryptophan. Halcion. I’ve had insomnia for many years, on and off. Sometimes there were good “reasons” – chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, infant with medical issues/crises; back pain and jaw pain; broken bone; betrayal and abandonment by long-time partner; family calamities; upheavals; cancer. But other times, there were no reasons at all, just WAKEFULNESS – terrible grueling sleep onset failure. Hour after hour after bloody hour. Like most of you, I tried pretty much everything. But for several months now I have been free of the insomnia curse but for an occasional night. It occurred to me that I might help someone, so I’ll describe what I’ve done.  I am utterly elated to have the gift of sleep.

Since I was about four years old I’ve ended every day the same way; getting into bed and reading, or writing in a journal. Didn’t matter what country or condition – in a tent, in a hotel, in a guest room, in Asia or Canada or Iceland, in any time zone.  (I have more than 150 book-length journals, even though I stopped journaling quite a while back). As a child I hid under the covers with a flashlight and a book. If I was up very late with a sick baby or lustful partner, I still read/wrote afterward.

Now I don’t. It was extremely strange – EXTREMELY STRANGE – to change this habit. It felt utterly alien (and at first VERY depressing and “wrong”). Bedtime meant booktime! But now I get into bed and turn the light out.

Another change: I have always been a night owl, going to bed at 1-2 am even if I had responsibilities four-five hours later, or all night. But now I go to bed at midnight. That isn’t “early” for many people, but for me it is a paradigm shift, a COMPLETE CHANGE.  Again, really strange, like becoming a different species. I always (always) did my best thinking/working after midnight, but now I shut everything down. I don’t even look at Wordle. ;-)

Some other details: I am a high-rev person. There is always a song playing in my head, and I excel at catastrophizing. I mentally replay events, I forecast doom, I am addicted to anxiety and regret and grief. To shut my brain down for sleep is a ridiculous ask (there are several regions in my brain -- one always has a song going, another is inhabiting the past, another is projecting.....). But for many weeks now, I have simply slept (and I have so many dreams!).  It is, frankly, stupefying.

So… this is the summary. I always work out between 9:30-11 pm (always have, I am a lifelong exerciser); I eat raw vegetables about 90 minutes before I go to bed; get in bed, turn the light out, put a warm compress over my eyes for about 10 minutes, then sleep. When I wake up during the night, I go back to sleep within minutes.

Answer to other questions some might have: Bedroom is dark and quiet; I don’t ever drink coffee (never did) or smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol (never did). Never used cannabis.  And no, I don't ""stop screens"" an hour or two before bed.

“Summoned again,” I announce to no one in particular as I trek toward the kitchen for a cup of coffee.

That’s how I feel about my visits with my mother.

She beckons, I go.

Our time together is never enjoyable and often results in me sitting impassively and glaring daggers at the woman who gave birth to me while she speaks—which is rarely with me, unless others are within earshot.

When I was younger, I fought for my relationship with my mother, making excuse after excuse for her horrible behavior until I saw her for what she was: a narcissist too consumed by her own selfishness to see those of us who would have loved her if she had given us the chance.

My desperation turned to disdain, then apathy over the years as I realized there was no place in her life for anything other than her own needs, and that included me. I was merely a tool to help her get what she felt she deserved.

Growing up, I thought my parents had it all, but I blame my starry-eyed ideals on the naivety of my youth. Money is never important to a child. Not when you have attention, affection, and an endless supply of long, sunny days spent playing with your parents at the summer beach house.

I learned quickly how important money is to adults. I’d listen to my parents’ late-night arguments.

Don’t get me wrong. My father made a good living. We were considered rich by many standards, although we never bought many extravagant things. My dad always said, if it worked, secondhand was as good as new.

My mother didn’t share his views. According to her, there was always room to go bigger. She continuously pushed him to work harder so she could buy everything brand new, saying to me, “If someone else didn’t care enough to keep it, it was trash, and we don’t own garbage.”

My father pushed back. He opted to spend his time with us instead of striving to make more than enough at the expense of his connection to his family. I remember him saying, “We have enough money, but I’ll never have enough of the both of you.”

But it was never enough for her.

We were never enough.

Eventually, she left in pursuit of her own treasures, but she didn’t go alone. She made sure to fight for custody since I would come with a hefty monthly check from my father.

The final custody ruling broke my dad’s heart, but we made the most of the time we got to spend together.

Until five years ago, when my father suffered a massive aneurysm.

He died before I could get to the hospital.

Losing my father crushed me. He was the only person in my life who had enough.

When I was with him, I was enough.

But in the end, I was alone.

I went to the funeral alone. Evelyn, which is what I call my mother now, couldn’t be bothered to leave her charmed life for a one-hour drive to the funeral home. She couldn’t support her only daughter in saying goodbye to her dad.

In the church, I sat among his business associates, staff, and some of his friends. I pretended they were part of my social circle as well, but they weren’t.

I stood on the beach in front of our little cabin and spread his ashes alone, crying my goodbyes against the wind as it came in off the lake to take him away from me.

And now I am alone.

My mother uses me for her own means as she sees fit. She pulls me out and dusts me off when she needs to show how amazing she is. Then she puts me away and forgets about me just as quickly, and for the next six weeks I have to go along with it, as she is holding the one thing I so desperately want over my head.

We weren’t enough. I wasn’t enough.

Now, I’ve just about had enough.

Just about.

\* \* \*

“Hello, Mother. You called?” I try for a cordial tone, but the word “mother” always seems to come out sounding trite.

“Yes, my dear Jayne. I never get to see you anymore.” I roll my eyes at the high pitch of her insincere tone and grit my teeth to hold in my tongue.

Her mock warmth is my first clue that someone else is within earshot, and it is someone she is trying to impress.

“Oh, well, you know me: always busy and stuff. What do you want?” I’ve learned to get to the point quick with her.

“I’m having lunch in the garden with Howard, darling, and I was telling him how you were between jobs, and he said one of the companies he’s invested in is hiring. He doesn’t own it, but he can send over your information if you are interested.” She sounds like she’s trying to be helpful, but I bet she was attempting to feign understanding of her out-of-work daughter, and dear Howard, with his heart of gold, swooped in to help. Now she has no choice but to play along and hope that it will be me who turns down his generous offer.

Not today.

An offer is an offer, and I need a job. Evelyn is the last person I would dare tell my troubles to, but I can only afford a couple more months of rent before I’m forced to grovel for her help, and that is not going to happen.

“That sounds wonderful, Mother.” I jack my sweetness level up to a ten and ask her to put Howard on the phone so I can thank him personally.

Her voice hitches in her throat as she reluctantly passes me off to her newest sugar daddy.

Howard is a nice guy.

I met him when my mother first sank her claws into him and moved into his home a short month later.

He is my mother’s big fish.

Since divorcing my father, she has slowly climbed the ranks of suitors. If they are ever married, Howard will be her fourth husband—although she’s probably told him that he will be her third since she doesn’t count her marriage to Mike. That lasted only two months before she caught him balls deep in the maid and settled with a huge payday.

I still think she bribed that maid to set him up.

Howard is too good for my mother. He reminds me of my dad. The first time I saw them together, he looked content. It was the same look my dad used to have when he talked about having everything he could ever want.

It breaks my heart to see her play a character around him. I know in the end she will only leave him feeling bitter and alone, and I hope he sees her true colors before he gets in too deep.

“Hello, Jayne. How are you doing today?” Howard’s voice is genuine, and it makes me smile into the phone even though there’s no one around to see me.

“I’m wonderful, Howard. How are you?”

We exchange our pleasantries, and he tells me about Hale Property Management. Apparently, due to growth and restructuring, some new departments have been created, and administrative staff is required.

As I thank him for sending my résumé over, he tells me such consideration isn’t required. He says he is close with the owners, and I can report in on Monday unless I hear otherwise from him.

“Yes. Thank you, Howard. I appreciate this.” I don’t hide my excitement.

Howard doesn’t know how much he’s saved me. I’ve been unemployed for three months, and my bank account is dangerously close to overdrawn.

I loved my last job. I did data entry and online research, so I was pretty much left on my own. I put in my time, and I left. All good things must come to an end though, and the company ended up going through massive layoffs. Our department was the first to be outsourced.

When I (27F) was 13, I fell in love for the first (and only) time. The guy was my classmate, my ideal type in looks and personality. Because I was shy, I never confessed and instead we became friends (he talked to me haha) and we continued on being friends through my teen years, even after he changed schools. As we became adults and unlike other friends who I naturally drifted apart, we remained good friends. He always dated people, I never did and also never confessed, I truly became comfortable being just friends as that was enough for me, I was content, I didn't feel rushed nor like I was missing something until we drifted at 19 because he dated a girl who isolated him a lot.

By 22, we reconnected and I thought this time we might be headed to more than friends because he asked me on a coffee and movie date, told me he was so nervous to meet, that I looked so pretty... I didn't do anything, believing not rushing was for the best since he had recently broken up a 3 year old relationship. Not the move, he began dating someone else 4 months later. 

Since then, he never broke up, even moved cities, and we remain friends. And I continue not dating. 

I tried, sweat to god I've tried. Men, women, younger than me and older than me... Nothing ever goes beyond a first date that leaves me feeling awkward and comparing them to him. I don't want to do that to people and I truly wish to experience love with someone who will love me back, it's not like no one asked me out or has told me they're interested in me romantically but it seems like I can't never connect, everything always feel so rushed and I keep having a voice in the back of my head saying he'd be better. I also can't confess now, first because I didn't at 15 because of fear of us no longer being friends and second because there's no reason to, he's so in love and I'm truly happy for him but I also don't want to watch him marry and have kids and still experience nothing myself... I need to move on, I just don't know how to.

Being 27 already and watching all my close friends have a significant other is so hard, it's also hard on first dates when they ask me about exes and having to say ""haha, none so far! promise I'm not a psychopath!"" 

It's frustrating and I need help, badly. I've even gone to therapy and they've told me there's nothing specifically wrong with me, I just need to move on but they won't tell me HOW because I need to figure out myself (if I could, I wouldn't have gone to therapy!!!!)

Then she puts me away and forgets about me just as quickly, and for the next six weeks I have to go along with it, as she is holding the one thing I so desperately want over my head.

We weren’t enough. I wasn’t enough.

Now, I’ve just about had enough.

Just about.

\* \* \*

“Hello, Mother. You called?” I try for a cordial tone, but the word “mother” always seems to come out sounding trite.

“Yes, my dear Jayne. I never get to see you anymore.” I roll my eyes at the high pitch of her insincere tone and grit my teeth to hold in my tongue.

Her mock warmth is my first clue that someone else is within earshot, and it is someone she is trying to impress.

“Oh, well, you know me: always busy and stuff. What do you want?” I’ve learned to get to the point quick with her.

“I’m having lunch in the garden with Howard, darling, and I was telling him how you were between jobs, and he said one of the companies he’s invested in is hiring. He doesn’t own it, but he can send over your information if you are interested.” She sounds like she’s trying to be helpful, but I bet she was attempting to feign understanding of her out-of-work daughter, and dear Howard, with his heart of gold, swooped in to help. Now she has no choice but to play along and hope that it will be me who turns down his generous offer.

Not today.

An offer is an offer, and I need a job. Evelyn is the last person I would dare tell my troubles to, but I can only afford a couple more months of rent before I’m forced to grovel for her help, and that is not going to happen.

“That sounds wonderful, Mother.” I jack my sweetness level up to a ten and ask her to put Howard on the phone so I can thank him personally.

Her voice hitches in her throat as she reluctantly passes me off to her newest sugar daddy.

Howard is a nice guy.

I met him when my mother first sank her claws into him and moved into his home a short month later.

He is my mother’s big fish.

Since divorcing my father, she has slowly climbed the ranks of suitors. If they are ever married, Howard will be her fourth husband—although she’s probably told him that he will be her third since she doesn’t count her marriage to Mike. That lasted only two months before she caught him balls deep in the maid and settled with a huge payday.

I still think she bribed that maid to set him up.

Howard is too good for my mother. He reminds me of my dad. The first time I saw them together, he looked content. It was the same look my dad used to have when he talked about having everything he could ever want.

It breaks my heart to see her play a character around him. I know in the end she will only leave him feeling bitter and alone, and I hope he sees her true colors before he gets in too deep.

“Hello, Jayne. How are you doing today?” Howard’s voice is genuine, and it makes me smile into the phone even though there’s no one around to see me.

“I’m wonderful, Howard. How are you?”

We exchange our pleasantries, and he tells me about Hale Property Management. Apparently, due to growth and restructuring, some new departments have been created, and administrative staff is required.

As I thank him for sending my résumé over, he tells me such consideration isn’t required. He says he is close with the owners, and I can report in on Monday unless I hear otherwise from him.

“Yes. Thank you, Howard. I appreciate this.” I don’t hide my excitement.

Howard doesn’t know how much he’s saved me. I’ve been unemployed for three months, and my bank account is dangerously close to overdrawn.

I loved my last job. I did data entry and online research, so I was pretty much left on my own. I put in my time, and I left. All good things must come to an end though, and the company ended up going through massive layoffs. Our department was the first to be outsourced.

I’ve been applying for work ever since.

I’ve had a lot of interviews, but nothing further. The job market is tough right now. Every position has more than enough applicants.

I say another thank you and make up an excuse about shopping for new work clothes, then I ask Howard to say goodbye to my mother for me.

I’m ending my week on a high note, and she’ll only knock me down a few pegs.

Monday can’t come soon enough.",1,1758515510.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

*By Your Humble Sportswriter and Part-Time Stand-Up Comic*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Meltdowns**  
The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (-1.5 to -2.5 spread) are the overwhelming favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.3 to 1.31** (implied probability: **76-77%**). The Chiba Lotte Marines, meanwhile, are priced at **3.4 to 3.6** (25-28% implied), which is about the same chance as winning the lottery if you’re a squirrel with a ticket.

The totals market is equally telling: **7.0 to 7.5 runs**, with the **Under** favored at **1.71 to 1.98**. Why? Recent matchups suggest this series is a pitcher’s duel. The Fighters’ **Fukushima** (7 IP, 2 ER in his last start) is a human fortress, while the Marines’ rotation has been… well, let’s say they’re the reason “porous” entered the baseball lexicon.

**Key stat**: In their September 21 clash, the Fighters crushed the Marines 7-2, with Chiba scoring just **2 runs**—a total that would make a toddler blush at its meager ambition.

---

**2. Digest the News: Ham, Marines, and a 5:56 a.m. Ceremony**  
The Marines are hosting an opening-pitch ceremony at **5:56 a.m.**—because nothing says “sporting spectacle” like a game that starts before most people have finished their coffee. The ceremonial first pitch will be thrown by **Unosawa Yusho**, a player who joined via a social initiative supporting kids in need. While inspiring, this is less “MLB World Series” and more “community service with a side of baseball.”

On the Fighters’ side, manager **Shinjo Tsuyoshi** is one out away from sending **Miyanishi Naoshi** to 900 career games. His September 21 near-miss was so agonizing, he reportedly considered requesting a *reverse play* to keep Miyanishi on the mound. “*リクエストしようかな*,” Shinjo mused, as if asking for a do-over at a buffet.

Meanwhile, the Marines’ offense is about

Not that I was really looking; I’d just promised myself not to go out with any more bastards or womanizers after everything I’d been through.



But that’s when the problem started—or rather, that’s when the problem walked through the door.

Ben’s younger brother, Ethan, walked into Zoe and Ben’s apartment during one of our gatherings, which involved drinking a lot of alcohol and catching up.

I hadn’t heard much about him. All I knew was that he ran the London office and was returning. Anna should have told me he was... \*like that.\*



Just by looking at him, I’d say he was the kind of guy I called a Wolf Charming. That was my antithesis to Prince Charming, who, in my mind, was what I didn’t want but probably should want. But I always thought Prince Charmings were too perfect and, consequently, boring.



The Wolf Charming was my ideal type—the kind who has wild sex with you and takes you roughly, but who has that charming side and treats you like a princess the rest of the time.



That was the impression the tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blonde hair gave me when he walked into the room, dressed in a suit on a Saturday. He looked too elegant and at the same time fierce and virile.



“Wolf Charming?” I whispered to Anna as we moved closer to greet him with the rest of the group.

Anna, my best friend, was probably the main reason I had this idea of finding the right guy stuck in my head.



Not that she had told me to do it, but simply because she was married to Will, the hottest and sexiest tattooed ex-player and nerd I had ever met. They were perfect together.



I was still trying to convince the two of them to donate some of Will’s DNA, so I could clone him in a lab. I always say it’s unfair that there’s only one Will. Anna hit the jackpot, and of course, so did Will.

“Bastard Charming, from what I’ve heard from Will,” she whispered back.

My smile faded instantly. Not that I judged before getting to know someone—I didn’t do that; I hated stereotypes and typification as a good scientist should—but hearing that would put any smart woman on guard.



In recent months, I’d worked hard to stay away from any womanizers, bastards, and players in New York.

Swallowing the last sip of beer, I leaned forward, placing the bottle on the coffee table before it was my turn to greet the man with striking light brown eyes. He was a good twenty centimeters taller than me, even in heels.



My stomach churned as I forced a smile in response to his, which revealed perfect teeth.



\*Damn... he’s fucking gorgeous.\*

I blinked, trying to snap out of the trance.



“Nice to meet you, Ethan. I’m Ellie. Welcome back to New York,” I said, offering my hand while my heart pounded in my chest.



I ignored that, along with the shiver that ran down my spine. Maybe it was because everyone around us was staring with some strange expectation, as if something screamed, two single people in the room, not just me as always.



“Nice to meet you, Ellie.” He shook my hand firmly.



I tried to ignore the quick once-over he gave me, spending way too much time focusing on my breasts. I pulled back as soon as he let go of my hand.





Ben, Will, and Jack gathered on the sofas after Ethan’s arrival, and I pulled Anna into the kitchen for another drink.



“His eyes are just like Ben’s,” she commented.



Yeah, those brown eyes were hypnotic.



“So is the reputation, I mean, before he married Zoe,” I said, making us both laugh. “But don’t let her know I brought that up. She’d eat me alive.”



Zoe and Bennett, or simply Ben, were another couple in my group of friends who were probably influencing me, though I think in a slightly \*different\* way than Anna and Will.

That’s because both of them were assholes who fell in love before they could kill each other. I don’t know how they’re still alive, maybe because they took out all their anger on each other through sex.



“He checked out your boobs,” Anna said as we entered the kitchen.



Stifling a laugh, she leaned against the island while I got busy opening two beers.





“You managed to notice that? I thought it was in a split second.”



“I think everyone noticed.”



“Ugh! Why was everyone staring?”



“Maybe because you’re the only singles in the room? That makes it interesting to watch when you’re married.”





“Do you really need to remind me? And it’s not like anything’s going to happen between us.”





“I know, I know. No scumbags, bastards, or womanizers. I’ve been hearing that for over a year now?”



“And you’ll keep hearing it until I find the right guy.” I handed her one of the beer bottles.

“To the right guy! May he show up soon!” She raised her bottle, proposing a toast, forcing me to do the same. “And end your bad mood with lots of sex!” she concluded.

“Hey! What bad mood?”



“Excuse me!” The deep voice sounded before he entered the kitchen.



His presence alone was enough to make me uncomfortable.



“Mind if I find Ben’s wine stash?” he asked, making Anna turn to face him.



“I’ll help you,” she offered, guiding him to the wall-mounted wine rack behind me.

I took a long sip of my beer, getting lost in my own thoughts as they discussed wines behind me.



“What do you Morgans take? I know Bennett goes to the gym almost every day, but nothing justifies you growing that much, not just in height,” Anna suddenly said, nearly making me spit out my beer.





God! She, as always, with no filter. I heard him let out a low laugh.



“You’re the scientist, right? Then you can explain genetics.”





“I think there are some things that even scientists like us can’t explain, right, El?” she said, forcing me to turn to them.





“Of course! Whatever you’re talking about, I’m with you.”



“So, you’re also a scientist?” He raised an eyebrow at me.



“Yes, more of a researcher these days.”



“I admit, I had a very different image of scientists in mind,” he said, not bothering to hide the way his eyes moved over my body, leaving me uneasy.

Chapter 2

ELLIE



\*Shit, Ellie, focus.\* He’s definitely not the right guy; he’s more like the completely wrong guy.

I blinked, trying to remember what he had just said.



“Let me guess... White lab coat, glasses, test tubes, and a total nerd?” I raised an eyebrow.

He nodded.

“Something like that.”

“Don’t be fooled. We spend ninety percent of the time dressed exactly like that,” Anna said. “But even now, the nerdiness remains.”

That’s right. That’s my girl.



“You just forgot to mention that we wear high heels,” I added, winking at her.

Ethan sighed.



“That’s the closest you got to making the image of a scientist sexy. Well, thanks for the help, Anna. Finish what you’re doing and join us; it’ll be the first time I’ve had the chance to talk nonsense in front of two scientists,” he said before leaving.



“What the hell was that?” I asked, frowning.



“What?”

“‘What do you take?’”





“It was just curiosity. The man is... huge!”





“As if that’s uncommon and Will isn’t just as big or bigger.”







“Well, Will is... Will.” She shrugged.















“Great argument.”



“What I mean is that Will works out a lot and runs regularly.”



“What I mean is that your question sounded like flirting. It’s obvious he spends a lot of time at the gym.”

arried; it couldn’t have sounded like flirting.”



“You’re terrible!” I laughed.





“I was just trying to be nice.”

“I get it. Where were we?”





“I think we were praying for your ideal guy to show up so you can have lots of sex?”



You make me sound desperate.”



“I know you’re not. But you really do need to get laid.”



“Just because you have sex every day doesn’t mean everyone else has to. People do other... things.”



You don’t have to do it every day, at least once a month, but never once a year.”



“What are you getting at?”



“You tell me... How long has it been?”



“That’s enough.”







\*A year? Maybe more. It was with that lawyer I met through work. He was hot but too busy. A shame.\*















“You’re trying to remember, aren’t you?”















“This conversation is over. My sex life isn’t important when all the available men are bastards.”















“Don’t forget Will and Ben’s past. I don’t forget. So there’s still hope. Sometimes a bastard just needs to discover love.”















“Thanks, but I don’t want to be the reason any bastard changes. And Will and Ben were always good men. Sleeping with lots of people doesn’t make you a bastard. Only when you lie and deceive.”















“I wouldn’t bet on them,” she said, surprising me.















“We’re talking about your husband.”















“I know.”















I blinked, considering it for a moment.















“Come to think of it... neither would I,” I agreed, making us burst into laughter.

Down a road I seldom drive down, the Comenara parkway, replete with trees and winding curves, like a gentle rocking of a cradle by a forest.

A few months ago R had invited me to coffee. He liked to hear about what I was doing, the things I was curious about, the gabble of interesting things I had picked up in reading of late. By then, his medical situation was burgeoning into a storm. It claimed him much faster than anyone realized it would.

As I drove, I felt this memory so fresh, so present, and at the same moment, the finality of it.

Each time in my life that Death has appeared, I have given him a nod. There’s a lesson from the ages, to live now, while you can.

Amongst the things that Dad inculcated into my bones, deeply etched, the suddenness of the ending. The surprise that it seems to be.

There’s also surprise amongst the living in how quickly the energy of life flows away. The DVD you borrowed for them, the reminder on their birthday, the small things they added to the richness of your life. And then silence. Except for the echoes of memory.

For those who I have loved and lost, those echoes are like birdsong. Somewhere in the world, someone is singing the melody these people made in my life. The commonality they shared with all things of love, that surely resonate in the same frequencies. These things that make up an inestimable layer of what is, unseen and yet felt, present in all things. These waves of love will resurface and repeat because they must, and in each of them is encoded what we have meant to one another.",1,1758514963.0,RawAbsurdity,0,1.0,False
