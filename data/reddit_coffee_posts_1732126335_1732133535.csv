I start my KPMG internship in June 2025 and I’m very anxious to start. I’m in a part time MBA program and can work full time while I finish school. 

I asked the recruiter and they said they I can’t start in January, but I’m about to reach out to the two folks I interviewed with for a coffee chat to try and work my magic.

The professionals at my wife’s treatment center told me to go to Al-Anon. “Alcoholism is a disease,” they said.  
  
I was working my way into an ulcer, had almost constant anger, high blood pressure, insomnia, and could not accept that she was sick. “If it will help her, I’ll do it,” I said as if I were doing just fine.  
  
The meeting was on a Sunday in a rural community, thirty miles from home. I didn’t think anyone there would know me. They knew me all right, as no one before had ever known me.  
  
Subconsciously, I tried the 58-minute meeting: arrive a little late, leave a little early, and don’t talk to anyone.  
  
The First Step identified the problem. I accepted my view of powerlessness and unmanageability immediately. Powerlessness and unmanageability were the result of lack of knowledge and technique on my part. One of you experts would have the hook I could use which would get my wife to behave and all would be well.  
  
The only other man in the room basically tackled me in the parking lot, and tricked me into going to the Wednesday Night Men’s meeting at a treatment center in the city. After that meeting, three of us stood in a light rain, under a street light, as I poured out the details of my sorry lot in life.  
  
On the way home, I realized two things: they listened; and they didn’t tell me what to do. After three weeks of meetings, a long-timer asked me to make coffee. “Someone did,” I said.  
  
“I didn’t mean tonight,” he replied, “I meant for October, November, and December.” This request didn’t sound like a suggestion, but it led to years of service.  
  
My name would magically show up places-to share, or serve as Group Treasurer. I wound up on a panel on serenity at an Al-Anon workshop that way. I didn’t think I had any serenity that day. “That’s all right,” I was told. “Tell us how you lost it.”  
  
Today, I view powerlessness as a daily gift from God. The first Three Steps in six words: I can’t. He can. Let Him. If I fully accept the first Three Steps, the rest of my life is none of my business.  
  
When you talk to your boss on the job, you can ask: Who? What? When? Where?-Never “why?” “Why” is a management question, and with the Third Step, we are under new management. If the rest of my life is none of my business, then certainly my loved ones’ lives are none of my business either. They also have a Higher Power, and it is not me.

This is not talked about enough.

It was never just about technicals or some magical thing to say on a coffee chat to get a job.

It was simply about showing how you can help. How you can help the company for which you want to work and what you're willing to do to help (even creating this impression in the mind of the right decision-maker can land you the job).

Showing how you can help takes a lot of reps (lots of messages, lots of conversations, and yes this is hard, which is why accountability and constant mindset monitoring is crucial) and that's what we'll be helping with through [High Finance School](https://www.skool.com/high-finance-school-9048/about), a group with a top finance coach **who has placed 150+ students in high finance roles**.

1gvyun1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaganoTonicResult/comments/1gvyun1/how_to_take_nagano_tonic/,how to take nagano tonic,"Nagano Tonic has gained popularity for its unique blend of natural ingredients and health benefits. Whether you’re looking to improve digestion, boost energy, or support overall wellness, this tonic can be a great addition to your daily routine. To maximize its effectiveness, understanding how to take it properly is crucial. This guide provides detailed instructions and tips on how to incorporate Nagano Tonic into your lifestyle effectively.

# What is Nagano Tonic?

Nagano Tonic is a health supplement inspired by traditional Japanese remedies. It combines a mix of herbs, antioxidants, and nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism, improve gut health, and support weight loss. The tonic is often praised for being easy to consume and free from artificial additives.

# Why is It Important to Take Nagano Tonic Correctly?

Proper usage ensures you receive the maximum benefits of the tonic. Misusing or overusing the product can lead to diminished results or potential side effects. Following the recommended dosage and timing not only enhances effectiveness but also ensures safety.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Taking Nagano Tonic

# 1. Check the Label

Before using any supplement, always read the label for dosage recommendations, ingredients, and potential allergens. Nagano Tonic typically includes directions on:

* The ideal dosage amount.
* When to consume it.
* Whether to take it on an empty stomach or with food.

# 2. Choose the Right Dosage

The standard dosage for Nagano Tonic is usually one to two tablespoons (about 15-30 ml) daily. However, this can vary based on:

* Your health goals.
* Age and body weight.
* Specific recommendations from a healthcare provider.

Start with the minimum dosage and gradually increase if needed, ensuring your body adjusts well to the tonic.

# 3. Time It Right

Timing plays a significant role in how effective the tonic is. Here are some general guidelines:

* **Morning:** Taking the tonic on an empty stomach can kickstart metabolism and energy levels for the day.
* **Before Meals:** Consuming it 15–30 minutes before meals may aid digestion and help control appetite.
* **Evening:** If you aim to relax or improve digestion overnight, taking it after dinner might be beneficial.

Experiment with timings to see what works best for you.

# 4. Mix with Water or Juice

Nagano Tonic is often concentrated, so mixing it with water or juice is recommended for better taste and easier consumption. Here’s how to prepare it:

1. Measure the recommended dosage using a spoon or measuring cup.
2. Dilute it in a glass of water (200-300 ml) or your preferred juice.
3. Stir well and drink it immediately.

Avoid mixing it with hot liquids, as high temperatures can reduce the potency of its active ingredients.

# 5. Stay Consistent

Consistency is key when taking Nagano Tonic. Daily consumption is important for long-term benefits. Create a routine, such as setting a reminder or pairing it with another daily habit like brushing your teeth or preparing breakfast.

# 6. Pair with a Healthy Lifestyle

While Nagano Tonic is a great supplement, combining it with a healthy diet and regular exercise enhances its effectiveness. Focus on eating nutrient-rich foods, staying hydrated, and maintaining an active lifestyle.

# Additional Tips for Taking Nagano Tonic

# 1. Monitor Your Body's Response

Pay attention to how your body reacts to the tonic. If you notice any adverse effects, such as digestive discomfort or allergic reactions, reduce the dosage or discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

# 2. Store it Properly

To maintain its quality and potency:

* Store Nagano Tonic in a cool, dry place.
* Keep it away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.
* Seal the bottle tightly after each use.

# 3. Avoid Overconsumption

More isn’t always better. Stick to the recommended dosage, as overconsumption can lead to side effects like stomach upset or nutrient imbalances.

# 4. Consult a Doctor

If you’re pregnant, nursing, taking medications, or have underlying health conditions, consult a healthcare provider before using Nagano Tonic.

# Who Can Take Nagano Tonic?

Nagano Tonic is generally safe for most adults, but certain groups may benefit more from its use:

* **People aiming to lose weight:** The tonic’s metabolism-boosting properties can support weight management goals.
* **Individuals with digestive issues:** Its ingredients promote gut health and improve digestion.
* **Those seeking natural energy:** The tonic’s antioxidant-rich formula helps combat fatigue.

However, it may not be suitable for:

* Children under 18 years.
* Individuals allergic to any of its ingredients.

# Benefits of Taking Nagano Tonic Properly

By following the correct method, you can experience various benefits, such as:

1. **Improved Metabolism:** Helps the body burn calories more efficiently.
2. **Enhanced Digestion:** Reduces bloating and supports gut health.
3. **Increased Energy Levels:** Boosts stamina and reduces fatigue.
4. **Weight Management:** Aids in controlling appetite and promoting fat loss.
5. **Overall Wellness:** Provides essential nutrients and antioxidants.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# 1. Skipping Days

Inconsistent use can delay results. Make it a part of your daily routine.

# 2. Taking It with Alcohol

Mixing the tonic with alcoholic beverages can interfere with its effectiveness.

# 3. Not Diluting Properly

Drinking the tonic undiluted may lead to a strong taste or irritation in the throat. Always dilute it as recommended.

# 4. Ignoring Potential Allergies

If you’re allergic to any of its components, avoid using it to prevent adverse reactions.

# FAQs About Taking Nagano Tonic

# 1. Can I take Nagano Tonic on an empty stomach?

Yes, taking it on an empty stomach, especially in the morning, can enhance its absorption and effectiveness.

# 2. How long does it take to see results?

Results vary depending on individual health and consistency. Most users report noticeable benefits within 4–6 weeks of regular use.

# 3. Can I mix it with tea or coffee?

It’s best to avoid mixing Nagano Tonic with hot beverages, as heat can reduce the efficacy of its active ingredients.

# 4. Is it safe for long-term use?

Yes, Nagano Tonic is designed for long-term use when taken as directed. However, periodic consultations with a healthcare provider are recommended.

# 5. What if I miss a dose?

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but do not double the dosage. Resume your regular schedule the next day. [Watch Nagano Tonic Video Before Buying This Product](https://youtu.be/6769Sdf0J88?si=aUIwdHilXmhrG5rA)

I am currently on 60mg Strattera and 20mg Adderall plus 150mg extended release Wellbutrin and Lexapro for depression (plus meds for hypertension and gout). But I've been able to see improvement in everything except focusing while reading (and I'm an English professor :-) - I find it actually makes me a good close reader because I usually have to read things 3 times).

I am 54 and was just diagnosed a couple of years ago. I had no idea that my impulsivity and ""counterwill"" (I would often get into fights and have horrible road rage) were related to ADHD until I started reading about it, and the lightbulb lit up. I am in therapy to help work through the emotional and behavioral stuff, and my motivation has gotten better - I find strict routine helps to keep me on track, and I think this is what helped me be successful throughout my education as well. I also have found, surprisingly, that being in a coffee shop type environment with a lot of people around talking has kept me ""present"" in my ability to work (unless someone has a speakerphone or other electronic speaking device on, I have found out)- otherwise my mind would be wandering all over the place. But I still struggle with focus, especially when reading. 

Have you had any experience with specific medications or with techniques that would help you to focus while reading? Any advice or shared experiences would be helpful! ",2,1732133219.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1gvyuah,https://www.reddit.com/r/drivinganxiety/comments/1gvyuah/ptsd_from_car_wreck_upcoming_drive/,"PTSD from Car Wreck, upcoming drive","Hi all,

I've never claimed the pstd label that my psychiatrist tried to label me with, but, with an upcoming cross-state move, I am now understanding what it actually means. I got into a really bad car wreck in the middle of nowhere, Texas, in 2019. I initially wasn't phased. No one else was involved, it was early morning and I was driving in the rain and the car lost traction, hit the sidewall, and flipped several times. It happened so fast, my coffee didn't fall out of the cup holder and I didn't realized I had rolled until my mother went to look at the car a few weeks later and saw scratches on the roof. I was extremely lucky to get out without harming anyone else and not a single scratch.

*I wouldn't say my fear is of driving, but of having a medical emergency or accident in the middle of nowhere.* I'm fine driving around town, but I never go for far drives. I even missed a concert recently that also would've been 4 hours away because I didn't want to drive.

Had I been hurt, which could have happened since my air bag never deployed because it was faulty, I would have had to wait a long while for help to arrive, load me up, and then drive me to the nearest hospital.  So, that's the main driver for my anxiety. I really don't enjoy living in such a large state.

As a child, teen- hell, any age before my wreck, I was okay on long rides. Had to take them often as my parents dropped me off between Dallas and Houston when it was their turn to have time with me. I seem to be at ease when someone else is with me, whether they're driving or not, because I feel I have someone to support me.

Now, I have a 4 hour drive with 4 cats, driving my father's giant truck while he drives the Uhaul, and I'm afraid that I'll have a panic attack, a stress-induced migraine, or simply be hyperventilating and possible faint mid-driving. I'm a month out until the move.

How can I prepare? What have you done to help yourself?

I put the game on pause and went to grab my coffee.

When I come back I get a message that somebody has given me a number of ""AI ship modules"" or something. OK cool I thought, that's nice of them. Anyway after meeting Nada, I left and went back to the local space station. After checking these ""modules"" it seems that they're worthless other than for trading, so I sold them and...

...they were worth just north of 600'000'000 units - I simply didn't think to check the value of the items before I sold them.

OK I really do appreciate the generosity of the player that did this, but I kind of feel that I've cheated - even if it wasn't my fault. In one way I'm happy that it can remove the grind, but in another way I feel I've had a certain challenge of the gameplay removed from me.

He then switched me to 10MG adderall xr. I feel no different at all. I'm still a blind task rabbit moving from one thing to another. I honestly think I was more focused when I was drinking coffee. 

Also I mentioned to him that the one good thing about the strattera is that it got me to stop impulse eating, and drinking. He told me the adderall would do the same thing even better. It hasn't, if anything I'm eating more on it at this point.

Afterwards my girlfriend and i got back together but i never told her about the friendship i had during the time we had broken up, because i didnt think it really mattered much.

Fast forward a bit to a few years ago, an old co worker who was tattooing in a shop that i was looking to get an apprentiship at told me about her job, i asked if i could ask her questions about how to persue getting an apprentiship and we agreed to meet at a public park and she would give me advice. I had mentioned to my girlfriend that i bumped into her but didnt give the full context because it didnt seem like a big deal to me because it was about persuing a job. 

Later on down the road my old coworker was let go from the tattoo shop and had asked if i would drive her to get her stuff from the shop, and i agreed. We picked her stuff up and i dropped her off at her building. I didnt mention it because it took maybe 10 minutes of my time to do and i didnt feel it was all that important. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, i now am tattooing as a job. I had a client from out of town who was visiting her friend for the day. I wasn't at the shop, she wanted to discuss getting a leg sleeve of video game characters and asked if id meet at starbucks to plan out the tattoo ideas, i said sure, it seemed harmless. She bought me a coffee we talked about it and then my girlfriend texted me to pick her up from work. 

I said goodbye, got in the car with the drink and drove to get her from work. She saw the starbucks cup with another girls name on it and flipped out and started to take pictures of the cup with her phone, i tried to grab the cup from her and as i was driving, i pulled over so i could grab the cup from her she flipped out and got out of the car, i asked her to get back in she refused and out of anger i drove off to calm myself.

I went back to get her about 5 minutes after, she refused to come home. Later on that night she had came back but with the police and refused to talk to me other than saying we were done. The police told me i had a time limit to leave my apartment with whatever i could take with me, and now im currently staying at my brothers. 

once we started to talk again, it came to light about the other people from that i mentioned above. she said that i cheated on her, but i felt i did not because there was no sexual intent or even romantic involvement with these people but she claimes its emotionally cheating and worth ending a 13 year relationship over. In my mind i feel it would be no different than hanging out with a friend.

These are things i feel we should be able to work through and overcome but she feels that its impossible to do so.

Am i in the wrong here? Because i lost the love of my life over something i didnt think mattered all that much, but again she claimes this is betrayal.

I wake up at 6am to workout until 8am, then work at 9am. I need a bit more time than him in the morning because I have to make and eat breakfast with my medicine, and I also usually take a bit longer to get ready. I make coffee and he doesn’t. He rolls out of bed, gyms, comes back and starts work.

Lately he’s told me that my earlier wake up is disturbing him. He said he’s a light sleeper and the light in the common area wakes him up. The other day I forgot to close the door so the next time I made sure to close the door and got ready in the dark. 

We have a bed that regulates temperatures on both side. I use a vibrating wrist alarm and get up immediately. I sleep with a mask on my eyes and we have blackout curtains. 

I still woke him up. He said that the hour of sleep lost is greatly affecting his morning routine and making him exhausted. For context we’ve also been trying to work on going to sleep earlier, because I’ve been very tired. Usually we’d stay up having s*x, and deciding we need to start earlier. We have had some issues sticking to that, he’s woken me up for s*x a few times late a night. We both have a high libido. 

I suggested that maybe if he was light sleeper and I was still disturbing him, he could get up at the same time as me, if he goes to bed at the same time as me. He said there’s “nothing” for him to do with the extra hour and would rather just sleep. But he doesn’t want me to miss out on my workout routine and understand that I can’t push it back any further because of needing extra time to eat in the morning. 

I also brought up how if we go to sleep around the same time he isn’t losing an hour of sleep. He said that was easier said than done.

I feel a bit at a loss. I don’t know if there’s anyway for me to be quieter. I think at most I could wake up probably 15 minutes later to make it to my workout class on time. 

Any ideas?

1gvyqo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gvyqo8/the_forgotten_phone/,The forgotten phone,"One lazy Sunday afternoon, Sunny and I were hanging out at my place. We had just finished a binge-watching session of our favorite series when he got a call and had to leave in a hurry.

An hour later, I noticed he had left his phone on the coffee table. Naturally, I texted him from my phone to let him know. But before he replied, the screen lit up with a notification.

It was a text from someone named R. It simply read:
""Did you tell anyone yet?""

Now, I’m not one to snoop, but that message made my mind race. Tell anyone about what?

Sunny returned a little while later, and I handed him his phone.
“Forgot something?” I teased, hoping he’d explain on his own.
He chuckled. “Yeah, thanks. I’d lose my head if it wasn’t attached.”

But when I asked casually, “Who’s R?” his smile faded.
“No one important,” he said quickly, pocketing his phone.
“Come on, Sunny, it’s me. What’s going on?”
“Nothing! Just... forget it.”

The way he avoided eye contact made me suspicious, but I decided to let it go.

The next day, though, R’s message stuck in my mind. What could be so secret that Sunny didn’t even trust me with it? I debated whether I should ask him again or just wait for him to tell me in his own time.

When I brought it up one more time, Sunny sighed and said, “Alright, I’ll tell you, but it stays between us.”
Turns out, R was a mutual friend who was planning a big surprise party for someone we both knew—and Sunny was sworn to secrecy. He had been stressed about keeping it under wraps, which explained his behavior.

I laughed at how dramatic I’d made it in my head, but Sunny gave me a playful shove. “See why I didn’t want to say anything? You’re way too curious!”

1gvymkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1gvymkr/mixed_experience_with_elvanse_looking_for_advice/,"Mixed Experience with Elvanse - Looking for Advice
","**TL;DR:** Started Elvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) 20mg a month ago and experienced initial euphoria but quickly faced disrupted sleep and later extreme fatigue. Got sick around the same time (possibly COVID), stopped meds to recover, and restarted at 30mg. Now struggling with heavy fatigue, high heart rate, and inability to rest or nap, despite good sleep at night. Fatigue is impacting my ability to function, and I feel “activated” all day. Scheduled to meet my prescriber next week, but looking for insights and similar experiences.



Hi everyone,

So here’s my experience with Elvanse (Lisdexamfetamine), aka Vyvanse in the US, over the past month. I started on **20mg daily** and initially felt amazing—focused, energized, and more like able to just listen to music without multitasking, or being able to just go out for a walk by myself both things that I was struggling a lot with in the past. But this “honeymoon phase” only lasted 1–2 days, which is something that I'm aware that it is to be expected. 



The positive executive function effects still remain until now. But this is where the good ends...



**20mg Phase:**

**Sleep issues:** After the first few days, I started waking up every 2–3 hours at night and struggled to fall back asleep.

Around day 3–4, I got sick (possibly COVID but not sure; I experienced a loss of smell). This illness lasted about two weeks, and I was *completely drained*. I stopped Vyvanse during the flu because it made me feel too activated to rest or recover properly.

After recovering, I noticed lingering fatigue and breathlessness that made even short walks hard. Living alone, this was particularly tough.



**30mg Phase (Been on it for 2 weeks now):**

Once I felt better, I started **30mg** as recommended by my prescriber. Initially, I felt a surge of energy in my brain but not my body—it’s hard to explain, but my body felt extremely fatigued.

**Sleep improved** after the first 4–5 days on this dose, but the fatigue persisted and worsened.

My heart rate is consistently high, often 80–100 bpm while sitting, and there are days where it's realy bad and it can spike to 130–140 bpm with light activity like cooking.

**Napping is impossible:** Even when exhausted, I can’t nap because my brain and body feel too activated. This amplifies my fatigue and makes me feel trapped in a cycle of exhaustion.



**Other Observations:**

I’ve been careful with **diet, hydration, and supplements** (magnesium glycinate, vitamin D, B vitamins, etc.). I don’t drink alcohol or coffee.

I’ve always had good sleep hygiene—always asleep by midnight and up around 9 AM.

Despite this, my fatigue is visible in my face and energy levels. Most days, I can only manage a couple of tasks before feeling completely wiped.

Some days, my blood pressure borders on hypertension. The fatigue and heaviness vary but are persisting if not worsening day by day.



**Health Background:**

I had blood work in September, which showed no thyroid issues. My prescriber ordered more tests to rule out inflammation or other causes.

I have the **thalassemia trait**, which affects red blood cells and hemoglobin (**Smaller Red Blood Cells** but the body compensates by having more of them). Could this contribute to my fatigue?



**My Struggles:**

I feel like I haven’t been able to fully rest in over a month. My prescriber attributes some of this to recovering from illness, possibly long COVID, but I’m not sure how much is due to the medication. Even though the sleep problems resolved, the **fatigue, heaviness, and high heart rate** remain, making socializing and daily life feel impossible. I just want to have one day where I can truly relax, but Vyvanse keeps me in a state of overdrive. I have been doing a lot of reading regarding similar experiences but it was impossible to find other cases of this extreme heaviness. It's almost as if I can feel my body weights more, sometimes I feel like that's happening to my head, I'm having difficulty keeping it up and I need to support with with my arms when sitting and doing work. Mind you that while walking I usually don't experience this heaviness that much.



**My Questions:**

Should I stick it out and give my body more time to adjust?

* Is 30mg too high?
* Could Vyvanse just not be the right medication for me?
* Has anyone else experienced this “body fatigue” or inability to nap on stimulants?



Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot right now. Thank you! 🙏",1,1732132717.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

This is neither here nor there, but I stayed as part of a work event so I did not have to pay for the room myself. That should not matter, but I wanted to include that as a disclaimer.

I realize that *some* of this is splitting hairs, but if I had paid $1100 - $1500/night I would have been wildly disappointed.

>\- Upon arrival/check in (4pm), our bed was missing two pillows. Like the bed was 100% made, with the decorative pillow in the middle etc and Lee's side of the bed was just empty.

>\- I texted the number listed for the concierge and never received a reply. We left for a bit to walk around, came back and still no pillows. So I had to go to the front desk and tell them we were missing pillows. Unclear at what point they *did* bring pillows because we didn't return to our room between 5 - 9 as there was a welcome dinner; during which time they did turn-down service.

>\- The next day we left our room from 8:30 - 11 for two scheduled spa services and then breakfast. During which, our rooms were not made up -- even though I put the service light on. Maybe that's asking too much, but you'd think since they knew we'd be gone they'd have housekeeping come then.

>\- We were gone from 1:30pm - 9:30pm on a wine tasting/dinner event with the group. Housekeeping did come during that time but they...didn't do turn-down service.

1gvyif1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vail/comments/1gvyif1/thinking_about_moving_to_vail_but_i_have_some/,"Thinking about moving to vail, but I have some questions","I used to go to Vail every winter season and every other summer with my family. I plan to move there in the next couple years when I have completed graduate school. I will be in my late 20s. 

I love Vail. I think living there would be great for me. Being surrounded by beautiful nature and having many opportunities to be active is so appealing to me. 

I was curious what it is like socially in Vail among the full time residents? Where do you find people? Are most people working almost all the time?

I am only a little worried about the social scene because I haven’t skied in years which essentially puts me at a beginner level. I will likely take lessons and ski a good amount once I live there. However, I probably won’t ski all the time because I know it is dangerous and I’m not the most experienced. I’m curious if I will be an odd one for not being a huge pro skier? I really enjoy walking and I cannot wait to do nice hikes and even some walks on the paved paths next to creeks. I remember some gyms offered squash, tennis, pickleball, etc, which I am excited about. 

How reliable is public transportation in the off season? Do the buses run on time? I am especially drawn to moving to Vail because it has such good infrastructure for snow and ice. I want to avoid driving during the winter as much as I can, even when I am commuting to work. Luckily, my job and housing would be a short walking distance from vail bus stops.

I’m also a bit of an introvert and I’d be moving to vail alone and as a woman. I enjoy frequenting coffee shops, cafes, dive bars, bookstores, etc. Are there a good number of these places in the Vail area? Are there good people to meet at spots like these?",0,1732132431.0,vail,0,0.33,False

I just got Blue Tokai Unakki Estate (French press grind, if that matters). I was really excited to try it, but as soon as I opened the bag, my excitement went down a bit. It didn’t smell good, but I thought maybe some coffees just aren’t very pleasant to smell.

Now, I'm not an expert taste tester by any stretch of the word, especially not when it comes to coffee, but that's how I felt it tasted.

Is it supposed to taste like that? Did I get a bad batch of coffee? Will it taste better as it ages, or did I just make a mistake while brewing? I'm just confused. Please someone enlighten me on what's going on.

**Memory transcription subject: Avery I. Wingate, Florida man, Venlil-human exchange participant**



Date \[standardized human time\]: September 5th, 2136

  


With our new friends' first day at my home over with, there was still the issue of finding a larger car as I had gotten tickets to the Jacksonville Jaguars. I had won a raffle a while back and won eight tickets to the game with field level seating at the fifty yard line. My mom was a legacy ticket holder which meant we got to park close to the stadium instead of finding a spot a few miles away.



My only issue now is that I would need to find a car for all of us. I booted up a few car rental websites to hopefully find something reasonably priced. Searching through the websites I came across the perfect vehicle, an older Rivian R1S. It had seven seats and autonomous driving capabilities which is perfect for us. I ordered it as my first action of the day, the confirmation email said it would drive itself here within two hours.



I had awoken a bit earlier than Sheva and managed to shimmy my arms out of her tight grasp to look for the car on my phone. The movement and light from my phone must have woken her up as she nuzzled into the back of my head.



“Good waking Avery\~”



“Good morning love\~”



She pulled me closer and gave me some loving licks on my cheek which I returned with a kiss on her snout. There are some things we need to do to prepare for the game tomorrow, the first being telling everyone about the game. The first to know would be the love of my life Sheva.



“So before first contact even happened I had won a raffle for eight tickets to a Jacksonville Jaguars game against the Houston Texans.”



“Jaguar translated as a large jungle predator, what is this game?” She had worry in her voice when she mentioned the Jaguar.



“So football is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.”



“Huh that sounds complicated, is there anything else I need to know about it?”



“Yep there is a phrase every fan knows that you should know.”



“What is it?”



“I would like you to turn your translator off to hear and repeat it back to me okay?”



“Sure Avery.” She reached around her head and pushed into her skin and dragged it. 



Then she flicked her ears at me which I interpreted as ready to go. I grasped her paw and sounded off the rallying cry the entire county knows.



“DUUUVAL”



She was surprised by the sound but quickly adjusted and first started to sound out the syllables then went all out.



“Du-val, Duval. Duval. Duval! DUUUVAL!”



I brought her in a loving hug while she switched on her translator back on. She returned the hug and pressed her head against mine.



“Your voice is so cute Sheva.”



“Thank you Avery, I love you.”



“I love you too, Sheva. Let's get up and get ready, I have to make a big breakfast for everyone.”



She picked me up and got off the bed while heading to our closet. Most of the clothes are mine but I had a small section dedicated to her bags as she didn’t have much clothes. But today we needed to head to the store to get everyone ready for the game tomorrow.



Walking down into the kitchen we were the first to awake which was rare. I started a pot of coffee for everyone and started to pull out some fruits and pre-made biscuits with a selection of jams. I also pulled out a few fruits that go well with other breakfast items.



Varro, Mudim and Aloysra were still asleep on the couch when we came down. We tried our best to be quiet when prepping breakfast but the coffee maker was pretty loud when it started to make the coffee. Varro and Mudim's ears perked up at the noise while they slowly woke up. Their movement woke up Aloysra as well with her head popping out of Mudim’s pouch, her little face was still half asleep. But when she noticed me her face lit up and she couldn’t sit still in the pouch.



I had ordered a few artificial pouches that are used for orphaned Kangaroos in Australia so I can comfortably hold Aloysra. They had arrived just last night and I would sew a few to some clothing and keep the rest as is for her to cuddle up in. 



“Good morning y’all, breakfast should be ready soon. Can I get y’all some coffee?”



“What's that? “ Mudim asked, still trying to wake up.



“It is a heated bean juice that helps wake you up. It's a bit bitter by itself but I have sugar and coconut cream to add in. All of these are from a local brand called Maxwell house, its good to the last drop.”



“I’ll take a cup please.”



Once the coffee was finished being made I took a few cups out and poured the coffee in each but left room for sugar and coconut creamer. While I did this Varro made his way into the kitchen to join his wife and Joey. He raised an inquisitive ear at the coffee cups before grabbing one and taking a sniff.



“Mornin’ Varro, how did you sleep?”



“Like a Hensa, Avery, like a Hensa.”



“A Hensa? Isn’t that an animal native to Lerin?”



“Yeah… they were a companion animal that helped with pest control. The Federation didn’t like them so they burned every last one they could during our first contact.”



From our encounter with Mrs Teylim and Tohba back on Venlil Prime we knew about the horrible treatment of the Yotul by the damn federation.



“Damn man, when Sheva and I were on Venlil Prime we met another Yotul there who explained what had happened during y’alls first contact. It sounded like hell.”



He gave me a knowing look then took a sip of the coffee. His ears sprung up in surprise at the taste. 



“By Ralchi’s light this is good!”



“Heh all dads seem to like their coffee black.”



“Mhmm” he got off as he took another sip of the coffee.



“So what would y’all like for breakfast? I have a wide assortment of stuff here for y’all.”



“I’ll take this” he held up a biscuit “and some of these jellies as well.”



Mudim walked over and grabbed a grapefruit using one of her claws to cut it open. 



“I’ve gotta eat healthy for this little one here, she will nurse off of me for a couple more months while slowly trying solid food.”



“I understand that, I bought some artificial pouches that are used for an animal that is similar to y’all here on earth.”



Varro and Mudim swung their heads over to me in surprise at this new information. 



“Animals similar to us?” “What?” 



“Yeah they are called Kangaroos.” I pulled out my phone and showed them a picture of a red kangaroo mom and joey.



Mudim took my phone and stared into the screen before passing it to Varro who’s jaw dropped as he compared the photo to his wife and Joey. 



“Huh, that is interesting.” 



“I know right? Some weird convergent evolution on another planet.”



“Yeah…”



At this point Trunla walked into the kitchen with Terya not too far behind.



“Good morning y’all, grab some biscuits and jelly.”



They gave their own greeting gestures before sitting at the counter and grabbing some food. Since everyone is awake now I should get everyone’s opinions on going to the game tomorrow night and going to another store for some preparation. I grabbed a few biscuits and some blackberry bourbon vanilla jam and sat down by Sheva.



“So y’all I have already mentioned this to Sheva but would y’all like to head to a Jacksonville Jaguars football game tomorrow?”



“What is the game about?” Mudim



As I explained the game of football to everyone my Yotul friends all took interest but Trunla had a look of worry as I tried to define football to everyone. Sheva had placed her arm around my neck and pulled me close while I explained the intricacies of the sport. Trunla finally spoke up about her concerns.



“Are you sure the sport isn’t violent, Avery?” 



“It can be but we have made it as safe as possible for the players, like improved helmets and padding.”



“But these humans are running and colliding into each other, doesn't that cause injuries?”



“It does but it is rare. There is nothing to worry about here Trunla.”



“O-okay Avery.”



Varro and Mudim had come to an agreement among themselves that both of them and Aloysra would tag along as well. Since Aloysra is so young she gets in for free which is a nice plus. We would need to stop by the supermarket to pick up some jaguars gear.



Sheva had been engrossed in immigration and citizenship paperwork all day yesterday as she wants to move here with me permanently. What she doesn’t know is that I have been designing a ring just for her. A heirloom ring that has been passed down for generations with each person adding their own flair to the ring. The gem is alexandrite which is a rare and expensive gem. A single carat has a starting price in the hundreds of thousands. A unique gem for a unique Venlil. I plan on marrying her come hell or high water, nothing will stop me from making her my bride. I just need to find the perfect opportunity to pop the question.



Terya had been open to it from the start and was excited when everyone else agreed. We would need to have a group shopping trip to the supermarket for snacks and Jaguars gear. I had a teal pouch that I could bring for Aloysra incase Varro and Mudim wanted to head off by themselves.



“So we need to head to the supermarket to get all y’all fitted in Jaguars gear and some other human clothes for this game.”



As soon we finished breakfast we all cleaned up and hopped into the Rivan. It had plenty of room for everyone and their tails. I hopped in the driver’s seat, even though the car is automated it is advised that someone pays attention to the car and road. Sheva jumped into the passenger seat while Trunla and Terya popped into the middle seats. Varro, Mudim and Aloysra sat in the back row which had the most room and was the safest for Aloysra. 



The drive to the store only took ten minutes with minimal traffic. After parking we made our way into the store and were hit with a wave of cool air. Our gang turned heads as soon as we walked in, we were the first aliens that these people have seen in person. Sheva turned the most heads as she is the most stunning, I made sure to let everyone know we were together by wrapping my arm around her and bringing her in for a kiss.



“So where do y’all want to head first food or clothes?”



Sheva was the first to speak up. “I’d say clothes as I’d like to try a few of them on.”



Everyone agreed with her and I grabbed a cart as I had a feeling we were going to be buying a lot of stuff. When we arrived at the clothing section there was an entire wall dedicated to Jaguars merch. Everyone found shirts and pants that fit them, we would have to modify them for everyone’s tails. Trunla ended up finding some dry fit shirts which were large enough to act as a dress on her.



“Hey Avery turn around\~”



“Whatcha need Shevaaa Oh wow.”



She was holding up a replica Jaguars cheerleader outfit. Just like when she held up the bikini at the starport my mind was in a haze. She leaned down to whisper in my ear.



“Something for after the game\~”



She threw it in the cart along with a jersey and a pair of shorts. We would need to find some dye for her so she could become a real Jacksonville Jaguar. Everyone threw their things into the cart and we headed to the next part of the store. Sheva was by my side with her tail around my arm as we continued through the store.



“Let's head by the toy section and see if Aloysra wants anything.”



Varro and Mudim were stunned at my words.



“This is a toy store as well?!” Mudim exclaimed



“Yep, it has pretty much everything you could need here. You think of it and it is here from foods to office supplies.”



“Woah… I am loving this place more and more by the minute.”



“Earth will do that to you pal.”



We came upon the frozen foods section and I decided to introduce everyone to some sweet treats. I made sure everyone’s attention was on me as we passed the non vegan ice creams.



“So I am going to introduce y’all to some amazing treats for a hot summer's day, ice cream and all of its flavors and variants. All of these are made with nut milks so it won’t hurt y’alls stomachs.”



A collective murmur of interest went out from our group as I placed a few pints into our cart. We went through the store collecting things we would need and stuff everyone wanted to try. I made sure to avoid the deli and frozen meats, even though all of it is lab grown I would rather not risk anyone fainting.



As we walked down the cereal aisle there was a bipedal cocker spaniel? They were checking out a box of cinnamon toast crunch. It looked like they had boots and mittens of their stark white fur.



“What's a Farsul doing here on earth?” Sheva questioned.



“A what-sul?”



“A Farsul, they are one of the founding members of the Federation along with the Kolshians.”



“Should we introduce ourselves?”



Before anyone could answer, the Farsul noticed us and yipped in surprise as they noticed our mixed group. They took a few steps back and starters to shake. Sheva approached and got on their level before introducing herself.



“Hello there, I’m Sheva and I wanted to see if you were alright. I didn’t expect to see a Farsul all the way out here.”



“I-I am quite alright t-thank you. I-I’m Mulli b-by the way.”



“It is nice to meet you Mulli, my friends here are my boyfriend Avery, Trunla, Terya, Varro, Mudim and their pup Aloysra.”



We all gave our own greeting to them as Sheva introduced us, I had blushed a bit when she said I was her boyfriend and when she came back to the group I gave her a kiss on the cheek. Mulli had asked what we were doing and I explained we were preparing to head to the football game. I pulled out a jersey to show them and they turned their head just like an actual cocker spaniel.



Since I had an extra ticket I decided to invite her along to the game to which she accepted almost immediately. We made our way back to the clothing aisle and picked out a shirt that would fit her. 



We all walked up to the front and paid for everything, I blushed as I imagined Sheva in the cheerleaders outfit. Mulli had asked if she could stay with us for the night, I of course said yes and we all headed back to my car and piled in.



Once we arrived back home we unpacked our stuff and I set up a bunch of spare air mattresses so no one had to sleep on our couch anymore. While I brought them out everyone got to know Mulli, she was recently fired from her job as a museum curator as the Venlil economy had been screwed up when they cut themselves off from the federation. When Sheva and I went to grab the extra air mattresses she asked me about my safe.



“What's this Avery?” She was pointing her tail at the safe.



“Oh that's my gun safe, I mainly have them for self defense and target practice. No hunting, I promise my love.”



“O-okay Avery I trust you on that.”



We took the extra mattress and set it up while Mulli got to know everyone. Once it was set up we all piled onto the mattresses, though Sheva made sure to lay me on top of her as she loved my warmth.



“Good night everyone, sleep well as we have the game tomorrow and it is going to be really fun!”



Everyone gave their versions of good night and we passed out ready for the next day to begin.

1gvy9ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1gvy9ac/qcrit_adult_fantasy_fraymoon_105000_first_time/,"[QCrit] Adult Fantasy Fraymoon 105,000 First Time","Dear xxxxx

\[Personalized sentence ideally. How important do people feel this is, or how is best to craft one? I am uncertain.\]

Excellent SFF writer Adam Roberts has suggested I use his recommendation freely. He has read another of my novels and, a vocal fan, he has described it as a masterpiece.

*Fraymoon* mingles fantasy with both low and god-level tech on a world which may once have been our own. The fantastic prevails. It is 105,000 words and has never been published.

Amihan knows at once when her Bituin is replaced by a changeling, and flees her home in the rural Philippines. She must travel across the world to the vast mountain where the ‘kind neighbours’ are said to live to reach her baby. She robs her in-laws of the makings of magic, and takes her great-uncle’s aswang (demon)-hunting tools. She overcomes a lovely blood-aswang named Leofsige, and makes him her vassal. She is also reunited with Isagani, her childhood best friend and student-wizard. He has stolen all his master’s charms, including the impossibly powerful atsar bombs.

With their help, she travels through cursed millet fields and bamboo cities lashed to the outside of ancient span bridges, helping vengeful ghosts, and finding, in an entombed restaurant, music older than anyone can say. She is no witch though she may grow into one, but rather a stubborn, ordinary woman facing the extraordinary—and an excellent shot. Throughout, they must defend against ever more violent attacks by the Academic Wizards, desperate to regain the charms Isagani stole. These are both frightening and sometimes comical. Amihan is almost scalded to death in coffee with condensed milk, an odd charm. Amihan has never returned Isagani’s deepening love, and is at war with herself as to whether Leofsige is a thing one could love at all. Eventually they face the reality that the mountain is something very different than they imagined.

*Fraymoon* could be shelved next to *Godkiller* (though it is less intense) as the picaresque is punctuated by violence, or *Nettle* *and Bone*. In both *Fraymoon* and T. Kingfisher’s novel, a vein of humour—and even absurdism—runs through the dangers the characters face on their travels. The closest resemblance may be Hannah Kind, with fairy tale elements seen anew, particularly as in her short-story collection *White Cat, Black Dog*, but also her novel *The Book of Love*. Reaching back into classic fantasy history, the feel is very like that of Jack Vance’s Dying Earth series. 

A late-in-life first time author, I am a Savannah native living in Singapore, and not a Filipina. However, I love and have researched Pangasinan’s dialect, using it as a springboard at the start to describe magic in a changed world.

I have fully completed the second novel of a proposed trilogy and three-quarters of the third, but *Fraymoon* can stand on its own.

Thanks for your consideration, 

Sincerely Yours,

Belle Waring

Notes for helpful reddit readers: Adam Roberts is an excellent writer, and a reader rather than a friend; he recommended highly that I mention his strong feelings about my writing, but is this the right place?

Secondly, people dislike cultural appropriation, and I have read a Filipina fantasy author on the subject. Her verdict: No. One agent turning me down mentioned it as a problem I would face. I use some Pangasinan, and have POCs as both MCs and as many less-important characters (I have read opposition even to this background element). Remaking the book so that everyone is white-coded/speaks a European language would make it worse. However I could/would do it in extremis. Should I mention it in the query or leave it to stand as it is?

I am eager for criticism that will improve things, and thanks in advance for your help.

Day Two

When I say I didn’t sleep that first night, I’m not exaggerating. I turned in early (just to get away from the both of them), and listened through the wall as Dylan tucked the boy in. I had found Gus cowering underneath our bed, and he lay next to me, wide-eyed and alert. When Dylan finally came in, he climbed into bed without saying a word and rolled over so his back was facing me.

It was like a slap in the face. No matter what happened—communication breakdown, minor argument, major fight—it didn’t matter, we talked before bed every night and fell asleep holding hands. Not that night. I didn’t understand his anger. But maybe I wasn’t looking at it from his perspective. If we DID have a child at some point and he’d gone missing, wouldn’t I be angry at Dylan if the child returned and he was acting like he wasn’t happy about it? Like he had no recollection of ever having a child. Wouldn’t I feel frustrated and confused?

A quiet sob shook through me. Talking to my mom had made things so much worse. Now I could no longer blame Dylan’s confusion solely on him. My own mother asked about the boy. Talked about his return excitedly. She even asked when she could come see him. It was more and more looking like I was losing my mind, that I’d scrubbed out all evidence of the boy because I couldn’t handle it when he disappeared. How else did you explain the pictures in the living room?

Deep down in the pit of my stomach, another thought poked at me. Maybe NEITHER of us was losing our minds. The boy’s dark soulless eyes and wide grin plagued me as I lay in bed. The hours ticked by, Gus by my side, as I thought about the possibility that my initial reaction to seeing the boy was the only explanation.

He was evil. And he’d come here to destroy us.

At some point, I drifted off. I woke with a start, feeling a deep vibrating against my side. It took a minute to realize that it was Gus, crouched down low next to me, growling at the door. I struggled to sit up, peering through the dark as my eyes adjusted. Dylan had left the door open (I assumed in case the boy needed us), and dark shadows pulsed beyond the doorframe.

“Hello?” I whispered. “Is someone there?”

Dylan snored quietly beside me, completely oblivious to my insomnia and the agitated dog. I squinted, then nearly screamed. A dark silhouette stood in the doorway, dark glittering orbs unblinking, staring at me.

“What do you need?” I asked, my voice high-pitched.

The boy didn’t answer. Gus let out another growl that rumbled deep in his chest. The orbs flickered from my face to Gus. A hissing sound cut through the silence, and Gus let out a little yelp, burying himself beneath the blankets. The boy’s eyes swung back to my face. I was pinned in place by the stare. Waves of malintent washed over me, shaking me to my very core. What did this boy want from us? Why was he here? Why US?

We were locked in a staring match for more than ten minutes, then I blinked and he was gone. Like he was never there in the first place. I was tempted to get out of bed and check to see if he was in bed, sleeping, but fuck that. Gus’ reaction was enough to tell me that I hadn’t imagined it. I knew one thing. I was NOT going to live like this. In the morning, I’d take Gus, pack a bag, and get the hell out of there.

But what about Dylan?

I couldn’t leave him behind. He was wrapped up in this delusion, but it wasn’t his fault. He needed my help to see that this boy wasn’t our child. If I left him alone with the boy, there was no telling what would happen to him. I couldn’t just abandon my husband, my best friend, even if he wasn’t himself at that moment. He needed me. I needed to figure out what was going on.

When the watery gray light of dawn filtered around the edges of the curtains, I pulled myself out of bed. The house was silent, save for the quiet snoring coming from Dylan’s side of the bed. I felt a tug on my nightshirt as I slid my feet into my slippers. Gus had clamped his teeth down on the corner of my shirt and was trying to keep me there.

“Its okay, buddy,” I whispered, patting his head. “Release. Release, bud, it’s okay.”

He finally opened his mouth and let go of my shirt, but looked up at me with big, round pleading eyes. He was trembling, and I felt awful leaving him, but I had work to do. Walking into the hallway, I heard the thump of Gus jumping down from the bed, and tentative steps following me out into the kitchen. He let out a whine and glanced at the front door.

“Wanna go out?”

He hadn’t come out at all last night, so I was sure his bladder was close to bursting. I grabbed his leash, slipped on my crocs, and opened the door. Before I could hook the leash to his collar, Gus jumped up and slammed his paws into the screen door, pushing down on the handle. The door flew open and Gus took off running before I could react. By the time I made it out onto the front steps, he was nowhere in sight.

“Gus!” I screamed, holding his leash helplessly in my hand. But he was gone. He was probably safer on the streets than here. I didn’t like the way the boy looked at him. Besides, I couldn’t hold it against him, could I? How many times had I thought about doing that exact same thing over the last 24 hours? I hoped he’d be alright. The thought of him being out there all alone made tears well up in my eyes. Of course, I’d go look for him, but I didn’t expect to find him. Not while the boy was still around.

“Hey, what’s all the screaming?”

I turned to see Dylan standing in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. “Gus,” I said. “He ran away.”

“What? Why didn’t you catch him?” he asked, accusation in his voice.

“H-he was too fast,” I said, closing the door. “He was gone by the time I got out there.”

Dylan shrugged. “I’m sure he’ll come back. Is Logan up yet?”

“I have no idea,” I said, moving back into the kitchen to put some coffee on.

“So you’re going to continue with this charade?”

I whipped around. “What charade?”

“This game you’re playing where you’re pretending you don’t remember our son.”

“It’s not a game, it’s the truth,” I snapped. I was tired of pretending. I was tired of the accusations and the guilt trips. I probably shouldn’t have said it, but I was so freaking tired.

“If that’s the truth, Lyss, we might need to go talk to someone,” Dylan said quietly.

“Oh, fuck off,” I snarled, pouring myself a cup of coffee.

“That’s a new one,” Dylan said, only slightly taken aback. “I have to go in to work today, by the way.”

A shock of fear jolted through me. “It’s Saturday!”

“I left work early yesterday, remember?” Dylan asked. “I have some things to wrap up.”

I did NOT want to be left alone with that THING. But it would give me some time to try and figure out what was going on. Some of you have suggested in the comments that I look up various types of supernatural or sinister beings, and that’s exactly what I had already planned on doing. I was no idiot. I’ve watched all the horror movies and read all the books. Asking for permission to come in, those dark creepy eyes, the monotone voice—something was off with that kid, I just didn’t know what. And what kind of being could inject memories of itself into people, anyway?

Maybe the better question was, why didn’t he inject them into me, too? Why leave me out of the loop to spiral, when he could have come home to two parents with memories of him, who were happy to have him back home?

Once Dylan left, the boy wandered out of the guest bedroom, still wearing the clothes we picked him up in. He stared at me sitting at the dining room table, unblinking.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked.

“Where’s Gus?”

“Gone,” I said, glancing at the front door.

“Where’s Dad?”

“He had to go to work for a bit,” I said. “Are you hungry?”

There was a slick of red on the side of the boy’s mouth. He reached up with a pale hand and wiped it away. “I already ate.”

I frowned, knowing fully well he hadn’t, but I didn’t want to even THINK about what it was he thought he’d eaten. “Can you change out of those clothes? We need to go to the library.”

“Why?” the boy asked.

“Because I need some books,” I said, losing my patience.

“I don’t want to.”

I stood from the table and marched into the guest bedroom. The social worker at the police station had given us some spare clothing in the boy’s size, since we obviously didn’t have anything at home. Just to tide us over until we could get to the store. I rummaged around in the bag, then pulled out a fresh pair of jeans and a red polo shirt. I waved them at the boy.

“Put these on.”

“I said, I don’t want to go.”

I sighed. “I can’t leave you here alone, for Christ’s sake—”

The boy recoiled, hissing at me from between his teeth. “No!”

“Look,” I said, changing tactics. “If you go with me to the library, I’ll take you to the store after and buy you anything you want.”

The boy tilted his head. “Anything?”

I swallowed. “Yes…anything. Just get dressed, please.”

At the library, I sent the boy over to the children’s area where storytime was going on. I watched as he sat on the floor crossed-legged on the outskirts of the circle of other children, then I hurried to the section of the library where I would find books on folklore, cryptids and the like. I pulled book after book off the shelves and thumbed through them.

Nothing about the boy’s appearance in our lives seemed to match up with the creatures I was finding in the books. A changeling was close, but that was a replacement for a child that was taken by a fairy or a troll or something. This child wasn’t a replacement. He never existed in the first place. WHAT was he?! Frustration coiled inside my stomach.

When storytime ended, a line of parents and children shuffled out of the library. I glanced over at the children’s section and saw there were a few stragglers—parents and kids looking at books or playing with toys. The boy still sat on the carpet, hands planted on his knees, starting straight ahead.

I needed to find something, anything, before he got restless. AND before Dylan realized we’d left the house. I opened up a book on urban legends and was thumbing through it when a shrill scream cut though the air. There was a commotion over in the children’s area.

“Shit,” I said, throwing the book aside. I jumped up from my chair and rushed across the room, rounding the corner. There was a group of parents—all clearly upset—standing between the boy and a little girl in a pink dress.

“Whose kid is this?” someone asked, looking around.

“Hi, mine, sorry, what happened?” I asked breathlessly.

A woman pointed to the little girl, who had lines of tears streaming down her cheeks and red marks on her neck. “Your son was CHOKING my daughter!”

My mouth dropped open. I grabbed the boy roughly by the shoulder. “Why did you do that?”

He looked up at me. “I was reading a book and she took it from me.”

No emotion whatsoever. No remorse in his flat-toned voice. I looked at the little girl, horrified, then at her parents. “I’m so sorry.”

“You should watch your kid,” the mother snapped. “Or better yet, don’t take him out in public until he learns how to behave!”

“Yes, of course,” I said, taking hold of the boy’s hand. Just touching him made my skin prickle. But I was trying to keep up appearances. “Let’s go.”

As I dragged him away, he started laughing. A raspy, gurgly sound that made all the hairs on my arm stand on end. I looked over my shoulder. The other parents watched us go, their eyes wide, hands pressed to their mouths. The boy continued laughing all the way out to the car.

I shook him. “Stop that! What’s wrong with you?”

“She deserved it,” he answered, climbing into the back seat.

I tore out of the parking lot like a bat out of hell. Five minutes later, I turned onto our street. I could feel the boy’s eyes boring into the back of my head.

“You said you’d take me to the store,” he said. And even though his tone didn’t change, I could hear the malice behind it.

I pulled into the driveway, cut the engine, and whipped around to face him. “That was before you choked out a four-year-old at the library!”

I climbed out of the car, glancing around for any sign of Gus. Our next-door neighbor was walking around her front yard, shaking a box of treats. She waved at me absentmindedly as the boy joined me on the front walk, still bristling from being told no.

“Alyssa, dear,” the neighbor called. “You haven’t seen my cat Muffin around, have you?”

“No, is she missing?” I asked, glancing at the boy.

“I let her out early this morning and she always comes home for lunch,” she said, scratching her head. “I don’t know where she could be!”

“I’ll keep an eye out for her,” I said, cold cascading down my back. It was not unusual to see the gray tiger-striped cat wandering around our backyard. The guest bedroom looked out over the very same backyard. I looked down at the boy and he grinned.",20,1732131126.0,nosleep,7,0.95,False
1gvxz1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_partners/comments/1gvxz1d/working_with_depressed_partner/,Working with Depressed Partner,"I am the non-depressed partner. My partner and I have been married for going on 8 great years. Before that we dated for about 1.5 years. So we've been with each other for about 10 years - and in those 10 years I lost my best friend to suicide, my partner lost their parent to alcoholism, been through multiple moves (good ones!), been through good jobs and bad jobs, school, pets, losing friendships, making new ones - I mean we have been through LIFE. 

Now - all that time their depression has been present. I would say in the last...4 years or so it has gotten a lot more. They are close to 30, and I'm a bit older. I always take into account age difference and remember what life was like during those time - but now since we have been together so long it's pretty much to the point of their age being what I was when we started. Not saying that makes up anything - I was a trainwreck of person in my day as well. 

But I just.... I am so tired. I do everything I can to make their day easier. I make sure coffee is ready for them everything morning, I make sure they eat, I have an hour commute, work 10 hour day, and I still come home and make dinner, feed pets. They work from home but normally don't start working till I almost go to bed (works medical and wait for the day to end). But other than that they don't do anything but play video games at home. And I'm not even really complaining about that - it's just.... I don't know how much more I can keep up.

I write them notes once a week to find in the house. I almost let them buy whatever they want - yes I do spoil and that is a problem in itself. But I just don't know what else to do. There are time they really bounce back - excited to move forward. But only when it's somethign NEW. New hobby, new food, new video game. But then once it's old - easily back down in depression. And on top of that the big thing in the last 4-6 months is just life.

Like... I take care of everything. I hate saying it but I do. I make sure the house is working inside and outside. I grocery shop. I cook. I maintain pet appointments/food/care. I manage all bills. I maintain the car maintenance (sadly feel out of that about 5 months ago and the car is pretty much messed up now). On top of that I give them attention because they CRAVE it. Basically while they sleep or are busy is the only time I really can do anything for myself. If we are both up I usually need to pay attention to them, make them feel good or do my own thing around them (which I am ok with that - like reading, writing, playing a handheld game, etc). And I love spending my time with them. They are my everything - I am stupid in love with them. 

I just.... I dont know what to do. Anytime they get in a depressive mode I can't say anything right. I can't do anything right. I can't encourage them to try and take a shower or go for a walk. Anything I do just beats them down more and they will ask ""Am I bother to you"" or ""You're getting sick of me aren't you?"" and there are times I feel like it's going to slip and I'm going to say ""I'm sick of your depression."" and I know they would lose it.

They are on medication. They have had suicide ideation. But even the other day they said ""Sometime getting coffee or knowing the babies (our pets) need me is the only thing that gets me up"". And I know that's bad - but I will try and spin it and be like ""That's good - these babies love you. I love you."" and anything.

I dont know. I don't even know what I want out of this. I'm just so, so, tired.",2,1732131107.0,depression_partners,0,1.0,False

Here’s the thing: I’ve generally avoided asking for higher doses of medications because I don’t want to seem like I’m drug seeking. I haven’t asked to increase concerta higher than 36mg, I haven’t asked to increase vyvanse higher than 30mg. In hindsight, they seem to only work for 3-4 hours. 

But it’s clear to me those doses are too low and aren’t actually an appropriate amount to correct the deficits in executive function for the whole time I need to function like a normal adult. I haven’t really experimented with higher doses on my own either, because I don’t want to get punished for trying it. 

Understanding adhd better and what the medication is and isn’t able to do has me realizing that I still have a ways to go in titrating to the correct dose for me. I need all day support because I work 12 hour shifts and a high demand job. Scraping by for the second half of my shift just doesn’t cut it and the anxiety I’ve developed because of that struggle didn’t have to. 

Anyway just kinda of venting as I take in this realization this morning.

Written by Torunn Gronbekk, art by Fabiana Mascolo and colors by Patricio Delpeche. 
Issue number two in the new run is finally here. It's been a looooong month since issue 69 but we're finally here. It's 12:30 am, I have no coffee but we're working through that unfortunate situation and I have read Catwoman issue 70 about twice...maybe three or four times by the time I finish this so lets talk about it.

Only two issues in and this is some of the best Catwoman I've read in awhile. I loved this issue. The writing remains strong. The new characters for example Suzy Sin felt interesting enough that I want to know more about them. I want to know more about Selina/Evie Halls relationship/past with Suzy and that Ids past in general. The pace is solid and the set ups throughout the issue are very well done. The art is...I'm torn on the art. I don't know how I feel about it. It fits the story...but my issues from issue 69 remain so I'm not sure where I'm going to fall on the art. More on that, the writing and the colors, oh the colors after the summary.

Same thing as last issues review, I'm just going full caution and blocking everything. It's honestly just easier that way. This was a fantastic issue, definitely read it first before unblocking everything as there are spoilers.

>!We pick right up in Berlin and the theme of identity, choice comes up right away. Selina finding comfort not as herself. Side note here already but I love the way the new costume can look natural under a top with the jacket off. It’s one of the things I loved about the 2018 costume. She could remove the mask and the jacket and go out in that without looking to out of place. Anyway! !<

>!Selina’s decision to fight for her life instead of moving to a new identity, a new her in a new place is I think going to be core to the run. By issue end she’s forced to accept that isn’t an option but solicits suggest that it’ll keep coming up. This is of course in the preview and we move to the cafe. Suzy Sin is interesting, she’s very much a character Selina would gravitate to helping/caring for. After only a few pages we can get a sense of who Suzy is.!<

>!We get to see interaction between Selina/Evie and Suzy. There’s a familiarity here that I really like. Through out we see pictures being taken by camera phones. The panel work, layering the photo panels over is lovely. They never feel to busy.!<

>!We move from the cafe to the introduction of two characters I hope last longer than the part in Berlin. Two assassins Tinsel and Gogol. We’re also introduced to that phone group that’ll be a problem for Selina through the story. The group is called bounty who gives a reward for any I assume usable picture of someone that’s being hunted for. As for the assassins, we don’t get much but what we get is interesting. We are told this is an open contract.!<

>!We move back to the meeting in the cafe and get a sense of how Suzy feels about “Evie”. There’s a lot in this scene building up the world. We learn why Suzys in Berlin. We also learn about a former employer for them both Theodore Belov and his family. The death of Theodore leaving a vacuum with each son seeking to potentially fill that vacuum but most importantly we learn Theodore’s vault. Full of valuables but more importantly files. This screams a future heist or at least I hope so. Suzy mentions their mother Katarina Belov and we move scenes.!<

>!The beauty of this issue is how the scenes transition. Suzy brings up the Belovs and the next scene we meet them. In the previous scene we learned that Katarina would potentially like one of her sons to kill the others and the captions give you the feeling that might be true. We learn this is a crime “empire” built on secrets. There’s definitely more here especially given the next scene. Before we transition we find out that the brothers are claiming ignorance over the recent deaths.!<

>!We shift back to the cafe and we learn how the vault is opened but more importantly we see the impact on Suzy that “Evie Halls” leaving had. The dialogue, the captions, the art…just all come together. You can feel the emotion. I said it before but it bares repeating…I want to see more about this relationship. That said Selina catches on that she’s being actively hunted, and after telling Suzy to run we move to the action.!<

>!The book showcases how fast Selina is and the action shows that as she gets the literal drop on the man who’s been taking pictures of her. Catwoman learns about the bounty group and that they only have the name Evie Hall. This confirms they didn’t know she was Catwoman or that’s how I’m reading it.!<

>!The action picks up again, we see the lengths they’ll go to kill Evie. A derailed train car. Theres a confrontation on the roof and a fight…and the action here is just as quick but it’s sketchy. It also doesn’t help that Selina looks somewhat weak. These are amateurs and she seems to have trouble with them. This is most likely wrong but I wonder if she’s being scaled back in her fighting ability to increase the threat level. If this is the case…it doesn’t really make sense if you have pro killers chasing her as well. Maybe there’s more to it than that…Anyway, the fight ends with the two pro assassins showing up or at least Gogol and killing the lot of them.!<

>!They lose track of Selina with Tinsel seeing her escape. Selina realizing that she can’t just become someone else. The option isn’t there. She has to fight back.!<

Let’s talk writing just a bit more. The caption work is on point. I love Torunns take on Selina, she feels right to me. From the captions to the dialogue. We get to see how quick and clever she is in her feet with little time to plan. The world building is handled beautifully. It’s not moving to fast and what we’re getting Torunn is keeping interesting. The plot feels relatively tight as well with the added elements >!such as the phone group for the photos!< feeling believable. The way she handle the intercuts, the flow of the story…just overall great.

On to the art by Fabiana Mascolo and my conflict over it. It's for the most part beautiful but a complaint I had in issue 1, where the action felt sketchy or very storyboard...is still here but maybe worse. Now it extends to just any scene. I don’t think this is the right word but the style feels painterly, looser less detailed. The action is still fast punchy but feels like an afterthought as it still feels so storyboard. I’m all over the place on this and I apologize but part of me loves the feel, the deceptive simplicity, the overall look of the book while part of me wishes it was more polished and finished. I think the art is in part really held together by the next thing…colors. 

The colors by Patricio Delpeche hold this book together. They compliment Fabiana perfectly. The choice of colors, the water color/paint vibrancy. The use of red during the action. Every choice made feels right. I’m semi obsessed with the deep red of Selina’s lipstick, the pink of Suzy’s hair, the shift into shadows. Given my conflict on the art…I still don’t think I’d want a different pair on this book. 

Also just to say it again, I really like the panel lay out used. It never feels busy. Just overall visually appealing. 

Catwoman 70 is a beautiful well written issue. Torunn is firing on all cylinders as the story is intriguing and keeps you hooked through out. I want to know why the people trying to kill Selina are going so hard. I want to know about her past, her past identities. I want to know about her time >!working for Theodore Belov!<. I have so many questions but I feel like they’ll be answered. 

I can’t recommend this issue enough and am looking forward to issue 71. 

I hope if you read it, that you enjoy it as much as I did. See you same Cat time, same Cat channel!",8,1732130508.0,Catwoman,2,1.0,False

This is the first time being back home in almost a decade, I live in the east coast but due to a slight career shift and now working remote I decided it's time I finally spend some time with the family.

I've always been the black sheep of the family never really fitting in with them nor having any similar interests with them kinda leads to the wanting to escape them from time to time haha.

About me:
- I am 6'1"" muscular build, hazel eyes, bald (by choice!!), have a well maintained beard, and I wear glasses. I am born and raised in LA near Burbank but I moved to the east coast.

- I work in the fitness industry in marketing and consulting, so being in gyms and working always has always come along with the career but my love for working out and bodybuilding lead me to the field.

- I am a foodie at heart, especially for sushi or a good coffee shop. My old favorite sushi spot closed down so pretty bummed about that and I am trying to find another spot ASAP.

- At most times I have music playing in the background and even going in long drives to listen to a new album or EP is a guilty pleasure of mine.

Hi everyone!

I’m 26 years old and currently still living in a student house. I’m looking for a French-speaking buddy to practice my French with, and ideally someone who’d also like to explore the city or just hang out and have a good time.

I’d love to help you with your English (or Dutch, if that’s helpful) in exchange! Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, taking a walk, or discovering some cool spots around town, I’m up for it.

Feel free to send me a message if this sounds like something you’d enjoy. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Cheers,

1gvxkbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1gvxkbi/a_personal_vent_life_turned_upside_down_so_quickly/,A Personal Vent: Life turned upside down so quickly.,"This is just a vent because I’m feeling fed up and stuck. Might be very long post sorry for that. It’s about me and my husband. we are moving in together soon. But you know what? I’m not excited. Instead, I feel afraid to start a life with him. I never thought I’d say this, but here I am.

I told him I wanted my husband to be my friend and lover first, then a husband. He replied, “*Come out of your fancy, cinematic world. We are husband and wife.”*

We are both working from home, but for valid reasons, he is at his home while I am at mine. We meet once every week. This time, I missed him so much. When he came to pick me up, I was so excited. I’d done threading, facial, waxing, and got ready. We both know we have only weekends together, and I was all set for a warm hug and endless talks—only to realize I was the only one expecting this. I stayed with him for two days. No kiss, no hug, no cuddle. I kept waiting until I left his home, hoping for something.

He booked a movie, and I thought it was just for us. Later, he told me he was taking his brother along. I was completely okay with that, but is it wrong to expect him to let me know beforehand?

Work is hectic, and I often stretch till midnight. He constantly blames me for not doing housework and “enjoying” my mom’s cooking. Yes, I’m enjoying it—what’s wrong with that? My mom wants me to rest after work.

He keeps repeating that I’m not helping his mom. This isn’t the first time he said this—it’s the nth time. I’ve already explained that my MIL has a completely different set of rules, and she doesn’t even let me in the kitchen, not even to make coffee. I’m allowed only to sweep the house, and I do that. Even after knowing this, how can he keep blaming me?

Since marriage, I’ve become so weak—just 40 kg, low BP, nausea, dizziness, and a disturbed sleep schedule. My family suggested hiring a maid when we move in together. But he said, *“Is that even a family when a maid cooks? Why should we even be a family? What if we have a child? Are you going to feed the child food cooked by a maid?*” He also asked me, “*You said you’d cook after marriage, so why this now?”* I tried to explain politely that I’ve become physically weak, and my work is hectic. Cooking would just add more pressure. He said he doesn’t have the money to afford a maid.(*though the fact is, I earn double his monthly income*).

He wants me to stay healthy since we’ll plan for a baby soon—cook, clean, work, and be healthy. I smiled and said “okay”.I know my work and health will be even more messed up, but I’ve lost the strength to argue.

Traveling with the AC on makes me dizzy and nauseous. I’ve told him multiple times, even puked once. Recently, when I asked him to turn off the AC, he shouted, *“I can’t drive without AC!*” I stopped asking and told myself, “*If you vomit, you vomit. If you faint, you faint. He won’t care*.” I cried and told him how my dad and brother would never force me like this.He replied, ""*He’s your father, but I’m your husband. Don’t expect the same pampering and care from me. This is life, and you have to be practical*.”

He doesn’t call after work, saying, “*How can I talk long hours with family around?*” But he talks to friends for hours, even when I’m waiting in the same room.Would anyone judge him for talking to his wife?

After all this, I’ve gone silent. He keeps asking why I’m not talking like I used to. What is there to talk about? I don’t even have a topic anymore. The excitement I once had—the things I wanted to share—they’re all gone now.

P.S.: He doesn’t have another woman in his life, and divorce is not an option for me. Please don’t suggest that in the comments.",3,1732130101.0,Arrangedmarriage,7,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I are heading to Japan January 4-19 and feeling overwhelmed about how much time to spend where! We’re experienced travelers but unsure how much we can fit in; hearing lots of different opinions here & from friends. **We're going for**:

* Winter-friendly spots with natural beauty
* Cozy onsen towns/ryokans (I have a specific vision of an outdoor bath by a river...)
* Charming places that shine in winter over “must-sees” (although probably not the north on this trip)
* Good vegetarian food (know this might be tricky)
* Exploring Tokyo beyond touristy stuff, e.g., cute shops, good coffee, charming bars. We might do a TeamLab experience but that's probably it for specific ""attractions"".

**Working draft itinerary**:

Jan 4: Arrive Narita 4pm, head to Tokyo, have dinner, and crash.

Jan 5: Tokyo for one day to help us adjust & avoid a long evening of travel on the day we fly in. Explore, find good coffee, get our bearings.

Jan 6: Train + bus to Shibu Onsen in the AM. Visit snow monkey park as early as possible, stay in a ryokan, and visit the 9 public baths.

Jan 7: Train Shibu Onsen to Kanazawa. Visit Kenrokuen Garden and old samurai district. ***Q: Shibu Onsen \*seems\* worth the journey as Jigokudani/snow monkey coverage looks like it's best in winter, although if the snow monkey park is maybe an hour-long activity at most, I'm second-guessing how much value there is for the amount of travel required. Are Shibu Onsen + Kanazawa (especially Kenrokuen) worth the travel to get there?***

Jan 8: Train Kanazawa to Kyoto, our home base in Kansai. Get acquainted with Kyoto, go where the wind takes us - probably a more laidback day, maybe with a visit to the sake district.

Jan 9: Explore Kyoto. Visit temples, Fushimi Inari Shrine, the sake district, parks, cafes.

Jan 10: Day trip from Kyoto to Osaka. Visit Kuromon Market and the Railway Cat Cafe. Dinner in Osaka then return to Kyoto.

Jan 11: Final day in Kyoto to do anything we haven't gotten to yet. If we have time, visit monkeys at Iwatayama. ***Q: How comparable are Iwatayama and Jigokudani? Is one noticeably better than the other?***

Jan 12: Mt. Koya/Nara. Stay in a ryokan, visit the deer park. ***Q: Have heard great things about Mt. Koya, but should we visit as a day trip from Kyoto instead, even if we're flying out of Osaka the next day?***

Jan 13-15: Fly Osaka (Jan 13 morning) to Seoul or Busan; return to Tokyo Jan 15 evening and check into Tokyo hotel.

Jan 16-18: Tokyo. Explore Shibuya, Shinjuku, Asakusa, vintage shopping and houseware shopping, go to cafes and bars. Likely a day trip to Lake Kawaguchiko or Hakone.

Jan 19: Depart Tokyo.

**Questions:**

1. ***Shibu Onsen \*seems\* worth the journey as Jigokudani/snow monkey coverage looks like it's best in winter, although if the snow monkey park is maybe an hour-long activity at most, I'm second-guessing how much value there is for the amount of travel required. Are Shibu Onsen + Kanazawa (especially Kenrokuen) worth the travel?***
2. ***Are there any other beautiful small onsen towns that would fit better into our itinerary than Shibu Onsen, if we skip it + maybe skip Kanazawa? Eg Kinosaki?***
3. ***How comparable are Iwatayama and Jigokudani? Is one noticeably better than the other?***
4. ***Mt. Koya/Nara as a day trip from Kyoto or an overnight stay, even if we're flying out of Osaka the next day?***
5. ***If we skipped the Korea side trip, where should we spend more time/add any other destinations?***

We'd love to make the Korea side trip happen, as we won't likely have the opportunity again for a long time, and frankly we'd love to see a Korean city (and get cheap beauty treatments tbh...) but it's not a high enough of a priority to visit that we'd make a dedicated trip to Korea otherwise. We've also done this before e.g., with a 48 hour trip to Cairo from Morocco.

I wake up for work at 3:30 am, have for the past 6 months and at first I told myself it is just my imagination but things are starting to happen that make me feel like there may be more to it.

I usually eat my breakfast and drink my coffee in the morning in the living room, but this thing started happening that I can't even fully explain, and it was almost immediate.  If I looked at the black screen of the TV and saw my reflection, my heart would race, I'd get this chill down my spine and would be filled with a feeling of dread.  Sometimes, I swear when I see the reflection out of the corner of my eye I could swear there's 2 of my reflections, but when I go to look it's just the one.  I've started to be overwhelmed with this same feeling of dread when I see my reflection throughout the house like in windows or off objects, funny enough though not from looking in a mirror lol.

Also the most alarming things that started happening, when I wake up, I can smell the distinct smell of cigarettes, I smoked for years so I know the smell well, and I always feed my dogs and take them outside in the morning, but lately ever since the smell started happening, they won't go downstairs in the morning, I have bring their food up to them and put them on there leashes and bring them down. They dart right back upstairs after doing their business. And, when I leave I swear I get that feeling of being watched, like there are eyes in every window as I get into my car so I keep all the blinds closed but on Friday when I looked back as I was leaving the blinds for our bay window were inched open ever so slightly, I was so startled when I noticed that I almost drive up on the curb.

The house is old, but there is no sinister history or history with it really at all. As far as I know, it's an old house in a small farming town in western Ontario.  My neighbor has lived in his house for 70 years, knew the original owners, said they were nice people, the man did pass away in the house, he was a smoker and died in his 70s of natural causes from what my neighbor told me but from all accounts he was a great man and a great citizen of the town and his wife lived in it for a while before being taken in by family.  I don't think the spirit of a nice old man would make me feel so uneasy unless I'm misinterpreting it or pissed him off somehow lol.

""Humans are like their weather—unpredictable, chaotic, and likely to hit you with something when you least expect it.""

“Captain Vanex, I beg you to reconsider!” Folok, the ship's logistics officer, clung to the edge of his console. “This planet’s surface readings are erratic! There's no harmony in the data—nothing aligns properly!”

Captain Vanex narrowed his gelatinous eyes, the color shifting from a confident green to an impatient yellow. “Nonsense, Folok. This is a golden opportunity to study a Class E-9 species in its natural decline. Post-catastrophic worlds are ripe for observation.”

Folok’s antennae twitched nervously as the shuttle descended through the planet’s atmosphere. The terrain below was a patchwork of ruined cities, wild overgrowth, and inexplicable plumes of smoke. “Natural decline?” he muttered. “Looks more like deliberate chaos.”

The captain ignored him, addressing the crew. “Stay sharp. This species—‘humans’—survived an apocalypse of their own making. Their resilience could be invaluable for our records.”

The landing was unconventional. A stray piece of metallic debris had taken out one of the stabilizers mid descent, and the shuttle landed with a crunch that sent a ripple of unease through the crew.

“Did we just hit a refrigerator?” one of the technicians asked, peering through the external cameras.

Folok slapped his console in frustration. “This species hoards garbage even in death!”

“Silence,” barked Vanex. “Deploy the drones. Begin recording.”

Two drones zipped out of the shuttle and floated above the wasteland. The ruins of what had once been a bustling city lay in disarray.

Crumbling skyscrapers leaned at impossible angles; their surfaces adorned with colorful graffiti depicting strange slogans: “Keep Out!” “No Bots Allowed!” and the particularly ominous, “DO NOT OPEN THIS CAN.”

“Why are they still warning themselves after the collapse?” Vanex wondered aloud.

The first sign of life was a humanoid figure darting between the rubble. The drones zoomed in, broadcasting the image back to the shuttle.

The figure wore mismatched clothing—a heavy coat over gym shorts, combat boots, and a traffic cone for a hat. In one hand, he carried a long, spiked pole.

His face was obscured by what appeared to be a gas mask retrofitted with Christmas lights.

“Fascinating,” Vanex said, his color shifting to academic blue. “Primitive scavenging behavior. Note the improvisation.”

The humanoid suddenly stopped and stared directly at the drone. Then, without hesitation, he hurled the pole like a javelin.

The drone dodged just in time.

“AGGRESSIVE PRIMITIVE BEHAVIOR DETECTED,” it reported in a monotone voice.

The humanoid yelled something incomprehensible and ran into the ruins.

“What did it say?” asked Folok, his antennae twitching.

The drone replayed the sound: “Get that floaty thing outta my turf!”

Vanex color dimmed to a contemplative mauve. “Remarkable. It appears humans can still assert territorial claims even in a state of societal collapse.”

The crew ventured out of the shuttle cautiously. The air smelled faintly of burnt rubber and wet cardboard. Folok activated his atmospheric stabilizer, muttering, “This place is going to clog my vent system.”

A faint rumbling noise drew their attention. The crew turned just in time to see a group of humans emerging from behind a crumbled wall.

There were six of them, each dressed more absurdly than the last—one wore a full suit of medieval armor spray-painted neon pink, while another carried a flamethrower made from a leaf blower and what looked like a barbecue propane tank.

The humans stared at the aliens. The aliens stared back.

Finally, the human in the Christmas-light gas mask stepped forward. “Who the hell are you, and what do you want?”

Captain Vanex stepped forward, his tone calm. “We are explorers from the Galactic Unification Federation, here to observe your species and—”

“Observe?” The human squinted. “You mean spy on us?”

“No, no,” Vanex said, raising his hands in a placating gesture. “We mean no harm. We are here to study and perhaps learn from your resilience.”

The human tilted his head, then turned to the others. “Did y’all hear that? They wanna learn from us.”

The group burst into laughter. One of them doubled over, nearly dropping his makeshift flamethrower.

Vanex glanced at Folok. “Was that not an appropriate diplomatic statement?”

“I think they’re mocking us, sir.”

Before Vanex could respond, the leader stepped closer. “Alright, space squids, here’s the deal. You leave us alone; we leave you alone. But if you’re thinking of pulling some War of the Worlds crap, think again. We don’t have much, but we’ll fight you with everything we’ve got.”

“Fight?” Vanex repeated, genuinely confused. “We have no intention of engaging in hostilities. We are merely scientists.”

The human narrowed his eyes. “Prove it.”

Vanex hesitated. “How would you like us to do that?”

The human grinned, an expression that Vanex found unsettling. “Follow me.”

They led the aliens to a large underground chamber beneath the ruins.

Inside was a bizarre mix of salvaged technology: computer monitors powered by car batteries, a satellite dish duct-taped to a shopping cart, and what looked like a coffee maker rigged to brew engine oil.

The humans gestured to a crude table surrounded by mismatched chairs. “Sit.”

Folok whispered, “Captain, this feels like a trap.”

“Quiet, Folok. This is a valuable opportunity to understand their culture.”

The humans sat across from the aliens. The leader leaned forward, clasping his hands. “Alright, let’s play a game. It’s called prove you’re not a threat.”

Vanex hesitated. “What are the rules?”

The human grinned wider. “Rule one: answer every question honestly. Rule two: no zapping us with your weird alien gadgets. Rule three: if you lose, we get your ship.”

Folok’s antennae shot up. “That’s outrageous! What if we win?”

The human shrugged. “Then you can leave without any trouble. Fair?”

Vanex considered this. “Very well. Begin your game.”

The human’s eyes gleamed with mischief. “Alright. First question: How many of you does it take to change a light bulb?”

Folok blinked. “What is a light bulb?”

The humans erupted into laughter again. Folok sighed. “Captain, I don’t think we’re going to win this.”

Vanex cleared his throat—or at least made the squelching sound his species produced when attempting diplomacy. “If this game is an attempt at humor, I must admit I fail to see its purpose.”

The human leader leaned back in his chair; his grin unwavering. “Purpose? Oh, we’re just getting warmed up, Squiddy.”

Folok leaned toward his captain. “Sir, they seem to be toying with us. I suggest we retreat to the shuttle.”

Vanex shook his head. “We cannot abandon this opportunity for cultural exchange. We’ll play their game.”

The leader’s smile widened. “Second question: If a tree falls in the woods and no one’s around to hear it, does it make a sound?”

Vanex color shifted to perplexed green. “What does this have to do with proving we are not a threat?”

“It’s a test of your reasoning skills,” the human replied. “C’mon, what’s your answer?”

“Scientifically speaking,” Vanex began, “a falling tree generates sound waves regardless of the presence of a listener. The question itself is irrelevant.”

The humans exchanged amused glances. “Oh, he’s a smart one,” said a man wearing a motorcycle helmet duct-taped with binoculars. “Bet he’s fun at parties.”

Another human snorted. “If he knew what parties were.”

“Enough!” Vanex snapped, his color darkening to frustrated yellow. “Are all your inquiries this nonsensical?”

The leader shrugged. “Depends. You want logical questions, or you wanna keep playing ‘Mess with the Squids’?”

Folok slapped his hands against the table. “Captain, I formally request permission to leave these maniacs and return to the ship.”

The leader leaned in, narrowing his eyes at Folok. “What’s the rush, buddy? You got alien places to be? Space garbage to pick up?”

Folok bristled. “We are scientists, not refuse collectors!”

The leader chuckled. “Could’ve fooled me, given what your ship landed on. Still smells like fried refrigerator out there.”

A second human, wearing a jacket with more patches than fabric, suddenly stood. “You know what? Forget the questions. I’ve got a better idea. Let’s see if these squids can hold their own in a real challenge.”

The group erupted into cheers. Folok’s antennae drooped. “Oh no. I don’t like where this is going.”

The “challenge” turned out to be a bizarre ritual involving a game the humans called Trashball. In short, the objective was to hurl random objects into a rusted oil drum while dodging projectiles thrown by the opposing team.

The aliens stood in a huddle as the humans explained the rules.

“This is absurd,” Folok muttered. “What could this possibly prove?”

Vanex colors flickered between frustration and resignation. “They clearly value physical prowess. If we must endure their games to establish peaceful relations, so be it.”

“Prowess?” Folok looked at the humans. One of them was juggling a car tire while balancing on a cinderblock. “Captain, these creatures are mad.”

The match began with a deafening roar from the humans. The aliens, unaccustomed to Earth’s gravity, found themselves at a severe disadvantage. Folok tripped over a discarded toaster within seconds, while Vanex struggled to dodge what appeared to be a flying loaf of stale bread.

The humans, meanwhile, were in their element. The leader launched a bowling ball with alarming accuracy, narrowly missing Vanex and smashing a nearby piece of rubble.

“Careful!” Vanex shouted. “We’re here for peaceful observation, not warfare!”

“Warfare?” The leader laughed. “This is just a warm-up!”

Another human lobbed a stuffed raccoon at Folok, who let out a high-pitched squeal and flopped onto the ground.

“I hate this planet,” Folok groaned.

Despite their clumsiness, the aliens began to adapt. One of the crew, Zln’rr, discovered that his tentacle-like appendages allowed him to throw multiple objects simultaneously. By sheer luck, he managed to score three points in a row.

The humans paused, clearly impressed.

“Well, would ya look at that,” the leader said, nodding at Zln’rr. “Squiddy’s got an arm on him.”

“Technically, he has five,” Vanex corrected.

The humans erupted into laughter again.

By the end of the match, the aliens had lost spectacularly, but the mood had shifted. The humans, though victorious, seemed to regard the aliens with something akin to camaraderie.

The leader clapped Vanex on the back—or tried to, his hand sinking slightly into the alien’s gelatinous form. “You know, you guys aren’t half bad. For weird space squids, anyway.”

Vanex colors shifted to cautious optimism. “Does this mean we have established trust?”

The leader grinned. “Trust? Nah. But you’re funny. That’s a start.”

Back at the shuttle, Folok slumped into his chair. “Captain, I beg you, let’s leave this insane planet before they invent another game.”

Vanex ignored him, reviewing the drone footage of the encounter. “Remarkable. Their resilience isn’t just physical—it’s psychological. Even in the face of hardship, they retain their humor, their adaptability, and their absurd rituals.”

“Absurd is an understatement,” Folok muttered.

Vanex colors brightened to a thoughtful cyan. “We must report this to the Federation. Humanity may be chaotic, but there is much to learn from them.”

A loud banging noise interrupted his thoughts. The crew turned to see the human leader outside the shuttle, waving a broken satellite dish like a flag.

“Hey, Squiddies! Next time, bring snacks!”

Folok groaned. “Captain, please, let’s go.”

The shuttle ascended shakily, still recovering from the earlier fridge-based landing incident. Inside, Folok was furiously scrubbing his atmospheric filter while muttering under his breath.

“I’ll be venting carbonized toast crumbs for weeks,” he grumbled, pulling a half-melted rubber band from his intake valve. “Why does everything they touch smell burnt?”

Captain Vanex ignored the complaints, focused instead on the holographic interface displaying their recorded interactions. The humans’ antics played on a loop: the ridiculous attire, the absurd games, and the laughter that seemed to permeate every moment.

“This is extraordinary,” Vanex murmured.

Folok looked up, exasperated. “What part of being pelted with ancient carb-based projectiles do you find extraordinary, Captain?”

“Not the projectiles,” Vanex replied. “Their behavior. Despite their primitive conditions and apparent lack of unified purpose, they function with a level of improvisation and cooperation I have never encountered.”

“Cooperation?!” Folok pointed to the screen, where the leader was seen yelling at another human for using a rusty frying pan as a shield. “They barely know what they’re doing!”

“Exactly,” Vanex said. “And yet, it works. They adapt to chaos efficently. It’s as though disorder is their natural state.”

Folok threw his hands up. “If that’s your conclusion, Captain, then I must insist we avoid planets where ‘natural state’ translates to ‘insanity.’”

The ship re-entered orbit, and the crew began compiling their report for the Galactic Unification Federation. The holographic log filled with notes: Cultural Analysis: Humans maintain complex social rituals despite post-apocalyptic conditions.

Technological Observations: Heavy reliance on scavenged and repurposed materials. Innovative but highly unstable.

Psychological Traits: Humor as a coping mechanism. High tolerance for unpredictability. Persistent mockery of outsiders.

Zln’rr, still riding the high of his accidental Trashball success, chimed in. “Captain, do you think they’ll join the Federation someday?”

Vanex considered this, his colors shifting thoughtfully. “It is difficult to say. Their behavior defies standard metrics. However, their adaptability and resourcefulness suggest potential.”

Folok snorted. “Potential for what? Driving the galaxy mad?”

A sudden beeping interrupted the discussion. One of the monitors displayed an incoming transmission from the surface. It was the human leader, grinning broadly as static crackled around him.

“Hey, Squiddies! Hope you didn’t leave yet. We got a proposition for ya.”

Vanex hesitated before responding. “This is Captain Vanex of the Galactic Exploration Vessel Curiosity. State your proposition.”

The leader’s grin widened. “We’re throwing a party. Y’all should come back down. Bring your weird squid drinks or whatever.”

Folok’s antennae shot up in alarm. “Captain, no. Absolutely not. Parties lead to games, and games lead to flying bread loaves.”

Vanex raised a calming appendage. “We appreciate the invitation, but our mission requires us to depart. Perhaps another time.”

The leader tilted his head. “Alright, your loss. But if you change your mind, just look for the big fire. That’s how we mark the fun spots.”

The transmission cut off.

Folok slumped in his seat, relief flooding his posture. “Thank the stars. Let’s get out of here before they invent something worse than Trashball.”

As the shuttle prepared to leave Earth’s orbit, a loud clang reverberated through the hull. Folok froze.

“What now?”

One of the external cameras swiveled to reveal a small, crudely constructed device latched onto the ship’s side. It appeared to be made from duct tape, an old radio, and what looked like a hamster wheel.

Vanex squinted at the screen. “What is that?”

The device emitted a burst of static, followed by the leader’s voice:

“Hey, Squiddies! Forgot to mention—we stuck this thing on your ship so you can call us anytime. Don’t worry, it’s totally safe! Probably.”

Folok’s antennae drooped. “Captain, I swear, if that explodes—”

The device suddenly began playing what the humans called “music,” a cacophony of drums and electric strings that made Folok curl into a ball.

“Captain,” he whimpered, “please, just go.”

The ship finally broke free of Earth’s gravitational pull, leaving behind the smoking ruins and their unpredictable inhabitants.

In the briefing chamber, Vanex finalized his report. “Despite the apparent anarchy of their society, humans demonstrate an extraordinary capacity for innovation, humor, and resilience. They are a species worth continued observation—albeit from a safe distance.”

Folok muttered, “Define ‘safe.’”

Vanex ignored him and added a final note to the log:

Recommendation: Further study required. Bring snacks.

As the Curiosity disappeared into the vast expanse of space, the humans on the ground celebrated their bizarre encounter.

“Think they’ll come back?” one of them asked, throwing another log onto the bonfire.

The leader smirked. “Oh, they’ll be back. Nobody forgets their first party on Earth.”",1,1732129629.0,u_SciFiTime,0,1.0,False

""Humans are like their weather—unpredictable, chaotic, and likely to hit you with something when you least expect it.""

“Captain Vanex, I beg you to reconsider!” Folok, the ship's logistics officer, clung to the edge of his console. “This planet’s surface readings are erratic! There's no harmony in the data—nothing aligns properly!”

Captain Vanex narrowed his gelatinous eyes, the color shifting from a confident green to an impatient yellow. “Nonsense, Folok. This is a golden opportunity to study a Class E-9 species in its natural decline. Post-catastrophic worlds are ripe for observation.”

Folok’s antennae twitched nervously as the shuttle descended through the planet’s atmosphere. The terrain below was a patchwork of ruined cities, wild overgrowth, and inexplicable plumes of smoke. “Natural decline?” he muttered. “Looks more like deliberate chaos.”

The captain ignored him, addressing the crew. “Stay sharp. This species—‘humans’—survived an apocalypse of their own making. Their resilience could be invaluable for our records.”

The landing was unconventional. A stray piece of metallic debris had taken out one of the stabilizers mid descent, and the shuttle landed with a crunch that sent a ripple of unease through the crew.

“Did we just hit a refrigerator?” one of the technicians asked, peering through the external cameras.

Folok slapped his console in frustration. “This species hoards garbage even in death!”

“Silence,” barked Vanex. “Deploy the drones. Begin recording.”

Two drones zipped out of the shuttle and floated above the wasteland. The ruins of what had once been a bustling city lay in disarray.

Crumbling skyscrapers leaned at impossible angles; their surfaces adorned with colorful graffiti depicting strange slogans: “Keep Out!” “No Bots Allowed!” and the particularly ominous, “DO NOT OPEN THIS CAN.”

“Why are they still warning themselves after the collapse?” Vanex wondered aloud.

The first sign of life was a humanoid figure darting between the rubble. The drones zoomed in, broadcasting the image back to the shuttle.

The figure wore mismatched clothing—a heavy coat over gym shorts, combat boots, and a traffic cone for a hat. In one hand, he carried a long, spiked pole.

His face was obscured by what appeared to be a gas mask retrofitted with Christmas lights.

“Fascinating,” Vanex said, his color shifting to academic blue. “Primitive scavenging behavior. Note the improvisation.”

The humanoid suddenly stopped and stared directly at the drone. Then, without hesitation, he hurled the pole like a javelin.

The drone dodged just in time.

“AGGRESSIVE PRIMITIVE BEHAVIOR DETECTED,” it reported in a monotone voice.

The humanoid yelled something incomprehensible and ran into the ruins.

“What did it say?” asked Folok, his antennae twitching.

The drone replayed the sound: “Get that floaty thing outta my turf!”

Vanex color dimmed to a contemplative mauve. “Remarkable. It appears humans can still assert territorial claims even in a state of societal collapse.”

The crew ventured out of the shuttle cautiously. The air smelled faintly of burnt rubber and wet cardboard. Folok activated his atmospheric stabilizer, muttering, “This place is going to clog my vent system.”

A faint rumbling noise drew their attention. The crew turned just in time to see a group of humans emerging from behind a crumbled wall.

There were six of them, each dressed more absurdly than the last—one wore a full suit of medieval armor spray-painted neon pink, while another carried a flamethrower made from a leaf blower and what looked like a barbecue propane tank.

The humans stared at the aliens. The aliens stared back.

Finally, the human in the Christmas-light gas mask stepped forward. “Who the hell are you, and what do you want?”

Captain Vanex stepped forward, his tone calm. “We are explorers from the Galactic Unification Federation, here to observe your species and—”

“Observe?” The human squinted. “You mean spy on us?”

“No, no,” Vanex said, raising his hands in a placating gesture. “We mean no harm. We are here to study and perhaps learn from your resilience.”

A few things upfront:


- english isn't my first language


- I'm f in real life if that matters


- please be an adult


- I don't have discord but if we click I would download it, if it makes things easier. I would like to start on reddit or telegram 


- if you have a fun idea, don't hesitate to tell me


- I write thrid person 


- please dm/chat me and mention a colour 




A few ideas as suggestions:


First idea (axm) 


Your character would be very succesful laywer. A rockstar in his field. You can choose if he is a passionat prosecutor or if he defends organised crime. My character would be his new assistant or secretary.

The pressure of the cases gets to him more and more. Death threats, high stakes and all. I thought panic attacks, paranoia, stuff like that. The assistant notices and starts to support their new boss- hangs around until their boss also leaves and they can get him to his car, opening all letters and packets, maybe not mentioning the food that goes missing from her desk...





Or maybe something with more thrill? Either one of us could play either character. (axa)


Sunshine and pyscho. One character is a normal person, the happy and caring type. One day a new neighbour from a different country moves into the same building. Sunshine of course sees them as a new friend. Pyscho is at first avoident and later tolerating... eventuelly growikg fond and solvomg sumshines problems their way. 





Or maybe a fantasy one? (axm)



Your character is immortal- for whatever reason. Maybe he is a vampire. Maybe it's just a fluke of nature. Or he is a powerful mage. 
He lives for some time now and thinks not a single living soul knows his secret. One day he is just buying a coffee in a shop, something he has done a million times, in a shop he hasn't even visited much and the barista writes his original name on the cup. The one isn't using anymore for a long time. 
He doesn't remeber of ever having seen that person before. 





I also have an idea leaning on but still very different of the movie pretty woman. ",2,1732129617.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

I don't know how to explain it.  It seems like I'm having to force myself to eat, but I'm not really having cravings for anything else.  It's not like I'm sitting here craving Taco Bell and forcing myself to eat what I have.  I feel physical hunger, I can feel my low blood sugar, I can feel my motivation going away.  I just sat with my lunch in front of me and didn't eat it for 45 minutes and threw it away.  The other night I decided to get DoorDash and was so hungry - I just sat and stared at the menu for 30 minutes.  Nothing was ""compelling"" but I still felt so hungry.

I've upped my calories.  I'm adding more carbs in.  I'm going to change up my meal plans this weekend.. Any other ideas?  I eat 4-5 meals a day, over 1g / lb LBM protein, 2500-2600 calories (estimated burn is 3500).  The main changes I've brainstormed and I'm making are increasing carbs at all meals.  I'm going up to 2700 calories and making sure all 4 meals have 75-85g of carbs.  I'm mentally exhausted on chicken breast, so I'm swapping one meal from chicken burrito bowls to Tacos Al Pastor and replacing chicken breast with boneless skinless chicken thighs in another.

I felt this way a couple weeks ago, but it was specifically at night when I got home from work and sapped my motivation to lift or do anything.

1gvx98w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1gvx98w/a_tool_that_deterministically_finds_joins/,a tool that deterministically finds joins ,"hi all:

i hope this doesn't violate rule #5 of the subreddit which is ""no shill/opaque marketing"".  i have nothing to sell, but i am looking for critical feedback on a tool i've been developing with friends.

the short version is: a group of friends and i built a not-purchasable-or-marketed-tool that finds, visualizes, and prioritizes valid joins. in short, we access your data warehouse, run our join finder, and it spits out relevant joins into an interactive tool. it also has some data discovery bits that are not novel at all but i think, helpful.  we built the tool because we couldn't find a tool that deterministically found all joins, and we were spending boat loads of time doing find-valid-join work with every new team we joined.

a few folks are asking what a valid join is, here's our definition: A valid join indicates that two columns represent the same semantic information (not just the same type and format of information). For example, two integer columns which contain customer ids from the same system represent the same information, while two integer columns which contain dollar values do not (these are simply the same type and format of information).

we've demoed the tool to a handful of friendlies -- the head data architect for a fairly large bank, a field CTO for a large technical consultancy, and the distinguished architect for a Fortune 10 company.  everyone has said the tool is helpful, and they are interested in onboarding the tool when it's commercialized.  but we know these people, and we think the takes could have some bias.

we were bootstrapped for most of the product's life ( doing our day jobs and working on this tool at the same time, but we just raised a small round from my adopted dad and a friend).  we have zero sales pitch, but i am hoping i can do a non-commercial demo for you and get critical feedback.   to affirm, we will 100% have no pitch / no purchase / no email sign up / no surprise -- the tool is not purchasable -- we're in the alpha stage/is this a stupid idea stage and just trying to validate ideas with folks in the space.  if we do anything stupid like that, tell a mod and get us banned.

i'm happy to get you a gift card to a coffee shop for an hour (or less!) of your time.  if i can say thank you some other way, let me know how.  feel free to pm me directly or comment on the thread and i'll reach out.

thanks for considering!",3,1732129352.0,dataengineering,9,0.8,False

While here, I finally got the courage to set up dating profiles and start talking to women.

Yesterday, I went on a date (my second date ever) with a girl I really liked. I even traveled quite far to meet her because she seemed genuinely interested, and we shared a similar taste in music (something I find pretty rare).

We met at a coffee shop and got ourselves coffee. When the cashier asked if we wanted to pay together, I froze and realized I hadn’t thought about this beforehand. I nervously said, “I don’t know,” and we ended up paying separately. It didn’t seem like a big deal at first, and we sat down to chat. I felt like we got along really well, and she seemed to enjoy my funny stories and jokes.

Then, about 30 minutes into the conversation, a random woman approached us and said something like, “Hey, I couldn’t help but overhear you two. I noticed what happened earlier, and I think it’s totally wrong if the guy doesn’t pay on the first date.”

I was stunned. How can a random person just walk up to someone’s date like that???

As you might imagine, the mood soured after that. When the woman left, I asked my date what she thought about it. She said she agreed with the woman but also thought I might not have known better since it could be a cultural thing. (For context, I told the woman I’m from Germany, and she said she had a friend there who told her it was the same over there – which I don't think is entirely true.)

I tried my best to lighten the mood after that, and we still had some laughs and good conversations. Eventually, she said she needed to leave soon, so I walked her to her car. We ended up talking for another 10 minutes even though she said she was running late (I even reminded her that I didn’t want to hold her up). We realized we hadn’t even talked about music, so I joked that we’d have to meet again. I also made a funny comment like, “I won’t be Dutch next time,” which she seemed to find amusing. We hugged and went our separate ways.

When I got home, I texted her saying I had fun meeting her, but I haven’t gotten a response. I feel terrible and incredibly sad. I can’t believe I might have ruined this over something as small as not thinking to pay for an eight-dollar coffee.

Do you think this really had such a big impact, or am I overthinking it? Her birthday is on Friday, should I reach out to her then, even if she didn't respond to me?",1,1732129234.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I make a habit of wearing earbuds virtually 24/7 to blast my eardrums with white noise, power tool sounds or industrial machinery to drown out the sounds of strangers (or myself) masticating.

But sometimes it gets so bad that everything is a source of anger. Every sound, every physical touch, every smell, the brightness of lights, every single one of my senses overwhelms me in that same frustrating, rage-inducing, overpowering, massively heightened intensity, all at once, and I feel like running into a sensory deprivation chamber or throwing my whole being into a black hole.

...is this what it means to be overstimulated?

I've never felt like I share the same sensory issues that classic ADHD is supposed to have. I love crowded parties, loud music and multi-color LED lights. Sure, coffee makes me pass out like it's liquid benadryl, and I have the worst attention span, and I will never remember to take my daily vitamins for as long as I live, and like a dozen people irl have told me I must have ADHD in the past couple years, but I don't like being alone, or soft/warm lighting or get irritated by the texture of things outside of those discreet moments of intense misophonia-turned-all-senses-overload.",1,1732129218.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

**“A simple act of kindness can reach into eternity; it can save your soul besides another’s.”**

You wouldn’t suspect that the jovial Orthodox priest who carries the gold chalise with such reverence from behind the iconostasis of “Mother of Unexpected Joy” church was once a drug dealing, rambling hippie and coffee-house owner with his own underground band, not to mention an illegitimate descendent of Nathaniel Boone, the son of the legendary American hero Daniel Boone.  Father Moses Berry, who is by now in his 60s, is still a rolling ball of fire, overflowing with spontaneous exuberance.  He bounces from one story to another as he moves from one section of the Ozarks Afro-American Heritage Museum he founded in his native town of Ash Grove.  He is a man who unravels a ball of tightly-wound stories, one knotted to another and yet another.

Father Berry’s story, in fact his entire existence, is rooted in the dark history of American slavery.  The three-room museum he opened is jam-packed with heirlooms, objects and artifacts culled entirely from his family’s possession.  Two faded sepia prints in oval frame reveal pictures of his great-grandmother, Maria Boone, mistress to Nathaniel, and her daughter, Caroline Boone Berry, his grandmother.  They are wearing stiff, laced-up dresses with matching bonnets fashionable for ladies in the 19^(th) century.  He says that the child of a slave mistress is born between the dark and the daylight, raised in the shadowland, not of this world.  They are children whose existence is denied, whose marked absence in the American consciousness is a mark of their presence.

A collage of black-and-white photos, yellowed historical documents, tools, and everyday objects align the walls of Father Berry’s personal museum revealing how the intimate personal facts of a family’s life create the historical impersonal account in a textbook.  He points to a faded photo of a young Black girl in a white dress.  “This is Fanny Murray at age 13 in 1866,” Berry explains.  “Fanny saved a young man’s life just by doing his laundry for 10 cents a week. This is why every little thing you do is important. A simple act of loving kindness, a seemingly insignificant gesture can have an incredible impact.”  The young man, who had gotten in trouble and whose family had consequently disowned him, eventually became a history professor.   Underneath is another photo, color this time, of an old woman in a pink dress and a wide, flamboyant Sunday hat.  “This is Ms. Olivia Murray, Fanny’s daughter, who died at 93 in 1991. She would walk down these streets in long dresses with a bonnet even after the 60s.  She was an Aunt Jemmima figure and quite an embarrassment to the young people in the town.  ‘Check her out,’ they would point and stare, but I would tell them you can’t dismiss people at a glance. We don’t know who the person is, who s/he really is.”

Through the personalized tour of his family’s history, Father Berry spins his own story.



Over forty years ago, an African-American teenager, Karl, leaves home at 15 after hearing that in California young people were shooting flowers instead of bullets.  “California, man,” he recalls in his black *rassa*, blacker than his glistening skin in the hot May sun, “Once I heard about California, about flower power, and how people were living together in love, I had to go.”  He hitched his way west from his native town of Ash Grove, Mo.  In California, he lived in a commune, learned how to roll hashish, and to tie-dye t-shirts.  He returned to his native state of Missouri where he settled in Columbia, Mo.  There he “hustled” by selling leather goods, Latigo of London in particular, out of a small store front on the corner of 8^(th) Street and Broadway, “The Strow Away.”  At night he jammed jazz rock with his group “Honey Chile,” which even had a hit single in the area.  He was active in the Stony Brook commune that convened by a creek in the granite hills of the area.  His fortune changed when he opened an underground coffee shop, the Rainbow Bread Company.  While it fronted as a “coffee shop,” as was the case with most coffee shops of the period, it made a bigger profit selling hashish and marijuana.  It would have continued as a lucrative underground establishment had the Columbia police department not set it on fire.  As it could not secure a search warrant, the police forced a raid.  During that forced break in by the police, which resulted in almost total devastation of the coffee house, Karl and his partners were forcibly arrested and taken into custody.

Without representation, Karl was placed in solitary confinement.  “It was a cell literally 5 feet by 3 feet by 7 feet. No windows. Just a chink where they could throw you a piece of stale bread.” Karl could not say for how long he was confined in the dark pit.  But he feared the worst.  Under the statutes, his sentence could stretch for up to 15 years in a penitentiary. “I had hit a low point. This was the end,” Father Berry remembers puncturing the somberness of the event with his full, guttural laugh that reaches down through his heart and soul to the bottom of his shoe soles.  “I remember the day before I was supposed to get my sentence.  I got down on my knees in that dark, narrow cell and prayed for the first time in my life.  I prayed and called out to God as I had never done before. I said, ‘Lord, get me out of this one, and if you do, I promise to serve you.’”

The next morning Moses heard a key turn in the cell door.  At first he did not want to come out.  He had heard how the guards would periodically beat prisoners and then return them to their cells.  Haunted by the visions of the brutal beatings the prisoners received at the hands of the guards he witnessed before he was placed in solitary confinement, he refused to exit. The guards had to drag him out into the light while they shouted, “You’ve been released! Get out!”

“He repented,” Father Berry muses. “The police officer who had pressed charges against me had repented.  He had come to the precinct before midnight and dropped all charges.  He must have come just about the same time as my prayer.” From that day forth, Moses Berry’s life changed completely.  His soul had heard the call of the divine.

It would be several years, however, before Moses’s course led him to Orthodoxy.  Upon his release, Moses traveled to New York City, where he became a teacher in Harlem.  It was there where he met his wife, a liberal, Jewish teacher.  “I remember walking down the streets of Harlem, arm in arm, singing Beatles’ songs. People must have thought we were crazy,” Father Berry reminisces.  On a spontaneous whim they accepted an invitation of a friend to visit in Richmond, Virginia. After driving eight hours, they were prodded by this same friend who was Orthodox to visit an Orthodox chapel another two hours away.   While the reluctance was strong, they did find the chapel; it was on the second floor of someone’s Colonial house.  “This wasn’t a church; this was somebody’s living room,” Berry says.  But upon entering, even with the makeshift choir of three or four women, never had he heard a service like this.  “I heard things like ‘Rejoice, Laver purifying conscience. Rejoice, Wine-bowl over-filled with joy. Rejoice, sweet-scented Fragrance of Christ. Rejoice, Life of mystic festival.’ This was poetry. This was beauty and peace and love. There was incense. There was reverence. Nowhere had I heard liturgy like this. I became Orthodox from that point on.”

Since that time, Berry has striven to live out his promise to God.  He has worked with at-risk youth, prisoners, and drug addicts.  One of his many accomplishments included starting up a 7-step drug rehabilitation program in Detroit based on the principles of salvation in Orthodox theology.

His two most recent achievements include founding a museum and church in Ash Grove, MO.  Father Berry and his family have returned to his roots.  They moved out of a comfortable three-story Victorian house in suburban St. Louis into a 150-year old unmarked farmhouse, the same farmhouse in which his great-grandmother was born. “Most of the Blacks moved out of Ash Grove. My family stayed.  When they heard I was going to open up a museum in that little town, ‘Be careful’ they told me, white people are not going to like it.” The museum, however, has been successful and has become a point of pride for the town.

The Ozark African-American museum houses a uniquely personal assortment of historical objects tied intimately to the “dark side” of the Boone family.  Some are quilts his great-grandmother and grandmother collaborated on.  One quilt, a 1790 piece, featured prominently in the Underground Railroad. The quilt in triangular green, brown, and yellow patterns would be draped over the porches of “safe houses” a signal that welcomed entry for runaway slaves.  Over the doorway to the second room is a “two-lady saw,” another object the two women would use.  It is smaller, thinner, and shorter, at least by a foot, than a regular saw.

Among the other objects on display is a minted coin commemorating the lynching of three Black men on Good Friday 1906 in the Ozarks and an authentic 1858 AG Brock slave tag that was used during slave auctions at the houses of that company around the South.  Father demonstrates a “screw lock” which looks like a menacing wrought-iron horseshoe with a long screw transversing it at the edge of which a bolt slowly tightens over a slave’s ankles.  According to Berry, it is the origin of our slang expression for “screw” as slaves would report among themselves “so-and-so got screwed.”   A leather-bound, yellowing volume of *The Remarkable Advancement of the Afro-American* by Lancaster Water, 1898 edition, and behind that, in a glass case, the same title but the original binding from 1852.  The painting and photos in the museum tell the stories of slaves who fought in the Union army and were later freed for their service, of 12-year-old runaways who were frozen to death, married couples who started churches, of rebel slaves who saw visions and organized services in the forest eventually founding the African Methodist Episcopalian church.

Another curiosity is the hand-crocheted African Mammy doll, a caricature of the Caribbean slave trade figure.  The doll stands alone on a green draped coffee table at the exit of the museum.  Hand-made with double lacing, the doll’s woolen face exaggerates lips nose and eyes.  She is wearing a green and yellow headdress from under which protrudes black woolen cornrows.  “Mammie is a West African matriarch,” Father Berry explains the subtle shadings of cultural history in everyday objects as he turns the doll upside down.  “She is a Josephine Baker fruit dancer underneath,” he says as the doll transforms into a bare-bellied, buxomous exotic dancer bearing the typical platter of bananas and pineapples on her head.  The doll provides a casual metaphor for the transformation of a people, a subtle symbolism for the complexities of the soul at its surface and at its depths.

Father Berry ends with one final story that underlines the importance of relationship, the one thing that can transcend the impersonality of history, the division of race, the misunderstanding of class. Several yards from the Berry-Boone farmhouse is the family cemetery.  Gray stones mark the resting place of slaves who never reached their final destination on the Underground Railroad.  One of Harriet Tubman’s porters is there.  So are the graves of Maria Boone and Caroline Boone Berry.  “It was maybe three months after we had moved into the farmhouse, so things were still messy.  I drive back from the church and all of a sudden, I see this red Corvette with California plates parked by the gate blocking the way to the cemetery.   I see these three blonde kids in the back.  ‘What are you doing here?’ I ask them. ‘Well, I’m sorry,’ they say all polite and all. ‘We didn’t know anyone lived here.’ (He puts on a high-pitched voice mimicking all too many “white boys”).  Now, I call back to them all gruff and all, ‘I am here to tell you I live here, and you are on my property. What are you doing here?’  It turns out these kids had been raised by a Black nanny who was buried in this field.  ‘Mammie raised us from when we were seven years old when our own mother died,’ they said. So, these kids had been coming to her grave every year on the anniversary of her death to put flowers on her grave.’”  He ends his story like a sermon.  “A simple act of kindness can reach into eternity; it can save your soul besides another’s.”

“Orthodoxy is the truth. It is the one true path to salvation,” Father Berry confesses.  “Once you understand what it is all about, there is no hiding from the truth.”  Once Orthodox, he confesses the greatest challenge for staying Orthodox is hopelessness.  “The hardest thing to do in Orthodoxy is to learn how to have hope.”

Father Moses Berry now serves hope from a golden chalise every Sunday at 10 a.m. in a small, white and red barn church with a golden onion dome in the middle of a cornfield in rural Missouri.  “There is no other hope than in our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ,” he smiles.  “I am a living example of the immanent love of God for His children, even those who have gone far astray, of despair turning into hope. We must never lose hope.”

**BACKGROUND**:

In early 2023, I decided I wanted to run a marathon. I am 28, was a decent high school runner (16:49 5K, 4:44 mile), but have not trained seriously in 10 years, and basically didn't run from age 22-24. Got back into it in 2020 (as did the rest of the world), but never more than \~15-30 mi/wk through the end of 2023 except a couple outliers.

I didn't know if I would be one-and-done or catch the marathon bug, so I decided to do NYC, which I'd heard across the board was the best experience (tough course, but incredible energy), especially since I live in Manhattan. I signed up for enough races to complete the 9+1 program\*\*\* and qualified for NYC 2024 in December of 2023.

\*\*\*I have some issues with 9+1 being too easy to complete (you can qualify for one of the most competitive marathons in the world by jogging 9 races that are 4 miles or shorter), and a theory about it being the reason NYC is so impossible to qualify for with non-NYRR times, but that is a rant for a different post. (and I fully recognize this program is great for a ton of reasons, and is the only reason I was able to run)

In the spring, I trained pretty consistently for the Brooklyn Half (*loosely* followed a 12 week Pfitz plan, 60 mile peak). Ran the half in 1:23:34 in May. Since this had gone well, I figured a a sub-3 marathon debut was a realistic goal with some half marathon fitness carryover leading into a real marathon training block. I took the next 6 weeks pretty easy (avg \~23 mi/wk).

**TRAINING BLOCK**:

For my training plan, I did kind of a hybrid of of Pfitz 18-70 and ""The Program"" hosted by Bandit (16 weeks, 55 mile peak). The Bandit program holds in-person interval workouts on Wednesday evenings and long runs on Saturday mornings, both at their west village store (I applied, got in, and attended whenever I was available). \*Not an ad\*, but running with the sub-3 pace group was an awesome experience and I would recommend applying to the program for anyone doing NYC next year (only $100 for 16 weeks of group training/coaching and a bunch of free stuff, and they have pacers for all goal times).

Something that was intimidating, but definitely helpful, was that almost every long run in the Bandit program was a workout, with miles at MP, HMP, etc. I also usually added at least a mile to each long run by jogging over to the store in the morning to meet the group. I made it through 18 weeks without any serious injuries, but ended up peaking at 64 miles instead of my plan of 70 due to a little calf issue heading into peak week.

Weekly Mileage: 38, 47, 44, 42, 50, 53, 55, 57, 57, 51, 58, 64, 51, 62, 58, 54, 40, 22 (pre-race)

Longest Run: 23 w/ 8 @ MP

Runs Over 20 Miles: Three (20, 21, 23)

Total Mileage: 904

**PRE-RACE**:

Perhaps the most important piece of my race day experience was the fact that one of my best friends from college, Dan, who ran a 2:43 at NYC last year, offered to run with me. His original 2024 plan was to race Chicago and then 3 weeks later pace/join me for a sub-3 attempt in New York. He decided not to do Chicago several months ahead of time, but said he still wanted to run with me for NYC, rather than race on his own for a PR. Don't know many people who would fly up from Georgia and use their only race of the year to pace a friend 15+ min slower than them... *I owe him one*.

We woke up at 4:15 in the east village and got in our scheduled uber at 5:00 headed towards the ferry. Halfway through the 10 minute drive I panicked, realizing my nerves had caused me to forget my watch, which was still charging on the coffee table. When we got dropped off, I immediately asked the Nike rep handing out free coffee if I could use her phone, and called Dan's girlfriend who was back at my apartment. She didn't even hesitate, jumped out of bed, got in a cab, and brought me the watch... *I owe her one*.

Ferry ride was fine, bus ride was ok (sat in a 20 min standstill 100 ft from drop-off for some reason). We used the porta potties right at the entrance to pink village where the buses drop you off, which I definitely recommend because they had zero line, whereas the ones near the corrals were mobbed. We laid around for a bit, briefly jogged a warmup, then went into the corral around 8:30. We threw our remaining layers in bins, the corral barrier was dropped, and we headed over to the start line on the lower level ramp of the bridge. Lots of butterflies in my stomach.

**RACE**:

\*mile splits based on watch gps, which said average 6:39 pace, so they are probably a tiny bit inflated and to be taken with a grain of salt

**Miles 1&2:** *Adrenaline* \- (7:21, 6:09)

As everyone told me would be the case, the adrenaline easily carried me up and over Verrazano (I was pink wave, so lower level). My first marathon ever, looking out at the skyline of the city I live in, hearing the news helicopters overhead, one of my best running buddies by my side, thinking about how insanely grateful I was for the 14 different locations that friends and family told me they would be watching along the route - chills.

**Miles 3-11:** *Cruising* \- (6:36, 6:36, 6:24, 6:24, 6:23, 6:30, 6:29, 6:29, 6:22)

The next 9 miles felt great. Passed my old boss at mile 3 and got a nice shout, then made our way through bay ridge and into sunset park where the crowds started to really pick up. Saw a couple more friends along 4th ave. No pains, no fatigue, on pace for 2:52 or so, ahead of all my goals. Thought about cutting back but I felt good, could easily carry brief conversation, and my friend Dan was reminding me every mile that we were hitting perfect splits.

As we approached downtown Brooklyn the crowds were incredible. When we turned on to Lafayette and headed through Fort Greene and Clinton Hill it was deafening - people are not exaggerating about this. Cowbells, signs, music blasting, thousands of people screaming. You barely even realize mile 9 includes a decent hill. Once we turned onto Bedford the crowds definitely thinned out (as expected - the Hasidic section of Williamsburg), but after we crossed over the BQE and headed toward the Williamsburg bridge they started to pick right back up.

**Miles 12-16:** *Solid* \- (6:08, 6:33, 6:39, 6:42, 6:59)

After we passed the 11 mile mark and the crowds were absolutely roaring again, I started to look out for my college friends, who I knew would be screaming their heads off in a big group on the right side. I spotted them a couple blocks ahead and couldn't help but pick up the pace. We moved over to the right and gave them all huge smiles and high fives without slowing down. Another huge adrenaline boost, and a 6:08 mile split - our fastest of the day (and maybe a mistake looking back).

Even if it didn't quite compare to Bedford Ave, the crowds stayed awesome through Greenpoint. But it was along this stretch that I first started to feel the miles wearing on my right quad. I mentioned it to Dan, but he assured me it would be alright, and we didn't slow down too much. Cruised through the half at 1:25:56 - well ahead of goal pace. At this point I was convinced sub-2:53 was in the cards.

The crowds in Queens were still great, and the next two miles flew by until Queensboro as I thought about my family waiting on 1st ave. The bridge itself also wasn't too bad. My legs, especially the right quad, were hurting, but my lungs/heartrate were fine, and I was able to talk and respond to Dan's check-ins throughout the climb. We stayed at sub-7 splits over the peak (per garmin), again keeping us well ahead of my goal.

Another thing people aren't exaggerating about: the roar of the 1st ave crowd as you head toward the exit ramp coming off the bridge. Accelerating downhill, only 10 miles to go, crowd going crazy after the silence of the bridge - more chills.

**Miles 17-20:** *Holding On* (6:14, 6:33, 6:49, 6:57)

As we curled onto 1st ave after the 16 mile mark, I got another boost knowing my family would be about 10 blocks ahead on the left - including my dad, a former college runner and 2:40 marathoner, who was always my (and my 3 siblings) loudest cheerleader at high school cross country meets. I saw my own face blown up on poster board about 2 blocks away, and picked up the pace the same way I did for my friends in Williamsburg. Got a huge boost from the high fives and screams, and cruised to a 6:14 17th mile.

This is around where I started to really feel it. Didn't slow down too much for the remainder of 1st ave, but wasn't quite keeping the same paces as earlier. Passed a few more friends at different points on the UES that kept me going, and headed into the Bronx, hitting the 20 mile mark still on pace to break 2:54.

**Miles 21-25:** *Pain* (6:46. 6:59, 6:58, 7:15, 6:54)

This is where it got tough. The Bronx crowds were pretty good, but after coming off the high of the 1st ave craziness, it wasn't quite enough to pull me out of the dark hole my legs were dragging me into. Most of this stretch is pretty blurry. Honestly shocked that we only had one mile above 7 minute pace (up 5th ave hill) based on how I felt. This is where I owe so much to my friend Dan. I was fading, and for this whole stretch he ran about 5 feet ahead of me, constantly telling me to keep pushing, counting down the miles, counting down the minutes. Not sure what would've happened without him there.

We made it up 5th ave hill, which slowed me down a bit but didn't really make me feel any worse than I already did. When we turned into the park, the crowds were roaring again, but I wasn't quite there mentally, so nothing was really gonna give me much of a boost at this point. My legs were screaming at me, especially that right quad that had first started hurting 11 miles earlier. Sub-3 seemed inevitable barring a disaster, so the goal now was just to stay steady through the finish line.

The only thing that kept me going along with Dan's constant encouragement was knowing that the combined group of my college friends from mile 12 and my family from mile 17 would be together on central park south.

**Mile 26(.2):** *Home Stretch* (6:51)

Although I felt like I was near death, seeing my family and friends at mile \~25.5 made me speed up yet again. For about 400 meters, I picked up the pace, gave them a brief look and a wave, and tried to tell myself it was almost over. This speed up caused a calf cramp, which spasmed on every step from here to the end, but I was able to keep it in control with some intentional heel striking.

I crossed the finish line in 2:56:39 and almost collapsed, but walked with a hand on Dan's shoulder for several minutes. All I could think was that he was the only reason I made it to that finish line without walking or stopping during those last few miles.

**POST-RACE/REFLECTION**:

Incredible experience. The crowds are unreal, this city is amazing, the course is tough but so much fun. I fell apart a little bit but I absolutely still consider it a successful first marathon. I said throughout training that my main goal was sub-3, and I ended up hitting that.

It sounds corny and annoying and I've mentioned it too many times, but I am beyond grateful for Dan. I cannot stress enough how amazing it was to not have had to spend a single second alone during my first marathon, probably the toughest and most painful thing I've done in my life.

Still too early to say whether or not I've caught the marathon bug, but I at least don't think this will be my only one. Being so close to the Boston and Chicago qualifiers, and pretty close to New York, makes me feel like with experience, some slight tweaks (doing any sort of regular strength work), and maybe a flat course, I should be able to hit those goals. Plus, again, running New York was an incredible experience.

1gvwuiy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvwuiy,What type of sideboard should I get?,"I made a post elsewhere yesterday and got a couple recommendations but now I have more context after searching a bit on my own. 

The sideboard will go along the shorter wall beside/behind my dining table (on the short end). The one I was going to get was discontinued and I can’t find anything like it as it was a perfect match for my table. But now, given the circumstance I know I can be more creative with my selection and find something that will introduce more texture and interest into my space. I made a collage of some sideboards I found that might be interesting, some I’m more confident in than others but I’d like to know what everyone thinks :)?

*the sideboard will be used as a coffee bar and so I need internal storage. As you might see from all the baby stuff everywhere I have a baby who will turn into a toddler soon, so I need doors on my sideboard to childproof.

* I’m in Canada so I’m limited to items available here as I’m not interested in incurring duties 

*This is a rental and so I wish I could change the walls and floors to something warmer but I cannot. Ignore the green tape on the wall as I was planning a gallery wall lol, yesterday I was suggested to lower the frames so I will do that. ",1,1732128379.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1gvwu6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gvwu6g/not_sure_how_to_navigate_this_situation_on_my/,Not sure how to navigate this situation on my avoidant ex,"Me (F26) Him (M28) were together a year and a month ago split up due to him acting in a way that hurt my feelings, we haven’t spoke much since then as he’s been wanting space which is valid, however when I’ve reached out he’s been cold and dismissive so again left him to his space. I’ve been wanting to rekindle the relationship because it was good but from one conversation he said he wasent interested.

However last night I messaged him about soemthing I had in his house and he wasent blunt with the conversation or anything which he had been in the past and I suggested while I was in town if he wanted to grab some coffee which he agreed, this is the first time we’ve had proper conversation since the break up.

The coffee was okay I kept it very light on the surface conversation not to make him feel pressure of anything, after he left he gave me a hug and said it was nice to see me and see me soon, which he initiated

But because he’s an avoidant I don’t want to push him away so shall I leave him back to his space and go back into no contact and wait until he reaches out to me next? I’m not sure if we can ever rekindle the relationship but we were friends for years before hand and i still value him in my life I’d love to get back together but I also want to navigate it in a way that would help 

Any advice?

1gvwu48,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gvwu48/could_i_do_anything_better_about_the_situation/,Could I do anything better about the situation with my father?,"I've been wanting to write here for a while to get some feedback on my situation. This is a long one, tldr at the bottom.

*TW: emotional abuse, shit parents*

I'm the product of a pretty broken family, my mom slept with a coworker because he was enticing. She was 40 and divorced, single parent to a 16 and 18 year old. She and my dad lived together for some years, but he basically ruined her already precarious financial situation and left (from what I understand). I've since learned he was controlling and abusive to her. 

I didn't have the best childhood, although I didn't realize it at the time - I was the classic 90s keychain kid, always alone, my siblings hated me. I befriended cats and ate noodles. Sometimes I stayed the weekend at my dad's place. I was bullied a lot, pretty brutally, and my mom was not entirely stable, so after she once slapped me in the face I asked my dad if I could live with him.

He said yes, and I moved. My mom was heartbroken. This is where the weirder part of my story starts and the years I have trouble figuring out mentally. Because I just don't know what's normal (although I realize what I'm about to write is certainly not).

My dad was a huge intellectual and an intense loner. He had cut off all connections with family way back. He had complete focus on me and was immersed in how he expected me to see the world. One of the first things I remember him telling me is that one is only truly free if one cuts off every connection to other people. He didn't let me see other kids, as they were beneath us. He let me read any books I wanted, leading to me reading Freud's collected works at 12 and being completely lost in a world of books and fantasy. He loved doing art, and so did I. His opinions were law and he was completely convincing to me. He had the solution for questions of intimacy, sex, world politics, you name it.

He moved around a lot and worked as a special ed teacher, everyone looked up to him (probably also since he was moving schools so frequently that he was always making a first impression, in a way). He was, in retrospect, completely irresponsible with money - he would buy me loads of Pokemon cards and drawing supplies, but I never had clothes, I was always wearing his big oversized black T-shirts and he didn't want me to spend money on stuff like bras. I never saw a doctor, never went to the dentist. He never cooked, and I ended up severely overweight because he only believed in drinking Coke because ""sugar is good for the brain"". 

He would always sell our flat or house and buy a new fixer-upper. I remember one house particularly well, because the bathroom in the basement was not finished. I remember crying while puking on the concrete unfinished floor because of period pain, he didn't believe in pain killers either. That bathroom had a shower but no window installed so it was literally snowing through a hole in the wall. He took all the light bulbs out because he liked hanging out in darkness, stuff like that.

If I was hurting, pain would make me stronger. The ideal was to leave all emotions behind, to be truly stoic. That was his goal in life, and in turn, it was mine. 

When I turned 14, we moved yet again. I was in Junior High School now and started school again after being ""homeschooled"" for a little over a year. This time, I actually made friends. I started thinking about food and developed social bonds and friendships - slowly, but the effect was pretty dramatic. I lost a lot of weight, I started making real food and my dad certainly noticed the change because that's when he left.

One day, he didn't come home, and he informed me that I was grown now and that he'd send money for bills and stuff, I'd figure it out. I was stoked! He trusted me, I was very happy to just live my own life. In retrospect, I'm *amazed* this didn't lead to a spiraling into drugs or worse (I certainly dabbled in any drug I could get my hands on), but it worked out reasonably well - I went on exchange for a year (arranged it myself, had a shit experience involving abuse because I was unlucky and had no one to turn to), came home, got severely depressed and dropped out of high school in the last year. I worked at a supermarket for a while, got my HS diploma, and went on to study.

I'm 35 now, so obviously a long time has passed. Unfortunately my 20s in particular were pretty rough, with a bad relationship including some surprise serious mental illness in a partner and several instances of rape. You could say I'm not exactly the most trusting individual. Nor do I find it easy to open up or believe in emotional connections. 

Since turning 20, I'd had a slowly deteriorating relationship with my dad. I would say he has promised to visit about 20 times, changing his mind at the last minute, to the extend of not getting of the train as I stood waiting on the station. I always excused his reclusive behavior - he lived in his holiday home, a very historically interesting property that he owned ever since I was born. As a baby, I briefly lived there with him and my mother. It's the closest I have to a family home and I absolutely loved that house. 

My father, for all his weirdness, had always solemnly promised me that that house was mine - and that I would be the one to take care of it and continue all the projects. I believed him.

When I was younger, I would spend summers there in some sort of intellectual hobo dream state. As I got older, I still enjoyed visiting and planning for the future, making connections in the small local community and even starting to arrange for jobs there.

As I had grown older and more into myself, my dad seemed to have less and less interest in me. During the later years, he would directly be provoked by me having opinions or being ""better"" than him at random things. When I told him I was struggling with my PhD, he literally started a PhD of his own to show me that it really wasn't that hard. Stuff like that. 

I decided to distance myself more from him, still visiting yearly in summer and trying to help him keep up the house (which he would usually refuse). I had finally started some therapy when the point of this post occurred. My dad got ill and was admitted to hospital. Of course he had a myriad of untreated conditions and it really looked like he might die. Due to this, I both went to the house to make sure things were OK and arranged for access to his bank accounts as he wasn't in any shape to deal with computers or phones.

It's relevant to add that I was literally the only person he had any sort of contact with, he had by that point cut off everyone else. Still, he's active in the community with art and a sort of museum - he is well known and quite loved as an intelligent and trustworthy guy (yes, I know it sounds strange).

Entering the house was terrible. There was an active water leak in the kitchen, with water spraying everywhere for god knows how long. The place was *filthy,* with garbage piled over all surfaces. I thought there were instant coffee spilled everywhere, but it turned out to be rodent poo. There were blood smears everywhere, and buckets filled with non-rodent shit. He had clearly holed up in one room for heating and the couch he had slept on was full of live, very confused mice. Several things were broken in what seemed like anger and that state of the house was worse than anything I've ever seen.

We managed to stop the leak and secure the house a little. Then came the money issues. I quickly realized that my dad had credit cards and loans up to the gills - not very surprising, but what did surprise me was that it was all tied up in the house. Which means I would never be able to inherit it. 

My heritage was just shit.

My father got better and I tried to talk to him about these things. That really derailed absolutely everything. At first, he just refused to talk about it. Then he refused that it was real. Then he refused that it was a problem. Then he told me I was to ""handle it"". I started suggesting ways to secure funds to pay it down, or make arrangements to deal with it, all stone walled. After many rounds of talking he just snapped and screamed at me louder than I've ever heard, and icily told me that I was created to be used by him and it was ""his turn now"".

I cut off contact with him after that. I blocked him on Messenger and told him that I would be open to speaking to him again if he was prepared to talk calmly like adults. All the while he had my phone number and e-mail. He never tried. 

Recently, I was called by a nurse who informed me that he now had moved into the local nursing home temporarily. She hadn't seen the note about me not being his contact any longer. She confirmed he was of sound mind, using his computer and phone. After that, I was very conflicted. I sent a very similar message with the option of communication again - I never heard back.

That did give me a lot of peace of mind. He's not sitting somewhere sad and in despair about losing his daughter - he just doesn't want to have anything to do with me. Like all the other people he's cut off from his life.

But I still feel so strange. I'm going through my childhood over and over again and wondering how I could be so naive and also just feeling very shameful. Shameful that I believed in him, shameful that I protected him whenever people asked or worried. Angry that no one ever wondered about me or if I was OK. I tried to talk to my mother about this, and she told me that yes, she knew about my situation and how bad it was, and she wondered why ""no one tried to do anything?"". Mom of the year award there, Jesus. 

So why am I posting here? Well. It was nice to just get it off my chest. 

But I also find that when talking to friends I've often gotten the ""oh, but I'm sure he loves you! Every dad loves his child!"". It does feel like a cloud of darkness is hanging over me, since I started processing this stuff. It's always there in the back of my mind. 

I don't really know what to do. I guess I just wait for him to die and pick up whatever pieces are left? 

tldr; I grew up with an emotionally abusive father all the time believing that I could at least continue ""our"" legacy, but surprise, he lied about it",1,1732128351.0,self,2,1.0,False

I admit that I feel a little self-conscious in talking about things I own, but that’s why I’m asking. 

It asks about contents sum insured. How should I think about a value for this?

It then talks about specified personal items. What should I consider worthy of including? I have some antique furniture. I have an expensive watch (bought for €3700). My partner has her diamond engagement ring and some diamond earrings. I have some family heirlooms (a 200 year old pocket watch my so many times great grandfather made, a collection of war medals from great grandfathers to grandfather), and a piece of fine art by a renowned English painter. What about other things - like a Canada Goose coat, a Zegna suit, Prada handbag, Prada shoes?

I have no idea of what value these have and I’m not sure if I should get them valued. I know if I put them on eBay, we’d get a few hundred to a few thousand for each mentioned thing. 

And, depending on your answers, how often do I need to update the insurance? Like, if I buy a Rolex or we get a premium €3000 coffee table (don’t shoot me until you’ve seen Iain James furniture), do we update the insurance with these new items? If we don’t why not?

Due to Thanksgiving being on a Thursday, many of these sales extend from today (Weds, Nov 20) to next Thursday night (Thurs, Nov 28) and will update next Friday. And due to the fact that I will be cooking and feasting heartily, the list may be delayed until somewhat late Friday afternoon. Because of feasting. Thank you for your understanding.

I work hard during the week sometimes pushing 55+ hours. I’ve also started attending the gym again to support my partners weight loss goals. In other words I’m one hungry dude in the morning. 

 A few times per week I treat myself to fast food breakfast. For $14 some bucks I can sit in peace eating my wonderful breakfast of toasted wraps, hash brown tacos and a side of Queso. Washing it down with an ice cold coffee. 

Yesterday I say good morning to Cathy. As I’m about to place my order I’m interrupted by an apology…. What came next struck me with utter dread. 

How could they have taken my beloved toasted wraps and cheese tacos. The pricing was phenomenal as well. I’m a pretty big dude and my profession can be physically draining. Eating out is generally pretty expensive. As if I don’t eat a large amount of calories I will lose weight to the point of turning into a skeleton. 

I’m not even sure what to do with my mornings at this point, local breakfast spots don’t hit my feel good spot the same way. Taco Bell is certainly not the answer. Has anybody else been as derailed as I? ",9,1732127696.0,DelTaco,1,1.0,False

Uses up half the water tank in the process requiring constant filling because the tank is so small.  The other issue is if you have the drip tray out, and you walk to go answer the doorbell, and the machine decides to shutdown and rinses on your ass, it dumps water and coffee grounds all over the counter which then run down the cabinets into drawers and onto the floor.

-start timer and add 100g of water, stir back and forth (not circular) 3-4 times *gently* just to ensure all the grinds are saturated (don’t over-agitate).

-leaving the plunger out, let bloom until 1:00 minute. Yes, some of the coffee will slowly drip through like a pour-over for this step. This is intentional. 

-at 1:00 add the remaining 185g of water, stir again *gently* 2-3 times back and forth (again, don’t stir aggressively, just very gently), then add the plunger back to slow the drip-through. 

-at 2:10 gently swirl the Aeropress for a few seconds to break the crust down. 

-at 2:30 start pressing the plunger for a 30-40 second press. 

-total brew time should be 3:00 or 3:15.

Shorthened questionnaire here.,"**Te - Efficiency, feasibility, facts, performance, use of knowledge, improvement, functionality, measurable success**

These are highly important concept for me, as I highly value the quality and efficiency of my decisions, work, and purchases. I am quite into self-improvement and I enjoy when I am able to get a lot done. However, that isn't really my constant state and I can find it pretty difficult to get started in work, or I have a tendency to worry a lot about unimportant things. Success measurement can depend on a lot of factors and no one single factor can define success as a whole. But at the same time, I react emotionally when I see someone better than me at a particular task and start feeling like a loser.

**Ti - Logical consistency, hiearachy, classifications, full understanding, structure, meaning of knowledge, order, framework**

I strive for full understanding of concepts and ideas to make everything fit together. I can be highly precise when it comes to terminology, language, and classifications as I highly value accuracy and logical consistency. I often take a long time to make decisions because I need to make the best decision possible. While I am not the most organized or structured in my lifestyle, my thoughts can have such a structure to make things easier to understand both for myself and others.

**Se - Action, decisiveness, competition, confrontation, immediacy, intensity-seeking, reality as-it-is, volition**

To be honest, I am pretty bad at these. I am quite fearful of failure in competitions and while I can enjoy a level of thrill-seeking, I am not the kind to be confident about such things. I tend to be very indecisive and get stuck between various good options or I just worry about useless stuff. Additionally, I am quite unsure about myself and what to really pursue so I only have a vague idea of my future. I don't really like confrontation and I prefer working independently or have a more supportive and collaborative style of leadership instead of bossing around others unless I REALLY need to.

**Si - Physical comfort, sensory details, harmony, enjoying the moment, aesthetics, habits, pleasure, design**

This is another area of mine where I really value in myself, but often fail to achieve. I highly favor feeling safe and sound, and I can even enjoy my creature comforts and repeatedly listen to the same music or watch the same YouTube video. But at the same time, I often feel tense and nervous and my mind is never fully at the present moment. I try to enjoy the moment a much as possible but I enther get distracted or I feel anxious about what could happen or what I am going to do next. I also have a good sense of aesthetics in my environment, just another thing to say.

**Fe - Emotional atmosphere, expression of feelings, passion, authenticity, enthusiasm, excitement, demeanor, moods**

I try to be as honest and authentic about my experiences and explanations, but I may try to hide my deeper feelings in the name of getting along with other and avoiding conflict. While I can be pretty aware of the general emotional atmosphere and even understand other people's feelings, I often struggle with determing whether I have made the right expression or not, and this can make me somewhat socially anxious. I often try to make jokes or funny remarks in order to make myself more interesting but deep down, I just feel emotionally volatile and negative, and I often take life too seriously myself.

**Fi - Personal relations, goodness of character, likes and dislikes, morality, intimacy, subjective judgments, distance of relationship, attitudes**

I care a lot about being a good person to the point that I often fear being actually evil or faking good. While morality is an important thing to me and it is also because of the future consequences I imagine, my likes and dislikes often change over time and they are actually quite flexible. One time, I may like espresso, but then I will like cold brew. I also have relatively adaptable opinions about many things such as my operating system preference and my signature outfit. As for relationships, they seem to be all over the place. I guess I care a lot about being a good person and that's about it. Additionally, I tend to ruminate on my past actions to see if my life was ruined by a horrible mistake.

**Ne - New ideas, potentials, broad interests, loose asociations, variety-seeking, alternatives, wandering, the unusual**

I have a broad range of interests and they can be quite loosely related. I have interests such as speedcubing, medicine, technology, photography, content creation, swimming, and they are quite dynamic as I don't really try to specialize on just one area even if I really should. It takes me a long time to make decisions not only because I need to sift through all the possible options to find the BEST one, but also my tendency to worry about all sorts of possible dangers, whether directly in the future or as a result of a horrible past mistake. The ideas I generate and the connections I find can really help me to study more effectively or it can be an interesting practice as I gather inspiration from an experience. But eventually, I care about the usefulness of my ideas because I notice that I need to improve my place in the world but sometimes, that moment can be forgotten and I am back to pursuing my personal interests. BTW, my interests aren't necessarily aimless pursuits (though some can be), but rather they can be quite purposeful yet enjoyable.

**Ni - Change over time, past and future, imagination, timing, forecasting, long-term trends, cause and effect, the inevitable**

I am often really in my head and I have a tendency to worry a lot about whether things will be fine or not. I have an easy time with cause and effect relationships and that makes me easy to understand how things can change or are changing over time. I am quite prone to activating my episodic memory through some external stimulus. I am really into discovering who I really am, both as a fun practice and relating myself to objects (If I was a coffee/time period/aesthetic/etc...) but also for self-improvement and fixing my weaknesses. My mind is often in what I have experienced in the past, either something nostalgic or rumination, and thinking about future possibilities and what I will do in the future. The long-term ramifications and consequences play a big role in my decisions though I can also make present-oriented decisions if they are good enough or make sense to me. But I can have poor time management as I am not really practical and action-oriented, and I can get distracted through some interesting yet useless pursuits and focus on my interests rather than what really needs to be done.

**My strengths, where I draw my confidence from, what makes me feel better**

* Curiosity and desire to learn a wide range of things
* Awareness of my own feelings and thoughts
* Ability to work independently
* Gathering full understanding of concepts
* Moral yet flexible about what I like and dislike
* Honest and humble about myself (sometimes too humble!)
* Vividly imagining my past experiences (though it can be a weakness if they are painful)
* Making loose associations between things to reinforce understanding or make things fun

**My weaknesses, what I need to improve on, and what stresses me out**

* My poor sense of time management and scheduling
* Prone to procrastination and not really getting things done
* Very indecisive and unsure about myself
* Not very confident about what I like and dislike
* Worrying a lot about useless things or catastrophizing
* Getting stuck in my past mistakes as they can endanger my future
* I can be quite emotionally reactive and dramatize certain problems
* Can be forgetful about essential and practical details",2,1732127510.0,Socionics,9,1.0,False
1gvwhip,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1gvwhip/aitj_for_perceiving_my_brothers_actions_as_being/,AITJ FOR PERCEIVING MY BROTHER'S ACTIONS AS BEING TOXIC ENOUGH TO CUT HIM FROM MY LIFE ??,"Edited to make.paragraphs.

I know it's long but needed to give you all context.

My brother (37M), let's call him Jim, and I (38F) were raised by a single mother and things were tough. It wasn't the happiest of childhoods. We struggled financially but, now that I'm a mom, I understand that she did the best she could with what she had. Some thought that my mom and I were close back then but the reality is that I tagged along to everything I could with her just to spend time with her, whether or not I was into it. Jim wouldn't go if wasn't into it. He would later admit that he felt that our mother loved me more because she did more things with me. My mom, of course loved both of us, she was just selfish and didn't do kid friendly things and I just realized at a young age that being with her was more important than what we were doing. 

Jim and I never had a good relationship as kids. He harboured alot of anger and I got the brunt of it. He was very aggressive and abusive towards me. I would lock myself in the bathroom until my mom came home. The few times we did anything together would usually result in violence. For example, when we were in grades 6&7, I would beat him at a Nintendo game and he punched me in the face. Around the same time, we were playing outside with mini rackets and a ball and after a while I said I didn't want to play anymore and he whipped the racket and hit me in the eye resulting in a swollen, black eye and a lazy eye that I still have to this day. When we were in grades 4&5, while walking home from school, he was about 20 feet infront of me because he never wanted to walk with me, there was a group of highschool girls hanging out on a porch and once we passed them, he yelled ""B*TCHES"" in a high pitched voice to make it sound like it was me and started running. I turned to see the 6 girls running after us, so I started running too and managed to outrun them. Those girls would later in the year catch up to me multiple times to jump me and beat me. He was manipulative at a young age, getting me into trouble or get me to do his chores due to a rule my mom that if either one of our chores weren't done we were both grounded. He would also scream directly in my face or ear when he knew I had a headache to bait me. He spread rumours about me in school and I was severely bullied. Even though I was a year older than him, I was scared of him, truly. 

Jim refused to work, unlike me who had been working since I was 12 in a corn field, which is what kids in that town did. He just didn't think he should. My mom even took a week off of work to work with Jim in the corn field because he told her that he shouldn't have to do any labour cause he was a kid especially if she wasn't willing to do it herself. He didn't work past that week. 

Despite all of this, I still loved my brother and when he grew like a foot over the summer at the age of 14 and had no pants long enough to fit him, and my mom didn't have the money for a new wardrobe for him, at 16, I used my money to buy him all brand new pants. I was also paying for the internet and cable for us to use. He never kept any of my secrets and took advantage of always getting me in trouble to deflect from him.

At a new school, he met a boy, let's call him Ben, who quickly became his best friend and was over at his house alot. Ben came from a dual parent home, had a pool in the backyard, went on family trips and all the snacks a kid could want. We didn't have alot of money so my mom made everything from scratch. She didn't want us drinking pop or eating junk food so she didn't buy it. There was food in the fridge, you just had to make it or reheat it. My brother started venting to Ben's mom, let's call her Jay, about our home life. He didn't like that he had to do laundry, have chores, help cook dinner sometimes, there was nothing in the fridge and no snacks, etc. Plus my mother never did anything with him and grounded him all the time and beat him. Jay fed into this and told Jim that he was just a kid and shouldn't have all of this responsibility, which is literally what my mom was trying to teach us. She was trying to set us up for success and independance. Jim lost his wallet and my mom paid to replace his cards. After the 2nd time he lost his wallet, my mother told him that he would have to pay to replace everything because it was expensive and maybe if he paid for it, he would be less likely to lose it again. Well, Jay didn't like that. She told Jim that if things were so bad at home that he could come live with her. It's also important to mention that Ben was not a good kid before he met my brother. He stopped getting into trouble and brought his grades up after they met and even treated his parents better because Jim was polite and ""a joy to be around"". But no one gave credit where credit was due, cause who raised him? So that's what Jim did, he left our home and moved in with his new family at the age of 15. He cut all contact with our mom at this point and never had anything nice to say about her to anyone. He now called Jay mom and her husband dad. He has a brother a new older sister. He would ask me to sneak him his things from the house which I did until I got caught by my mom. After that there was no contact between my brother and I because I told him I didn't want to be put in the middle and if he wanted his things, he needed to go get it, so he cut me out. 

I graduated highschool and went to the same college as my brother. We would run into each other and I would try to befriend him and although I tagged along to a few lunches with him and his friends, he made me feel like I was unwelcomed. I was probably a reminder of his childhood and what he left behind. I chose to keep my distance at that point. 

Fast forward about 6 years with no real contact, he was getting married. He sent me and my mom an invite out of obligation but we were not part of the wedding at all. The stag and doe was a shit show for me. Despite my many attempts at contacting Jim's new parents to see what I could do to help, it was clear they wanted me to take no part in any of it. I still showed up early and helped anywhere I could. That was when I met Jim's fiance, let's call her Tif. She welcomed me with open arms and was super sweet. I caught Jay talking so much shit about me and my mom to various people at the stag and doe. I hid behind the fridge in the kitchen when I went in to refill one of the dishes and realized that Jay was telling her family member all these nasty things about my mom and I. I cried quite a bit behind that fridge. I never brought it to Jim's attention because I just knew that he would take their side and I would lose him for good. I did write a lovely letter to Tiff thanking her for loving my brother and giving him a safe space to be himself. 

I was not in a good place and just started therapy with alot of abandonment trauma and my therapist encouraged me to reach out to him and share my feelings, to which I did. Unfortunately I cried alot on the phone and told him that he was my only brother and it hurt me that we had no relationship and I felt like just a guest at his wedding. So he asked me to say a speech. 

By now, his ""new family"" was who he introduced everyone to and alot of people were surprised to know that he even had a biological sister, so I wrote the shit outta that speech and delivered it with class and just reminded him and everyone in that room of how much love I had for him. Afterwards I wept in the bathroom for a good long while. This changed our relationship a little that we started to reach out to each other a bit more. 

When they were pregnant with their first child, I worked from home at the time and offered to come live with them to help. They agreed and I moved 6 hours to live them. The first 3 days, I walked on eggshells. Then I told him that I felt like if we were going to live together comfortably we should really have a conversation about everything and explain each other's sides of everything. We had that conversation with Tif present and it felt like a very healing conversation and we had an incredible relationship from that moment on. I feel I have to mention that all this time, I didn't have a relationship with Jim, so I didn't know who he was really as an adult. When I moved in, I felt like I became super close to both Jim and Tif at the same time and got to know who they were at that time. I can honestly say that I was just as close to Tif as I was to Jim and in some ways closer to Tif. We had so many suppers together where we told each other how grateful we were to be in each other's lives and how much better I've made their lives since reconnecting. 

I stayed there for 4 months until their daughter was born. I was in the hospital with them and they even made me godmother. They told me that Jim's ""parents"" were coming for 2 weeks once the baby was born and while they were in hospital, I went back to the house and got their room ready, cleaned the whole house and changed all the sheets for them to come home to a clean house. The day we came home, his ""parents"" were there and that's when Jim told me that I had to leave that day for those 2 weeks as it would be too awkward for them. I was in shock but wanted to respect their wishes and be the bigger person, so I left and cried the entire drive home. At the end of the 2 weeks, I returned and stayed for 2 months. I made the drive to visit every month and we spoke often in between. I really felt like I finally had a healthy relationship with my brother and sister in law. 

After their second was born their relationship started to deteriorate and they ended up separating, with Tif accusing Jim of physically assaulting her. It was very hard to believe but how do you tell someone that claims to have been abused that they weren't when I wasn't there. This is where things started to shift. I was getting calls from both of them telling me their sides and I listened. Both had to come through my town on seperate occasions and stayed with me. Jim started to feel like I had no loyalty to him because, being his sister, I should have just taken his side automatically. Despite that, Jim kept the house and begged me to come move in with him. With nothing keeping me in my town, I moved in with my brother.  Plus I knew that we lived well together so we could do it again. 

Jim and Tif shared custody and had each their kids for a week a time. We hashed out details before I made the decision to move like rent and expectations with the kids. He said he would charge me $700 for rent plus half groceries which I thought was pretty steep but he said that he would help me find a job and eventually help me start my food truck. He said that he just expected me to be an aunt and love his kids. So I agreed and moved up here. 

What I didn't know was that the girl that Jim cheated on Tif with, Kay, was living with him and when I agreed to move up, he kicked her out. All of her things were still all over the house and 2 days after I moved in, she came over to pack her stuff. I helped her and apologized to her and tried to just be there for her as support while she cried the entire time she was packing her things. Of course Jim refused to be in the house while she was there to not have to face her like a coward. I started to see him differently now. Kay and I would end up really good friends.

 I had alot of my own things, some of which went into the house and the rest was stored in Tif's basement as per Jim's suggestion. I still had a good relationship with Tif and just tried to stay neutral. I quickly got a job at a local restaurant which meant I worked alot of nights. I ended up making lunches for me and my brother and would meal prep for us alot as I have a culinary background and genuinely love to cook. He started coming home for lunch everyday and sometimes brought a friend. 

He was offered a job teaching part time at the college which his job would accomodate but that meant he had to start going into work earlier. I agreed to help get the kids up and on the bus on his weeks so he could fulfill this dream of his. Afterall, we were together to support each other. This quickly turned into my cleaning the house, doing the groceries, making all the meals, getting up with his kids everyday they were there, even on days he didn't go into work early, snow blowing the driveway when the snow started, all while still paying $700/month and half the groceries. I have to mention that Jim ended up going to a food specialist and found out that there were a number of foods that irritated his bowels and asked me if I could adjust some of the things I would make him to help his digestion, which meant a whole new set of groceries for just him that I still had to pay half of. It was starting to get to me. 

During this time, he was venting about Tif and the courts and how diffuct she was making his life. He told me she had said some not so nice things about me and when her tone with me felt different, it made me feel like what he was telling me was true. He also was going through a bit of a slut phase where he was still stringing on Kay bringing her to our cousin's wedding 8 hours away. While also meeting other girls online and not coming home on the nights he had his kids, leaving me to care for them on my only nights off of work. 

He even had potlucks with friends at the house on nights I was scheduled to work but asked me if I could make a dish for him. I would come home from work at 2am and all the food would still be out on the counter and a huge mess. As someone who grew up poor, I can't let food go to waste so I would package and refrigerate the food and clean up a bit before going to bed, only to have to get up early with his kids because he would lock his bedroom door so his kids would end up crawling into bed with me because daddy wouldn't open the door. 

I was starting to feel lonely myself because I was in a new town, with no real friends, alone alot of the time and raising my niece and nephew. I decided to join a dating site and met my now spouse, let's call him Bill, just before Christmas 2019. My mom and her boyfriend came up for Christmas and I made a healthy breakfast for us knowing how heavy the food was going to be for the next few days. A breakfast that Jim asked for regularly and loved. My mom is not a very healthy person but Jim, his new girlfriend, Bill and I are. My mom started making fun of the breakfast asking where the bacon and eggs and sausage were, so naturally Jim's old nature kicked in and just started making fun of the breakfast to help gang up on me, this just gave a flashback of my childhood and how he used to be. 

I did make a huge Christmas Eve dinner for us with all the fixings. It was nice. It was the first time we were all together for Christmas since 2002. I remember crying and saying how thankful I was that we could all be together. Everyone wanted to go to bed early, like 8pm and I decided to go to Bill's mom's house for their big Christmas dinner with extended family.  It didn't actually even start until after I got there around 9pm. Jim and my mom asked if I would be home for breakfast and I said yes, I wasn't going to spend the night. So despite getting home late, I still got up early and made breakfast for everyone; one that no one would complain about. We spent the day together and I went back to Bill's mom's house for their more intimate Christmas dinner with just his sisters and nieces and nephews. That night I ended up spending the night there and was bombarded with messages the next morning about where I was and where was breakfast, to which I said he could take care of 1 breakfast. He was not happy. After that day he was cold towards me. 

My cousin came for a visit between Christmas and New year's and stayed for new years. In that time, Jim decided to have all his friends and his ""mother"" Jay over for a potluck to get it all out of the way at the same time, but Jay explicitly asked Jim that I not be there because I make them uncomfortable, so he hosted this night again on a night I was working but asked me to make a dish. My cousin was like ""so you're making a dish for a Christmas party that you're not even going to be here for? That's f*cked up"". I was just glad that someone saw it. 

New year's Eve was a busy day. Tif wanted to be with the kids but it was Jim's day so he said no to keep them from her. I started noticing how manipulative he was and great at gaslighting. He worked a half day so I was with the kids and my cousin until he came home. Bill left his wallet in his locker at work after a night shift and realized when he woke up, but he worked an hour and 45 minutes away from us. He got someone to drive it half way and asked if I would come for the drive, to which I agreed, we needed things from the nearest Costco which was in the town Bill was meeting the coworker. Jim  was hosting a new years party at the house and asked if I could pick some stuff up from Costco. 

By the time I got home it was 8:30pm and Jim had already put the kids to bed, so he didn't want to ring in the new year with them but didn't want Tif to have them. I wanted to shower and get ready for the party. At 9:30pm Jim came to my room really upset saying that people were here and I was I still getting ready. Like wtf, dude. I live here. The party is at my dwelling. Who cares what time I come upstairs? We ended up having a fun night as a group and just before 2am Bill and I decided to head to bed. Jim then asked ""are you getting up with the kids or am I?"". I told him that they were his kids and his choice to keep them and put them to bed early so he could get up with them and he tried to guilt trip me in front of his girlfriend, Bill and my cousin. Bill just grabbed my hand and led me to my room. 

At 5am I heard Jim's daughter go upstairs and knock on his door and ask if she could sleep with him. She was 4 at the time, and he didn't answer the door as usual so she tried to climb into bed with her brother (2yrs) who woke up crying and wanting daddy, so I heard them both go upstairs and try daddy again and he didnt respond. Door was locked. Those babies came downstairs, crying and asked to sleep with me, but Bill was in my bed so I took them to Jim's room and knocked hard on the door telling him his kids wanted him and he yelled that he was busy and that I should take care of it. To avoid a fight in front of them and my cousin who was awake on the couch and witness to this, I went into their room and cuddled them in their bed. When I thought they were asleep I went back to bed, but my niece followed me crying so I pushed Bill against the wall, gave him my back and put my niece in bed with me. 

My brother only spoke to me over text for 3 days while trying to tell me he sees a change in my behaviour since meeting Bill... I decided to make dinner for us as a white flag and have a chat. I told him that I was applying for a job that would change my hours drastically and wouldn't be here for all mornings with the kids and asked him if he would be willing to wake up with his kids more during the week. His response was ""so don't spend time with my kids"". As if they are my kids to negotiate. Don't get me wrong, I love my niece and nephew and would do anything for them, but it's not my responsibility to raise his kids. Although he did say that I knew what I ""signed up for"". I told him that I wanted more free time to spend with Bill, which is my right. To which he responded ""tell him to enjoy my lunches"". He also scolded me for putting his daughter in bed with me and my new boyfriend whom no one knew very well at the time. I got really upset and told him that he should have answered the door and parent his kids. That I was happy to help but they are not my kids and not my responsibility and moved up here to make both of our lives better, but he was taking advantage of me. He continued to try and gaslight me. We went around in circles until we had to leave for our volleyball game. I thought we would continue the conversation after the game but he arranged to have his girlfriend come over right after the game to avoid a conversation at all. 

Everyday for 2 weeks, he had invited people over to the house or just didn't come home, to avoid any conversation which forced me to write him a long message over WhatsApp. In that message I gave him my 2 months notice and in many words, as you can imagine, how he made me feel and how disappointed I was. He didn't respond to the message, as expected. 

The next day I got a call from Tif to say that she can't get ahold of Jim but the daycare called and my nephew was sick but she couldn't leave work, so I agreed to go get him. Jim was in his room the whole time and refused to come out. The next day I agreed to watch both kids at Tif's place while she went to work because now they were both sick. I sent Jim a message to see what he had planned for his son's birthday as it's in January and his response was to ""ask my best friend, Tif"". I reminded him that I was there watching his kids that he refused to take care of despite being home. His response was that I needed to be out of his house ASAP and to forget the 2 months notice. He was changing the code to the locks and I needed to find my own place. I literally had the clothes on my back. I tried to go back to the house but he had locked me out for real. I didn't know what to do. I uprooted my life to move here. I had no real friends, no other family, he alienated me from Tif, and I just met my boyfriend like 4 weeks prior and now I was locked out of my home without any of my things or my cat. 

I had no choice but to go to the police station to find out what my rights were and they placed a courtesy call to say that he can't keep my things from me. So he had to try and control when I was able to move my stuff out of his house and very vocal with his expectations in the most condescending way. Luckily Tif was super understanding and let me and my cat live with her despite everything. I had to show up with a police escort the first time to start collecting my things but I had a couch and bed and needed more than 1 trip plus I needed help, so they reminded him to give me the new code to have access and he reluctantly agreed. Bill and I tried to take my things in 2 trips but a third was going to be needed. I did those 2 trips while he was at work but on the second trip, we were having difficulties with strapping the couch in the truck and Jim came home early. He got right in my face and was screaming and caused a huge scene in front of the neighbours and his kids. Bill just pulled me away and we drove to the nearest parking lot where we finished strapping the couch. I then received a predictable message from him about his ""rules"", the damage I left and the money I owe him for rent and damages but that I was no longer welcome on his property. Blah blah blah At this point I'm not taking any of his shit and know my rights and standing up for myself. I managed to get  his garage key from Kay who still had a copy and went and picked up the last of my stuff. Of course he had an officer give me a courtesy call and asked how I gained access. I moved in with Tif and thankfully I did, because covid happened in March and he would have been a nightmare to be stuck with. 

Around that time I also found out that I was pregnant. Shortly after covid, he told Tif that he was done being a dad. He gave up and was not picking them up and this was the only way to get rid of her. So I sent him a big long message about how huge of a mistake he's making. That despite how mad I was at him, I was still going to advocate for those babies. He was not breaking the cycle but continuing it just like our father. I also messaged a good friend of Jim 's, pleading him to reach out to my brother and help him realize that he needs to be in his kids' lives and they need him. He didn't see his kids for over a month and then wanted them back. He finally chose to get counseling and seek help. He tried to rebuild his relationship with our mom and I realized that he was in severe depression and showed all the signs of suicide, so after not seeing or speaking with him for 4 months, I just showed up and hugged him. Reminded him that I was still here. When I had my daughter, I brought her to meet him and after that we were civil but never having talked things through. I was always the one that initiated any contact with him or get together. 

Tif moved on and had a third baby with her new boyfriend, let's call him H. Although H had a substance problem, we were really close, the 3 of us. Spent alot of time together, laughed alot and they even came to me to mediate alot of their fights or arguments, so when I witnessed H neglecting his parental duties because of an ongoing argument he and Tif had been having, I said something to him not knowing that he was under the influence and it resulted in him having a one sided full blown screaming match with me with all the kids present, including my daughter. I left and Tif and I got into a heated argument after that so we kind of drifted apart after that. Tif and H stayed together so our relationship was never the same and I no longer felt safe with my children in his presence. So when Jim tried to get us all together for Christmas, I told him I did not feel comfortable being there with them because there was no attempt on his part to reconcile and make me feel safe. Of course Jim complied and wanted all the details. I'm thinking they were getting along, otherwise why would he have her and H over for Christmas? I, of course, just told him that we had a falling out and there was no attempt to reconcile on their end and Jim took that and added his details to try and use against Tif in court, which created more of a riff between Tif and I because she thought I had run to Jim at the first site of trouble between me and her. 

The following year Bill and I got pregnant again to which we told the family, including my brother and then we lost the baby at 9 weeks and Jim never once reached out to check on me. We found out we were pregnant again 3 months later and this time with twins. Despite everything, I still reached out to my brother to try and make plans to get together with our kids to go Christmas tree shopping and I was going to tell him about our pregnancy in person. I also suggested that we get together for Christmas and go get santa pictures at the mall together with all the kids. Despite him saying yes and my trying to finalize plans closer to the Christmas tree outing, he ghosted me and ditched me and my family to play music with a friend at a local coffee shop. I only know this because I ran into my niece and Jim's girlfriend at the mall the day we were supposed to be together and she innocently told me that daddy was playing music with a friend. After that, I still tried to finalize plans for Christmas to which he said he had people over and would get back to me and then never did. 

A person can only take so much rejection and it seemed pretty evident that he was content without me and my family in his life. So I said I would not make any effort for him ever again. I was tired of being the one to always make the effort just to be dismissed and made to feel unimportant. He had not even made any effort to fix what he had initially broken when he ""kicked me out of his house"". But accused me of not being loyal and it was my fault that we did not have unconditional sibling love. 

Near the end of my pregnancy, Tif reached out to me to apologize and let me know that she and H were no longer together and she wanted to work on our relationship which I was very open to. I missed her. She even came to my house a few times near the end of my pregnancy to help me with household chores as I was bedridden for the last month of my pregnancy. 

I had my twins in June 2023 and despite what I told myself, I still messaged him to let him know I had the twins. I shared their names and a picture and he congratulated me but that was it. No attempt or desire to want to meet them. 

I had pretty bad post partum depression after the twins. When the twins were about 3 months old, we found out that one of our best friends, who is a local country music artist, was performing locally, Bill got a sitter for us and tickets to the event which happened to be an event hosted and organized by Jim to help raise money for colon cancer. We actually had backstage passes for our friends performance so I knew there was a chance I was going to see my brother but I was there to support my friend. Also with 3 month old twins and a 3 year old toddler, it was easier to get a sitter to come after we put everyone to bed as the twins were sleeping through the night and trying to feed and put them to bed was overwhelming for just me, let alone someone who doesn't see them on a regular. So we made it just in time for our friend's performance and missed all the previous performance, which apparently Jim was one of. But hey, we got there and we got out and I got to dance and listen to the music I love, backstage at my best friend's concert with his girlfriend and all of our friends and it lifted my spirits. 

Tif happened to be at a wedding that night with a friend and when she found out we were going to the concert, she decided to leave the wedding and come to the concert. Now, she and I do not discuss my brother, our friendship has surpassed all the drama they've had and obviously I don't talk to my brother so I had no idea that they weren't in a good place. Last I heard she was going to his house for Christmas dinner. How would I know that they were on a downward spiral of their rollercoaster of a relationship?? Our friend's girlfriend gave security the ok for Tif to be backstage with us. What I didn't expect was how drunk Tif was. She definitely made her presence known and Jim's girlfriend asked her to leave because she did not have backstage passes. I knew that this was a move on my brother's part but wouldn't face her himself so he sent his girlfriend to do his dirty work. Once she left, Jim walked right up to me, inches from my face during my friend's performance and asked if I let Tif backstage. I told him that I didn't have the power to do that but the performer's girlfriend gave security the ok. He then proceeded to scream at me demanding I explain why that would be a good idea to have her back here. I tried to tell him that we don't talk and I didn't know they weren't in a good place. He then proceeded to kick me and Bill out of backstage and threatened to call security on us if we didn't leave. I tried to plead with him and tell him not to do this that I came to support my friend and haven't been out since my twins were born and he asked me if I made it early enough to watch his performance. All my friends are witnessing this while our friend is performing. He then throws in ""and you're keeping my niece and nephews from me. Get out from my event or I will get security to escort you out"". I realized that Bill had already left to avoid a physical fight cause he was sick of my brother treating me and talking to me the way that he has been. So I left and went to find him. I was shaking and fuming to say the least. I then got a text from our friend's girlfriend asking where we went and I told her he kicked us out. She told us to come back and he had no right. Our friend is the main artist and he wants us back there so to come back. She went to Jim and scolded him for kicking us out and that he had no right to do so. It may be his event, but our friend was the main talent and has the right to have whoever he wants back there. Jim proceeded to tell her that he loves me to death but can't have his ex backstage. So Bill and I returned back stage and enjoyed the rest of the show, or tried to anyway. Once the show was over, we were able to go backstage and attend the after party which Jim was there for but we didn't say a word to each other. Bill and I hung out with our friends backstage and then we left. 

Our friends walked us to our car and I got emotional about the whole ordeal and apologized for the drama that seems to follow Jim and I, but they were super supportive and kept saying ""we saw his true colours tonight and you did nothing wrong."" It still made me so sad that after everything I've done for him, he continues to treat me like gum on the bottom of his shoe. Maybe it was all the emotions running through me or maybe I was justified but I was sick of being abused by him and realized how toxic he is to my life and the audacity of him trying to use my children to play the victim. So I sent him a message about how he hurt me for the last time and told him he was dead to meet unless he took ownership of what he's done and apologized and then blocked him. 

Now I have some family members who say that family should stick together and stupid shit should be pushed aside to be able to come together because we're family, but I don't think this is stupid shit. You don't get to shit on people, family or not, just because you know they will always be there. I feel like any of these things individually would not be a big deal but accumulated and repeated behaviour shouldn't be ignored. I feel like at some point, I would just keep putting myself in positions to get hurt and then expose my children to toxic sibling behaviour when all I want for them is to love and respect each other. Siblings fight, I get that, but I believe this is different and accountability and effort must come from both sides. That is the lesson I want to teach my children and luckily through Bill's family, they will be exposed to healthy sibling relationships.

They said I did the correct thing, and that there wasn’t any liquid inside the machine itself but just underneath the keyboard, trackpad, and inside the ports on the right side. When I brought it home, I noticed that the F12 and +/= keys were brighter than the rest and that some other keys on the right side are much dimmer. The keys that were affected by the spillage (including the space) also felt stiff and sounded kind of crunchy at first but that went away after I pressed them repeatedly. It also still smelled a bit like coffee at first but that’s probably understandable and I’m just being paranoid lol
Is that just the result of coffee damage or could this be the repair shop’s fault? And what can be done to fix the issue? I’ve contacted the shop and they suggested I bring the Mac back to them for inspection. ",0,1732127459.0,mac,1,0.5,False
1gvwguf,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1gvwguf/can_anyone_help_me_identify_this_disgusting/,Can anyone help me identify this disgusting flavor I keep experiencing from restaurants?,"I try to support local and independent businesses as much as I can, so if I eat out, I only get food from independent restaurants.

But I've notice a ""flavor"", that I can't quite describe, which used to only be when I'd get some pastries that were probably close to (likely past) the expiration date. I'm now noticing it in cooked food too.

**The way I'd best describe this taste is like the smell of an old stale basement, and you're licking the floor. It has notes of cleaning products and an aftertaste of dust.**

I first tasted this from a frozen yogurt shop, I thought maybe it was from the plastic cups being in an old dusty storage area.

I got xmas cookies from a very well known and long standing bakery last year, and they all had a very strong taste of this, as well as being stale. They were inedible and at the party we just decided to throw them all out.

I've been buying discounted food from toogoodtogo and on a couple of the bakery / coffee shop deals, there was a feint taste of this. Which would make sense that I'm buying food that's discounted for being too old to sell, but is infuriating when I'm paying full price for something just to throw it away.

**This made me think that it could be from something stale in the cooler making it's way into the taste while the items become stale.**

But then I got a sandwich, and ate half of it before I noticed that same flavor, and then the more I'd eat it, the more I'd notice it, and I just couldn't finish it.

And then comes today, where I just got a huge burrito, and ate some of it, then started tasting that disgusting flavor again, and just decided to throw it out, but on my way to the trash can, I started violently throwing up, and wouldn't stop until all of it was out of my stomach.

Is this a result of some health code violation? I know the health code budget has been cut due to Eric Adams, so restaurants might be cutting costs by selling food that should already have been thrown out? Or because they're not maintaining proper sanitation?

Is this a contamination of some cleaning product into the food preparation areas, and now I'm tasting it?

So my wife met this guy through work a long time ago and he has been a mentor figure to her throughout her career. They used to hang out regularly along with a group of friends, but recently they’ve been seeing each other about once every one or two weeks for lunch, coffee or drinks. I understand why she wants to maintain this friendship since he’s been a really big help to her over the years. She says it’s purely platonic and she has no feelings for him whatsoever, and I believe her, but I’m not so sure that I trust his intentions, as I don’t know him very well and he’s been fairly dismissive in the few interactions we’ve had. He also calls her somewhat regularly out of the blue just to catch up, not even for anything work related since they don’t work together anymore. They usually talk for about an hour or so.

I don’t particularly like them seeing each other alone as often as they have been. I don’t like that my wife is regularly out with a man who most people would assume is her S.O in that circumstance. I’ve brought it up to her and she understands where I’m coming from but doesn’t seem to have any intentions of doing anything different, and I end up feeling bad because it sounds like I’m asking her to give up a long term friendship that’s important to her. I’m quite sure if the roles were reversed and I was in his shoes (seeing a younger woman regularly 1on1 who looks up to me in some capacity) that she would have a problem with it. This really bothers me. 

Am I being overprotective or are my feelings warranted here? I don’t want to force her to not have certain friends, but I also feel disrespected and unheard in this particular circumstance.",4,1732127411.0,relationship_advice,50,0.64,False

1gvwfnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodService/comments/1gvwfnv/can_anyone_help_me_identify_this_disgusting/,Can anyone help me identify this disgusting flavor I keep experiencing from restaurants?,"I try to support local and independent businesses as much as I can, so if I eat out, I only get food from independent restaurants.

But I've notice a ""flavor"", that I can't quite describe, which used to only be when I'd get some pastries that were probably close to (likely past) the expiration date. I'm now noticing it in cooked food too.

**The way I'd best describe this taste is like the smell of an old stale basement, and you're licking the floor. It has notes of cleaning products and an aftertaste of dust.**

I first tasted this from a frozen yogurt shop, I thought maybe it was from the plastic cups being in an old dusty storage area.

I got xmas cookies from a very well known and long standing bakery last year, and they all had a very strong taste of this, as well as being stale. They were inedible and at the party we just decided to throw them all out.

I've been buying discounted food from toogoodtogo and on a couple of the bakery / coffee shop deals, there was a feint taste of this. Which would make sense that I'm buying food that's discounted for being too old to sell, but is infuriating when I'm paying full price for something just to throw it away.

**This made me think that it could be from something stale in the cooler making it's way into the taste while the items become stale.**

But then I got a sandwich, and ate half of it before I noticed that same flavor, and then the more I'd eat it, the more I'd notice it, and I just couldn't finish it.

And then comes today, where I just got a huge burrito, and ate some of it, then started tasting that disgusting flavor again, and just decided to throw it out, but on my way to the trash can, I started violently throwing up, and wouldn't stop until all of it was out of my stomach.



Is this a result of some health code violation? I know the health code budget has been cut due to Eric Adams, so restaurants might be cutting costs by selling food that should already have been thrown out? Or because they're not maintaining proper sanitation?

Is this a contamination of some cleaning product into the food preparation areas, and now I'm tasting it?

I know it's long but needed to give you all context.

My brother (37M), let's call him Jim, and I (38F) were raised by a single mother and things were tough. It wasn't the happiest of childhoods. We struggled financially but, now that I'm a mom, I understand that she did the best she could with what she had. Some thought that my mom and I were close back then but the reality is that I tagged along to everything I could with her just to spend time with her, whether or not I was into it. Jim wouldn't go if wasn't into it. He would later admit that he felt that our mother loved me more because she did more things with me. My mom, of course loved both of us, she was just selfish and didn't do kid friendly things and I just realized at a young age that being with her was more important than what we were doing. 

Jim and I never had a good relationship as kids. He harboured alot of anger and I got the brunt of it. He was very aggressive and abusive towards me. I would lock myself in the bathroom until my mom came home. The few times we did anything together would usually result in violence. For example, when we were in grades 6&7, I would beat him at a Nintendo game and he punched me in the face. Around the same time, we were playing outside with mini rackets and a ball and after a while I said I didn't want to play anymore and he whipped the racket and hit me in the eye resulting in a swollen, black eye and a lazy eye that I still have to this day. When we were in grades 4&5, while walking home from school, he was about 20 feet infront of me because he never wanted to walk with me, there was a group of highschool girls hanging out on a porch and once we passed them, he yelled ""B*TCHES"" in a high pitched voice to make it sound like it was me and started running. I turned to see the 6 girls running after us, so I started running too and managed to outrun them. Those girls would later in the year catch up to me multiple times to jump me and beat me. He was manipulative at a young age, getting me into trouble or get me to do his chores due to a rule my mom that if either one of our chores weren't done we were both grounded. He would also scream directly in my face or ear when he knew I had a headache to bait me. He spread rumours about me in school and I was severely bullied. Even though I was a year older than him, I was scared of him, truly. 

Jim refused to work, unlike me who had been working since I was 12 in a corn field, which is what kids in that town did. He just didn't think he should. My mom even took a week off of work to work with Jim in the corn field because he told her that he shouldn't have to do any labour cause he was a kid especially if she wasn't willing to do it herself. He didn't work past that week. 

Despite all of this, I still loved my brother and when he grew like a foot over the summer at the age of 14 and had no pants long enough to fit him, and my mom didn't have the money for a new wardrobe for him, at 16, I used my money to buy him all brand new pants. I was also paying for the internet and cable for us to use. He never kept any of my secrets and took advantage of always getting me in trouble to deflect from him.

At a new school, he met a boy, let's call him Ben, who quickly became his best friend and was over at his house alot. Ben came from a dual parent home, had a pool in the backyard, went on family trips and all the snacks a kid could want. We didn't have alot of money so my mom made everything from scratch. She didn't want us drinking pop or eating junk food so she didn't buy it. There was food in the fridge, you just had to make it or reheat it. My brother started venting to Ben's mom, let's call her Jay, about our home life. He didn't like that he had to do laundry, have chores, help cook dinner sometimes, there was nothing in the fridge and no snacks, etc. Plus my mother never did anything with him and grounded him all the time and beat him. Jay fed into this and told Jim that he was just a kid and shouldn't have all of this responsibility, which is literally what my mom was trying to teach us. She was trying to set us up for success and independance. Jim lost his wallet and my mom paid to replace his cards. After the 2nd time he lost his wallet, my mother told him that he would have to pay to replace everything because it was expensive and maybe if he paid for it, he would be less likely to lose it again. Well, Jay didn't like that. She told Jim that if things were so bad at home that he could come live with her. It's also important to mention that Ben was not a good kid before he met my brother. He stopped getting into trouble and brought his grades up after they met and even treated his parents better because Jim was polite and ""a joy to be around"". But no one gave credit where credit was due, cause who raised him? So that's what Jim did, he left our home and moved in with his new family at the age of 15. He cut all contact with our mom at this point and never had anything nice to say about her to anyone. He now called Jay mom and her husband dad. He has a brother a new older sister. He would ask me to sneak him his things from the house which I did until I got caught by my mom. After that there was no contact between my brother and I because I told him I didn't want to be put in the middle and if he wanted his things, he needed to go get it, so he cut me out. 

I graduated highschool and went to the same college as my brother. We would run into each other and I would try to befriend him and although I tagged along to a few lunches with him and his friends, he made me feel like I was unwelcomed. I was probably a reminder of his childhood and what he left behind. I chose to keep my distance at that point. 

Fast forward about 6 years with no real contact, he was getting married. He sent me and my mom an invite out of obligation but we were not part of the wedding at all. The stag and doe was a shit show for me. Despite my many attempts at contacting Jim's new parents to see what I could do to help, it was clear they wanted me to take no part in any of it. I still showed up early and helped anywhere I could. That was when I met Jim's fiance, let's call her Tif. She welcomed me with open arms and was super sweet. I caught Jay talking so much shit about me and my mom to various people at the stag and doe. I hid behind the fridge in the kitchen when I went in to refill one of the dishes and realized that Jay was telling her family member all these nasty things about my mom and I. I cried quite a bit behind that fridge. I never brought it to Jim's attention because I just knew that he would take their side and I would lose him for good. I did write a lovely letter to Tiff thanking her for loving my brother and giving him a safe space to be himself. 

I was not in a good place and just started therapy with alot of abandonment trauma and my therapist encouraged me to reach out to him and share my feelings, to which I did. Unfortunately I cried alot on the phone and told him that he was my only brother and it hurt me that we had no relationship and I felt like just a guest at his wedding. So he asked me to say a speech. 

By now, his ""new family"" was who he introduced everyone to and alot of people were surprised to know that he even had a biological sister, so I wrote the shit outta that speech and delivered it with class and just reminded him and everyone in that room of how much love I had for him. Afterwards I wept in the bathroom for a good long while. This changed our relationship a little that we started to reach out to each other a bit more. 

When they were pregnant with their first child, I worked from home at the time and offered to come live with them to help. They agreed and I moved 6 hours to live them. The first 3 days, I walked on eggshells. Then I told him that I felt like if we were going to live together comfortably we should really have a conversation about everything and explain each other's sides of everything. We had that conversation with Tif present and it felt like a very healing conversation and we had an incredible relationship from that moment on. I feel I have to mention that all this time, I didn't have a relationship with Jim, so I didn't know who he was really as an adult. When I moved in, I felt like I became super close to both Jim and Tif at the same time and got to know who they were at that time. I can honestly say that I was just as close to Tif as I was to Jim and in some ways closer to Tif. We had so many suppers together where we told each other how grateful we were to be in each other's lives and how much better I've made their lives since reconnecting. 

I stayed there for 4 months until their daughter was born. I was in the hospital with them and they even made me godmother. They told me that Jim's ""parents"" were coming for 2 weeks once the baby was born and while they were in hospital, I went back to the house and got their room ready, cleaned the whole house and changed all the sheets for them to come home to a clean house. The day we came home, his ""parents"" were there and that's when Jim told me that I had to leave that day for those 2 weeks as it would be too awkward for them. I was in shock but wanted to respect their wishes and be the bigger person, so I left and cried the entire drive home. At the end of the 2 weeks, I returned and stayed for 2 months. I made the drive to visit every month and we spoke often in between. I really felt like I finally had a healthy relationship with my brother and sister in law. 

After their second was born their relationship started to deteriorate and they ended up separating, with Tif accusing Jim of physically assaulting her. It was very hard to believe but how do you tell someone that claims to have been abused that they weren't when I wasn't there. This is where things started to shift. I was getting calls from both of them telling me their sides and I listened. Both had to come through my town on seperate occasions and stayed with me. Jim started to feel like I had no loyalty to him because, being his sister, I should have just taken his side automatically. Despite that, Jim kept the house and begged me to come move in with him. With nothing keeping me in my town, I moved in with my brother.  Plus I knew that we lived well together so we could do it again. 

Jim and Tif shared custody and had each their kids for a week a time. We hashed out details before I made the decision to move like rent and expectations with the kids. He said he would charge me $700 for rent plus half groceries which I thought was pretty steep but he said that he would help me find a job and eventually help me start my food truck. He said that he just expected me to be an aunt and love his kids. So I agreed and moved up here. 

What I didn't know was that the girl that Jim cheated on Tif with, Kay, was living with him and when I agreed to move up, he kicked her out. All of her things were still all over the house and 2 days after I moved in, she came over to pack her stuff. I helped her and apologized to her and tried to just be there for her as support while she cried the entire time she was packing her things. Of course Jim refused to be in the house while she was there to not have to face her like a coward. I started to see him differently now. Kay and I would end up really good friends.

 I had alot of my own things, some of which went into the house and the rest was stored in Tif's basement as per Jim's suggestion. I still had a good relationship with Tif and just tried to stay neutral. I quickly got a job at a local restaurant which meant I worked alot of nights. I ended up making lunches for me and my brother and would meal prep for us alot as I have a culinary background and genuinely love to cook. He started coming home for lunch everyday and sometimes brought a friend. 

He was offered a job teaching part time at the college which his job would accomodate but that meant he had to start going into work earlier. I agreed to help get the kids up and on the bus on his weeks so he could fulfill this dream of his. Afterall, we were together to support each other. This quickly turned into my cleaning the house, doing the groceries, making all the meals, getting up with his kids everyday they were there, even on days he didn't go into work early, snow blowing the driveway when the snow started, all while still paying $700/month and half the groceries. I have to mention that Jim ended up going to a food specialist and found out that there were a number of foods that irritated his bowels and asked me if I could adjust some of the things I would make him to help his digestion, which meant a whole new set of groceries for just him that I still had to pay half of. It was starting to get to me. 

During this time, he was venting about Tif and the courts and how diffuct she was making his life. He told me she had said some not so nice things about me and when her tone with me felt different, it made me feel like what he was telling me was true. He also was going through a bit of a slut phase where he was still stringing on Kay bringing her to our cousin's wedding 8 hours away. While also meeting other girls online and not coming home on the nights he had his kids, leaving me to care for them on my only nights off of work. 

He even had potlucks with friends at the house on nights I was scheduled to work but asked me if I could make a dish for him. I would come home from work at 2am and all the food would still be out on the counter and a huge mess. As someone who grew up poor, I can't let food go to waste so I would package and refrigerate the food and clean up a bit before going to bed, only to have to get up early with his kids because he would lock his bedroom door so his kids would end up crawling into bed with me because daddy wouldn't open the door. 

I was starting to feel lonely myself because I was in a new town, with no real friends, alone alot of the time and raising my niece and nephew. I decided to join a dating site and met my now spouse, let's call him Bill, just before Christmas 2019. My mom and her boyfriend came up for Christmas and I made a healthy breakfast for us knowing how heavy the food was going to be for the next few days. A breakfast that Jim asked for regularly and loved. My mom is not a very healthy person but Jim, his new girlfriend, Bill and I are. My mom started making fun of the breakfast asking where the bacon and eggs and sausage were, so naturally Jim's old nature kicked in and just started making fun of the breakfast to help gang up on me, this just gave a flashback of my childhood and how he used to be. 

I did make a huge Christmas Eve dinner for us with all the fixings. It was nice. It was the first time we were all together for Christmas since 2002. I remember crying and saying how thankful I was that we could all be together. Everyone wanted to go to bed early, like 8pm and I decided to go to Bill's mom's house for their big Christmas dinner with extended family.  It didn't actually even start until after I got there around 9pm. Jim and my mom asked if I would be home for breakfast and I said yes, I wasn't going to spend the night. So despite getting home late, I still got up early and made breakfast for everyone; one that no one would complain about. We spent the day together and I went back to Bill's mom's house for their more intimate Christmas dinner with just his sisters and nieces and nephews. That night I ended up spending the night there and was bombarded with messages the next morning about where I was and where was breakfast, to which I said he could take care of 1 breakfast. He was not happy. After that day he was cold towards me. 

My cousin came for a visit between Christmas and New year's and stayed for new years. In that time, Jim decided to have all his friends and his ""mother"" Jay over for a potluck to get it all out of the way at the same time, but Jay explicitly asked Jim that I not be there because I make them uncomfortable, so he hosted this night again on a night I was working but asked me to make a dish. My cousin was like ""so you're making a dish for a Christmas party that you're not even going to be here for? That's f*cked up"". I was just glad that someone saw it. 

New year's Eve was a busy day. Tif wanted to be with the kids but it was Jim's day so he said no to keep them from her. I started noticing how manipulative he was and great at gaslighting. He worked a half day so I was with the kids and my cousin until he came home. Bill left his wallet in his locker at work after a night shift and realized when he woke up, but he worked an hour and 45 minutes away from us. He got someone to drive it half way and asked if I would come for the drive, to which I agreed, we needed things from the nearest Costco which was in the town Bill was meeting the coworker. Jim  was hosting a new years party at the house and asked if I could pick some stuff up from Costco. 

By the time I got home it was 8:30pm and Jim had already put the kids to bed, so he didn't want to ring in the new year with them but didn't want Tif to have them. I wanted to shower and get ready for the party. At 9:30pm Jim came to my room really upset saying that people were here and I was I still getting ready. Like wtf, dude. I live here. The party is at my dwelling. Who cares what time I come upstairs? We ended up having a fun night as a group and just before 2am Bill and I decided to head to bed. Jim then asked ""are you getting up with the kids or am I?"". I told him that they were his kids and his choice to keep them and put them to bed early so he could get up with them and he tried to guilt trip me in front of his girlfriend, Bill and my cousin. Bill just grabbed my hand and led me to my room. 

At 5am I heard Jim's daughter go upstairs and knock on his door and ask if she could sleep with him. She was 4 at the time, and he didn't answer the door as usual so she tried to climb into bed with her brother (2yrs) who woke up crying and wanting daddy, so I heard them both go upstairs and try daddy again and he didnt respond. Door was locked. Those babies came downstairs, crying and asked to sleep with me, but Bill was in my bed so I took them to Jim's room and knocked hard on the door telling him his kids wanted him and he yelled that he was busy and that I should take care of it. To avoid a fight in front of them and my cousin who was awake on the couch and witness to this, I went into their room and cuddled them in their bed. When I thought they were asleep I went back to bed, but my niece followed me crying so I pushed Bill against the wall, gave him my back and put my niece in bed with me. 

My brother only spoke to me over text for 3 days while trying to tell me he sees a change in my behaviour since meeting Bill... I decided to make dinner for us as a white flag and have a chat. I told him that I was applying for a job that would change my hours drastically and wouldn't be here for all mornings with the kids and asked him if he would be willing to wake up with his kids more during the week. His response was ""so don't spend time with my kids"". As if they are my kids to negotiate. Don't get me wrong, I love my niece and nephew and would do anything for them, but it's not my responsibility to raise his kids. Although he did say that I knew what I ""signed up for"". I told him that I wanted more free time to spend with Bill, which is my right. To which he responded ""tell him to enjoy my lunches"". He also scolded me for putting his daughter in bed with me and my new boyfriend whom no one knew very well at the time. I got really upset and told him that he should have answered the door and parent his kids. That I was happy to help but they are not my kids and not my responsibility and moved up here to make both of our lives better, but he was taking advantage of me. He continued to try and gaslight me. We went around in circles until we had to leave for our volleyball game. I thought we would continue the conversation after the game but he arranged to have his girlfriend come over right after the game to avoid a conversation at all. 

Everyday for 2 weeks, he had invited people over to the house or just didn't come home, to avoid any conversation which forced me to write him a long message over WhatsApp. In that message I gave him my 2 months notice and in many words, as you can imagine, how he made me feel and how disappointed I was. He didn't respond to the message, as expected. 

The next day I got a call from Tif to say that she can't get ahold of Jim but the daycare called and my nephew was sick but she couldn't leave work, so I agreed to go get him. Jim was in his room the whole time and refused to come out. The next day I agreed to watch both kids at Tif's place while she went to work because now they were both sick. I sent Jim a message to see what he had planned for his son's birthday as it's in January and his response was to ""ask my best friend, Tif"". I reminded him that I was there watching his kids that he refused to take care of despite being home. His response was that I needed to be out of his house ASAP and to forget the 2 months notice. He was changing the code to the locks and I needed to find my own place. I literally had the clothes on my back. I tried to go back to the house but he had locked me out for real. I didn't know what to do. I uprooted my life to move here. I had no real friends, no other family, he alienated me from Tif, and I just met my boyfriend like 4 weeks prior and now I was locked out of my home without any of my things or my cat. 

I had no choice but to go to the police station to find out what my rights were and they placed a courtesy call to say that he can't keep my things from me. So he had to try and control when I was able to move my stuff out of his house and very vocal with his expectations in the most condescending way. Luckily Tif was super understanding and let me and my cat live with her despite everything. I had to show up with a police escort the first time to start collecting my things but I had a couch and bed and needed more than 1 trip plus I needed help, so they reminded him to give me the new code to have access and he reluctantly agreed. Bill and I tried to take my things in 2 trips but a third was going to be needed. I did those 2 trips while he was at work but on the second trip, we were having difficulties with strapping the couch in the truck and Jim came home early. He got right in my face and was screaming and caused a huge scene in front of the neighbours and his kids. Bill just pulled me away and we drove to the nearest parking lot where we finished strapping the couch. I then received a predictable message from him about his ""rules"", the damage I left and the money I owe him for rent and damages but that I was no longer welcome on his property. Blah blah blah At this point I'm not taking any of his shit and know my rights and standing up for myself. I managed to get  his garage key from Kay who still had a copy and went and picked up the last of my stuff. Of course he had an officer give me a courtesy call and asked how I gained access. I moved in with Tif and thankfully I did, because covid happened in March and he would have been a nightmare to be stuck with. 

Around that time I also found out that I was pregnant. Shortly after covid, he told Tif that he was done being a dad. He gave up and was not picking them up and this was the only way to get rid of her. So I sent him a big long message about how huge of a mistake he's making. That despite how mad I was at him, I was still going to advocate for those babies. He was not breaking the cycle but continuing it just like our father. I also messaged a good friend of Jim 's, pleading him to reach out to my brother and help him realize that he needs to be in his kids' lives and they need him. He didn't see his kids for over a month and then wanted them back. He finally chose to get counseling and seek help. He tried to rebuild his relationship with our mom and I realized that he was in severe depression and showed all the signs of suicide, so after not seeing or speaking with him for 4 months, I just showed up and hugged him. Reminded him that I was still here. When I had my daughter, I brought her to meet him and after that we were civil but never having talked things through. I was always the one that initiated any contact with him or get together. 

Tif moved on and had a third baby with her new boyfriend, let's call him H. Although H had a substance problem, we were really close, the 3 of us. Spent alot of time together, laughed alot and they even came to me to mediate alot of their fights or arguments, so when I witnessed H neglecting his parental duties because of an ongoing argument he and Tif had been having, I said something to him not knowing that he was under the influence and it resulted in him having a one sided full blown screaming match with me with all the kids present, including my daughter. I left and Tif and I got into a heated argument after that so we kind of drifted apart after that. Tif and H stayed together so our relationship was never the same and I no longer felt safe with my children in his presence. So when Jim tried to get us all together for Christmas, I told him I did not feel comfortable being there with them because there was no attempt on his part to reconcile and make me feel safe. Of course Jim complied and wanted all the details. I'm thinking they were getting along, otherwise why would he have her and H over for Christmas? I, of course, just told him that we had a falling out and there was no attempt to reconcile on their end and Jim took that and added his details to try and use against Tif in court, which created more of a riff between Tif and I because she thought I had run to Jim at the first site of trouble between me and her. 

The following year Bill and I got pregnant again to which we told the family, including my brother and then we lost the baby at 9 weeks and Jim never once reached out to check on me. We found out we were pregnant again 3 months later and this time with twins. Despite everything, I still reached out to my brother to try and make plans to get together with our kids to go Christmas tree shopping and I was going to tell him about our pregnancy in person. I also suggested that we get together for Christmas and go get santa pictures at the mall together with all the kids. Despite him saying yes and my trying to finalize plans closer to the Christmas tree outing, he ghosted me and ditched me and my family to play music with a friend at a local coffee shop. I only know this because I ran into my niece and Jim's girlfriend at the mall the day we were supposed to be together and she innocently told me that daddy was playing music with a friend. After that, I still tried to finalize plans for Christmas to which he said he had people over and would get back to me and then never did. 

A person can only take so much rejection and it seemed pretty evident that he was content without me and my family in his life. So I said I would not make any effort for him ever again. I was tired of being the one to always make the effort just to be dismissed and made to feel unimportant. He had not even made any effort to fix what he had initially broken when he ""kicked me out of his house"". But accused me of not being loyal and it was my fault that we did not have unconditional sibling love. 

Near the end of my pregnancy, Tif reached out to me to apologize and let me know that she and H were no longer together and she wanted to work on our relationship which I was very open to. I missed her. She even came to my house a few times near the end of my pregnancy to help me with household chores as I was bedridden for the last month of my pregnancy. 

I had my twins in June 2023 and despite what I told myself, I still messaged him to let him know I had the twins. I shared their names and a picture and he congratulated me but that was it. No attempt or desire to want to meet them. 

I had pretty bad post partum depression after the twins. When the twins were about 3 months old, we found out that one of our best friends, who is a local country music artist, was performing locally, Bill got a sitter for us and tickets to the event which happened to be an event hosted and organized by Jim to help raise money for colon cancer. We actually had backstage passes for our friends performance so I knew there was a chance I was going to see my brother but I was there to support my friend. Also with 3 month old twins and a 3 year old toddler, it was easier to get a sitter to come after we put everyone to bed as the twins were sleeping through the night and trying to feed and put them to bed was overwhelming for just me, let alone someone who doesn't see them on a regular. So we made it just in time for our friend's performance and missed all the previous performance, which apparently Jim was one of. But hey, we got there and we got out and I got to dance and listen to the music I love, backstage at my best friend's concert with his girlfriend and all of our friends and it lifted my spirits. 

Tif happened to be at a wedding that night with a friend and when she found out we were going to the concert, she decided to leave the wedding and come to the concert. Now, she and I do not discuss my brother, our friendship has surpassed all the drama they've had and obviously I don't talk to my brother so I had no idea that they weren't in a good place. Last I heard she was going to his house for Christmas dinner. How would I know that they were on a downward spiral of their rollercoaster of a relationship?? Our friend's girlfriend gave security the ok for Tif to be backstage with us. What I didn't expect was how drunk Tif was. She definitely made her presence known and Jim's girlfriend asked her to leave because she did not have backstage passes. I knew that this was a move on my brother's part but wouldn't face her himself so he sent his girlfriend to do his dirty work. Once she left, Jim walked right up to me, inches from my face during my friend's performance and asked if I let Tif backstage. I told him that I didn't have the power to do that but the performer's girlfriend gave security the ok. He then proceeded to scream at me demanding I explain why that would be a good idea to have her back here. I tried to tell him that we don't talk and I didn't know they weren't in a good place. He then proceeded to kick me and Bill out of backstage and threatened to call security on us if we didn't leave. I tried to plead with him and tell him not to do this that I came to support my friend and haven't been out since my twins were born and he asked me if I made it early enough to watch his performance. All my friends are witnessing this while our friend is performing. He then throws in ""and you're keeping my niece and nephews from me. Get out from my event or I will get security to escort you out"". I realized that Bill had already left to avoid a physical fight cause he was sick of my brother treating me and talking to me the way that he has been. So I left and went to find him. I was shaking and fuming to say the least. I then got a text from our friend's girlfriend asking where we went and I told her he kicked us out. She told us to come back and he had no right. Our friend is the main artist and he wants us back there so to come back. She went to Jim and scolded him for kicking us out and that he had no right to do so. It may be his event, but our friend was the main talent and has the right to have whoever he wants back there. Jim proceeded to tell her that he loves me to death but can't have his ex backstage. So Bill and I returned back stage and enjoyed the rest of the show, or tried to anyway. Once the show was over, we were able to go backstage and attend the after party which Jim was there for but we didn't say a word to each other. Bill and I hung out with our friends backstage and then we left. 

Our friends walked us to our car and I got emotional about the whole ordeal and apologized for the drama that seems to follow Jim and I, but they were super supportive and kept saying ""we saw his true colours tonight and you did nothing wrong."" It still made me so sad that after everything I've done for him, he continues to treat me like gum on the bottom of his shoe. Maybe it was all the emotions running through me or maybe I was justified but I was sick of being abused by him and realized how toxic he is to my life and the audacity of him trying to use my children to play the victim. So I sent him a message about how he hurt me for the last time and told him he was dead to meet unless he took ownership of what he's done and apologized and then blocked him. 

Now I have some family members who say that family should stick together and stupid shit should be pushed aside to be able to come together because we're family, but I don't think this is stupid shit. You don't get to shit on people, family or not, just because you know they will always be there. I feel like any of these things individually would not be a big deal but accumulated and repeated behaviour shouldn't be ignored. I feel like at some point, I would just keep putting myself in positions to get hurt and then expose my children to toxic sibling behaviour when all I want for them is to love and respect each other. Siblings fight, I get that, but I believe this is different and accountability and effort must come from both sides. That is the lesson I want to teach my children and luckily through Bill's family, they will be exposed to healthy sibling relationships. 

If you've read this far, I thank you for your support already. So Reddit, am I the asshole for perceiving all his behaviours as toxic enough to cut him out of my life? Or was cutting him out too drastic?",7,1732127306.0,AITH,6,0.77,False

","I try to support local and independent businesses as much as I can, so if I eat out, I only get food from independent restaurants, and since Astoria has so many, and with the growing trend of corporate businesses trying to push them out, I try to focus on giving my business to the smaller ones.

But I've notice a ""flavor"", that I can't quite describe, which used to only be when I'd get some pastries that were probably close to (likely past) the expiration date. I'm posting this here, because I've never experienced this outside of Astoria, and now I'm noticing it much more often and in cooked food too.

**The way I'd best describe this taste is like the smell of an old stale basement, and you're licking the floor. It has notes of cleaning products and an aftertaste of dust.**

I first tasted this from a frozen yogurt shop, I thought maybe it was from the plastic cups being in an old dusty storage area.

I got xmas cookies from a very well known and long standing bakery last year, and they all had a very strong taste of this, as well as being stale. They were inedible and at the party we just decided to throw them all out.

I've been buying discounted food from toogoodtogo and on a couple of the bakery / coffee shop deals, there was a feint taste of this. Which would make sense that I'm buying food that's discounted for being too old to sell, but is infuriating when I'm paying full price for something just to throw it away.

**This made me think that it could be from something stale in the cooler making it's way into the taste while the items become stale.**

But then I got a sandwich, and ate half of it before I noticed that same flavor, and then the more I'd eat it, the more I'd notice it, and I just couldn't finish it.

And then comes today, where I just got a huge burrito, and ate some of it, then started tasting that disgusting flavor again, and just decided to throw it out, but on my way to the trash can, I started violently throwing up, and wouldn't stop until all of it was out of my stomach.



Is this a result of some health code violation? I know the health code budget has been cut due to Eric Adams, so restaurants might be cutting costs by selling food that should already have been thrown out? Or because they're not maintaining proper sanitation?

Is this a contamination of some cleaning product into the food preparation areas, and now I'm tasting it?

The test sim decided that, no matter what I did, the kitchen wasn't usable and as such all the ingredients directly teleported from her hands to the side of the house.

I couldn't find a way to fix it so I decided to start over, bigger this time, in the hope that with more counters she'd have no more issues (I should have known better, I gave ""Home for Two"" just an angle counter + a normal one and she had no complaints).

Once I finished ""Modern Life 2.0"" I made the test sim try and cook a cake.

SHE GRABBED THE INGREDIENTS AND RAN TO LEAVE THEM ON A TABLE OF A NEARBY PARK.

I tried to insist, maybe it was just because she'd decided that she wanted to talk to a random sim, and made her bring back the ingredients to cook them.

Cue the tiktok shop…I know most of the fragrances are probably junk comparatively but I just love them. And I mean the cheap-cheap ones, like 3-10$ so they’re probably super low quality but I still enjoy them. I love every aspect of reading the notes and the silly fragrance names and then blind buying and finally testing them. I almost bought one scent labeled “human peach” for the mere humor of it but $7 to be silly was too much for me 😅

Anyway, other than the shame, am I harming myself? 😂 Like cancer or whatever? I really don’t think that most high end fragrances make an effort to be “clean” as they don’t generally advertise it and it’s be a selling point. But I also have no knowledge whatsoever as to whether these cheap fragrances are even dirtier than the regular higher end ones. Does anyone know if I’m just spraying straight petroleum on myself? 🥲

I like the higher priced ones too like the Khair pistachio but those are a less common purchase as I usually just add a cheaper perfume to an order so I get feee shipping on the stuff I actually need.

Last, does anyone else have a silly favorite cheap tiktok shop fragrance? My favorite cheap-cheap one is probably the “wind hibiscus coffee perfume” it doesn’t barely last at all but it was like $7 so I don’t mind re-spraying haha.

I preparing full guide how to manage withdrawal or pause from kratom. If you have any experiences, methods how to manage symptoms please comment here.

In the begin i want you to know that for me kratom is one of the most beautiful healing plant i experienced.

Its worth to research this plant and give it a try if you consider or have a problem with taking benzo and opioids. This is also good tool to fight with legal drugs like benzo and opioids.

In my understanding of addiction (sober from fent 7years, benzo 4years) levels of kratom withdrawals are few. Based on how long and how much you taking you will have higher level dependency.

In lower-medium doses, withdrawals are on the same level as mid-heavy coffee drinker off from caffeine. As i understand coffee addiction, kratom have shorter and more manageble withdrawals symptoms, even if you dont know how to manage this kind of situation.

If you are MID coffee drinker, stop and see what will happen. :)

Kratom withdrawals is 2-5days physical to 7 days. Mental depends on your mindset and discipline.

If you dont agree with my statments, please write comment also.

This is the time to match perspectives before i will end guide.

If you will write your methods, there is HARD NO for benzo, opioids, gabaergics modulators like pregabaline. I imagine cannabinoids are helpful and legal on some states and countries, if you want give advice with cannabis please be responsible.

(Eng is not my first language, this post is write without translator. Guide will be checked in cases of stylistical or others language errors.)

You will help me in my work and i Hope it will helps people and make diffrence.

Thank you.

What they don’t do is tell you how to do that or what it even means. Here are a few things that I wish I started sooner.



Being **physically active** is absolutely essential.  Every day in law school you sit down and perform a mental marathon. Then at the end of the day most people want to sit down and kick their feet up. It’s terrible for your mental health to be dormant for so many hours in a day. You must exercise. If you don’t have the time to go to the gym, you surely have enough time to go for a 30 minute run. If you’re not a runner, go for a walk. Law school is hard, but it’s not so hard that you can’t fit in a 30 minute workout.



**Eat right.** The things you put into your body affect your mind. If you eat like shit, you will feel like shit. Then you will look like shit. Then you will feel even shittier. You also need to make sure you are eating throughout the day. Don’t skip any meals because you need that energy to keep up the mental marathon.

  
**Self-talk.** Law school has a way of making people spiral into negative thoughts. To assuage this, you need to have multiple voices in your head. Everyone has negative thoughts, and it's impossible to prevent them from coming up. All you can do is control your next thought and your next action. Create a second voice in your head to counter any negativity: ""There's no way I get all this work done by tomorrow."" ""*Fuck you mean? You think this is the first time in my life I've been pressed for time? Try me.""*



**Wake up earlier**. Not to do work. So many people wake up just in time for themselves to get out of the house and get to school. They throw themselves immediately into the stress. Some hardly even have time for breakfast. Wake up 20 minutes earlier. Go for a walk. Take a couple extra minutes with your coffee to really enjoy that fucking coffee.

Law school is hard. Let law school be the obstacle, not yourself.

Her childhood was shaped by the horrific abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, Leonard. Using a scholarship and a college fund from her mother, Andrea earned a law degree at Georgetown and has been practicing law for the past 18 years, channeling her rage into securing convictions—especially against men.



 November 22nd, 1994. A week after Andrea was attacked and nearly raped outside a motel. A month after her son's speech there took advantage him. She was investigated but not much came of it due to a lack of substantial evidence and low effort on behalf of the police. Several months since Nick's soulmate transferred to a prestigious college to realize her ambitions. She promised to keep in touch, but over time that promise has degraded to avoidance and short, out of touch conversations. Letters and phone calls are predictably ineffective. <End context>

  


 Judge Judy chastises some poor bloke as Andrea takes a significant gulp of her rich red wine. An otherwise eerie quiet envelops every room and passageway as the AC settles. 

 ""Goodnight, Emily.""

 ""Goodnight, Nicky! :)""😴🥱💤 ""I love you."" 

 She stares up at him with admiration, clutching the hem of the blanket just a little bit tighter. Her teddybear suffers a collapse of his airway under her arm in tandem. She closes her eyes and rolls over...

 The words remake his heart just as hard as they break it. 

 Nicky turns his attention back to the living room, back to mom. There she is, still sitting there. 

 ""Hi m-"" 

 ""Oh, Jesus, Nicholas, please..."" {frightened, grasping her heart}

 ""...I'm sorry.""😞 

 ""I didn't mean to-""

 \*sigh\* ""I know you didn't, Nicholas...""

 Judge Judy is chastising someone over the sound of his thoughts. Before their silence lingers for too long:

 ""May I...?"" 

 He gestures to the wine bottle. Andrea gets a genuine chuckle out of it.

 ""Nicky... Last time, that did not go well.""

 He doesn't laugh, not because he didn't find it funny, because he was surprised by her being genuine.

 He takes a glass from the cabinet anyway and pours halfway to the brim, taking a seat to her right on the recliner. The couch she's on remains with a glaringly empty seat.

 Nicky settles into his comfort zone for once. With what's on his mind, the consequences that comfort brings might no longer matter. He can't bring himself to speak up, so he immerses himself in the show.

""...""

""...""

""...Nicholas?"" {hesitant}

""Yes, mom?"" {eager}

""...""

""Do you need something?"" {why are you here? But in a polite way}

""...""

""I want to kill myself.""

Andrea freezes, Judge Judy is suddenly a million miles away. She doesn't make a goddamn noise. He can feel her eyes on her, asking are you serious?

""I already know how I'd do it painlessly.""

""...Nicholas.""

""Helium...it's not supposed to hurt when you inhale too much of it.""

""...""

The TV pauses, Andrea gets the remote down on the coffee table with a large thud against the glass, followed by her wine. 

 ""Have you told anyone else this?""

 ""...no.""

 ""...don't do anything dramatic son.""

Nicky keeps quiet, looking away. She sighs, forcing herself to speak.

""The truth is, the life that I built here is brighter with you in it. Your sister loves you. You have no idea how much she values you."" {she doesn't fully buy what she's trying to sell}

 ""...""

 ""Please. I'm look at me and tell me you're ok.""

Nicky keeps looking to the blank tv screen, afraid of the damage she can deal if he screws this up.

 ""What about you? Do you love me?""

 ""Nicky do really have to...""

 ""..."" 

 ""Ugh. Why...can't you just listen to what I'm saying?""

 ""I'm not sure...""

 She's so annoyed with him. His suicide would allow her to live her life the way she wants to. It's just a matter of getting it to happen without implicating herself.

 ""Please, mom.""

 ""...what?""

""Please love me.""

Andrea is mortified. She can't bring herself to look him in the eye.

 ""...stop. Of course I love you. I do.""

Nicky looks even more devastated than before. He looks to her for anything more reassuring and receives nothing.

 ""Please...just..."" Andrea is about to start crying, she grabs her heart like it's stressed

 ""Go away.""

 ""What?""

 ""Please. Go away!""

 Nicky gets to his feet alarmingly fast, and hurries off to his room, not looking back as he disappears behind the corner.

 Oh god. Oh fuck. What have I done?

 She doesn't have the courage to face it. She was not prepared for the longest night of her life, waiting for her son to kill himself, disgusted with herself but also too mortified to face what she's pushing herself to do.

 Wine in hand, she settles into bed, curled into the fetal position. Staring at the ceiling, drinking as much wine as her stomach can carry. Numerous times she almost got up to check on him, to beg him not to do it, and she can't even place why.

 

 Soft sunlight filters through the blinds. It's a beautiful day outside. 

  


What happened last night? Why did I get so...

  


NICHOLAS, NO

  


Andrea gets out of bed faster than her heart was ready for, running as fast as her heart will allow to her son's bedroom. Please please please please don't go. Nicky I love you, please don't...

 

The door flies open, her mind overwhelmingly prepared to see him hanging, or with a bag over his head. 

  


 He was sleeping soundly.  

  


""Mom...?""

Andrea pivots, realizing her mistake.

 ""Emily! I was just...I don't know. I had a bad dream.""

 ""Really? That something bad happened to Nicky? I get those too.""

 Andrea's heart breaks even more. She nearly falls to her knees. 

 ""P-please, Emily, please...""

 ""Now is not the time, sweetheart. Please go back to bed.""

 ""But I have to get ready for-

 ""Please, not now.""

 Emily's brow furrows. Something isn't right between her and Nicky. Again.

 Andrea starts hiding every knife, every rope, every pill. Emily watches from around the corner in horror, connecting the dots. 

 ""Mom...why are you doing that?  He...he wouldn't...""

 ""Dammit, Emily. Please, go get ready for school. I can fix this.""

 She's never heard her mother curse at her before. Tears start to form. 

 ""No! I want to know!""

 Andrea's already crying too and puts a knee down to hug Emily. 

 ""Your brother isn't doing well, Emily. We need to protect him. We need to help him.""

 ""...why, what did he say?!""

 Andrea breaks down sobbing. Nicky said what he meant literally. Telling Emily would only deal unnecessary damage to her. 

 ""Just promise me that if your brother asks you for help, you will be there for him."" 

 \*sniff\* ""Okay."" She immediately sets off on an unexplained mission. Andrea hesitates before deciding to just let her go.

 Nicky's eyes fly open. His heart is swelling and Emily crawled into the fetal position on the bed beside him. Her cast juts into his side in an effort to be closer to him. His arms fall around her, love and hope returning to him in small quantities. 

 ""Mom...she made it sound like you're going to hurt yourself."" {holding back tears}

 He remains awfully quiet, and it scares her.

 ""I...I told her something. I didn't want to have to lean on you for support, I'm not sure that's how this dynamic should work.""

 ""But...Nicky...I can't be okay if you're not okay....That's how this dynamyc should work."" {picking up his vocabulary, practicing the word}

 ""Because I can make you feel better. I know I can."" She nuzzles her forehead into him, letting her hair cascade around them trustfully.

 ""Mom's...scared. And so am I.""

 ""She thinks you...you want to...hurt yourself."" The words confuse and shock her, turning to tears faster than even she expected. 

 Emily wails beside him, ragged and damaged.

 ""Please say it's not true. That's you wouldn't...you wouldn't...""

 Emily gathers herself, not wanting to make this about her feelings. Not even remotely. 

 ""Please, Nicky... I love you."" {loving}

 ""This world is better with you in it... I promise.""

 ""We can fix this, we can help you, we can..."" {bargaining}

 ""Shhh, sh sh sh.."" {recognizing the signs of her panic attacks easily}

 Emily immediately winds down, falling back against him.

 His head rests again, so drained of his emotional capacity. Andrea can be heard rummaging around in the kitchen.

 ""Did she really...what did she say, em?""

 She looks up, eager to elaborate on anything that might make him feel better.

 ""She said that we need to be there for you. That you're not ok.""

 ""...""

 ""She said that?"" Why the hell was she so cruel last night if she cares? This is asinine.

 ""What else...?"" {afraid to know}

 ""Not much...she...she was hiding things she thought you might use...to...to..."" {the thought is incomprehensible}

 ""I've never seen her so scared, Nicky. I don't think she's acting.""

 ""We all want you to be okay. We all need you, Nicky. We want to help.""   
  




this is what I have so far and honestly I'm just wondering it's good enough that I should keep at it or na ",1,1732126447.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1gvw1wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1gvw1wb/our_gender_complexity_club_a_family_journey/,Our Gender Complexity Club: A Family Journey,"hey hey my reddit queers.

Where do I even begin.

My husband and I were both raised in conservative Catholic households, where traditional gender roles were (and are) the norm.  However, in parenting our own five children, we’ve taken a very different approach. We’ve always emphasized that “gender is a construct” and encouraged our kids to explore who they are without the pressure of fitting into rigid boxes.

My oldest, who is now 16, came out as queer two years ago. I vividly remember the morning we found their coming-out letter placed carefully by the coffee pot, where they knew we’d see it first thing. (it was accompanied by an illustrated meme, because lol forever these gen z kids.) Since then, they’ve identified as genderqueer, then non-binary, and most recently, he told me he's ready to start using male pronouns.

Even though I’ve watched this evolution happen, I’d be lying if I said the switch from ""they"" to ""he"" didn’t throw me for a loop. It’s not that I’m resistant—I want to be the best parent I can be. But sometimes I feel like I’m stumbling over my own assumptions or expectations, confronting internalized ideas about gender I didn’t even realize I had.

And it’s not just this kid! My family is a lively mix of identities: I have another child who identifies as non-binary, two younger kids who are cisgender, and then there's my youngest, a cisgender boy with a flair for self-expression—who loves his long hair and occasionally rocking a dress. It’s amazing watching him carve out his own style with so much confidence at just seven years old.

To add another layer, my husband recently confided something that I’m still wrapping my head around. He told me that he sometimes feels like, and I quote, ""a lesbian in a man’s body."" At first, I kind of laughed—it caught me completely off guard—but as we talked more, it became clear that this isn’t a passing thought for him. He explained that he’s felt this way for a long time but figured it didn’t really matter since he’s already married to a woman (me).

And then there’s me. For years now, people have assumed *I’m* gay. Maybe it’s the short hair, the way I carry myself, or the tomboy style I never quite grew out of. It’s gotten to the point where it feels like everyone around me is just waiting for me to come out as at least bisexual. But here’s the thing: I’m not. I’ve always been pretty comfortable with my identity as a straight woman, but the assumptions and the way people perceive me make me wonder if there’s something I’m missing—or if it’s just a reflection of how rigidly we’re all taught to categorize each other.

Our extended families are still very conservative, so none of this is really talked about openly—at least not outside of a very select group of close friends and a few of my siblings. Those siblings have actually formed what my sister jokingly calls the “gender complexity club,” as one of them is bisexual, one is a lesbian, and one is genderqueer (but definitely not a he/him anymore, as they’ve made clear).

I’m trying to hold space for everything: my kids’ evolving identities, my husband’s self-discovery, and my own questions about how I’m perceived versus who I am. It’s overwhelming, but it’s also deeply meaningful. Thank goodness we’re all already in therapy! 

I know I don’t have it all figured out, and I’d love to hear how others have navigated similar situations. How do you support a partner when their sense of self is shifting? How do you balance holding space for someone else’s identity with your own emotions? And how do you give yourself grace when it feels like everything is changing all at once?

Thanks for letting me share this. If nothing else, it feels good to put it out there.",2,1732126427.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False
