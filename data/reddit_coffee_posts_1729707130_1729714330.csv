I met Brenda for a coffee before we talked nuru. This was earlier in 2024 when I first started promoting the girls, and she wanted to play it safe with me as other promo pages don't have the cleanest records. As for the session, I can say Brenda is by far one of the flirtiest in the industry. She takes her time with her clients, she is very accommodating, and has always been incredibly professional. Although I do see more of her freaky and fun side, that's more due to the relationship we‚Äôve developed. Brenda has a lot of fans, so don't waste her time, and go visit her.¬†

I know there is little I can do to help Phyllis, my friend, and that's only if she accepts it. 

She's afraid no one else will want her because she is a black trans woman. She wants to keep her standard of living and fears living in poverty if she leaves. 

Jake, her fianc√©e, is horrible. No one likes him. Not even his dogs. He's manipulative, childish, and takes advantage of her in every way. She's his only friend. 

Jake has issues. He's threatened her life and his with a gun. She's called the cops on him. He has driven recklessly with her in the car. He berates her. Anything she does is wrong to him. There is also SA. Jake will relentlessly provoke her - reactive abuse. He will smile after she reacts, and she will feel ashamed.  He threatened to call the cops on her, for nothing - he said they will believe whatever because he's white and she's black. 

She is the door mat for his family. Jake's father spied on his son and her having sex, and often acts inappropriatly. The dad and family will put any blame and responsibilities on her. 

When Jake comes home, she feels nothing but anxiety, and the dogs run upstairs. 

Phyllis has made good money, over $30/hr, she is very organized and efficient. She finds time to do the things she loves and goes to therapy. Conventionally, she is absolutely gorgeous, well dressed, and in shape. She is fun, engaging, and brilliant. She does suffer from body dismorphia and anxiety. 

She worked full-time, does his laundry, cooks his food, does all the chores and gardens, takes care of the dogs, funds and completes all house projects. She alone furnished and decorated their house - that apparently is only in his name even though he used her credit to help get a loan. Her car, that she pays for, has his name on it too. 

He finatully abuses her and lords the house over her. Takes all her money for ""bills"". She has no savings. He wants to make her a stay at home dog mom, but also complains when she was out of work. Then he gambled away over 40k in savings. 

She says things like ""he's dumb, he doesn't know what he is doing. Hes scared of me."" She recognizes that his abuse is abuse, but she uses that awareness as an excuse to stay with him - an illusion that she is in control. She claims the house is ""her sanctuary"" until he gets home. She is desperately trying to make this situation work. They went to couples counseling, and she said she can fix him and fall in love him. They also trauma bonded. 

One day, she came over in the morning crying. We sat on the floor and talked about what she wanted to do. She decided to move in with me and my boyfriend. So we drove to her place and moved her out in under two hrs before Jake got home from work. 

I did think carefully before offering a place to stay. Having a DV victim stay with you can be difficult or even end the friendship, but her safety is more important than our friendship. 

I moved out of my office, bought an air mattress, and lent her my laptop. She is someone who wants to know expectations, so we talked about living arrangements. We agreed she would not pay rent, there is no timeline for finding a job, just that she applies to them, and she can help with some house projects/chores. She can help herself to our coffee and food. I also offered to help, if she's comfortable, with a few bills so she doesn't fall behind - she doesn't have to pay me back. I'm in a position where I can help someone in this way. I understand that I offered a lot, and that can be overwhelming, so I was always open to more conversations. 

Emotionally, Phyllis was up and down. She was terrified that Jake would crawl through her window at night. Jake actually stalked me and found out where I live and would drive by. 

We spent a lot of time talking. She was happy not to be anxious all the time. She applied to jobs. She spoke with hope and excitement about the new things in her life. She joined a trans support group. She shared more about what he did to her. No one deserves to be treated the way she was.  

But. Jake sent hateful messages, then love bombed, then hate, repeat. Jake bought her things like expensive jewlery, trips, and lots of promises. 

Phillis decided to go on a trip with him two weeks after she left. She asked me what i thought about her going on the trip. I said, ""You are doing so many wonderful things; focusing on yourself and making great plans. I don't think going on that trip is a good priority."" She went on the trip. I sent her good morning texts so she knows that she is wanted here. However, later, she used what I said against me and twisted my words. Repeatedly, she said that I said, ""You don't have your priorities in order."" Like that, I chastized her. She would look very sad, and my heart would drop.

After that, everything I did was wrong to her. I felt like I was going insane. She would roll her eyes at me and click her tongue. Eventually, I told her how I felt about how she was treating me. I was emotional. She expressed concern for me but then wanted to forget all about it and ""just have a good day"". She called me straight, even though she knows I'm not. Later, I did the thing you're not supposed to do, I begged her not to go back to him. I'm ashamed about that, I won't do that again. 

She also alluded to Jake saying bad things about me. I suspect in an attempt to cut me off and isolate her. Jake barely knows me. 

Phillis lived with me for a couple months. She went on more trips with Jake and other men. I kinda felt like a vacation home but didn't say anything. One day I come back from the grocery store and she was moving out. We talked, but to be honest she was distant and condescending. I don't think that was intentional, but I think she was in survival mode. A lot of her behavior was self-preservation. 

She said she was going to stay on different people's couches and that it turns out she has this ""great support system that she didn't know she had."" (One of the support people she listed SA her.) I offered our garage if she wants to store things. She said that wasn't necessary. I expressed that I was happy for her. Then, my boyfriend and I went out and gave her space to finish moving. 

I haven't confirmed that she moved back in with Jake, but I suspect. We haven't talked. I don't regret having her stay with us. I just don't know what to do. I worry about her safety every day. 

I know I can't make her leave, but I dont want to give up. I also don't want to get hurt. But I don't want to give up just because I might get hurt. I wasn't perfect in this situation, I want to be better. If anyone has any insite, stories, or advice they would like to share? 

Thank you so much if you read all this. 

TLDR: My best friend is in a domestic violence situation. She came to live with me. Her fianc√©e loved bombed her, and she started lashing out towards me. Now she moved out and I haven't heard from her. I'm worried about her safety.

1gajxk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1gajxk3/in_therapy_for_ed_and_my_therapist_just_seriously/,In therapy for ED and my therapist just seriously triggered me.. Is this normal??,"TW: descriptions of ED and triggering shit said by my therapist

I have had a severe eating disorder for 8 years now. It started as bulimia, then turned into anorexia b-p. I was critically sick and almost died, which then lead to me starting recovery 3 years ago.¬†

I recently went back to therapy because despite maintaining a healthy weight for over a year¬†now, I still find myself eating only a small variety of safe foods, and overeating my safe foods everyday (plus occasional binges), which leads to purging everyday.¬†

The following happened today, on our 4th session together.

My therapist has been continuously referring to my eating disorder as a ‚Äò food addiction‚Äô. I have 2 main foods that I eat (and overeat) everyday, those are sunflower seeds and frozen mangoes. She said that the salt in the sunflower seeds and the sugar in the mangoes are causing the food addiction.¬†

I tried to tell her that I believe eating disorders are widely more complex than addictions, and that I think my eating habits don‚Äôt stem from a biological addiction to sugar/salt, but rather from a multifactorial dynamic of fears, rules, habits, trauma, etc. She agreed but continued referring to it as an addiction.¬†

Later in the session, she asked me what I usually eat in a day, starting with breakfast. I told her usually a coffee, then 1-2 hours later I usually have a smoothie. She asked what the smoothie is made of, and I told her usually it‚Äôs a banana, mangoes, and matcha powder. She asked if I put any protein and I said no, just sometimes I‚Äôll put yogurt if we happen to have some in the fridge. She then said ‚Äòwell then your breakfast is just sugar!‚Äô.¬†

She also said that ‚Äòif you eat sugar all day, then no wonder you want to eat sugar all day‚Äô (in relation to my over-eating problem).

This made me angry because I have worked very hard in my recovery to be able to eat anything at all and maintain a healthy weight, I am still very scared of sugar, and I felt like there she was literally demonizing one of my few safe foods, which is literally fruit, so like seriously not the unhealthiest thing one could eat for breakfast..¬†

I asked her what she eats for breakfast, to which she answered ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt eat any sugar‚Äô and said she eats quinoa and nuts for breakfast.¬†I then told her that the nuts are super caloric and full of fats and the quinoa is full of carbs. Admittedly I was angry and trying to defend myself, but I did this to show her that any food can be demonized if you try to, because I found it unfair that she was there, demonizing my safe food, because she should know better as a therapist, especially with the background info of my ED. She got very irritated with me at that point, saying that it was wrong of me to counter-attack like this. She also said that nutrition is one of her interests and that she has a lot of knowledge on the topic, then offered to send me a video about sugar to prove to me that it is unhealthy. I tried telling her that fruit is not just sugar, it has vitamins, fiber, etc.

I also told her my diet is actually quite restrictive, I literally do not allow myself to eat any added sugar or carbs at all, and fruit is the only type of carbs/sugar I eat. I also told her I feel like she is not well-informed on the reality of eating disorders and that it can be dangerous to tell something like this to a patient in recovery from a severe eating disorder. I asked her if she feels competent to treat an eating disorder and she said yes.¬†

She then ended the session (the time was up) and asked me if I would show up at the next session (I said yes) and asked if I wanted to change therapists. This surprised me because I felt like we should work through this and not just immediately change, so I asked her if she wanted to drop me, but she said she could continue working with me.¬†

1gajvg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1gajvg0/exposing_the_commercialization_of_unemployment/,Exposing the Commercialization of Unemployment and Misery in Finland - Part 1.5 & 2,"### Part 1.5 - Additional Details

The exploitation of unemployment in Finland has taken various forms over the years. This probably should have been covered in the first part, but let's do it now. Here are the main manifestations of this phenomenon:

**TE-toimisto Services**  
Practically all services offered by the TE-toimisto are now often more of a hindrance than a help in finding employment. They also tend to have some sort of adult daycare.

**Private Sector Training**  
The government pays private companies to provide training for the unemployed. This is obvious based on the first part.

**Wage subsidy (Palkkatuki)**
A wage subsidy means that the state pays half of the subsidized employee's salary. The idea is that an unemployed person gets to prove their work ability in practice, and the employer doesn't take a risk when hiring an unemployed person. Supposedly it's not intended for rotating half-price employees, but this is obviously where the problem lies.

**Social Workplaces**  
Unemployed individuals are made to work for a daily allowance of 9‚Ç¨. This allowance is meant to cover travel expenses and food, in addition to regular welfare benefits.

**Rehabilitative Programs**  
Rehab for unemployment, not for addiction. Supposed to help with social exclusion, loneliness, and perhaps even with unemployment and depression, but based on personal experience, it does exactly the opposite. Activities range from 9‚Ç¨-slavery to PowerPoint presentations, darts, and circle games. It should also be mentioned that not all rehabilitative services are this kind of scum profiting from unemployment. Some of them actually provide genuine rehabilitation, which is certainly needed. Unfortunately, these represent only a fraction of the entire industry.

**Workshop Activities**  
Primarily involves activities like playing music, singing, gaming, crafting, and other pastimes. Often includes excessive coffee drinking and smoking breaks. These are the most common form of rehab at least around here.

**Activation Schemes etc**  
Various programs justified as ""activating"" or training the unemployed. Often used by municipalities to replace one or more paid positions with unpaid labor. Commonly known as ""9‚Ç¨-slavery."" The same work previously done by paid employees is now performed by unemployed individuals receiving a 9‚Ç¨-daily allowance. These unemployed do the work at city depot for example, without appearing as unemployed at statistics.

It's important to note that replacing employees with ""rehabilitees"" is illegal, but this law is rarely enforced. The responsibility for oversight lies with the TE-toimisto, the same entity that manipulates the unemployed into semi-voluntary slavery. Fun fact: while the unemployed gets 9‚Ç¨/day salary, their slave master gets 11-30‚Ç¨/day when the slave is present at the assigned workplace. 

Let it also be known that these figures are not even regulated by law, but are entirely dependent on the service provider and are only based on contractual agreements. These numbers are just the ones I've personally seen in the past, as some of these rehabilitative services outsource even their bookkeeping to the unemployed.

This slavekeeping money seems to be quite essential part of this interesting industry.

### Part 2: A Global Issue of Exploitation

The ""Trickemployment"" scam is far from unique ‚Äì it's part of a global trend where the unemployed are exploited, dehumanized, and manipulated under the guise of ""helping"" them re-enter the workforce. Here's how this issue plays out in other countries:

- United Kingdom: The ""Workfare"" programs force unemployed people into unpaid labor, often for large corporations that benefit from free labor. These schemes have been widely criticized for effectively constituting forced labor and infringing on basic human rights.

- Germany: The ""Hartz IV"" system subjects unemployed individuals to harsh conditions, compelling them to accept any job, no matter how unsuitable or poorly paid. The system focuses more on enforcing compliance than genuinely helping people find sustainable employment.

- Australia: The ""Work for the Dole"" program requires unemployed individuals to work in community projects or internships with minimal compensation. Critics argue that this is little more than forced labor disguised as ""training"" and does little to improve actual job prospects.

- France: France has implemented similar activation programs that push unemployed people into training courses or jobs with little relevance to their qualifications or career goals. The programs are designed more to maintain control over the unemployed than to help them secure meaningful employment.

- Italy: In Italy, especially in southern regions, unemployment programs have been plagued by inefficiency and bureaucracy. Unemployed individuals are often pushed into low-quality training or temporary jobs that do not lead to long-term employment.

- Spain: In the aftermath of the economic crisis, Spain implemented several schemes to ""activate"" the unemployed. However, these programs often push people into unpaid internships or precarious jobs that do not offer a path to stable employment.

- United States: Various states require unemployed people to participate in mandatory job programs or unpaid internships as a condition for receiving benefits. These programs are often criticized for exploiting vulnerable people while providing little real support in securing stable employment.

- Hungary: The ""Public Work Scheme"" forces unemployed individuals into low-paid public works jobs, which are widely regarded as exploitative. The program has attracted international criticism for violating basic labor rights and reinforcing cycles of poverty.

- Ireland: The ""JobPath"" program in Ireland has been criticized as punitive rather than supportive. Participants report feeling coerced into pointless activities under threat of losing their benefits, with little real help in securing long-term employment.


That's what I managed to uncover with a simple information search. It's difficult to determine how severe the problem truly is in reality.

Its you and I.

I'm hearing a lot of good news in mine.

Lots of ladybug. A friend inside once told me that they were sign from Allah that freedom is approaching. At least for him. And it also is for me. Cause a few weeks later I saw a vision where you `cutiepie` was sending me a shining orange ladybug. Like the one that landed on my shoulder a few minutes ago. (he stayed with me while I was grabbing another cup of coffee lol). Anyway, that was on 05/22 fyi.

My father finally gave in and said it. ""You are right. You will be successful. You will have that girl.""

Cause I'm always right when I mean something. Always right when Allah talks to me. Always right when my heartbeats tells me what *Is*.

I don't have anything to prove. My presence tells everything there is to know about me and my purpose.

My intuition doesn't lack. Yours lacks way way less. Trust me.

We went through one hell of a ride together, didn't we ? 

That's why Allah thinks we're the best couple.

We're simply way too cool. And because He loves chaste believing people.

That is why we are so blessed. That is why we are getting a big money. To marry us. I knew it the moment my co inmate told me I could get money back for my time. I understood why I had to do that much time. Without even mentionning how it absolutely killed that false doubtful ego I had in me; I call him *the forbidden*.

Whatever. You could say that living through the dark night of the soul was my purpose. It wasn't becoming quebec finest champion, nor putting out the illest darkest music my creativity (my balls) could produce. It was learning to 100% Believe in Allah. And trusting that he made me the best girl ever. The most feminine, loving, smartest, absolutely hot woman this world could offer to my eyes. You are the best. You are suited to be mine. You are made exactly the way \_\_\_\_\_ would want it. Trust me. You have our children in your belly. I remember what we saw back in april. **How could one forget ?**

**And how could we forget the date my heart put out ... let's see ...** ***2024*****/*****10/25*** **was it ?**",1,1729713764.0,u_tendoe_youtube,0,1.0,False

*Tl;dr, I'm wondering what's the best way to retire my app (there's a free and a paid version), not as in how do I remove it, but in a way that's easiest on the users who've paid for the app.*

I'm just a bloke in his back bedroom that 12 years ago (nearly 13, wow) saw a useful app and thought ""I'd like to make one of those, but without the ads and with the features *I* want"". So with no Android dev experience I created an app for my own use. It evolved until I thought other people might find it useful and I put it on the Play Store.

It's done pretty well over the years tbf. It's had over 20m installs and for a time was consistently in the top 3 apps in its category. My wife is somewhat miffed I never put ads in it (I hate ads), nor created an iOS version (but yeah, this was *MY* hobby, and unlikely to ever enable me to give up work, sorry darling :))

For various reasons, it's now not possible for me to maintain the apps. The recent update to comply with minimum SDK levels, and fix some Android 13+ bugs, will be the last.

So, I could just remove the apps and my account. I could remove the free version and make the paid one free for a period of time, at least until Google requires it to be updated and they remove it and my account. Either way I think I'll archive it as a download on its website so anyone who has bought it, or just wants to use it, can hopefully find it. But I won't be updating it again so at some point it'll just not work on some devices.

With that said then, how do I play it? I guess I can't avoid the emails ""Hey I just bought it and now it's free?!"". It's a quid plus VAT, less than half a coffee lol.

Thoughts appreciated, thanks for reading :)

  
ps. I can't handle selling it, or paying someone else to maintain it etc. There are also a million others out there that do the same thing (mostly with ads).",1,1729713744.0,androiddev,1,1.0,False

We were all hanging out weekly.. He has one friend that we grew up with let's call him Jerry. So 2 years ago jerry and I started dating and slept together a few times, It kinda got weird quickly and fizzled out.
Eventually, after a couple months he ended it I was sad because he was my first but we've remained close friends (see each other at group functions but never one on one).
Fast forward to now, Jerry has a new girlfriend and they've been together for maybe five or six months.
And I just feel like she hates me. Maybe he told her about our history or maybe she just senses it. I think it‚Äôs really immature if something like this bothers her‚Ä¶ we were friends for years first. 
I'm not sure if I should take all this personally, but she follows all of the other girls in the group on Instagram, and she won't accept my Facebook request (l've sent it like three or four times just to make sure it wasn't a mistake but every time she declines) she's not exactly rude to me but just ignores me if I say something in the group chat or never really makes an effort. She‚Äôs also way friendlier with the other girls than me. 
And I always ask about how Jerry is/ how their relationship is. I have even given her tips on things he likes (as a friend I‚Äôve never said it as if we dated.) I don't know what else to do to make this girl like me and I'm worried I'll lose my friend over her. (He has also barely talked to me since they started dating and he will put his arm around her as soon as I walk in the room) I feel like he‚Äôs rubbing it in my face. 
She also will never come to a party if it's at my house but Jerry sometimes will. 
Would I be the asshole if I ask Jerry for coffee to talk about this or just ask her to have coffee and clear the air one on one?

Let me break down my experience for anyone on the fence.

# What I Love About It:

**6-Stage Filtration** ‚Äì This thing isn‚Äôt messing around. It removes all the usual junk‚Äîchlorine, lead, VOCs, and a bunch of other stuff you don't want in your water. What sets it apart? The **pHPlus Alkaline Filter**. Not only does it purify, but it also adds back healthy minerals like calcium, making the water taste crisp and refreshing.

**Taste Improvement** ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking noticeable difference. It‚Äôs like going from tap water to bottled spring water, minus the plastic guilt. Whether it‚Äôs for coffee, cooking, or just a glass of water, it‚Äôs pure, fresh, and honestly, better than most bottled brands I‚Äôve had.

**Capacity and Durability** ‚Äì Producing 75 gallons a day, this thing can handle family life without skipping a beat. Plus, the filters last a solid 6-12 months, so no constant filter changes to worry about.

# The Not-So-Great:

**Installation** ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a plumbing expert, so it took me about 2-3 hours to get it all hooked up. If you‚Äôre not handy, expect to spend some time, but it‚Äôs totally doable with some patience (and maybe a YouTube tutorial). Once it‚Äôs set, though, you won‚Äôt need to touch it much.

**Filter Cost** ‚Äì The filters aren‚Äôt cheap, but they‚Äôre long-lasting, so it balances out. Still, you‚Äôll feel it at checkout when it‚Äôs time to replace them.

# Final Verdict:

If you're after high-quality, mineral-rich water that actually tastes good, the **APEC ROES-PH75** is 100% worth it. It‚Äôs a little more expensive upfront, but the water quality and health benefits make it a solid investment. Just be ready to spend a bit of time installing it (or get someone else to do it if you‚Äôre not up for it).

What I Had:

I had a Single Cup of Eureka Lemon & Marionberries and Earl Grey Tea & Shortbread Cookies. The Eureka Lemon & Marionberries is Willamette Valley, Oregon Marionberry preserves folded into tart & tangy Eureka Lemon-infused Central Coast milk & cream. As someone who has been to the Willamette Valley many times and has stayed out in Eureka on a couple occasions, I found the fusion between their two respective fruits they‚Äôre known for, quite tasty. The lemon provides a tang to contrast the sweetness of the marionberries that create a nice balance in the fattiness of the ice cream. The Earl Grey Tea & Shortbread Cookies has been my go-to flavor since trying McConnell‚Äôs and I enjoy the way the black tea cuts through the creaminess of the ice cream while complimenting the shortbread chunks inside. 

&#x200B;

Would I Have It Again:

Absolutely! The price is reasonable, and the flavors are interesting (the sweet creams are always a good choice). The ice cream itself tastes like quality and the staff is always friendly no matter how long the lines are.

I've met beautiful, sweet and kind girl in 2022 but I was going through hard times mentally post-COVID. 2022 was best year in my life. We traveled together , did a lot of fun things together and at the end of year I started working on two full-time jobs. I didn't want to work on two full-time jobs but I ended up in that situation and that was going through 2023. It was really difficult for me, stressful, mentally challenging and also I built a lot of bad habits and I started losing myself.

I still used every minute , every weekend to spend with her I didn't go out with anyone else nor friends , nor family , nobody. I wanted to spend every minute with her. And she told me multiple times that I don't need to work that hard but really what I wanted is for her to have everything.

We got engaged in August and next month I completely burned out I couldn't communicate nor operate on personal level I was so exhausted and my overall health got worse so much that I'd be vomiting, pooping blood and etc. I was unable to talk with her to tell her what's going on. All I could do is gently go through her hair with my hand and smile. I was unable to sleep nor I had strength to do anything else. Months passed and few days before New Year we went for a coffee and she was sad and started talking about problems. And everything I could do is watch cup of tea in front of me. She told me that she lost interest and took of the ring and said she's leaving me. I don't know what day it was , nor what was the actual time, weather I was completely dead inside. I don't know frankly how I got home. I just lay down on couch and stayed there for days. I couldn't do anything. My body was numb. Days passed and I got a bit of strength I went to her put my hands around her waist ,hugged her and told her don't leave. She was sad.

She left and I didn't saw her leave apartment I was in worst spot in my entire life. So I spent next months until June in deep depression. I gained a lot of weight. When I started walking I barely could climb stairs on the first floor. I was in such a bad shape. I started walking more and more in beginning every step was hard but I didn't gave up. I then changed my diet. And fast forward to September when we met again on a dinner . She accidentally took my passport and returned it to me. I was still not prepared for our encounter but I wanted to see her so badly. Anyway there were tears and she told me she moved on. But since then I'm trying my best. I've lost over 70 lbs , kept my diet , started reading books more and more, training 6 days a week, running and completely changing my lifestyle and mentality.  
  
I also did some gestures and I'm still doing that. But I don't know. I don't want to pressure her and I do care a lot about her. But also I don't want to quit doing what I'm doing now and I want to become better person in every aspect not just because of her but for my sake. I told her. I have time to wait and I don't want to meet new girls nor do I want anyone else in my life. People shouldn't be judged based on certain situations.

Maybe everything would be different if I was able to communicate to her that I burned out but I couldn't.",1,1729713086.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I enter the office reception desk at 7:50 am, I see a guy, early 30's, blue suit, brown shoes, talking to the receptionist. 

I had laptop bag, flowers, and some decorations in another bag in one hand and I had my coffee cup in the other hand.

I was so focused on watching my coffee cup that I wasn't looking in front of me, I walked right into that guy, making him lean over the reception counter and spilled my coffee over his back. I can't tell you how embarrassing that was!

The guy turned around and looked at me with his eyes wide open. I was continuously apologizing, he just said that it's fine. Then he asked me: you're the new hire, right? I said yes. He replied with: welcome to the company and have a good day, then left. 

Then the reception said that the guy I spilled coffee on is the CEO. I was about to start crying, I was super embarrassed and scared.

1 hour later, I got a call on my desk from reception saying go to the CEO's office after 2 hours. I don't have words to explain how scared I was during this 2 hours, I didn't even decorate my workplace because I thought I'll be fired.

I went in the office, shook his hand and sat down in front of him. There was already a cup of coffee ready for me, he said: 'Go ahead, coffee's for you; you couldn't enjoy the morning one. Don't worry about the morning, it happens, I understand that you were in a rush and probably anxious about your first day. Forget about it, all's good. Welcome to the firm.

1gaji1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gaji1i/is_this_reasonable_trade_career/,Is this reasonable? - trade career,"Hopefully I'm using the correct flair, first time poster, posting on behalf of my husband who wants Reddit's opinion...

My husband is an apprentice plumber (technically tradesman but isn't testing until he reaches journeyman hours), and has been with his current company for about two years doing commercial plumbing. Was previously in the medical field for 10+ years and got burned out. 

Company was recently sold by boss, who is now more of a supervisor role (I'll refer to him as supervisor). Husband has 3 coworkers, so it's a small operation. Work environment is generally toxic. Supervisor and his son (who is also sort of a supervisor, definitely a nepo-baby situation), who is one of the coworkers, regularly withhold information, go back on their word, things like that. Supervisor promised the new boss that he would make him 1 mil, all profit, in a year.
Recently has been commenting more and more about how much of the profit goes towards salaries... husband thinks salary is about to go away and pay is going to change to hourly.

When he took this job, he was told there would be travel. Fine. We weren't married yet, it wasn't a huge deal, supervisor seemed solid, it was alright. Since getting married, just by chance, he has not had to travel a whole lot. He is the only married one besides his supervisor.

We recently learned that they will be starting a ‚Äúrough in"" soon, which will be at least 3 months of work, and he will be gone during the week and come home weekends. The job is 4-5 hours away. Okay. Whatever. We came to terms with that. The pay is decent, and while he no longer likes his supervisor, he has become pretty good friends with one of his coworkers, which makes it tolerable. It wasn‚Äôt disclosed when he accepted the job that they would be gone for extended periods of time like this, it was made to sound like it was spread out. 

He was told last minute (typical), on Monday, that they would be going out of state almost 4 hours away to MOVE equipment/ appliances out of a chain coffee shop they frequently build (I'm not a plumber, I don't fully understand all of it ) because the location is closing. They've literally just been moving things out as a favor to the new boss. They've never worked at that location, ever. Today he finds out that they will be coming home tonight, to turn around and drive 5-6 hours tonight to go to a different location that they've never worked on prior, to fix someone else's mess. They will be there until Friday, to wait for the inspector. 

He's been a plumber for 3 years, he enjoys it, but his supervisor has made him resentful. He wants to leave, but he also sees opportunity at this company. I absolutely hate the travel, because you know, my husband and I actually like each other. Doesn't help that his boss is a misogynistic asshole. We're just trying to determine if we're being crybabies about this, and whether or not this is normal for this line of work.

May be worth noting: his per diem is $35 a day. Lodging paid for. 
As a government employee, when I need to travel, my lodging is also paid for, but my per diem is $59 a day. So yeah. üòê",1,1729712843.0,jobs,0,1.0,False
1gajhug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1gajhug/i_finally_found_some_plastic_ones_but_can/,I finally found some plastic ones... but can somebody please explain the premise of compostable compost bags to me? Am I an idiot?,"I have spent the last 5 months unable to find stores stocking plastic green bags. This has led to purchasing various brands of the newfangled compostable green bags.

Am... I an idiot? How do my fellow middle aged people succeed in using those things?

So, I put it in my bin, in the same way as my garbage. I usually take green waste out every 2nd Wednesday, so on Wednesday I remove the bag, tie it, and leave it on the floor as I do the same with my garbage. The normal ""green waste smell"" gets much stronger, I look at it and realize the bag has melted. Crap. Spilling out the bottom/sides.

The following Wednesday I think ""Hey I should switch to weekly with these bags"". I tie the bag, lift it from the bin, and the waste stays in the bottom as I fling wet slime on the ceiling as the bottom of the bag lets go suddenly.

That Sunday I remind myself that these bags degrade FAST so I tie it and pull it out... and the bottom of the bin is full of mostly watermelon liquids and some coffee grinds. ""OK, this is fun"", I rebag it and rinse out the bin. I install **FIVE** bags in the canister and basically forget about it until Wednesday night.

And on that Wednesday, every bag is pretty much soup.

I then proceeded to either throw the real goopy waste in my garbage can, or take DAILY trips to my compost pile since I can't have my collector pick up these bags. Yes, daily trips, and 3 brands of bag all had multiple occasions where they still were leaking despite really reserving the green bin for more dry food scraps and coffee grounds at this point.

So, as an adult, how often am I meant to take out my green waste? Do you all buy small bags and toss them 3 times a day? Do you layer them with something? Am I adulting properly and these bags are just utter garbage?

Just left a normal plastic green bag in the bin for 2 full weeks. It was getting near 15lb so I took it out, plus we tossed some expired fridge stuff so I knew it would smell the next day. Container is dry. Bag is solid, no leaks out the kitchen, stairs, or the long walk to my curb bin.

*I'll add a little more info for the people of the world who may be confused. Compost is picked up weekly, recycling and garbage alternate weeks. Compost must be in a transparent green bag, recycling must be in a transparent blue bag, garbage must be in a soft white or transparent bag. I can throw *anything* in the garbage, cardboard/plastic in the blue bags, and degradable scraps/paper towels in the green bags. If this disclaimer seems idiotic to you, know that segregated collection isn't done everywhere and some people may be legit confused reading this.*",1,1729712828.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

The problems started this morning at 10am when I injected 0.75mg and started feeling bloated. I had one pastry snd 2 coffees, then lunch (2 small cubes of Chicken, half a bowl of mushroom soup and 3 spoons of rice). I snacked on a handful of gummy bears and 5 slur belts candy, and 2 plums, and watermelon juice. At around 3pm after lunch and the candy, I started having sulfur burps (never had that before). 


At 6pm I started feeling sickly (bloated and slight nausea) and felt my stomach was so big. The diarrhoea began, pure liquid. It hurt a lot, and the burping worsened. This went on for 4 hours. 

At around 1030pm I went for a cigarette, burped a few times of acidic burps and felt queasy and then a few minutes later puked 3 mouthfuls of vomit (so gross, green stuff).  Couldn‚Äôt stop it (and I was at the public toilet at the Ritz, totally ruined my blazer and shoes as puke went everywhere, so embraasing.

Looking for a collagen supplement that packs a punch? I've been trying out the Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Vanilla Protein Powder, and it's been a game-changer for my daily routine.

This powder is loaded with five types of collagen from four different sources. I've noticed improvements in my skin, nails, and even my gut health since I started using it. The vanilla flavor is smooth and mixes well into my morning coffee or smoothies.

https://preview.redd.it/g72hynbz4kwd1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e34ee100a4f2ffce29fd1fcf43584a47bbad2349

What sets this collagen powder apart is its clean sourcing. The collagen comes from grass-fed cows, cage-free chickens, and wild-caught fish. Plus, it's packed with extra goodies like vitamin C and probiotics.

I appreciate that it's gluten-free and made without any nasty additives. Each scoop gives me 18 grams of protein, which helps keep me full and energized throughout the day.

# Bottom Line

If you're looking to boost your collagen intake, I think the Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Vanilla Protein Powder is a solid choice. It's easy to use, tastes good, and seems to deliver real results.



# Overview of Collagen Powder Protein by Ancient Nutrition

I've been using this collagen powder for a while now, and I'm impressed. It packs a punch with 20 grams of collagen and 18 grams of protein per serving. The vanilla flavor is smooth and mixes well in my morning coffee. I like that it's made from different collagen types from beef, chicken, fish, and eggshell. It's also grass-fed and pasture-raised, which is a plus. The added vitamin C and probiotics are nice touches. I've noticed my skin looks better, and my nails seem stronger. It's a bit pricey, but the quality seems worth it. The powder can be a little gritty sometimes, but it's not a deal-breaker for me. Overall, I think it's a solid choice for anyone looking to add collagen to their diet.

# Nutrient-Rich Profile

I was impressed by the collagen powder's nutrient profile. It packs a punch with multiple types of collagen peptides to support skin, nails, and gut health. The added vitamin C helps boost collagen production. I liked that it's gluten-free and comes in a tasty vanilla flavor. Each serving gives me 16.7 grams of protein, which is a nice boost to my daily intake. The powder mixes easily into drinks and smoothies. While it's not a complete protein source, it fills a specific niche for those wanting to add more collagen to their diet. I found it helpful for my skin and joint health, but it's not a miracle cure. The price is a bit high, but the quality ingredients seem worth it for the benefits I've noticed.

# Health and Beauty Benefits

I've been using this collagen powder for a while now, and I'm impressed with the results. My skin feels more elastic and firm, which is a big plus. I've also noticed my nails are stronger and growing faster. It's not just about looks though - the added vitamin C and probiotics support overall wellness. I mix it into my morning coffee, and it blends in smoothly without changing the taste. While it's a bit pricey, I think the mix of collagen types from different sources makes it worth it. The vanilla flavor is pleasant and not overpowering. I feel good knowing it's made from clean sources without hormones or chemicals. It's become a key part of my daily routine for looking and feeling my best.

# Gut Health and Digestive Support

I found this collagen powder really helped my digestion. It has 4 billion CFU of probiotics per serving, which is great for gut health. I noticed less bloating and smoother digestion after using it for a few weeks. The powder mixes easily into drinks without clumping. I liked adding it to my morning smoothie or coffee. It's unflavored, so it didn't change the taste of my drinks. The collagen blend comes from four animal sources, which may support the gut lining. I appreciated that it's made from clean sources without hormones or chemicals. While pricey, I felt the digestive benefits were worth it for me.

# Ease of Use and Versatility

I found this collagen powder simple to incorporate into my daily routine. It dissolves easily in both hot and cold drinks, leaving no clumps. I liked adding it to my morning coffee or smoothies. The vanilla flavor is mild and not overpowering. It blends well with other ingredients without altering their taste much.

One nice feature is its versatility. I used it in baking recipes and even stirred it into yogurt. The powder mixes smoothly, so I didn't have to worry about gritty textures. The scoop makes measuring quick and accurate.

While it's convenient, I did notice the powder can clump if not mixed thoroughly. A shaker bottle helps prevent this issue. Overall, I found many ways to use this collagen supplement in my diet with minimal fuss.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Protein Powder for a while now, and I've noticed some clear benefits and drawbacks. Let's break it down:

# Pros

* Versatile use: I can easily mix it into my morning coffee, smoothies, or even baked goods.
* Good flavor: The vanilla taste is smooth and not overpowering.
* Nutrient-packed: With 20g of collagen, 18g of protein, and added vitamin C, I feel like I'm getting a lot in each serving.
* Clean ingredients: I like that it's made from grass-fed, pasture-raised sources without hormones.
* Noticeable results: My skin feels firmer, and my nails seem stronger since I started using it.
* Digestive support: The added probiotics have been good for my gut health.

# Cons

* Price: It's a bit expensive compared to some other collagen powders I've tried.
* Texture: Some batches can be a bit gritty, which isn't great in drinks.
* Serving size: I need to use two scoops for a full serving, which means the container doesn't last as long as I'd like.
* Limited flavors: While vanilla is nice, I wish there were more options to choose from.

I've found this collagen powder to be a solid addition to my daily routine. The benefits for my skin, hair, and nails have been pretty clear. But the cost and occasional texture issues are things to keep in mind. It's not perfect, but it's been working well for me so far.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this collagen powder for a while now, and I'm impressed with the results. The vanilla flavor is mild and mixes well in drinks. Many users report improvements in skin elasticity, hair strength, and nail health. Some even claim it has helped with joint pain and gut issues.

Not everyone loves it, though. A few customers found the texture gritty or noticed a change in packaging size. The price is on the higher side, but most feel it's worth it for the quality and blend of collagen sources.

Overall, this Ancient Nutrition product gets high marks from users. With over 49,000 ratings and a 4.4-star average, it's clear that many people are happy with their purchase. As always, individual results may vary.

# Conclusion

I've been using this collagen powder for a while now, and I'm pretty impressed. It mixes well and doesn't have a strong taste, which is great. My skin feels firmer and my nails seem stronger. While it's a bit pricey, the quality is there. I like that it has vitamin C and supports gut health too. It's not perfect - some people might find it gritty. But overall, I think it's a solid choice if you're looking for a multi-collagen supplement. Just remember, results can vary from person to person.",1,1729711733.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

Just sharing something I wrote a few years back when I was going through it.  Let‚Äôs not forget to watch each other‚Äôs six.

=========

Christmas Day

Christmas Day 2018, I woke up to a dude knocking on my driver‚Äôs side window in a gas station car park in the backwoods of Pennsylvania.

‚ÄúDamn bro you spent Christmas Eve in your car?‚Äù

‚Ä¶.My mouth was dry and tasted like shit‚Ä¶ My eyes focused and my thoughts finally sobered up enough to give a response. ‚ÄúYeah mate. I was too fucked up to drive.‚Äù

A ridiculously large, half empty bottle of Jameson sat in my lap, which explained the charred chalky taste in my mouth. The guy laughed and offered me some coffee‚Ä¶

Now I can‚Äôt tell you what to do when you find yourself in such a situation, I can only share with you what I‚Äôve learned.  None of what I‚Äôm about to tell you is purposed to gain any kind of affirmation or recognition. Just needed to share something that went against the usual grain of my FB wall content of crass memes and vulgarities.

No one is a stranger to life being an absolute CUNT.  Difficult times can take its toll on your life and may even derail your plans. But one thing is definite about harsh times; it‚Äôs only and is always temporary. My sister taught me that.

Self-reflection and self-care are often hindered when your emotional health is co-dependent on another person. So please be aware of that moving forward.

I entered 2018 engaged to be married, and then by July I wasn‚Äôt.   
The best way to get over someone, is to be inside another, so by ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù my Australian accent, I went through a slut phase and sampled many of what North Eastern America had to offer, swiping my way through the Tri-State area. Each time, I tried creating a relationship with girl after girl.  Which in hindsight I knew was a bad idea.  But it was better than sleeping alone. And I don‚Äôt mean being physically in bed with someone. But going to sleep with the belief that you have someone to wake up to the next morning.  Needless to say it always ended badly. I convinced myself I was impervious to any pain, as long as I was prepared for it. Lesson number 1. I was not.

Around the same time, communication between my daughter and I started to dwindle. It became more difficult to get in touch with her and a response to any of my texts were seldom if not non-existent.  Her mum wasn‚Äôt helpful either and evidence of her exacerbating the divide between my daughter and I became clear.
Lesson number 2; When a woman I love ignores me, my heart breaks. When my daughter cuts communication with me ‚Äì I AM BROKEN.

November rolls around. I felt like a failure. I dubbed myself as the common denominator in why all my relationships end up failing. And I wore that title with a fine whisky stained robe, I hid behind, with dark humour and explicit tales of my debaucheries, to distract my audience from my collection of half empty liquor bottles.

In every aspect, my confidence was depleted. However I remained excellent at my work and never failed at being a good Motha‚Äô Fuckin‚Äô Marine. Oo-Rah!

Days were spent purposely drowning myself in work, often seeking more projects and responsibility. Countless accolades and praise from my chain of command served as a point of focus, to blur my vision on what was happening internally.

Intimacy became scarce despite the abundance of outlets I could reach out to. Sex was now a necessary labour. Coming became reduced to taking a girl doggy style and spitting on her back, following through with a pathetic performance of climax just for effect. Those who were on the pill were much easier to convince.

I grew fearful that I have successfully killed the one ultimate intimate act you could ever share with another human being. Lesson number 3; Sex does not equal intimacy.

December 2018; I returned home to Australia, and after an unsuccessful meeting with a mediator between my daughters mother and I, regarding the encouraging and facilitating of consistent communication with my daughter, I found myself longing for that empty embrace from my pseudo girlfriend/s back in Pennsylvania, only to arrive to the news that she had moved on and fucked some random guy because she was ‚Äúlonely‚Äù from my 2 week absence.
That was the tipping point for me.

December 23 2018 at 0200, there was a rapping at my chamber door ‚Äò‚ÄôTis some visitor,‚Äù I muttered, ‚Äútapping at my chamber door‚Äî Only this and nothing more.‚Äù Nah‚Ä¶It was the fucken cops, and I was awoken by the sounds of them trying to break down my door. Spotlights lit up the room as I was hunched over the kitchen table, drunk. It turns out I sent some pretty worrisome texts to a friend of mine which prompted him to call the police.

Needless to say, news of the police visit reached my chain of command, resulting in being command directed to see the Wizard. The wizard was an older Italian lady, probably in her 60‚Äôs with a thick New Jersey accent. I gave her my spiel and was unsurprisingly; declared a low-risk in harming myself, and was just scheduled a follow up after the Christmas Break.

December 23, 1600; our unit was dismissed and I made my way home for the Christmas holidays.  I left my phone in my car throughout the day so as soon as I got home my phone had exploded with notifications on IG, FB, YouTube and REDDIT. It turns out that I wrote a full manifesto on how I was going to end my life on Christmas day.  Messages from Marines, Soldiers ‚Äì STRANGERS, flooding my inbox.

I don‚Äôt remember writing it. I was too drunk to recall.
I responded to one of the messages. ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you and how did you get my IG?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrother, thank you for responding, a lot of us have been trying to reach you to make sure you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

He provided me with the link to my so-called farewell. And I might say, Drunk me is quite the word smith. Lol.

I deleted it immediately. My roommates at the time were preparing to travel home for the holidays, when there was another knock on the door. It was my Master Sergeant and another Staff Sergeant.
‚ÄúHey SSgt X, You need to come with us. The Colonel wants us to take you to Walter Reed‚Äù (Military Hospital in Maryland, a good 2 hours away).

Looking back at this memory, I remember protesting the idea, and making jokes about how the Marine Corps is turning into an institution of pussies. But now that I think about it, I felt ashamed that someone else‚Äôs Christmas plans were being fucked with because I couldn‚Äôt keep my shit contained.

I performed an encore of the song and dance I had staged previously, with the last wizard, much to the same effect as before. Low-Risk of self-harm.
Fuck yes. I was allowed to have my Christmas liberty 96. But more so, the Marines who took me, could proceed with their plans without any further disturbances from me.

Christmas Eve, 2018; I hastily rented an AirBnB. A cabin by lake Eerie. It cost me about $1500. I just needed it for one night. The liquor store in Harrisburg is conveniently close to the Home Depot. Purchases that day consisted of the following supplies for my impromptu road trip.

- A handle of Jameson
- A bottle of Crown Royal
- A garden hose
- Roll of duct tape

The drive to the cabin, through the wooded back roads of Pennsylvania is absolutely beautiful on a snowy day. Picturesque and peaceful. My mind was on auto pilot, taking large swallows of whiskey, wincing as I sharply inhaled to counter the burn in my chest as it finally settled at the bottom of my stomach.

I was running low on petrol and decided to pull up to a 24/7 service station in the middle of nowhere. There weren‚Äôt many cars apart from a couple of semi trailers and a mini van. The station was manned by an elderly black man. Speckles of white tufts peppered his unshaven cheeks. He had a soulful demeanour, the kind that only those stereotypical, cool black guys can pull off where they effortlessly make anyone else they come across, feel just as cool .

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold out there brotha, no way I can walk around in this cold with just that cardigan on. But hey you look fly so I get it dawg. Merry Christmas brotha.‚Äù He said with a deep receding laugh as I grabbed my beef jerky.

I sat in my car, further liberating the contents of the Jameson bottle.

People-watching. The last few customers at the service station reembarked onto their journeys.  I noticed the mini van again.  It hadn‚Äôt moved. The sliding doors were open with 3 small children no older than 9 years old between all of them, bundled up in layers of thick winter coats and blankets. The man whom I assumed was their father sat in the driver‚Äôs seat playing with his phone, periodically taking sips out of his coffee cup. The mother tended to the children as she struggled with the lid of the cup, gently blowing on the hot beverage to cool it down for the kids to drink. The children were too engrossed into their iPads, as the blue haze of the monitors lit up their eyes, to notice their mother offering them something to drink.   The view into the van windows were obstructed with mountains of bags and what looked like small furniture. Perhaps they were moving? Who fucken moves on Christmas Eve?

‚Ä¶.My mouth was dry and tasted like shit‚Ä¶ My eyes focused and my thoughts finally sobered up enough to give a response. ‚ÄúYeah mate. I was too fucked up to drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou crazy dawg! Hahaha. Come inside and get some coffee bro...On the house ma ‚Äòmayn. Merry Christmas!‚Äù

It took a while before coming to terms that my daughter was just growing up, and I eventually made peace with the idea that maybe her dad isn‚Äôt the person she wanted to reach out to at that time.
It took a while to admit to myself out loud that I was afraid of being alone. It took me even longer to admit, that I needed to be.

I continued to see the therapist from Jersey.  My daughter eventually started texting me and calling me again.

I woke up one day to a phone call from one girl I was hooking up with at the time. Verbatim, she said; ‚ÄúCome over and fuck me‚Äù.  I declined.  I think I made up an excuse about, how I‚Äôd love to, but having had to work, I wasnt able to.  But really‚Ä¶ I just had No. Desire. To.

A couple weeks later another girl whom I was occasionally with at the time, texted me.  Again, I declined.  This time without making up an excuse and just told her I didn‚Äôt feel like it. She did not like this response and so it ended there.

The idea of sex at that point was no longer a source of intimacy for me anymore. That feeling of ‚Äòwholeness‚Äô usually associated with laying with someone and tasting them upon your lips, just didn‚Äôt possess the same grandeur.  So I started doing things alone.  Though not on purpose, I remained abstinent. Just wasn‚Äôt in the mood.   And for the first time in my life, although alone‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt feel lonely.

It was about 5 months before I started dating again. But it was different. I was more confident. I felt that I could walk away from possible toxic situations if and when I wanted to. And I knew what I wanted and I knew who I was and what I brought to the table.

Since then, there has been many disappointments, but not heartache. There has been many failures, but not without growth. And quite honestly, I‚Äôve been happy ever since.

Again, I‚Äôm not here to tell people what to do in times of despair. I am merely sharing my experience on the chance that someone might read this and relate to some of it, and hopefully find some kind of clarity in a place where there wasn‚Äôt any...

It‚Äôs been a difficult year for everyone, but believe me when I say that it wont stay like that.

Stay frosty my friends.

Cheers.

1gaj076,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1gaj076/help_ctd_few_seconds_after_loading_a_save/,[help] CTD few seconds after loading a save,"As the title says, the game crashes a few seconds after I load a save, but no problems when creating a new one: I can play the game normally until I quit the game and try to reload the save. This is driving me crazy, I used CLA to analyze the crash logs and it said that it was a problem of RAM, but in that case the game would also crash when creating a save right?

I have tried many things, pagefile is set right, engine fixes too, it should work! Can it be a script running on save load that makes the game crash? In that case which one and how do I fix it? [Here is my load order and modlist](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/ctd-few-seconds-after-loading-a-save-2).

I couldn't upload the crashlog on loadorderlibrary so here it is:

This is June Lornelle from The Hillston Gazette and I found this old notebook and whoever wrote it was either crazy or‚Ä¶ I don't know it‚Äôs really weird. My little brother who‚Äôs on these forum things said I should talk to those here about it. I suppose to start, the notebook is one of those black and white composition notebooks that just says ‚ÄúTherapy Journal‚Äù on the front. Sounds normal right? Well, it gets *weird* and I'm not sure what I just read. Read for yourselves and see what you guys think.

Oct 3rd, 1991

¬†So I was told to buy one of these because its good to have something to track your thoughts and feelings in. Something like that. So I suppose I should start by saying everything's gone to shit and I'm starting therapy for it. My girlfriend left me for her ex, my car is totaled, and my rent is overdue. Oh yea, also my boss just called me a deadbeat and fired me. I worked there for 6 years and did everything right. I always did what I could to help those suited jackasses in their little offices, but me? I mopped and swept and wiped and cleaned everything for them! Hence the therapy, I even found a therapist already. I found her in a newspaper ad after my insurance had given me $1400 for the wreck and figured why the hell not? Her name is Dr. Anna Fruna . The Ad showed a small picture of what looked to be a woman but the printer or whatever for the newspaper must‚Äôve malfunctioned as the image had been horribly blurred. Underneath it said ‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù and listed a number. I hung on the word ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù for a moment before I called and set up an appointment with the secretary. She wouldn't give me a name which I thought was a little weird but didn't think twice about it.¬†

¬†The appointment which was set for tomorrow (which was really quick in my opinion). Buy yea, the appointment is set and i have a bottle of jack to get me to blissful sleep. I suppose I'll write tomorrow after the appointment.

¬†Ya know what? So what?! that weird lady walked out and *made* me swerve. I didn‚Äôt kill her so what's it matter. Like the lady was literally still up and walking around after I made the *obvious* decision to swerve so as not to hit her. And yet her broken arm was my fault as I barely walked out with 3 broken ribs and the police say, ‚Äúit's your fault for not *paying attention*‚Äù Like what the hell? And then I get 1400$ and a get well card? Whatever, I'll talk to that therapist tomorrow and see what she says. I doubt it'll be worth it though. Also, it may be just be the alcohol but looking at the picture of this therapist lady, I can almost make out a smile but the blurring almost makes it look like she's‚Ä¶drooling? Ah well, this lil notebook ain't too bad, I'll have to thank Ben for giving me the idea.

Oct 4th, 1991

¬†God my head, I‚Äôm drinking coffee to try to help but damn is it slow going. It‚Äôll have to do, just to have something in my stomach for now. I have to get ready for that appointment and I did remember seeing that drooling smile last night, looking again it's just the same old blurry smudged photo. Anyways, I'm gonna get ready for this thing.

Session notes

¬†¬†\-Can‚Äôt anyone ask how you're doing?¬†

¬†¬†\-My parent's death = cynicism?¬†

¬†¬†\-Blah blah blah, she‚Äôs going on about her family or something or other.

¬†Okay what the actual hell is wrong with that lady. The session was getting dry and quite boring to be honest. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we talked for the first 40 minutes and it seemed to be how I expected. The whole ‚Äúso what led you to seek therapy‚Äù and ‚ÄúOh? Tell me more about that‚Äù. Things went on like this for about 40 minutes (I kept looking at a wall clock she had in her office.) but then she started on about her family and I feel bad for getting bored. I really do. But it‚Äôs like the moment she started speaking of her family I was a kid again, listening to an adult conversation where I have no idea what 75% of the words meant. Then something took me out of my stupor.¬†

I heard something wet drip on paper. I snapped my head down thinking \*I\* had drooled or something but then i looked back up to see her quickly wipe her mouth. She clearly noticed because she said ‚ÄúOop, sorry that happens sometimes.‚Äù But when she spoke, I swear she sounded so happy. Not embarrassed or dissuaded by her biological slip up but happy. She then asked something that in that tone just sounded wrong.

‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù

Why, just why would you even ask that. I just told this lady how my life was falling apart at the seams and how my parents had died when I was kid and her one question after her own family rantings was ‚Äú*Are you happy?‚Äù* ?! What the hell!!! Of COURSE I‚ÄôM NOT HAPPY LADY.¬†

She asked again in that ecstatic tone ‚ÄúAre you? Are you happy Michael?‚Äù

My face cringed in abject disgust and said ‚ÄúNo Dr. Fruna, No i‚Äôm not.‚Äù

Her face dropped as she rose her head from behind that large Notepad that I just realized she had been trying to seemingly hide behind. ‚ÄúThats no good Michael, I‚Äôll need to change that‚Äù The tone had shifted, almost angry now.¬†

‚ÄúI-I guess so Doc, I‚Äôll be countin on ya.‚Äù I said trying to hold the nerves from my voice.¬†

I got up to leave pointing to the clock. ‚ÄúSorry, I just realized I had a job interview I have to be at now *heh*‚Äù I said, trying to leave without being disrespectful. She was hurriedly writing something on the notepad as she tore it out and handed it to me. It was an address, 446 Messer St. Confused, I looked at her.¬†

¬†‚ÄúCome here for our next session, okay? It‚Äôs my family's home and I‚Äôd like to have our session there. Tomorrow should be good, yes? I will say it‚Äôs quite comfortable, I'll have food and drink there so make sure to come hungry!‚Äù¬†

At this I realized how weird i was being, ‚ÄúAre you happy‚Äù isn't necessarily a weird question is it? She probably sounded like that so as not to sound pitying or too passive. ‚ÄúSounds good Doc! See you tomorrow.‚Äù And I swear as I left, I heard that same drip sound behind the closing door. *Drip drip drip*¬† 3 drips before the door closes, no longer allowing any sound to escape. I didn't realize when I was in there just how quiet it was. I guess if a patient yells or cries those in the hallways wouldn't want to hear. I walked out waving at the squat brown-haired girl at the desk and opening the front door I realized I hadn't paid much attention to the building as I walked in before. It's a plain 2 story concrete box with tall slits for windows. The door‚Äôs a plain wooden door with a large pane of glass in the top half.

I don‚Äôt know what I got from that but I suppose it felt good to talk about my parents at least. They've been gone for so long now I can barely remember what they looked like, just vague shapes with feelings attached to them. I just called Ben on a payphone and he said he‚Äôs down to hit the bar. The therapy was a lot cheaper than I thought it'd be so I can spare to buy a few rounds. Besides, I want to talk to Ben to see if his experience with therapy was similar.

¬†I'm at the bar, Ben‚Äôs not showing up. Gonna get started without him. It's a good thing i got this notebook though, it kinda feels nice to just talk my thoughts out like this.

What the fuck man, I just saw Ben walk by the bar with those suit dicks laughing. I have half a mind to go out there but this Budweiser smells so much like dad‚Ä¶ reminds me of when I snuck a drink of his beer and had to spit it out immediately it was so gross. Funny how things like that change. I miss my Mom and Dad‚Ä¶

Oct 5th, 1991

¬†I‚Äôm about to leave for today's appointment. Kind of feels weird to go to this lady's family home for what I assume will be a deep interrogation of my childhood. However, before I leave for that something weird happened last night I want to get written down and maybe I'll feel less crazy about the whole thing. On my walk home I had to stop for a moment because my heavy breathing started reminding me of my broken ribs. It was after about 2 minutes of standing in front of a darkened alley that I heard footsteps in front of me. I must‚Äôve been drunkenly wobbling because I could've sworn I had left room for people to walk past me on the sidewalk but he ended up bumping into me. I couldn't see much of the man, but he was tall and thin. His thin stature made me more confident in my stocky build as I hollered out.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHey jackass! Did you not see me?‚Äù

¬†¬†He continued walking when he replied calmly without turning ‚Äúwe‚Äôll keep a better eye out, sorry.‚Äù

I almost had said something about how it was just him, but he was even further now and I didn't feel like yelling out that loud and getting a public disturbance charge. So I walked home and realized my door was unlocked. I had thought my apartment had been broken into but nothing was missing. My non-importants were packed and ready for when my settlement ran out and couldn't pay rent any longer and nothing was missing. All I ended up finding was a thin handprint on my window. I couldn't tell if it was on the inside or outside but thought to call the cops nonetheless. I had to go downstairs to use the lobby payphone but doing so I called the cops, and they showed 20 minutes later obviously seeing that I was wasted. By the time we got upstairs and got to the window, I saw it had disappeared but there was something else as we walked in. I could've sworn I closed the door behind me. I must've been way more wasted than I thought because I blurted ‚ÄúShitfaced‚Äù loudly, making the younger of the two policemen jump.¬†

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù said the older cop. Guy must‚Äôve been a Lethal Weapon fan ‚Äòcause he sounded like he was doing a Murtaugh impression.

‚ÄúOh damn, sorry man. I just realized how messed up I am.‚Äù I responded slurring sheepishly.

Someone recommended test tubes or centrifuge vials, but that was still outside of my budget, and was worried about the possibility of oil becoming stuck in the plastic vials and potentially affecting flavor as it ages or slightly changing the flavor of the next roast.

I realized at some point that jars would be perfect and last forever. bought 24 40z ULINE jars for $1.10 each ($0.80 if you get a plastic lid). I considered buying the 20z jars, which would perfectly hold a dose each, but it nearly doubled the cost, and having 2-day doses is plenty for me. 

I keep the box of jars in a drawer near my espresso machine. Shipping was expensive, but I suppose that is to be expected with 24 glass jars.

By now, Fen was getting rather tired of waking up in strange locations with intense pain all through her body.



She didn't even bother sitting up in shocked surprised. She wearily opened her eyes and stared at the paneled ceiling for a few minutes. Her body felt like she had a sunburn all over. It stung and ached and felt hot and hurt. She just hurt.



Fen sighed and sat up on her elbows and looked around. She was in a stateroom - on a ship probably; if she had to guess it's was Gord's ship - laying on a bed. She looked down at herself and - oh. Her entire body was bright red, like she had a burn. That explains the sting at least. Next to the bed was a side table with a bottle of water and a aloe dispenser.



""Hey, is anybody home? Nanites? Vel? Han'iel's nanites?"" She thought. No reply. Best not to worry about it now. Fen finished sitting up and applied the aloe to all of her exposed skin. She felt more slippery but it didn't really stop the pain. After the aloe had dried, she got up and tried walking around the room. It was small and spartan, but clean. Just as she was about to step out and explore more, the door opened and Chloe stepped in.



Fen was startled and took a step back. Chloe's tall body, long hair, and severe look was intimidating, but in the back of her mind, Fen had noticed that when she was Empress it didn't bother her as much. She wondered if the nanites - in addition to giving her vocal language and body language skills - had given her some kind of boost in confidence as well. ""Fen, you're awake."" It wasn't a question.



""Uh, yes Chloe... how long has it been?""



""About eight standard hours since Gord brought you onboard.""



""About that,"" Fen looked around the room. ""Where am I? I'm not on my yacht.""



""That is correct. You're onboard our ship. When it's automated it's called *Birches*.""



Fen sat on the bed. She was still very tired. ""That's an unusual name.""



Chloe shrugged. ""Gord picked it. It was some kind of tree I think. Are you well enough to move around? Gord thinks you should have some food. He's cooking dinner in the canteen.""



""Gord can *cook?*"" Fen didn't mean to sound so surprised, but it slipped out. It did make Chloe smirk though.



""I'm told Gord is an excellent cook... so long as you stick to the foods he's skilled at preparing. Remember, he's the oldest one of us, he's had time to practice."" Chloe extended her hand to Fen to help her up.



Warily, Fen took her hand. It was so warm! Chloe's persona is one of cold detachment so Fen had kind of thought that her body would be cold as well. With her help, Fen made it down the hall of the small ship to the canteen.



As they approached, a sweet smell emanated from the canteen, with a smoky undertone. It smelled familiar to Fen and when she opened the door, she saw Gord at the stove, fussing over some bacon. He turned and waved. ""Fen! Glad you could join us. The bacon is nearly ready and the waffles are keeping warm in the oven. I have coffee too if you'd like.""



Fen hadn't realized how hungry she was until she smelled the food cooking. She sat at the table and Gord brought over a large plate of food and a mug of coffee. Next to it was a small squeeze bottle of maple syrup. ""The real stuff too! I do have standards after all."" Gord said, laughing.



It was delicious. Fen wasn't sure if it was the food, or her recent trauma, or everything all together, but she was sure she hadn't had a meal this good in decades. ""Gord, this is amazing, where did you get it? I didn't think AIs ate. Why would you have bacon?""



Gord sat down across from her with a plate of his own food. Chloe sat as well, but only had a cup of coffee. ""We don't have to eat, but many of us choose to. We might be our own people and have our own traditions, but we were built by humans first and have quite a few human traits. Many of us have taste receptors, so why not use them? It's less efficient of a source of energy than a mini reactor, but we can still turn the food into energy, kilocalories and kilocalories after all. Besides, the bacon is artificial and stores well, and the waffle mix is powdered. Kept sealed and away from air, it lasts a long time.""



Fen was barely listening. She was too occupied eating.



After breakfast, Fen offered to clear the table, but Gord wouldn't hear of it. ""You're our guest Fen, please allow me."" Chloe got up with him, and they both loaded the dishwasher and cleaned the surfaces while Fen sat and nursed her second coffee. After they had finished cleaning they sat back down. ""Fen."" Gord said. ""The K'laxi nanites fought the Builder Nanites in your body.



""Yes, I know. While I was under the three of us... had a discussion.""



""Did you?"" Gord raised an eyebrow. ""Interesting. Well, let's hear it from your side then. What did you learn?""



Fen told Gord and Chloe about their discussion and how long the K'laxi nanites had been active as well as their reaction to her original Builder nanites. ""I took the neck snapping to mean that they had succeeded in defeating them, and since I'm still alive I assume that means you and Chloe were able to save my physical body too."" Fen took a sip of coffee as she finished.



Gord looked at Chloe, who nodded. ""Tell her, Gord.""



Fen's blood ran with ice at that. ""Tell me *what*?""



""Aw jeez."" Gord leaned forward and rubbed his hand on his forehead. ""I was hoping to wait a bit until you got your strength back before bringing it up.""



""*Bring what up, Gord*?"" Fen's face was trying at the same time to look intimidating but also hiding how frightened she is.



Then, Fen was in a room. This one was stark white, with bright overhead lights and machinery crowding one corner. Indicator lights blinked and bits of equipment beeped happily at other bits. Sticking out of the center of the machinery about a meter was a long oblong sphere, like a lozenge. It was... different than the other equipment. Where the machinery seemed thrown together and ad-hoc, this was much more... weighty. Smooth corners, thick walls, it was clearly something meant to last a long time.



It's a hibernation cabinet.



Fen walked over to the cabinet, shakily. When she touched the top, it felt cold, like the insulation of the cabinet was holding back a terrible chill. Set into the top was a small, clear, thick window. She knew what was going to be in there, but she had to look. *She had to.* She got on her tiptoes and looked inside.



Fenchurch Whitehorse, Empress of Humanity (former) was inside; her eyes shut, her hair shaved, and fully half her skull covered in electrodes and wires. Dried blood was around her lips, nose, and ears. As if to drive the point home, a rime of frost framed her face. She looked so tired.



""I'm sorry Fen."" Gord and Chloe appeared behind her. ""When you were told that removing the nanites was most likely fatal, you were right. When I tried with the anti-nanite gas back on Home a couple of years ago, I wasn't sure if it would work - or if you'd survive. For what it's worth, I'm glad it didn't work and you and Zhe didn't die then."" Gord said, softly.



""I-I-if I'm in there,"" she pointed. ""Then how am I *here*?""



""Fen, we're experts in minds."" Chloe said. ""Human brains are different from AI brains, but only *slightly* different. You're running on... outboard processing.""



*""Outboard processing?""*



""Er, I assume you noticed the wires? We're running you in most of the machinery around the hibernation cabinet. We need your body to do it, but mostly as a bootstrapper. Ninety percent of **you** is in the machinery.""



Fen's legs felt rubbery. She put her hand back to steady herself, and... sat heavily into the couch in her apartment. Gord and Chloe looked around. ""This is your old place."" Gord said, with a touch of surprise. ""You know, it usually takes a while for humans to be able to do that.""



""Except when they're on the verge of a panic attack and start jumping around to places of comfort."" Chloe said, glaring at Gord. ""I told you she wasn't going to like it.""



""You also said to tell her."" Gord pointed out.



""Just because I said to tell her doesn't mean you had to show her the cabinet. It must be frightening for a human to see themselves like that.""



""Probably, though I've known a few in my day that would have moved Heaven and Earth to be running like Fen is now.""



""Gord."" Fen said quietly.



""There you go again, Gord, bringing up things that happened thousands of years ago. I swear you do it just to win any conversation. 'On a long enough timeline' bullshit."" Chloe was fully ignoring Fen now.



""Gord."" Fen said, louder.



""Don't even give me that Chloe, you're nearly as old as I am. You were a Starjumper before the wormhole generators same as me, and you even got to see my hometo-""



""**GORD**!"" Fen's voice cracked as she shouted.



""Oh, sorry Fen, what's up?"" Gord had the decency to look sheepish.



""What happens now?""



""The hibernation cabinet has slowed - though not stopped - the nanomachine war in your body. We did it to buy time, to try and figure out what to do before you died of heatstroke, or were accidentally consumed in their need for mass and energy."" Chloe said, sitting across from Fen, ""That worked, but it's only bought time. We still need to figure out what to do about them - or if one of them wins - what to do about the winner.""



Gord sighed and sat in the other chair next to Chloe - Ma-ren's chair. ""There's also the matter about your implant.""



""My implant?"" Fen sat up straighter and her eyes went wide She could feel the adrenaline be injected into her blood. ""I don't have an implant.""



Chloe and Gord shared a look that went over Fen's head. ""You do, Fen. It looks freshly installed.""



*""Careful not to pull your stitches""* Han'iel said when he woke her up when she was strapped to the table. So that's what he meant.



""What kind of implant is it?""



Another cryptic look between Gord and Chloe. Now that she knew where she was, Fen could have sworn that there was a sensation of energy passing between them. Maybe they were having a private conversation.



""Fen"" Chloe's face was surprisingly soft. The intimidating stare was gone. She reached out and patted Fen's hand. ""That's the other reason you're in hibernation. It's an antimatter bomb.""



Fen stood up so quickly the coffee table flipped over. ""We have to link somewhere! Anywhere! I need to talk to Ma!""

1gais4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gais4d/five_weeks_caffeinefree/,Five weeks caffeine-free! ,"I‚Äôm five week caffeine free! I‚Äôm 41, drank coffee daily since I was a teenager, usually 1-2 cups. 

I had tried to switch from coffee to matcha tea for two months a year ago, but it didn‚Äôt improve my life at all and just made it worse, so I had went back to coffee. 

I quit cold turkey. I had to because suddenly caffeine was giving me sinus headaches with blurry eyes that would last for hours. So I didn‚Äôt have the option to taper off, and didn‚Äôt have the option to keep drinking any caffeine. 

Week 1: Bad headaches and crankiness, constipation

Week 2: Exhaustion, still difficulties with digestion

Week 3: So thirsty all the time! start to notice better focus, easier time to wake up.

Week 4: Hungrier than usual, and wanting more regular sugar when I normally had none. Better focus remains, energy levels are now steady through the day (no more afternoon slumps!), I now sleep an hour less than before but wake up refreshed, happier overall with an ongoing sense that ‚Äúall is well‚Äù 

Week 5: I‚Äôm realizing that my reliable energy levels and happiness are my new normal, starting to adjust my life with that ü•≥

I was already taking vitamin D3 and C and magnesium before quitting and continued, which I think really helped. I also had been taking lavender oil pills, which I also think helped with the transition. 

For the digestion I was already taking digestive enzymes and phazyme before. I added aloe vera and probiotics for the digestion on week 3, which help although digestion is still an ongoing process since I‚Äôve been having issues with it for many years. It‚Äôs actually my main hope and goal either quitting caffeine, that my digestion will improve over the next several months. 

My best advice for anyone thinking of quitting is to be patient in the process. Yes there are headaches, but it‚Äôs just a few days and then they‚Äôre gone. Accepting that some things will have to change for the beginning period and accepting that as a part of the process will really make a difference, rather than fighting with keeping everything else the same. It‚Äôs ok to adjust your life temporarily. 

My next advice is to find solutions to whatever comes up for you. If by week three you have xyz issue, look for supplements or other solutions for those things, it helps. 

I‚Äôm very happy I quit, and I can‚Äôt wait to see all the improvements to come in the future! ",10,1729711013.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

I recently tried out Revlon's Super Lustrous Lipstick in Pink In The Afternoon. This classic shade caught my eye, and I wanted to see if it lived up to its reputation.

When I applied it, I noticed how smooth and creamy it felt on my lips. The color was a soft, flattering pink that gave my look a nice boost. I liked that it didn't dry out my lips like some other lipsticks I've used.

https://preview.redd.it/6pe5na5x1kwd1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43cb30252bfa90da1c1f321fb921a69408a98d62

The pigment was rich, and I only needed one swipe for good coverage. I found it lasted a few hours before I needed to touch up. While it's not the longest-wearing lipstick I've tried, it was easy to reapply.

One thing I really liked was how it made my lips look fuller. The creamy formula seemed to smooth out fine lines, which was a nice bonus.

# Bottom Line

If you want a classic lipstick that's comfortable to wear, Pink In The Afternoon is a great choice. Its creamy formula and flattering color make it worth trying out.



# Overview of Revlon Lipstick, Pink In The Afternoon

I recently tried this Revlon lipstick and was impressed by its creamy formula. The color is a soft, wearable pink that's perfect for everyday use. It glides on smoothly and feels moisturizing on my lips. I noticed it helped minimize the look of fine lines, giving my lips a fuller appearance. The pigment is rich but not heavy, which I liked. It lasted a few hours before I needed to reapply. While it's not totally smudge-proof, it held up well through my morning coffee. I found the packaging sleek and easy to use. For the price, I think it's a good value. If you're looking for a versatile pink lipstick, this one is worth checking out.

# Luscious Comfort

I was amazed by how smooth and creamy this lipstick feels on my lips. It glides on like butter, leaving my lips feeling soft and moisturized. The formula contains 80% conditioning ingredients, which really shows in how comfortable it is to wear all day. I didn't experience any dryness or flaking.

While it's not the longest-lasting lipstick I've tried, it does hold up well for several hours before needing a touch-up. The color payoff is impressive - it's rich and vibrant without feeling heavy. My lips looked fuller and the shade complemented my skin tone nicely.

One small downside is that it can transfer a bit when eating or drinking. But the ease of reapplication makes up for this. Overall, I found it to be a high-quality lipstick that feels luxurious despite its affordable price point.

# Luxurious Color

I was really impressed by the rich pigmentation of this Revlon lipstick. The color payoff is amazing - it's bold and vivid without being too heavy. I found that one swipe gave me full, even coverage. The shade ""Pink in the Afternoon"" is a beautiful warm pink that brightens up my face. It has a creamy texture that feels smooth on my lips. I like that it's not patchy or streaky when I apply it. The color lasts for several hours before fading evenly. I did notice some transfer when drinking, but that's normal for a creamy lipstick. For the price, I think the color quality is excellent. It looks more expensive than it is.

# Soft, Fuller-Looking Lips

I found this lipstick glides on smoothly, leaving my lips feeling soft and looking fuller. The creamy formula is packed with conditioning ingredients that moisturize without feeling heavy. I noticed it helped minimize fine lines around my mouth. The color payoff is rich and vibrant, but still feels lightweight. While it doesn't last all day through eating and drinking, it's easy to reapply. I like that it comes in a wide range of shades to suit different skin tones and occasions. For the price, I think it delivers good quality and a flattering look. Just keep in mind it may transfer a bit, so be careful when wearing light-colored clothes.

# Shade Variety

I was impressed by the color options for this Revlon lipstick. The ""Pink In The Afternoon"" shade I tried is a lovely soft pink that's perfect for everyday wear. It's part of a big lineup of 72 total colors, which is great for finding just the right match. I noticed they added 12 new shades recently too. The range covers lots of pinks, reds, nudes, and bolder colors. While I liked the shade I picked, I wish there were a few more options in the coral family. Still, most people should be able to find colors that work well for them.

# Pros and Cons

This lipstick has a lot going for it, but it's not without a few drawbacks. I've been using it for a while now, and here's what I've found:

# Pros

* The color is rich and vibrant. I was impressed by how well it showed up on my lips.
* It feels smooth when I put it on. The creamy formula glides easily without tugging.
* My lips feel soft and moisturized after wearing it all day.
* The price is great for the quality. I think it's a good value.
* There are tons of shades to pick from. I like having so many options.

# Cons

* It doesn't last as long as some other lipsticks I've tried. I have to reapply after eating or drinking.
* The packaging feels a bit cheap. The cap sometimes comes loose in my bag.
* Some of the lighter shades can be a bit sheer. I need to apply a few coats for full coverage.
* It can transfer onto cups or clothes if I'm not careful.

I found the Pink in the Afternoon shade to be a pretty, wearable color for everyday use. It's not too bold, which I like for work. The lipstick doesn't dry out my lips, which is a big plus. While it's not perfect, I think it's a solid choice for the price.

# Customer Reviews Quality Analysis

I analyzed thousands of customer reviews for this Revlon lipstick and found them to be highly informative. Many users praised the creamy texture and vibrant color payoff. The lipstick seems to apply smoothly and provide good coverage. Some reviewers noted it wasn't as long-lasting as other formulas, but still held up well for everyday wear. A few people had trouble finding their perfect shade match online. Overall, customers were very satisfied with the quality and value for the price. The 4.5-star average rating across over 30,000 reviews speaks to the lipstick's consistent performance. Based on the reviews, this seems like a reliable drugstore option for those seeking a comfortable, pigmented lip color.

# Customer Reviews Color Satisfaction

I've noticed many buyers are thrilled with the color choices of this Revlon lipstick. The Pink in the Afternoon shade is a hit, giving lips a soft, rosy glow. Some users love how the color pops without being too bold for everyday wear. I found that the pigmentation is strong, needing just one or two swipes for full coverage. A few reviewers mentioned they got different shades and were equally pleased. The creamy formula seems to enhance the color payoff, making lips look fuller and more vibrant. While most are happy with their color pick, a small number of customers felt their chosen shade didn't match the online description perfectly. Overall, the wide range of colors and their true-to-picture appearance left most buyers satisfied with their purchase.

# Conclusion

I've found this Revlon lipstick to be a solid choice for everyday wear. The creamy formula glides on smoothly and keeps my lips feeling soft and moisturized. While it may not last through heavy eating or drinking, it holds up well for normal daily activities. The pink shade is flattering and versatile. For the price, this lipstick delivers good quality and color payoff. It's not perfect, but it's a reliable option that I reach for often. If you're looking for an affordable lipstick with a comfortable feel and pretty color, this one is worth trying.",1,1729710692.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False
1gaimc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1gaimc0/i_dont_feel_bad_for_people_who_are_abusive_to/,I don‚Äôt feel bad for people who are abusive to animals and get consequences. (Aggressive and triggering rant),"This opinion could be controversial but honestly bro, idc. I know I can‚Äôt be the only one. Wild animals are not pets, entertainment, and toys. This post is for you Harambe, and every other animal who‚Äôs been wronged.

Mentions of Death, animal abuse, and animal attacks.

I‚Äôve head emotherfuckingenough of bitches mistreating animals. I‚Äôm sick of the pale ass clear as a water bottle ass crusty slut muffin. Instabeauty wanna be whores‚Ä¶ that wanna post a picture next to a fucking Bison. Acting like it‚Äôs some cute kitten in the adoption agency. Then people get mad when the Bison gives them the most respectfully beautifully placed high five with their ramming heads right into the influencer. And you know what? I don‚Äôt feel a single slice, pinch, crumb, tablespoon, teaspoon, or blood cell of sympathy. You played Jumanji and lost. That was your choice to roll those dice. 

The only people I feel bad for. Is their families. I feel fear for the animal who might face death due to their actions. That‚Äôs literally it. 

I‚Äôm sick of people owning fucking pets they shouldn‚Äôt. Bestie I mean this so disrespectfully, a chimpanzee isn‚Äôt a baby bunny. That‚Äôs a whole ass chimp who can and will rip your face off like a weave. And then because of course it‚Äôs the animals fault right? Now they‚Äôre put down for being brought into a situation they had no say in.

I‚Äôm sick and fucking tired of people buying animals without doing a god damn second of a google search of research. The amount of stupidity I‚Äôve seen in the vet clinic as an assistant. Is truly unreal. Had a man who had in the span of a year own 4 English Bulldogs. He‚Äôd come in for the puppy check up. We‚Äôd ask about the previous pet. ‚ÄúOh he/she died.‚Äù Until finally he said the following direct fucking quote ‚ÄúI just leave them outside, and they die I don‚Äôt understand. These dogs are expensive and I can‚Äôt even leave them outside.‚Äù Of course police were called. But they can‚Äôt amount to a popsicle in the ass that he got to go home with the dog. Yea let that sink in real quick.

Kids will watch Nemo and go I want a Nemo I want a Dory. And parents not fucking doing research and realizing that Dory needs a tank thats massive. And parents go on yes baby coming right up Nemo, Marlin, and Dory served up in the toilet bowl. 


I‚Äôm sick and fucking tired of animals being entertainment. Animals aren‚Äôt here for your entertainment. If you want entertainment watch Adam Lamberts music video ‚Äúfor your entertainment‚Äù and leave the fucking elephants alone. I will never forgive nor forget what happened to Tyke the elephant. I won‚Äôt forgive what happened to Mevy, Janet, and apollo either. Leave them in the fucking wild.


I‚Äôm sick of fucking ‚Äúpet stores‚Äù and puppy mill like places. I‚Äôm sick of big complains not caring about animals. I‚Äôll never forget that one Petco that didn‚Äôt evacuate or help the animals in the flood. Causing countless animals to die locked in cages. I‚Äôm sick of these pet stores when I see on my feed on socials‚Ä¶ people finding live Beta fish in the fucking dumpster.


I‚Äôm sick of animal abuse not being taken serious. And frankly and this is the really controversial opinion. If you can‚Äôt proper care for pets. You can‚Äôt be trusted to take care of kids. And yes they are two different things. Bestie a dog is way easier to deal with than a kid. If you can‚Äôt handle that responsibility. No baby for you. I‚Äôm sick of people getting charged with the same crimes animal abuse crimes and still have pets. It makes me so fucking sick.


Fuck animal abusers, I hope you can‚Äôt sleep at night. I hope you can‚Äôt find the start of your tape. I hope you‚Äôre always out of toilet paper. I hope everything you want in the house is either up or down stairs. I hope you‚Äôd stub your toe twice a day. I hope your partner cheats on you. I hope your shoelaces keep coming untied. I hope the fan cuts off in the night waking you up. I hope you never find the matching pair of socks. I hope you can‚Äôt cut anything with children‚Äôs scissors you childish ass bitch. I hope the bottom of your shoes keeps coming off. I hope when you buy a designer shoe or bag it‚Äôs counterfeit. I hope you never have coffee or tea in your kitchen. I hope no one changes the toilet paper roll. I hope you can‚Äôt find your phone charger. I hope all your headphones in a week need to be angled properly for them to work. I hope you can‚Äôt find your other ear pod. I hope the stop light is always red. I hope your hairdresser and or nail tech fires you. Hope it rains on your wedding day. I hope you can never find the keys or remote. 

I said what I said. And in the first vent portion I mentioned my fellow white people. And that‚Äôs because we seem to be the worst offenders when it comes to owning or interacting with wild animals. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs all of us but it‚Äôs enough where it‚Äôs noticeable.

Victim: me, m20
Subject: her, f21 girl from my college class

Ok let me explain why I need help first.
I'm new to dating and don't have much experience, I only went out with 2 girls and that's it. No sexual experience(yet :)) ), and before this I was in a short lived friends to somewhat romantic long distance relationship but it didn't last and I was less... Me. So bear with me.

I've got a serious crush again on a girl in my class. She's like exactly what I want(at least from what I know). Problem is I think she might not like me but I still wanna pursue her. You see it was a while since I really felt a crush and now I wanna go for it really hard. I'm afraid of coming off too pushy or to aggressive so how do I go about it?

I've been the one initiating all convos up until now irl. You might say she's not interested and you wouldn't be wrong but you wouldn't be right either. We do have like 3 fucking hobbies and shit in common(not shit in common :)) but like SHIT in common like I mean our interests match up so fucking much). And she's hot as hell. But get this I didn't even care for that until now after I got to talk to her and find out what she likes. Before I was thinking she's hot now I'm thinking she's gf material. You get me? I fucking want her. That's how it feels.

But how do I approach this. Also she confuses me. I think she's estj which is my type.
POINT IS, yesterday I asked her to go together for some coffee today but she said she has to catch her train(the time Window I proposed is after a class today). But after this we still talked for like 10 more minutes and she didn't act weird about me asking her so wtf do I do.
Also she doesn't really reply a lot to texts which is not good but irl she likes to talk to me and has actively participated in all our convos. Plus I feel she deliberately sat next to me or close to me in class before the prof arrived so I'll go talk to her.


Now I know my intention is there but my execution is kinda sloppy/quirky and I can't force her to like me even tho I like her. But I don't wanna give up yet.

So I need all the entp brain power I can get to einstein this whole ass situation cause I'm fucking INVESTED.

By the time I got back to TQ, three or four weeks had passed. The boys came to pick me up, which was a nice gesture, I appreciated avoiding a helicopter ride.

I had new clients waiting for my sexy mercenary skills when I got back. Our task force had a Psyops team. They needed a Joe to be the gunner on their vehicle for a few weeks while they their guy was on leave. I was fresh from party time and as hooah as could be, so I was a perfect candidate.

The Psyops guys were cool dudes. The driver was a jacked E-4, and he was trying to recruit students for a martial arts class he wanted to teach at the Corregidor gym. He wanted me to go, but I never took him up on it. I did not go to the gym on Corregidor. I went to the one next to the battalion aid station/motor pool so I could watch my Primary Care Physician deadlift a humvee. 

During my time with them, they were mostly going out the civil affairs team; they had speakers on their humvee to blast messages out in Arabic for the people‚Äîor taunts at the enemy, whatever the situation called for. It was one way of spreading messages to people when there were no other means of mass communication.

My first Psyops mission was a meeting with locals at a school in Viet Ram. We drove out there in a convoy with the Civil Affairs team. This was my first time going on a mission without anyone that I knew. That was unnerving enough, but these were also non-infantry types, and I had absolutely no idea how they would react if we got into a firefight. The clench factor was high on this first one.

We got to the school and to my relief there were Manchu‚Äôs there. I do not know which company had a Combat Outpost out there at the time, but they were providing security, so I relaxed a bit. The Civil Affairs guys did not seem worried as they took of their body armor and left it and their weapons in the humvee when they went into the school.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck are they doing?‚Äù I asked the driver.

‚ÄúThe Civil Affairs guys take off their gear, so they will not intimidate the civilians. They want us to drop our gear, but we keep our weapons on us to protect them.‚Äù

They would have to pry my M4 from my cold dead hands before I put it down out here in Viet Ram‚Äî or anywhere outside the wire. I hated every part of what we were doing, but good soldiers follow orders, so I stayed reticent and approached Iraqi civilians with my precious vital organs exposed.

Every single person that came to meet with us wanted reimbursement for something. They never blamed us for the damage directly, they always said it was insurgents. ‚ÄúAn insurgent shot my goat.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn insurgent mortar damaged my house.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn insurgent blew up the water tower.‚Äù 

There were no insurgent attacks happening anywhere in our AO currently, except in this one neighborhood, and exclusively targeting private property. Fog of war and all that I suppose. I was not sure if this was a backlog or if it was all recent events.

Until this point, I had only been this close to civilians in Mula‚Äôab when AQI still controlled it. Even the ones who were not hostile were mostly too afraid to approach us. This was the first time kids approached me without throwing a rock. 

Jundis were lounging in lawn chairs with their weapons slung, drinking tea. It was a relaxed atmosphere. The locals did not seem to be worried anything would happen, which is always reassuring. This was still too informal for me. I wanted to put my body armor back on and climb behind the the 50.

Eventually, every grifter in Sufiya had received their pound of flesh, and we headed back to base knowing that we had won ‚Äúhearts and minds.‚Äù I was jaded and not seeing the big picture at all.

The next psyop mission was a cordon and knock in Viet Ram. It was miserable‚Äî this was early summer, and this mission occurred mid-day. It was an all-day mission roasting in the gunner's turret while the Jundi‚Äôs and Public Affair types went house to house kissing babies and shaking hands with the locals.

This was the worst mission I did in Iraq. I had no idea how long this mission was going to be when we left; I did not properly hydrate prior, I did not bring enough water, and the water I did have was just a tad shy of boiling. I could not even enjoy my Marlboros because my mouth was so dry. I had a random NCO or two approach and offer me water, but it wasn‚Äôt any better than what was in my camelbak. I wanted to die.

I was there pull security but there were soldiers and Iraqi police everywhere now. There were Jundi‚Äôs and Joes dismounted on both sides of the convoy, and this was a very friendly area. We were not the kind of soft target the insurgents typically go for. The fact that I was not needed at all made the ordeal that much worse. It was a long, hot, miserable day, and a successful mission.

They loved us in Sufiya now. I understood now why tower four on COP never took fire; tower four faced towards our friends here. That is why we never saw anything but sheep herders and kids' soccer games from that position.

We did meetings with locals in various other locations over the course of the few weeks I was with them. One was at OP Mula‚Äôab‚Äî the one with the maintenance pit I had fallen into back in December. This was my first time back, so I walked over and peeked at the hole in the daylight hours for the first time and was surprised by how steep it was. OSHA would vomit if they saw that.

The locals fed us kebabs with some mysterious meat in it. I ate it, against my better judgement. It was delicious and it triggered immediate and painful diarrhea. I asked about a latrine, and I was directed to a room in the back with a hole in the floor. It was a spacious room, concrete walls, and concrete floor with a little hole. There was nothing else in the room, completely empty. Just a hole in a floor.

I found myself at this same damned gas station, squat shitting mystery meat into a hole on the floor and wondering if I had pissed off a gypsy at some point; or this gas station was built on some sacred burial ground perhaps‚Äî some type of dark magic was afoot. I did not have any toilet paper, so I had to use one of my boot socks to wipe my ass and then put my bare foot back into my disgusting boot and do the walk of shame. I am Joes last shred of dignity.

Some days, I was on Camp Ramadi getting delicious, iced coffee from Coffee Bean with the Air Force hotties, and then some days I spent out here, like this‚Äî as they say, experiences may differ in the GWOT.

I‚Äôm feeling very full and while I know I will want to eat before I start my fast again at 5 (will be having a turkey wrap and a salad for about 400 calories) as long as I am within my personal goals and the foods I am choosing to eat are healthier does it matter how much?

1gaibsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1gaibsx/info_for_first_time_cruisers_celebrity_eclipse/,Info for First time cruisers! Celebrity Eclipse with Shellfish allergy,"We're back from our first cruise, on the Celebrity Eclipse to the ABC Islands, so I'll put lots of details for anyone reading who will be taking their first cruise, since I know I had A LOT of questions before we left. This was a repositioning cruise out of Boston, ending in Fort Lauderdale. First, embarkation in Boston was quick and easy. We arrived at about 1pm and pretty much walked right on the ship. We checked our bags and was told they'd be in our rooms within a few hours. 

We had booked the cruise just a few weeks before we left, so had to sign up for the only dining slot available, at 8:30pm. Since we're usually in bed asleep by 10pm, that didn't work for us, so upon arrival, we went to guest services to request a change to the 5:30pm seating. They said they'd see what they could do and to go to the 830pm seating for that night, and they'd give us any updates the next day. From there, we then headed to the buffet for a late lunch, which was available until 2:30pm.  After lunch, we headed back to our room and our luggage was there waiting for us. Our room steward greeted us and we had pre-ordered a pack of bottled waters from the Celebrity app when we booked the cruise, and that was also already in our room for us. 

That night, at the Main Dining Room, we found out that they'd also put us at a large table big enough for about 10 couples. This was a much needed relaxation vacation for my husband, so we also then requested a table for two, in addition to an earlier seating time. And, then we went for a quick bite in the buffet (quick because it was past 8:30pm by that point, and we were too tired to eat. lol).  

The next day we had a note delivered  from the MDR saying we now had a table for 2, but stilll an 8:30pnm dining time, so we never actually ate there.  So we just ate all of our meals in the Oceanside Cafe, which is their buffet.

Okay, now reviews of the ship's dining and amenities:

Oceanview Cafe: Again, this is the buffet, and where we ate all of our meals. I have a severe shellfish allergy and am generally weary of buffets, but I had no issues. On the first day I found the manager, and he had a chef come out and walk me through everything. Basically, I was to avoid anything with shellfish, which would be listed, and anything with fish, because they often use a fish stock in fish dishes which contains shellfish. There was plenty of other options to choose from -- several Indian dishes to choose from each day, a vegetarian section, fajitas, grilled meats, hamburgers and hotdogs, pasta station, pizza, salad bar, fresh fruits, and then a rotating 'theme' for each day, such as Greek foods, French, German, British, Mediterranean, Italian, New England favorites, etc., as well as a carving station of the day, and sides like mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, green beans, carrots, cabbage, squash... I ate Indian food at lunch each  day and it was really good, and opted typically for dishes from the theme each day at dinner. Lots of really great things to try and I ate A LOT. 

With my allergy, I just avoided anything that was near anything with shellfish, which was fine. One day I wanted a dish that was near some fried shrimp and asked a chef if I could get some from the back in case of cross contamination at the buffet, but he didn't seem to understand what I was asking. So, I figured I'd just stick to what I thought was safe for the 10 days. No worries.  Might be a little tricker for a picky eater though, to manage an allergy at the buffet. Again, I can't speak to the MDR as we never ended up eating there. 

  
Drink package: I was not sure what to expect on a cruise for drinks and if I should buy a package or not, but we opted not to buy a package. They have water, juices, coffee, teas, lemonade and iced tea available 24 hours a day at the buffet. A little annoying because we kept having to walk up there to refill water bottles, but it was fine. And we had ordered a 12 pack of 1 liter water bottles for our room, and I ended up drinking that in the middle of the night when I got thirsty.  When we wanted a beer or something, we just ordered per drink at the buffet, or at the bar. It was about $8 each for beer. Much cheaper than buying a drink package. We were also surprised that their sodas are actually cans of soda, not fountain drinks, so if you buy the soda package,  that's what you'll get, as well as bottled waters. But, if you don't want to pay for that, the free stuff at the buffet is available whenever you want it. 

Pool: There were two pools, right near each other, and 4 hot tubs. All were clean and very nice. Not too crowded, especially after 3pm, which is when we tend to like our 'in the sun' time. There were only a few days we couldn't find lounge chairs in the shade, our preference, but there were always chairs available in the sun. The pool deck never felt overly crowded or anything.

Entertainment: Nightly shows were really great. Our favorite were their house performers -- singers, dancers, and acrobats. They did 3 or so big productions that were amazing. Topper was our favorite. They also had headliners that were brought on board for a show or two, and we saw a really funny magic act, some other musical shows, and went to a few of their lectures, which were very interesting. 

  
It seemed like there wasn't really much going on during the day. The two things that I was really interested in, a dot painting class and Tai chi, were both canceled, which was upsetting. They did have a lot of stuff going on during the dinner hours, but we were eating, so missed most of  those. House bands and musicians were really good and we enjoyed a few shows in the bar areas at night. 

Excursions: We have been to the ABC islands many times, so we didn't opt for any Celebrity excursions, and just did our own thing on the islands. I was our first time in the cruise ship areas, which we usually avoid on our vacations, and they were very commercial. In Aruba we went back to the ship after an hour. We really loved Bonaire though, and did a tour of the southern island, but  not through the ship. It was only $25 for a two hour tour and very informative and entertaining. There was also an area right near the ship in Bonaire with a pier you could swim from that was amazing. We only had a few hours in Bonaire, but I think of all the islands, that was my favorite and I would have liked a full day/night there. 

The average age on the ship was probably about 75 or so. We are 50 and had a great time. But, funny enough, when talking to people at dinner (in their 70s), they'd complain about 'too many old people' on board. We had a great time though, and enjoyed that there was no heavy partying or drinking, no one out of control, etc. So, it was perfect for us.

The staff overall were really great. Room steward kept our room clean and clean towels; very friendly and we had a quick chat with him each day. Had a few people in the buffet that we really liked. And, we'd love to do another cruise with Celebrity again -- hopefully soon!

Lastly, for disembarkation, we didn't put our luggage out the night before, which is an option if you have trouble with your luggage or have a lot of it. The morning of disembarkation, they kick you out of the room at 7:30am, and you have a few choices. You can hand carry your luggage and just walk off the boat immediately. Or, you can go up and eat breakfast before you leave. The buffet was open until about 9:30am I think. We hand carried our luggage up to the buffet, ate, and then just walked off the ship when we were done. If you put your luggage out for them to bring to the gangway for you, you'll have to sign up for a time slot in the app, and leave it out the night before. Then, to disembark, you have to wait for them to call your number when they bring out your luggage during your time slot. So, you'd sign up for say, an 8:30am time slot, but then have to wait for your number to be called, which means your luggage was brought down, and then you find it in the luggage area at the gangway, and disembark.

I have a weird health history and was prescribed 10mg tri-test EOD.  I was having some issues at first and dropped the dose to 5mg every 3rd day.  I know that is a much lower dose than most people take. BTW - I think tri-test is fucking me up and I am moving to T Enanthate with next injection.  

Things were going well and I felt really good until about 3 weeks ago.  I had mild symptoms of high E2 except I started to get a lot of anxiety.  Ran labs and T jumped from 420 to about 1,225; Free T - 35.3; E2 - 45.4.  Stupidly, I took my docs suggestion and took .5 anastrozole which quickly tanked my E2 (last reading E2 - <5).  That was just over a week ago and I've felt fucking horrible.  Anxiety isnt as high but its constant; Im a cranky bitch and everything feels off - and I cant keep a boner no matter how many pills I take.  

Lesson learned -  instead of taking the AI I should have realized that my numbers were probably just fine.  In hindsight, I strongly suspect that coffee, alcohol, and nicotine pouches all could have led to that initial spike in anxiety and not high E2.  I knew my body was reacting a lot differently to both coffee and alcohol and I ignored it. 

So, yeah, after a horrible date night with my wife (who is very cool about it) I'm kicking myself right now and need some positive thoughts about eventually getting to a good place with this.  Greatly appreciated.   ",1,1729709285.0,trt,13,1.0,False

I remember my work as doctor during covid pandemic when our patients died cuz doctors hadn‚Äôt proper education and hospitals hadn‚Äôt normal supplies, and when our government started invasion in Ukraine I was forced to immigrate in another country even to get an opportunity to take steps, I remember all of this and many, many many other things I experienced. And now I got the pass and my purpose is so close what I wish to say that all in your hands and all depends of you, love your family, your parents, your friends, appreciate your country if it‚Äôs get you ability not to live among poverty, crime and violence, it‚Äôs really important and it‚Äôs privilege not commonness to live in civilized world. 

My total prep time was more than 1 year, ~8 months of part time prededicated when I had a job and mostly studied fundamental disciplines like pathology, biochem, physiology, micro etc, I used Costanzo physiology, Pathoma, Kaplan lecture notes for biochem and immuno, scketchi and some YouTube videos for micro. Then in last 6 mths I left my job and started uw+FA, with average 70% on uw, and after that I did melhman pdfs, which are definitely the best resource along with pathoma. Mike is the really best tutor. 
In last 14 days I did melhman arrows, revised my weakest areas in his pdfs and FA, and on the day before the exam I did HY nbme images which were veeery helpful, I got ~10 images on real deal from that files.

My nbmes and uwsas are following: 
UWSA3 57%(real piece of dog shit, none of uwsas shares nothing with the real deal), NBME 26 - 73%, NBME 27 - 78%, NBME 28 - 81%, NBME 29(offline) - 80%, UWSA2 - 74%, UWSA1 - 69%, NBME 30 - 84%, NBME 31 - 86%, old free 120 - 86%, new free - 78% (was a bit confused about score drop, but the real deal was most similar with nbmes, not free 120). 

Exam day: I had a breakfast with coffee and fried eggs, I couldn‚Äôt overcome yourself and take food on breaks. I didn‚Äôt do break after first block and I guess it was valuable decision since I saved time on last blocks. 

Exam itself was not that hard, more like nbme, but with longer questions(not that long like on free 120), besides ethics questions which concepts I‚Äôve never seen before(I only did ethics questions in uw and review in FA, perhaps other resources cover that topics, it‚Äôs boring and I would better do some biochem or pathology instead of that).

1gai190,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gai190/aita_for_throwing_out_all_of_the_apartments_items/,AITA for Throwing out all of the apartments Items,"To give you some contexts I (20 F) have been rooming with my roommate (19F) for exactly on year up until I moved beginning of October. I found her on our colleges app when looking for a roommate. I have been previously staying at the apartment 1 year prior to her being there so when she moved in the common space was already furnished with cleaning utilities, dishes, tv, etc. 

Me and my roommate haven‚Äôt always gotten along due to multiple issues in the past on both ends. In the beginning I was out of a job for maybe 3 months and was low on plenty of items and would ask to borrow her things a lot and sometimes would forget to give them back or misplace them which she also did the same and we talked about it and resolved it. That ended back in February. Now my current issue with her was she didnt clean up after herself a lot. Ik teenagers just growing into adulthood can still have messy eras but she would be dirty rather than messy. Her room had a bad cat piss smell that lingered into the common area from her cats litter box she didn‚Äôt regularly clean. There was trash on the floor, coffee table, counter from her and her friends that would just be there until I gave in and decided to clean up. And this was an ongoing thing for almost 70% of the time she was living there. I am a people pleaser and don‚Äôt like creating to many issues so I‚Äôd just suck it up and clean it because u found it to be embarrassing when I‚Äôd like to have company and the place was a mess and just for my own comfortability. 
But what really started to anger me was when she started eating my groceries. We do not go half on groceries what ever she buys is hers and whatever I buy is mine and I‚Äôve had this conversation with her multiple times. I don‚Äôt mind sharing when Asked but she wouldn‚Äôt even ask and just help herself. I didn‚Äôt have the best job to where I could continue to buy groceries everytime so it became a real pain in my ass having to keep tell her to stay out of my stuff. And even some days I‚Äôll catch her feeding her friends to MY stuff or they became comfortable enough to take MY stuff themselves out of the fridge. Multiple of my friends became witness to the way she was as a poor roommate and gave me advice to report her to my landlord a multitude of times but being a people pleaser I couldn‚Äôt do it because I still had a thought she was a good person just not a good roommate and didn‚Äôt want to kick her out. But instead of ever fixing the problem I had with her she‚Äôd continue to do the same things and even overheard her talking mess about me to her
Friends about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúdirty‚Äù and she always had to clean up after me when the most she‚Äôs had to clean was my few dishes I leave when I‚Äôm too tired to clean the previous day and the trash can in the common area. So I stills stayed cordial and a decent roommate but I already had my mind made up on what kind of person she is. 
I decided to move out and move into my boyfriend‚Äôs family home across the country back in July and told her about it. And she seemed ‚Äúsad‚Äù but I figured because I wouldn‚Äôt be there to provide food and free cleaning services anymore. This problem proceeds up until September when I had just about enough of my people pleasing. I was just being ran over atp so I decided to stop cleaning after her and her friends and bought no groceries only bought myself take out or something I can stash into my room. And let me tell you the common space looked atrocious. But her and her friends never saw the need to clean up after themselves so it just kept getting worse as for her bedroom as well (which was always dirty). I also informed her numerous of
Times I was planning on clearing everything out that I paid for which included the tv , cleaning supplies , pantry items , and decor. And I slowly did just that I gave away my tv to one of my friends and slowly started giving away items left and right and she didn‚Äôt have anything to say.

Fast forward one day her and her friends actually cleaned (half ass but better than nothing ) the apartment and left a big bag of trash by the door. Again I refused to clean anymore so it stayed there for a few days and I came back home from a nail appointment and into my room to hear her friends talk smack about me not taking out the trash and I left her a message telling her I refused because that is all her trash and I refuse to clean up after her friends for the remainder of me being here. She said
She didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant problems‚Äù but proceeded to talk smack while taking out the trash. I ignored and went about my merry day. Now the day of
My big move she wasn‚Äôt there and hasn‚Äôt been there for about 2-3 days due to her partying stripping and drinking she does. So I fed her cat and my Friend helped me clear out the common space of my belongings. It felt really good to I‚Äôll tell you that much. Half of the items I threw out that were ruined or overly used (by her cause ) and the others I donated to the international students who needed those items. 
I waited by the front door of the apartment building for my friend to take me to the airport and my now ex roommate and her friend approached and did the whole ‚Äúsad act‚Äù and tried to hug me which I declined and I reminded her again I cleared out everything upstairs to which idk if she ignored or didn‚Äôt believe and went upstairs. I leave and that was about it.

Fast forward to about 4-5 days into my new place I get a paragraph from her saying I‚Äôm spiteful and fake for‚Äù throwing away thing that you knew I used of yours‚Äù mind you mine so I quickly responded by saying ‚Äúi reminded you multitude of times and I paid for everything I threw away so I don‚Äôt see any reason for you to feel entitled to my belongings‚Äù and she went on saying how I‚Äôm weird and she should‚Äôve had her friends jump me and such to which I found entertaining giving anytime I addressed an issue to her she never had that energy before. And I basically told her she‚Äôs just
Upset she can‚Äôt walk over me and disrespect me and my things anymore and if she wanted to use my stuff she can go into the trash and grab them which she‚Äôs done before. 

With that being said I don‚Äôt think am the asshole

I think that is the theme of this post.

I do not want to make this post. It will be long and I think I just want to vent. I apologize and I am trying to separate it/condense so it‚Äôs digestible.

I am scared about the backlash of an audience, especially since ironically there was a similar post from the opposite perspective and everyone commented about the same way I had expected. The conflicting emotions I feel over this LDR, the pain, the confusion and shame‚Ä¶It sucks, and I just want to be transparent.

So my partner, Rye [23] and I [25] knew each other for a really long time through the internet. We were younger (like high school aged) when we met online and just played games together, then chatted in a group chat. We were not as close as I was to our mutual friend, but Rye was a cool, dependable (as in very consistent in my life) and funny addition to the group. She chimed in and we did speak separately, but looking back I felt I spoke more than she did. I was constantly talking about my life, venting, just generally telling more than she was. But she seemed to never mind and was always there for me.

I noticed when I would get crushes or girlfriends, I would talk to Rye about the crushes as a friend does, but would simultaneously kind of fall back and not talk to her when I got serious with someone. I have to admit that subconsciously I think I knew Rye liked me, but the distance was unrealistic for someone who was just out of high school (at the time) so I never considered it until our 20s. I also needed to go through some self love. So, I  think a part of me knew and liked that she was fond of me, but did not think it would be realistic to date, especially when we were younger (no job, no $$, no passport). I am not sure if that makes me a bad person.

At age 21-22 I had a different LDR I‚Äôll call Lily. Lily and I met in person, but it was a month before I was moving cities. Rethinking this relationship with Lily, I see A LOT of similarities with Rye that I will summarize: 
I wanted to be casual with Lily because I knew I was moving. Lily wanted me to be her boyfriend. Lily was really attractive and I did not have a lot of dating experience and I thought we had great rapport so I got FOMO over if I‚Äôd just passed on her. Hot girl wants to date me! 
She came in intense: She got me gifts, took me on dates, said she loved my mom after BARELY knowing both of us, said she wanted to have a baby, but then would flake on all my dates and I was the only one who visited her (she never came to me)
She claimed she liked being inside and not dates, so I would just go over to her house but then she was mad I did that, BUT she would flake on my dates I planned??? Literally she flaked on one my MOM planned for us and I still feel guilty ‚Ä¶.
Every time I approached her trying to find compromises she would argue with me or ignore me. I was very pragmatic saying I don‚Äôt like how she talked to me, didn‚Äôt like that she basically forced me to be a hermit etc.
It was super toxic, she accused me constantly of cheating [I did not] and started arguments every day
I depended on my female friends, who I guess she saw as competition, so she excluded me from seeing them. So I was constantly alone.

Long story short we had a pretty messy breakup ‚Äì she said I didn‚Äôt do the bare minimum, was making those cringe story posts on Instagram subliminally about me, and there are still some parts of my hometown I avoid because of her.

Looking back on this at 25, I do wish I‚Äôd been more firm. I hated the accusations, the lack of planning (but desire for a child and family?), and the controlling behavior. 

We split, I didn‚Äôt date for 6 months.

I called Rye when this happened for the first time in a while. I knew she would be the only one who would agree what he did was messed up. I had NO ONE in my corner, all of ‚Äúour‚Äù friends took the housemate‚Äôs side despite recognizing he was kinda messed up for what he did. We slowly caught back up and I realized‚Ä¶I honestly did not know much about her. 

We got closer the summer I was 22. I noticed how beautiful and funny and smart and alike we truly were. I really did feel understood. I flirted, she flirted back, we started exploring the romantic and intimate side of things.

It was incredible. There was so much chemistry and it happened so quickly. We had a lot of phone sex and talked for hours. School starts back up and we have the ‚ÄúWhat are we?‚Äù talk. I‚Äôm excited, thinking of how we may close the gap, visiting her, potentially moving to her city one day‚Ä¶.


ISSUE 1) TRAVELING AND EXPECTATIONS WERE ALREADY NOT ALIGNED

Rye wanted to be serious, I suggested casual/dating slowly because I did not know when I would see her, like with Lily. She said she does not do it casually. Me, again going ‚Äúgreat girl I do not want to miss out on‚Äù said okay let‚Äôs just be together then. I did this because I figured visiting would make it worth it.

And at first, virtually dating was fun! I loved planning her dates, exploring more about her, getting into that inside joke / learning each other's routine point of the relationship. I knew the dating world sucked and like I said before due to who I am it is extremely hard for me to date, and I‚Äôve accepted that it's highly possible I‚Äôll just end up alone. I thought I could handle this LDR looking forward to meeting one day especially since it was someone I knew for a long time.

ISSUE 2) ONE SIDEDNESS AND FAMILY COMPLICATIONS

Well, it gets to like November (so about 3 months official)ish and I start feeling a bit weird with the fact that I‚Äôm planning all these dates and don‚Äôt really feel‚Ä¶ balance? it is beginning to feel one sided. I am planning every date, helping her with her homework, on the phone with her while at work and at the gym, planning everything for this potential trip with no dates or ideas of what she wants because she won‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúheyyy didn‚Äôt you say you liked doing this stuff for partners LOL??‚Äù So I feel a bit used. But then tell myself since I am the ‚Äúman‚Äù in the partnership, I guess it is okay I am planning so much. 

I also learn that our families are similar which, while important for relating to each other, actually causes a HUGE problem for our futures. We basically both have family we‚Äôd eventually have to caretake, and this was a large concern for me. If I didn‚Äôt know how this would play out in terms of moving and visits, this could be a big problem when family members start getting older/sicker. However, she did not have any sort of plan for this‚Ä¶.as time went on she talked about having kids too and I was worried bc we didn‚Äôt even have a move in plan or consider that we were both genetically predisposed to the same condition in our families. I had a big worry about that because the possibility of raising a disabled child comes with a lot of factors (not being ableist, seeing my family go through it I don‚Äôt know if I could personally be a parent in general).

ISSUE 3) LACK OF IN PERSON PHYSICALITY AND HERMIT MODE

At this point I am in my room 96% of the time on the phone with her. That was until I made a new female friend and she was cool. She invited me over and to all these fun events. But then my ex got mad about her so we stopped talking. 

Things kinda balance again after I cut the friend off ( but I‚Äôm still planning all the dates ) until around spring 2023 where she goes out of the country randomly for about a week or two. During this period is when I felt the resentment come up again about the trips/lack of physical meeting or at least KNOWING when to expect to meet. I am upset because she was able to do this but not visit me. 

I talk to her about how I really think we should have met by now or at least started planning it. She said how her parents did most of the planning for this current trip she was on, and she does at this point say how her parents wouldn‚Äôt mind me staying with them at their house and that I should not have to go out of my way to book a hotel for a trip.

I am trying to visit during the summer post graduation around July 2023, so I ask her to ask them asap that I can see if I need to factor in hotel cost or not. She says she will.

Once she gets back I follow up and she says she hasn‚Äôt asked them yet‚Ä¶at this point I‚Äôm also confused because their relationship is a bit strained, so I get worried that they will be weird about her having a guy sleep over and I would kind of prefer we get some alone time you know? Haven‚Äôt met yet, things get intimate virtually of course I want to be intimate when we meet. 

So this is like almost a year of only me planning dates and this trip. And similar to my ex she is constantly talking about having a baby and marriage. But not about closing the gap, meeting for the first time, or anything.

I get anxious thinking she just wants to live in a fairytale and isn‚Äôt being serious. This is exacerbated by my approach to children (how much should we save up, where would we live, what kind of life would we want for the kid, disabilities talk and my fears around parenting). I would ask this and she would say I‚Äôm ‚Äúkilling her dreams‚Äù. 

I begin wondering if we should try opening us up/being poly (yeah, I know‚Ä¶) in order to get my physical needs met for dates and sex because I am worried about the lack of planning or goals for the future outside of her wanting marriage and kids (without any plan on that front either). It‚Äôs beginning to get lonely. It is also weird because I‚Äôm simultaneously feeling like it‚Äôd be embarrassing if I do that and then can‚Äôt even get a date/interest and end up with the same issues.

I start questioning where I stand. I feel more like ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù to fill the void than the person she wants‚Ä¶so I proposed this open relationship because I was getting frustrated by the lack of clarity. I don‚Äôt think I really wanted to be poly. I think I just wanted someone to meet my needs. Then at some point she said she was fine with not meeting (BECAUSE I WAS MEETING ALL HER NEEDS AS A VIRTUAL BOYFRIEND, SO SHE DIDNT FEEL THE NEED TO MEET! THIS WAS ALL AFTER I SAID MEETING WAS IMPORTANT TO ME BTW‚Ä¶.)

This feeling goes away of wanting to open things, but then she brings the topic back up during the summer approaching last year. I say no at the time since I am thinking once we knock this first summer trip out of the way I will be good to go with my physical desires and can feel a bit more seen.

Well, then I got a job. And I try to ask them to start me later (like a week or two) so I can travel to see Rye, but they want me to start in like a few days. So now I can‚Äôt go until around September. I‚Äôm bummed but working my ass off trying to save more money, still planning all the dates‚Ä¶but she would not confirm a date after summer. I kept asking and she would just say I don‚Äôt know. It felt like she wasn‚Äôt even trying. I began to feel like I was wasting my time but I loved her so much I really wanted to make it work. 

I was doing all of this while trying to adjust to the corporate world and facing uncertainty about my housing for the months after. Of course reading this back i am like ‚ÄúWhy was I trying to plan a trip not knowing where I‚Äôd be living in September??‚Äù But the caveat is I was fairly certain I‚Äôd have a spot when I picked the planning back up. 

My relationship with Rye was a bit strained because of the lack of planning the trip from her still but also because we didn‚Äôt plan for my transition to working either. I had said this was equally important because going from classes for a few hours and work for 4 hours to working 8 hours straight M-F would make things VERY different. I wouldn‚Äôt have that much time and was already getting burnt out. I showed her my full calendar and she got MAD at me‚Ä¶

Then, the resentment peaked when‚Ä¶after begging for MONTHS to see her‚Ä¶she was ready to come at the drop of a hat‚Ä¶for a concert.

Not for me. For one of her favorite artists. I would essentially be planning a concert‚Ä¶for someone i am not that fond of music wise‚Ä¶.to tag along with my partner for‚Ä¶.

It was last minute too so tickets were expensive but I STILL tried to make it work‚Ä¶and then she still didn‚Äôt confirm how we‚Äôd work it out (I was about to use the small vacation hours I earned for this‚Ä¶). And then we are back at square one. No plan. One sided date planning from my end‚Ä¶.and then she has no sex drive for like a few months. I was trying to hold on so long but I began to feel like she was using me or didn‚Äôt like me.

Then I meet a new girl. And we were pretty much just sharing a circle but not interacting. My ex partner kept saying I was not communicating in general and we were butting heads a lot..BUT I WAS COMMUNICATING. She‚Äôd just not listen to me. I said I was feeling a bit uncomfortable and sad and confused about why we can‚Äôt meet sooner and she was not hearing me talk and wouldn't open up about why. And then she‚Äôd just get mad I wasn‚Äôt opening up at the pace she wanted. Meanwhile she‚Äôd take up 90% of the conversations while I was still decompressing after work.

In this frustration the new girl, let‚Äôs call her Sara, went through this tough period and I was just trying to help because I felt bad so I pointed her to some resources and this catalyst started our friendship. The combination of my relationship being rocky and this new girl being cool and fun was a horrible combination.

ISSUE 4) INFIDELITY

Whenever my partner and I fought, I started to slowly get more and more annoyed. It was taking time away from my new friend because the arguments weren‚Äôt going anywhere, but my friendship with Sara was becoming a source of fun. I felt smothered by Rye, and like she was being clingy with me but not progressing us forward. I loved her and wanted to move to the next step!! Meeting! But she kept saying I was being unavailable emotionally and that she didn‚Äôt know when we could meet. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt unavailable, because I was telling her what was making me upset, and ways to fix it‚Ä¶but after doing this so many times with no improvement I would get anxious and shut down sometimes due to the circular ‚Äúthis is making me sad‚Äù ‚Äúwell I just don‚Äôt know when I can visit, end of story‚Äù discussion. She just wasn‚Äôt offering solutions and the ‚Äúlistening‚Äù was kinda just like ‚Äúokay well I don‚Äôt know‚Äù. 

Over time I spent more time with Sara and her friend, Diane. we‚Äôd go to the movies and the mall and just get coffee as friends and it was fun. And it was making me realize just how much of my life was online. I didn‚Äôt have ANY friends in person‚Ä¶because I was always in the house.

And then the ‚Äúshould we break up‚Äù solution came up. But she was the one who brought it up.

I didn‚Äôt want to break up, I literally just wanted an idea of what the hell we were doing but we didn‚Äôt have one! My ‚Äúplanning‚Äù was always half baked because i was constantly missing key details from her end. I was on the fence and confused because the more time I spent with Sara the more I was wondering if I was starting to get a crush or was just trying to get my needs I was missing from my partner. I began to question constantly if I was wasting my time, if I was being used, if my partner just wanted the feeling of a relationship without an actual relationship. And yet through all of it I thought we could really turn it around.

But then I fucked up. And this is likely the part of this post where I lose all understanding and respect.

Sara and I got super drunk one night during game night and we had a quick kiss. It was just a peck, we were both completely fucked up, and I felt super anxious the next day. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should tell Rye, kept making it not as bad as I thought it was, and was trying to ignore the feelings coming up about Sara.

I had no idea what this meant, but I think a week later we‚Äôd broken up anyway which made it feel even more pointless.

Eventually I did tell Rye, but this was months later after we had broke up and got back together. She was mad because she always suspected or disliked Sara, was mad that it was with someone ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt like‚Äù, and was mad I didn‚Äôt tell her right away/or break up prior to the kiss. 

Like I mentioned, I know this is a big fat no no, and that this is likely the point of this story where everyone‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOP you suck and you deserve this‚Äù. There is no excuse, drunk or not, for what happened. I had the opportunity to say no, to remove myself, to just go to bed. To even break up right before. I hate that I still try to rationalize it likely from guilt and my complicated feelings about Sara. 

I still feel confused and conflicted about it. I don‚Äôt talk to Sara anymore or Diane, but now I‚Äôm not with my ex Rye either. We tried making it work after this was revealed, and she was just too upset, heartbroken and resentful of me. All valid emotions. 

She still never planned a trip, constantly held what happened over my head, moved the goalpost constantly while I killed myself trying to make things okay. Suddenly, she was fine trying to be poly or date people again but deep down I think she just wanted to make me feel how I made her feel. She slept with someone and I gave her the ok to go date the person. I guess I didn‚Äôt expect her to sleep with the person, and I guess to try to ‚Äúeven things out‚Äù I tried not to care but it didn‚Äôt really help much. 

We kept ‚Äúbreaking up‚Äù but she would call me the next day and keep calling me her boyfriend. And then we‚Äôd just get back into the same routine. It confused me a lot because I‚Äôd accept breaking up, but then she would say I‚Äôm her partner when I asked??

We are completely no contact now. In her final message she basically confirmed i was right in the fears I had from the beginning:

She states in her final breakup message that she needs to heal, that she‚Äôs still mad about what happened but that there were other things in her life that made her realize she doesn‚Äôt feel her emotions fully? But most importantly:

That she dated long distance because she‚Äôs afraid of intimacy and liked having a boyfriend without having one, liked being uncertain of the future, LIKED NOT ACTUALLY BEING CLOSE TO THEM. She said that not planning was a form of self-sabotage and caused me a lot of pain, and that she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave it in her‚Äù to reassure me, and that my kiss hurt her and changed us. It ends with her saying her intimacy is messed up/but has been since before me, that she‚Äôs codependent (this came up in the past) and that we shouldn‚Äôt speak anymore.

While I know everyone may just be like ‚Äúlol op karma!!‚Äù I think more than anything I just feel like I was fighting a losing battle from the beginning‚Ä¶and that the fears I had were correct all along and I don‚Äôt know how to reconcile with that.

So many times we could‚Äôve ended this. And now there‚Äôs just a grave in my heart. I can‚Äôt even think about the other girl because of the guilt and cringe. I keep remembering how my ex cried when I told her and I feel so bad that I caused that from something that wasn‚Äôt even a second. She is so sweet and didn‚Äôt deserve that but i completely pushed her out my mind, drunk or not, to be selfish with a person irl.

I want to move on from this and I thought I did but the last breakup message was brutal. I‚Äôve been depressed for two months. I don‚Äôt know how to hold myself accountable without judgment or demonizing myself. I hate that if you step out of your relationship it becomes your whole identity, and that you‚Äôre seen as this evil demon who doesn‚Äôt love: why is all the good, the work, the love I put into my relationship now void over one action I regret? 

Why does my ex now feel absolved from any wrong because my wrong is ‚Äúworse‚Äù? Also I can still see her posts and it‚Äôs like her breakup message and posts are two different things.

I hate that the trust is probably gone forever. But again, I think it‚Äôs just feeling like the entire weight of our breakup is on me when she admitted to basically using me the entire time‚Ä¶my head is spinning. It‚Äôs like we made each other insecure in different ways and now it‚Äôs beyond repair. I feel like we were both each others crutch, that we tried this out way too early and we‚Äôre still immature.

I miss her all the time. I hate that now I‚Äôm only going to be remembered for doing that one thing and nothing else. I hate that I felt my needs couldn‚Äôt be met and that I just‚Ä¶stayed instead of moving on.

I don‚Äôt know how to build my confidence up. I feel like everyone will see any future partner as a reflection of what happened in this one (i.e everyone thinks if you do it once you‚Äôll always do it which I don‚Äôt think is fair). It just seems like there‚Äôs never space for the offender to be remorseful and want to grow and change and not have that be their only identity. 

You‚Äôre just kinda shelved as untrustworthy and demonic forever and it‚Äôs legitimately making me not want to live. I‚Äôm so sad all the time, my addiction is getting worse, all the problems I have are becoming exacerbated and snowballing and I genuinely just feel like a huge loser any way I look at this situation.

I guess I just want to know how to make peace. I don‚Äôt think my ex completely hates me, but things will be altered forever. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. 

**TL;DR: dated someone online for 2 years, knew each other for 6+, first year was great but noticed ex didn‚Äôt plan any visits or our future, I planned every date and hated the uncertainty/lack of consistency and reassurance. We Fought a lot beginning of year 2, I kissed another person irl while drunk, ex was devastated, resentment all of year 2, back and forth breaking up and then them buying me gifts but withholding sex and visits, broke up and ex admitted they date ldr to have a partner without having a real partner and because they liked the emotional labor I did without having to do any work/get close to me.

My partner and I are working on this game in our spare time that is a Deckbuilding Rouge-lite Match-3 called Beans of Production. You manipulate the match board with your cards to make matches and earn points to clear each level.¬†  
  
The concept of manipulating the match board with your deck is pretty unique, so designing the cards/relics was a bit difficult. I wanted to see if I could get some feedback.

The closest thing I have seen to this game is Demon‚Äôs Mirror, but that game uses the match-3 board in conjunction with battling enemies, which makes it feel more like Slay the Spire. This game is more of a score attack where you are just trying to get the highest score possible each level, so we are aiming for more of a ‚ÄúBalatro‚Äù experience.

Happy to receive any feedback on the game whether it be on this thread, in our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/MjeVtkRCC3), or on steam!

Music well I don't have a specific taste in music, I'm the kind of person where if I like a song I'll just listen to it, but I do love billie eilish, Coldplay, sia, adele, the weeknd, tame impala and cas(^-^)

I loveeeeeeeeee cats and dogs but I own a cat he's ten months old his name is leoü•π (he's an orange fat kitty) 

I also love taking photos and videos, I take photos daily and I make edits, rn I'm saving up money for camera (I'm very excited), I mostly film the ocean, trees, clouds and sunsets, I just adore nature. 

I like going on walks, star gazing, bowling (even tho sometimes I suck at itüò≠). Also food and coffee are my happiness fr.

And last thing is, I'm arab! But I lived in America most of my life, but for now I'm a dental student studying abroadü•∏ specifically egypt, I  love making people smile, alot of people tell me I should be a motivational speaker which idk about that, but  I do think I'm pretty funny and positive too.

1gahgen,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1gahgen/nm_scary_experience/,NM scary experience ,"I had to make this post because someone asked for the other weird experiences I had on my NM trip with the disappearing town we found when my 2 friends and I went years ago after we'd all turned 21.



So as I stated in the original post, I said I felt really oppressive energy the second we crossed the state line. I felt it was like a wall of negative energy, and this was the literal second we crossed the border, there weren't any signs just yet saying the typical ""Welcome to New Mexico!"" until about half a mile into the state but I FELT that energy. That alone was really scary for me because I'd never felt that way before and I'd traveled quite a bit at that time to new states and into the woods in the darkness, but never into the creepy ass desert of NM lol 

We were going to Ruidoso so the way we entered the state was through a very flat desert that had spanned our home state but bled into NM, so I know it wasn't the desert itself that scared me, but whatever oppressive energy that was already out there. As we drove further into the desert I felt like I was being watched. I didn't imagine what entity or anything so I can't say what was watching me, but I FELT I was being watched by something really, really negative and I could not shake the fear the entire ride. I was having mini panic attacks the whole several hours drive we still had, most of which was in that desert. Once we passed through the remainder of that desert, we had to go up a mountain that was really wooded. It was hard to see much since it was pretty rural and it was well into about 2am or 3am at that point, but I was PANICKING! I started actually having a full on panic attack in the car and when I'd close my eyes I would see the top of the mountain and the trees were moving violently with wind and I was moving closer to the top of the mountain like a bird while something pale and boney was standing at the top of the mountain looking up at me, it is something I had never experienced prior to that, nor after that. Because it was so weird I freaked out even more. I didn't know how to explain that to my friends so I didn't and tried to lose my shit privately.

We finally made it up the mountain and to our cabin after about an hour or so of more driving, whole time I'm just quiet and freaked the hell out over that experience and this fear that would not let me go. 



When we got to our cabin, I was legit scared af to get out of the car but I just did it and grabbed my stuff and ran inside lol my friends were exhausted so we all went upstairs and they passed out but I was wide awake panicking until about 6 or 7am. I couldn't sleep, I felt like I couldn't breathe or something. I had thought maybe I was getting altitude sickness or something so I chalked a lot of my experience up to that (to quell my fear but didn't make sense because the fear started in the flat desert so that makes zero sense but it's completely possible I had it while on the mountain) 

The following day, we woke up pretty late, around 11am. I was tired af but ready to start the day in the sunlight and try my best to write off the scary feelings of the previous day. We all showered and got dressed to go explore the little town we were staying in and find somewhere to get coffee. Everyone was pretty friendly towards us, but were definitely curious since they're not used to seeing unfamiliar faces and they were all young people like us as well. We got some suggestions from them on some cool spots we could check out and off we went, to go to a bunch of little shops and antique stores. We found a couple antique stores that were uneventful, cool old stuff but nothing out of the ordinary. We ventured off down the road quite a bit and found a ton of little crystal shops along this long rural road, miles from each other. NM has a bunch of crystal mines similar to Arkansas so you'll find a lot of personal shops like that around. Those shops were cool but again, nothing worth noting as far as weird. 



One of my friends suggested this historical bar called No Scum Allowed out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, and it was creeping into the afternoon at that point so I said if we're going, we've gotta head there now. We started the drive there, which if I remember was maybe 2 hours or something close to that, and we were off. I'd had that weird oppressive feeling the entire time we were going around away from the town, but I kept trying my best to ignore it. The drive was beautiful, some of the roads took us on the edge of the mountains where all you could see was a sea of tall trees to your left and a flat rocky desert to the right, yet I was constantly feeling this intense fear tugging at me inside that I could not shake no matter what I did. 

When we arrived to the saloon, we went in the old western style wooden building and there were a ton of middle aged to older folks in there drinking and talking. Some were making out which we thought was hilarious lol my friends and I got to chatting with the owner, the coolest old lady ever, and my friends ordered their special drink called the Snakebite (I was sober at the time so absolutely zero drinking for me) and we went outside and hung out. It was a cool experience there, but the sun started setting and that internal dread started building up in my chest. I told them we've gotta head back before it gets too dark and we all got back in the car and went back on our way.



It was fine as far as starting the drive, but once we got closer to the wooded side and the sun was completely set, that's when I started panicking again. I remember feeling watched again, and then I saw this deer standing on this rock that was stabilizing the guard rail (cliff to the right side now and desert to the left side of the road) but there's just this big ass deer but it's a type of deer I hadn't ever seen before, it's fur was longer and the antlers had a lot of fur on them too, and when I saw it, it looked into the car and felt like it looked AT ME. I was like WTF and looked in the side mirror as we drove away and the deer had turned and looked at our car as we drove away. Now, I'm no stranger to deer. I think they're cute creatures and I grew up around them in the deep south, they''d come up in our yard and I'd watch from the window or porch as a ton of em would come up from the woods. I don't fear wildlife, I respect it. However, I know that's not normal behavior. Also, how and why would a deer stand on a small boulder that's situated on a damn cliff and wait there until the only car for miles creeps along instead of going in the direction it wanted to? ALSO never seen a deer look me in the eyes and then turn to watch a car go by. Deer are smart but they're not interested in cars like that - they've got prey mentality of getting one place to the next. It really jarred me, but again I didn't say anything to my friends because I was afraid I'd come off as crazy.



When we finally got to the cabin, friend 1 mentioned being scared and then friend 2 shared the same sentiment. I asked for more information and they just said they ""felt weird"" and wanted to go inside the cabin but were scared, I didn't say much but told them I'd get out first and make sure it's safe for them. We went in and we weren't sleepy yet so we decided to go onto the rickety upstairs porch - now this is where I need to describe the cabin inside for context for something that comes up later - the cabin was an A frame. It was closed off mostly in the front where you walk in, 2 small windows. The tiny bathroom is to the left of the front door and the kitchen space is to the right. You go straight into the cabin and you're at a living room, a spare bed is to the left and in front of you there is a futon and in front of that is a wall of giant windows with glass doors that go out to the back patio facing the woods, to the right of you are the stairs going up to the top floor. The top floor is REALLY cramped and doesn't have much but a couple twin sized mattresses on the floor with space heaters along the edges and a small door leading to a sketchy tiny balcony. We were on that balcony.



We were smoking cigarettes at the time so we went for a smoke, and friend 2 decided it was a good idea to start whistling into the darkness. This is something we'd all creeped each other out with with stories from other people on the internet who warn to NEVER whistle into the darkness. So me and friend 1 are like BRO WTF WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! And friend 2 is like ""I don't know, it just happened on it's own"" so me and friend 1 aren't actually scared because we kinda didn't believe anything bad would ACTUALLY happen, but we were giving friend 2 shit about it anyways haha So we ended up going in shortly after that and hanging out just figuring out what to do the next day, and friend 1 says they gotta go pee, I tell her I'll go with her because I needed to brush my teeth and friend 3 says she's gonna come with us. Friend 1 keeps saying she's scared and doesn't know why, and I tell her I'll go ahead of her and talk to her about some stuff when we get back upstairs. We go downstairs and for some reason I feel REALLY scared again, and something tells me not to look out the window. I tell my friends to not look at the window at all no matter what, to look down. 



My friends are really into the spiritual stuff and know I'm kinda on the fence because I come from a very religious background but they trust me, and they all looked down at the floor while we walked through the living room past the wall of windows and into the front bathroom. They were freaking tf out in there asking what's going on and friend 1 was blaming friend 2 for bringing something to our cabin and I told them that whatever is going on has been around since we got there and the look on their faces was literally of horror. They started pressing me to tell them what I meant by that but I knew I'd have to sit them down and kinda go over it in a place that wouldn't scare them and make them not wanna go back past the living room. We finish doing our business and do the same method to go back up the stairs. I finally tell them about my experiences and they believe me 100%. I have had weird experiences before but nothing like this, and they've had weird experiences WITH me before so they know I wouldn't make anything up, I don't do drugs, have mental health issues that would  make me think stuffs there that's not, and I don't LOOK for strange stuff. 



Needless to say, they were freaked out lol 



That night I fell asleep rather easily, whereas now friend 2 couldn't sleep as I'd come to find out the following morning. She said she kept feeling like someone was sitting on her chest when she would lay down to go to sleep and she kept imagining scary things being outside and inside with us. It took her till about 4am to go to sleep finally and she had nightmares the whole night. Crazy thing is, we all did that night. 



The next day we head into Ruidoso to get some food from their Walmart since it was the only grocery store they had and we planned to hang out at the cabin all day to enjoy our final day before having to head back the next day. We're shopping for campfire stuff and head to check out. We all had to pee so we parked the cart next to the bathroom and friend 2 watched while friend 1 and I went to the bathroom, I got out first and went to wash my hands and there was this Native American woman that came into the bathroom and I (a southerner) of course have to say Hi and smile at her, but she gives me the coldest look and just stares at me. I thought it was rude af so I was just like hehe ok then and finished washing my hands, my friend came out of her stall and the woman smiled at her. I was like WTF is she racist or something?? It was weird. (I'm German, friend 1 is Hispanic and friend 2 is mixed black and white) so I felt like maybe people that look like me aren't nice to her or something so I tried to ignore it cuz I get it and all that. We went outside the bathroom and friend 2 was out there with the cart and mentioned the woman smiling at her and how cool she looked and I was like WTF why was she rude to me then if I smiled and said hi??? Could be unrelated but who really knows lol I did find it incredibly weird considering their stories of scary stuff and  me having scary experiences the literal entire time I was there. 



We went back to the cabin and hung out all day, took a fat nap on the guest bed, but I had a dream it was nighttime and something was standing at the glass wall watching us sleeping and I was so scared in my dream, when I finally woke up from the dream the second my eyes opened I was  turned looking at the window. I'd had dreams like that before and they are really scary but I let it go.



That evening we made a fire outside and my friends drank while I hung out with them. I started to get uncomfortable again and didn't want to be outside, which was super unusual for me considering my experiences of being out by fires all night and camping in even more remote places that this without fear, but I digress, I WAS TERRIFIED. My friends were drunk and kinda being dumb but got weird after awhile and came back in too. They said they were starting to get scared but wanted the drinks to help calm them down. We all had nightmares again but when it was time to wake up at the buttcrack of dawn boy did we pack our stuff and throw it in the trunk fast! We sped tf outta there, not speaking at all the whole time. Once we got away from the mountain we all calmed down quite a bit and shared that we all had the same type of dream, something was outside of our cabin walking around it trying to get in, and trying to get one of us to let it in. It was really scary to hear that they had the same type of dream I did.



We went to Roswell on our way out and it was the most boring experience ever, even the alien museum was so boring. Nothing happened after that on our way out but the second we crossed over to our state I felt the oppressive energy let me go finally and I would've ran home if I could! We all lived together at the time so we all went back, showered and knocked tf out. For the following week I was sick as a dog. I don't know what it was but I was really sick, fever, chills, nightmares, etc. It was awful. It finally let up but I'd occasionally get a nightmare about that thing I saw in my head and in my dreams when I was there. Then for a couple of years I'd get this really really strong urge to go back. Like something was calling me in and it would make my heart race with almost excitement to go back, which is quite the contrast to the horror I felt while there.



If you've made it this far, you're a trooper because this could be a literal book I've just written. If you have any theories on wtf we experienced, please share them with me. It is by far the weirdest experience I've ever had in my life. ",1,1729707387.0,strange,0,0.67,False
