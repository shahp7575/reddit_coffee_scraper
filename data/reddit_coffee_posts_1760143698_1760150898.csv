I have been thinking about asking him to get coffee and just feel it out. But I creeped and I saw a post about him going on a Halloween date with someone. 

Should I just try to move on and allow him to do the same? Should I ask him to meet up? I’m not sure what to do and I’m not sure if I’d even want to try again and I definitely don’t want to hinder him from healing and moving on if we arent getting back together.

So when coffee gets expensive some coffee vendors change the blend percentage to include robusta beans because they’re much cheaper. 
A regular coffee drinker would probably notice but if you’re not familiar with Coffee, you might not notice. For me Robusta coffee is too bitter. They mostly use that for freeze dried coffee that sits on a shelf for years.

1o3keel,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o3keel/advice_the_ultimate_guide_to_how_to_lower/,[Advice] The Ultimate Guide to How to Lower Cortisol Levels (That Actually Works),"I didn’t realize how many people in my circle were running on stress hormones until everyone I knew started saying they were “wired but tired.” Can’t sleep. Can’t focus. Stuck in a loop. Turns out, it’s not just burnout. It’s cortisol overload.

Here’s what helped me reset.

* **You can’t outwork a stressed body.** Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) said cortisol isn’t just “stress” — it’s your body’s emergency alert system. When it’s on 24/7, your immune system tanks, your sleep breaks, your belly grows, and your focus disappears. The fix? Don’t just cut work. Add real safety cues: morning sun exposure, slow walking after meals, and predictable daily structure. You need rhythm, not hustle.
* **Scrolling = low-key panic training.** Dr. Anna Lembke (author of *Dopamine Nation*) calls social media “digital cocaine.” Each scroll trains your brain to expect chaos and unpredictability. That spikes cortisol. Set a dopamine menu: limit doomscrolling to 30 min after dinner. Replace it with “low-cortisol” activities like drawing, slow music, or touching grass. Literally.
* **Don't fix your stress. Fix your blood sugar.** Cortisol spikes when your blood sugar crashes. Even if you're not diabetic. One tip from *Glucose Revolution* by Jessie Inchauspé: Always eat fiber or protein before carbs. Oats + eggs > oats alone. Apple cider vinegar before meals works too. Cortisol doesn’t like sugar spikes.
* **Your brain needs a “threat off switch.”** The *Huberman Lab* podcast recommends cyclic sighing: two short inhales through your nose, one long exhale through the mouth. It’s the fastest way to drop cortisol — faster than meditation. Do it 3 times during work breaks. Instant nervous system reset. Feels weird. Works better than coffee.
* **Perfectionism = silent cortisol trap.** “Productivity” isn’t the problem. Chronic self-pressure is. Psychologist Dr. Nicole LePera calls this “fawning productivity” — when we grind to feel safe or worthy. The fix? Let “good enough” be enough. Ship it messy. Rest like you mean it. High cortisol thrives on guilt.
* **Your bedroom isn’t safe enough (for your brain).** Even dim light messes with melatonin and pushes cortisol up. A *2022 Northwestern study* found that one night of sleeping with a hallway light on raised insulin resistance and cortisol in healthy adults. Blackout curtains. No phone near bed. Night = no light.
* **Alcohol is tricking you.** A chilled glass feels relaxing short-term. But when alcohol wears off, cortisol rebounds hard. That’s why you wake at 3am wired. Matthew Walker (*Why We Sleep*) explains that alcohol blocks REM sleep and makes cortisol spike during the second half of the night. Try magnesium glycinate or reishi tea instead. Better sleep. Lower cortisol.

Sharing some insanely good resources that helped me understand and fix this cortisol chaos:

* **Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle** by Emily & Amelia Nagoski This bestseller blends science and sisterhood. Emily’s a health psychologist. Amelia’s a choral conductor. Together they explain how stress isn’t just in your mind — it’s in your *body*. You have to *complete* the stress cycle to lower cortisol. I cried reading the part on emotional exhaustion. This is *the best book I’ve ever read on how to heal modern stress*.
* **Dopamine Nation** by Dr. Anna Lembke Stanford psychiatrist. Bestseller. Brutally honest about how overstimulation is the real enemy — not laziness. The book made me rethink everything: social media, food, even work. Every chapter hit hard. This book will make you question everything you think you know about “relaxing.”
* **The Huberman Lab Podcast (especially the cortisol & stress series)** He breaks down complex brain science into usable tactics. His deep dives on sleep, stress, and nervous system regulation are gold. Start with the “Controlling Stress & Anxiety” episode. The breathwork protocols and sunlight timing tips changed how I structure my entire day.
* **On Purpose with Jay Shetty: “Why We Burn Out” episode with Mel Robbins** They talk about why cortisol isn’t just about stress — it’s about disconnection. Mel explains how to rebuild rituals of joy and attention in a burnout culture. You’ll leave that episode both emotional and ready to take action.
* **Dr. Andrew D. Huberman on Diary of a CEO YouTube** It’s his most viral interview. 3+ hours of science-backed life design tips. There’s a part where he talks about how trauma stores as physiological activation, and how tools like visual anchoring or cold exposure can release it. I watch this once every few months.
* **BeFreed app.** This is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns books, research, expert talks, and real-world case studies into podcasts and personalized learning plans tailored to your goals. You can choose how deep you want to go — with 10, 20, or 40-minute episodes — and even pick your host’s voice and tone. It learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive study plan over time.
* **YouTube: The Holistic Psychologist** Dr. Nicole LePera's channel explains how trauma, overachieving, and burnout are linked. Her videos on self-soothing and nervous system healing are short, sharp, and validating. Especially helpful if you have a “go-go-go” brain and can’t shut it off.
* **The Comfort Crisis** by Michael Easter This book completely reframed how I think about “stress.” It’s about embracing discomfort to recalibrate your baseline. Think cold exposure, solo hikes, boredom. It’s an adventure book meets science journal. Insanely good read.

Hope this helps someone out there crawling out of the burnout ditch. Cortisol overload is real. But so is recovery.",1,1760150623.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

I liked her a lot more than I expected and invited her back to my place. We watched a movie, fooled around, and she ended up staying the night. We both want to see each other again, but I’m worried I might have given her the wrong impression.

The sex was great, but I don’t want to just be a bootycall in her mind. Likewise, I don’t want her to think that I expect to hookup every time we hang out, or that I wouldn’t like to take her on proper dates. It’s just sorta hard to walk that perception back once you’ve gone all the way.

Obviously, we only went out once. After one date you can hardly even tell if you enjoy someone’s company. It’s just that I liked her enough to want to at least explore the possibility. I feel like if I said any of this I would come off as WAY too needy or attached, so although I’m usually all for honest communication, I think this is the wrong moment.

ive been living the same day everyday for the past 3 years, i wake up, drink coffee, go to school, come back, work on personal stuff and sleep. i wake up the next day to do it all over again. i think this is a common thing among many people, but for my case at least, it feels fruitless, stale and not very fulfilling. 

it’s a boring life. im a boring person as well. i tried to not be boring by doing something unique, and that is making a video game. but ive been constantly stuck working on it over and over again. for that reason, ive fallen behind my peers, those i know online as well i know in person.

only around last month did this really start getting to me, and it has taken a toll on me. my decision-making got worse, i'd start spending so much money on junk or cheap dopamine, i stopped studying consistently, i stopped doing things i like, like drawing. it got really bad.

So at homesense he had a moment of crying bc he was so tired, I was with a friend with helped so much haha I had to hold him and walk around the store while my friend pushed the stroller. So little guy is in the middle of crashing out and some old lady walks down the aisle we’re in and stops and is like oh he’s so little how old?? And I’m like in the middle of try to soothe and calm him down. Then today getting him out of the car seat and into my he carrier he was also having a moment, and a lady walking down the sidewalk stops at my car so close to me again asking how old, and I just like can’t wrap my head around why these ppl seeing my baby having a hard time and me trying to soothe them is a good time to try and converse with me 😭 it’s literally so annoying LOL like I already have anxiety about this exact moment and I’m an introvert like pls stop paying attention to me/us. To the lady at homesense I took a good moment to respond then just said 3 months and walked away lol, then today the lady standing at my car I literally just flat out ignored her🤣 I feel kinda bad now but like seriously go away pls ",1,1760149474.0,firsttimemom,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! 😊
My husband and I are in our late 20s/early 30s,recently got married and moved to downtown toronto.We’ve been missing that “home” vibe lately — good food, easy conversations, and the comfort of being around people who just get it.
We’d love to meet other South Indian couples  to hang out, grab some food, or just chill over coffee.
If you’re also missing that homely connection, we’d love to connect! ❤️

1o3jqhh,https://v.redd.it/hzbyz7955euf1,Grab a Coffee or Tea. We are Catching Flovern!,"I know catching Flovern is mostly a battle of waiting for rain, but it's also a battle of catching (10) in the 15 minutes you have.

I'll break down parts of the video so you have text based explanation of what you are seeing.

The video starts with me refusing to accept that I cannot get on the arch over the lamp posts because I am sure I was up there last time I did this. I eventually move on. Then try one more time and then really move on for real.

I then fail to catch like three in a row due to not being able to get positioned high enough to get to the bubbles.  It's still important to bubble them and create new spawns.

First major tip is bubble spam and stay back.  Wait until the bubble is upon them to advance, even with Keroppi I feel like these bad boys speed up when you get too close.

Next major tip is look for shadows.  You can spam bubbles in the direction of the shadows and then figure out how to position to get where you know they are going even if you haven't seen them yet.

Third tip is use the sound of the bubble capture to time your jumps so you can catch things off screen but use nearby object height to your advantage.

You'll notice that a few minutes in, my spawns stop or all my critters are off the map where I cant get to them so I port back to the peak and jump back down to reset the area.

Fourth tip! Do not get discouraged or invested in any one Flovern.  If it's too high just bubble it and move on. If you miss one just port back up to avoid the long fall and get back into the hunt.

Fifth!  Spam bubbles, sometimes even if you cant see where one is, your bubble will track it down. Follow the bubbles to your prize.  Anticipate height and distance to target and go for it, you might get lucky.

The video is 2x speed, so you dont have to watch the full 15 min rain event.  At the end I show you 24 in my inventory, I had 8 going into this.  It's a long watch an a long read, but hopefully something in here helps make your next Flovern attempts easier.

I believe she is a DA. The breakup was amicable, and we’ve maintained friendship since, though it’s mostly been online chat/social media rather than in person. We were in a relationship for about a year, just over. 

We started with about 2 weeks of zero contact, which she broke, but since then we have some form of interaction most days of the week. I have a really good relationship with her family. 

I never wanted the breakup but I can see how we needed it as we got into a bad cycle we couldn’t break out of. There wasn’t a huge fight or anything. At the time of the breakup she agreed we still be friends and she even said she wouldn’t rule out something happening between us in the future (but also clarified this wasn’t her saying it definitely would too).

The current dynamic between us feels hot and cold. As an example, last week I offered her a voucher I have that is about to expire, and I thought it’d be nice for her and her children to use as I won’t. Her reply was “I’d say we should all use it together (2kids, her and me) but they’re so confused about you it wouldn’t be fair”. Yesterday she mentioned she has something to drop off for me (small gift for a favour I did) so suggested I she give it to me whilst we have a coffee, which she said she’d  let me know. 

This dynamic really confuses me and I just want to get a chance to retry things with us. Would really love some advice on what to do here. Obviously having the kids adds an extra difficulty- I adore them.

My biggest confusion is that I believe she knows I still want more than friendship, but she still is so warm with me yet doesnt take that extra little step to even test the water. Any time I’ve ever had a friend that expressed feelings for me (that I didn’t reciprocate) I ended up pushing them away entirely to the point the friendship dwindled away to nothing. She hasn’t done this. 

Please no comments telling me I should want better- looking for advice on this specific relationship dynamic, and what I can do to give rekindling a chance.

**Part One - Two Grand Richer**

Richard Martin is a prevalent lawyer from Aldie, Virginia. I met him at the wedding of a former client, who invited me out of sincere gratitude for my services. We didn't talk much, he thought I was nothing more than a scam when the groom, William Hebert, praised my work and thanked me endlessly for saving his life. I wasn't phased by the accusations, my work tends to require first-hand spectation of the supernatural to be taken seriously; ironically enough, that same man who called me a sham would unknowingly be tear-stricken on the other end of a phone call not a month later, pleading to me to save him from a demon in the woods.

It was 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon, but even still the phone call startled me awake from the back of my 2013 Jetta, which had been converted into a makeshift bed. Sunlight pierced my eyes as they strained to adjust and my brain slowly comprehended the ringtone of my phone, which had slipped between the car seats. I managed to retrieve my phone just in time to answer the call, wincing in pain at my bandaged hand. Not recognizing the number, I gave your standard introductory script.  
""Hello, this is Konstantin Walker?"" -My father had high expectations for me since birth-  
""Hi-yes-hello? This is the exorcist guy, right?"" The voice on the other end I recognized to be Mr. Martin, sounding shaken.  
""'Exorcist Guy' is certainly...a word for it.""  
""This is Richard Martin, William's lawyer, remember?""  
""Yes, Mr. Martin, how can I help you?""  
""...Look, I still don't know if you're real or not, or if you played William for a fool, or if you actually are what you say, but I'm out of options that don't make me look less foolish. I am staying in a family cottage up in Pennsylvania, and I believe to be bewitched by something....supernatural.""

Mr. Martin begins to explain in loose detail the events of the last few nights, most of which I already knew. He and his ""friend"", a 20-something year-old model straight from a Vogue magazine, were staying up at Martin's lake house in Pennsylvania, which had been built along the Susquehanna river and was heavily secluded from the prying eyes of the press. Martin was going up to take a break from a pretty nasty legal battle he was in with another client while his wife traveled down to visit family in Georgia.  
According to him, the first incident of abnormality was within the first few hours of arrival. He had finished unloading his van and was chatting up his ""friend"" on the balcony of his lake house when a racoon fell from a large tree whose branches draped over the house. It landed right on the railing in front of Martin, but it took him a moment to realize it was a racoon because the unfortunate creature appeared to have been completely skinned, its organs and entrails having dispersed on impact as the two obvious lovers were splattered in it's blood. The Model screamed and ran into the house to rid herself of the bile as Martin instinctively looked up to where the racoon had fallen, only spotting a second racoon, curiously staring at him with emerald eyes.  
The situation only continued to escalate, though not until the dead of night. They had decided to calm their nerves with a nice session of copulation, how a Vogue model found the entanglement with a 65 year-old man pleasurable in any way is beyond me. In the midst of their pleasure, Martin's heart sank to his stomach as he hears the irate voice of his wife outside, screaming accusations of infidelity as her voice approaches the bedroom window. Large thick curtains were drawn over the window, so the entangled duo hastily separated, the model disappearing into another room, as Martin stormed over to the window in anger and confusion. His furious questions as to how she was even here were cut short as he ripped open the curtains; through the window, silhouetted by the moonlight on the lake, was a 7-foot tall figure standing 30 feet away from the house. Darkness unnaturally concealed the figure's entire body, as if their form was shadow itself, but the figure looked masculine, completely nude, and there was an eerie sense that he was staring directly at Martin.  
Fear-stricken and silently awaiting for the man to move, Martin closed the blinds. It was only, but immediately after Martin's view of the man was entirely obscured that Martin heard the shattering of glass from a distant room in the house, followed shortly by the model's screams. Almost instinctively, Martin raced out of the bedroom, continuing to hear the screams as a series of 'thuds' are heard. When he finally finds the room she's in, he finds her completely unconscious, blood swelling from a small abrasion across her forehead. And yet, even with her limp, unconscious body in front of him, Martin continued to hear the model's screams, but it wasn't from the model. In the corner of the room, staring at Martin with anger in his emerald eyes, was a racoon, mimicking the screams of the model at Martin.  
Terrified, Martin raced the way he came, hearing the racoon scamper after him as he retreated into his room and slammed the door shut. He pinned himself against the door as he began to hear something bang furiously on the door; not the racoon, the impacts were high on the door and sounded as if a human was punching the door on the other side.  
""*Heeeeeelllp. Someone pleeease!""* \- the model's voice rasped from the other side of the door, followed by a menagerie of voices as the entity seemed to try different ways to convince Martin to open the door.

This lasted 3 hours.

After 3 grueling hours of holding off this fiend, the voices stopped, the banging stopped, the air was silent. Martin sat in this silence, penetrated only by his own breathing. Finally, Martin took a solemn moment to de-stress, slumping against the door. Even with the threat seemingly vanished, Martin could not help but feel watched. And as Martin anxiously scanned his surroundings, his eyes finally caught sight of an emerald eye peering from a crack in the curtains.  
As soon as Martin saw it, the window curtains lurched forward as glass shattered; the entity had punched through the glass. But as Martin flinched and anticipated his end with a shrill scream, nothing came. Martin looked back to the window, and the figure was gone.

I had set the phone off to the side on speaker, only half listening to Mr. Martin's perspective as I slowly dressed myself and prepared my equipment for the upcoming cleansing of the lake house. I hadn't realized he had finished until I heard a long pause before:  
""....Mr. Walker?"" he asked expectantly  
""Yes, sorry. I'm just... taking in the details. I'm so sorry this has happened. You said this was Sunday? Monday night?""  
""Sunday night. I was hoping it would be a one-night occurrence, but they returned the next night. This time the thing just started shouting in different voices from the woods and staring ominously at me from afar. I can't get the police involved and my friend has left for home, I might do the same-""  
""No. You are dealing with a standard Skinwalker Mr. Martin.""  
\-a pause of comprehension-""A what?""  
""A shaman of dark magic that can shapeshift into animals and even people by stealing their skin.""  
""You're mad, this is nonsense!""  
""If you truly thought so you wouldn't have called. Now, if you leave now, the shaman will follow. It means to steal your life and identity, and each day it remains nearby, it will slowly learn more and more about you until it steals your skin and becomes indistinguishable to you.""  
""So what do I do!?""  
""I'm currently in Scranton, I can be there in an hour. We'll need to cleanse the property so it can not enter and then cleanse you so the Skinwalker can no longer harm you.""  
""And given what I've heard of you, I assume you expect payment for this?""  
""We can discuss payment based on the severity of the situation. Send me your address and I will be on my way.""

I hop on the road over before he even sends me the address and I arrive by 4pm, the already-setting sun accentuating the bronze autumn leaves of the massive tree that towers over the 2-story lake house. Mr. Martin is standing at the door as I arrive, smoking a cigarette with a look of annoyed regret; he already thinks it was a bad idea to call. I walk up and shake his hand as I carry in my leather bag of equipment. He invites me in, offers me coffee which I graciously accept, and he sits at a large oval table in the kitchen as I place the bag on it and ruffle through the contents.  
""Let's cut to the chase, no sugar-coating it. How much are you asking for?"" He asks sternly.  
""Well, given the size of the property and from what you've told me about the Skinwalker, we'll start at 500 for the initial cleansing and another 2k if it's successful-""  
""Two thousand?!"" -He interrupted, frustratingly appalled  
""The 500 is for the resources I use to cleanse you and the area and the 2k is for if I successfully save your life from this shaman.""  
He takes a moment, no doubt contemplating everything he's gone through and weighing the costs. Understanding his frustration, I try to cut a deal.  
""Look, because you're a first-time client, I'll drop the initial payment. You only have to pay me if this works, how's that?""  
""You have returning customers?""  
""Sometimes the same person will encounter a multitude of these entities, it's pretty common.""  
Another pause of contemplation, before-""Fine, two thousand, but *only* if your voodoo works.""  
Rather than clarify the distinction between West-African voodoo and Navajo magic, I respond with an outstretched hand and we shake on the deal.

It only took a half hour to finish all the defenses. The bulk of the ward was made of incense, I placed fancy-looking agarbatti stands in each room, each with an incense stick that filled the area with a pungent odor, but one Mr. Martin would not be able to smell. Since the attack, Martin had covered the two broken windows with cardboard flats, so I took two dream catchers made of river birch and tacked them to each, and placed others at the different entrances around the house. I gave Martin his own ward, it was a weave of river birch emulating an expulsion ward made into a bracelet with silver beads along the strap, which I wrapped around his wrist. Last thing I did was burn some incense around the perimeter. I hate the smell, but I had to be thorough.  
When I finished, I gave him the rundown. The incense burned around the house set the perimeter; you won't be able to smell it, so best not go outside at all. The skinwalker will only be able to enter the area if it was in the area when the perimeter was set, so unless it's hiding somewhere close, you shouldn't have an issue. The dream catchers should ward your mind from the skinwalker, which won't allow it to use new voices from your past, but will still allow it to use the voices and memories it's already used. **Do not go outside** for any reason and **do not speak to it**, don't give it more to work with. If all else fails, the ward on your wrist should repel the skinwalker, whether it's the river birch or the silver. He agreed to everything and told me he'd call tomorrow morning. With that, I packed up my things and left, telling him the skinwalker won't attack if I'm there.

As I left, Martin decided to get some early sleep, wanting to make sure he was wide awake from when the creature inevitably returned. He went to sleep around 5pm, and when he woke up, it was almost 1am. He woke up with a start, frustrated he was out for so long, but soon realized he had woke to a sound. Outside, he heard a voice screaming and pleading for help nearby. My voice.  
""*Martin! Martin please! The thing's here, it's in the fucking incense!*""  
Martin scrambled out of bed, quickly grabbing the rifle as he tried to locate where I was. He eventually made his way to the front door, hearing my cries from the other side.  
""Walker? Is that you?"" He whispered.  
""*Yes please god open the door!*"" I cried out.  
""I thought you left"" His back was towards the door, ear pressed against it as he slowly stretched up to peer through a circular window in the door.  
""*Martin, open the door, now!*"" I started banging on the door  
As Martins eyes made it to the door window, I wasn't there. He kept stretching up, seeing if I was hunched over. Instead, Martin saw a wolf, shaggy ash-grey fur with dried blood caking it in splotches, it's front paws against the door as the wolf slammed it's head against it repeatedly, quickly, the head swinging as if loosely attached.  
""*It's just standing there, please!*"" My voice came from the wolf, but the mouth didn't move as it kept banging on the door. It suddenly stopped, staring at the door, before it's head cocked to the side, it's right eye, emerald green, staring directly up at Martin through the window.  
Horrified, Martin dropped to the floor, breathing heavily with terror with his back against the door, hugging the rifle.  
""*Is that you? I-I-Is that you-is that you? Is that you?*"" The skinwalker began mimicking Martin's voice, adjusting and shifting it's tone and pitch to better match. All the while continuing to banging on the door. Desperately, Martin decided to distance himself from the door, turn around kneeling, and aimed his rifle at the door.  
""*Is that you? Is that you-is that-****OPEN THE DOOR!***"" It continued before screaming in my voice.   
Finally, Martin shot the door, the bullet piercing the door and the sound silencing the air. Martin held his breath, waiting for a voice, a whisper, a sound.







""*Your wards are strong.*"" 

Finally, a voice-Martin's voice-gravelly whispered from the other side of the door.  
""*But time decays, age withers, sanity crumbles. Leave my ancestral home, take your things and run, or I will n e v e r stop. Time decays, age withers, but has no hold on the likes of I. This is your only warning.*""  
A slam, as if bucked by a horse, ripples the door and the footfalls of the wolf trail away. Martin, still poised in fear, drops to the floor with exhaustion and relief.

Martin would not sleep the rest of the night, he stayed awake before finally calling me at 6am with delight. He offered to pay me joyfully, even adding the original 500 to the payment. I listened intriguingly, always finding the other perspective humorous to listen to. But I already knew everything. Unbeknownst to Martin, the wolf ran for another half mile, stopping at the top of a hill looking down at the house. The wolf gagged, mouth agape as two hands-arms reached from inside the wolf, clasping the top and bottom jaw before spreading them open. The jaw tore further and further, skin and muscles tearing and blood splattering everywhere as the wolf was practically split in two. And as they did, I stepped out, blood soaking my underclothes and face. I took a calming breath as I closed my eyes and basked in the moonlight above. I then looked down at Martin's house before turning to leave with a smile, knowing full-well I am now two grand richer than the night before.

I think it’s important start with my red flags.

Some of my green flags because that’s also important. I’m funny, I’m kind. I have superb music taste. I love dive bars and dancing badly in them. I love sports. I make a mean apple pie. I consider myself a glizzy connoisseur.  I’m always down for an adventure but I also love a good night in. I can drink most men under the table and I love beer. (Thanks mom).

Props to whoever is all of these but I know that’s not entirely possibly to find. So I’ll settle for one.

Everyone going through grief has the right to go out and shop, get ready for a dinner, lose themselves in hobbies, go to a new coffee shop, etc, etc. Everyone has the right to do these things, as we are not prisoners, **no one says you can't** but *but* most people can't. They wish they could. They want to be more functioning. Is that why her Stans are saying ""YoU Are So StrOng""? Because they wish they could just be normal after experiencing loss?

 People do want to enjoy their lives and take pleasure in asinine things, and laugh, and judge coffee shops etc.etc.  Those are the sorts of pleasures that having peace of mind enables you to have. 

Again, **Those are the sorts of pleasures that having peace of mind enables you to have.**

Without peace of mind, those experiences are either unattainable, or at best are just a flash in the pan.

What Emilie is communicating by posting her videos is that she has the peace of mind to be able to engage in such things. This is why, we, as viewers, feel disturbed.

I agree that grief isn't linear, but most people aren't able to dip their toe into the enjoyment of random bullshit pond until much later than Emilie has after experiencing such extreme loss. Why not? Because they don't have the peace of mind that would enable them to immerse themselves in any meaningful way.  No amount of therapy would provide that mere months after having your son die due to your own negligence. She's either full of shit and using every morsel of being to fake it, or she's disturbed.
 

Her GRWM video about having dinner at her sister's was more than just a flash in the pan. A flash in the pan 4 months after your son died due to your negligence is mere moments (and that video was probably filmed earlier). *MOMENTS* Like happiness that lasts seconds, or if you're lucky, minutes.
 Her video was much longer than that. She even edited herself sneezing. Did she edit out herself sobbing? How can she, for an hour or more, be superficial and do her makeup and not cry about Trigg? Can she? How can she? That's what we don't understand. That's what I don't understand. 

I don't even understand why she would want to go forward with pretending she can get ready to go out and have dinner totally unfazed.

Thursday morning I woke up with horrific nausea, which I eventually was able to soothe with my walking pad, peppermint tea, and Dramamine. Today the nausea wasn’t as bad but I feel lethargic, I move so slowly as it is so difficult to even do basic movements, and whenever I stand up or cough there is this throbbing pain and pressure in my head that won’t go away. Also my stomach feels so bloated and I feel uncomfortable constantly as I have not had a BM in days (another big concern). Also I constantly have the chills as if I have a fever (which I don’t). Also, my body feels consistently achey and sore. When I go to try and crack my neck and back (as I usually do), it feels painful and my body feels incredibly stiff and I am unable to crack anything. I know it’s only day 2 but this discomfort has been non stop and I wasn’t able to go into work yesterday or today because the symptoms have been so bad. All I can seem to do is lie in bed. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice? I can’t imagine having to feel like this for weeks or months on end, I won’t be able to function at work or have a social life, and unfortunately I have to work and I have several social/family commitments in the next few weeks to attend. Also I need to wash my hair this weekend but I fear if I continue to feel like this, I won’t be able to (I have really long wavy hair and washing and drying my hair takes several hours).

So far I have purchased ginger chews, miralax, metamucil, fiber gummies, pepto bismol, gas-x and aloe water per some suggestions under previous posts.

For additional info:

I’m 27 years old, female, 5’1”, and ~ 160 lbs. I was started on 0.25. I have at least 64 oz of electrolyte water daily, plus magnesium and a probiotic at night. 

The first day I started the medication I had black coffee (cold brew), ate smoked salmon, a protein bar, some dried mango, then nachos and ice cream later (I didn’t realize how big of a no- no that is lol).

Yesterday I had one bite of banana, then plant based meatballs, some mashed potatoes and green peas with lingonberry sauce, a few bites of coconut rice and a few bites of dairy-free frozen yogurt.

Today all I have had are some saltines and a protein shake and nausea lozenges today, plus ibuprofen, (as well as my magnesium and probiotic and my electrolyte water; same as the other days).

Thank you so much in advance, any tips would be so appreciated as I am feeling absolutely miserable 😭🙏

What’s annoying is that no matter how strict i was, what meds i was on (im on ppi twice daily, sucralfate, i take dgl) i was still feeling the same discomfort. 

Well, the past 7 days i just said fuck it, started eating a lot more, snacking often, eating arguably unhealthy foods. Drank some coffee (i know this is bad but i missed coffee so bad).
And my symptoms are just, often times nonexistent. My stomach feels better.

A jukebox in the corner played some old song I couldn’t quite place, and sunlight streamed through the windows in long golden stripes.

I remember stirring sugar into a cup of coffee, watching the crystals swirl and vanish. My brother sat across from me, smiling, and for a moment it felt like the most ordinary morning in the world. Then, without warning, the seat was empty. One blink and he was gone. I even caught myself laughing at something. I don’t remember what, only that it was like i was still in the middle of a perfectly normal conversation that had already ended.

When I glanced at the window, i was startled, the reflection wasn’t mine. It was a tall, thin man in a wide-brimmed hat, sitting where no one was. The hat tipped forward, hiding his face, but I knew somehow that he was looking at me.

Before I could react, the sound of the jukebox warped, slowing down into a low, droning hum. The light in the diner flickered out, leaving only shadow...

I woke in the dead of night, heart pounding so hard I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. At first, I thought it was just another dream. Only this time it was vivid, and too in the moment. That's when I realized I couldn’t move. My chest felt like it was pinned down by something heavy, and when I tried to scream, not even a breath escaped.

The silence in my room was thick, unnatural. 

That’s when I saw it.

In the far corner, darker than the shadows around it, stood a figure. Tall, thin, still. The brim of a wide hat cut a sharp line across its face, hiding everything but a suggestion of eyes.  These eyes glowed faintly, not with light, but with attention. They were locked on me.

I tried to convince myself it was just my dresser, or a trick of the dark. But the longer I stared, the more the shadows seemed to bleed outward, stretching across the walls, reaching toward me.

Then it moved.

Not with footsteps, but with a slow, gliding motion that carried it closer without sound. The air grew colder. My breath frosted in front of me, even though I couldn’t move to turn away. It leaned down, until the brim of that hat nearly brushed my face, and I felt the weight of it press against my chest.

Just when I thought I’d suffocate under that impossible pressure, it whispered though not with sound. The words bloomed inside my skull, cold and final:

“You see me now. And once you see me, I never leave.”

The weight vanished. My body lurched free. I gasped, sat up, and scrambled for the light.

But the corner where it had stood wasn’t empty.

The hat still waited, resting neatly on my nightstand.",1,1760147648.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

 I attract the deeply wounded, the controlling, and the people who think therapy is an insult.

Scene 1: I Walk Into a Room…

I’m just being me—maybe a little intense, laser-focused on my new interest (canning fermented pickles while learning five historical dialects of Ojibwe and reorganizing the cutlery drawer by emotional attachment).

Suddenly… they appear.

You know who I mean:
 • The person with unresolved childhood trauma who wants to be adored, validated, and obeyed.
 • The one who sees other people’s autonomy as a threat.
 • The one who thinks boundaries are a form of betrayal.

And for reasons unknown to them, they can’t stop focusing on me.

Why? Let’s Break It Down with Psychology

(Yes, this is real. Yes, it’s fascinating. Yes, I will absolutely get distracted while explaining.)

🧠 1. AudHD authenticity disrupts the trauma script
 • People with trauma, especially those with narcissistic traits or codependent tendencies, often live in roles.
 • “I’m the caretaker.”
 • “I’m the victim.”
 • “I’m the one who fixes everything.”
 • But AudHD folks?
 • We don’t play roles—we exist. Authentically. Weirdly. Loudly. Honestly.
 • This shatters the unspoken rules of trauma-driven dynamics.
We don’t fall into “emotional hierarchy.” We say “why?” We say “no.” We stim. We info-dump. We overshare and forget we overshared.

 That kind of raw authenticity is like throwing a wrench into the well-oiled trauma machine.
And the wrench is covered in glitter.

🧠 2. We reflect unresolved emotional work (without trying)

Studies show that people with narcissistic tendencies are often hyper-attuned to rejection, shame, and emotional unpredictability—because their emotional development got stunted by trauma (e.g., Gabbard, 2005; Kernberg, 1984).

AudHD people?
 • We unintentionally reject social norms.
 • We forget small talk.
 • We don’t notice power games.
 • We interrupt. We mask. We unmask. We stim mid-conversation.
 • We accidentally say, “Why are you being weird?” to someone who thinks they’re in charge.

 That’s not just socially confusing for them.
It’s ego annihilation.

🧠 3. We radiate unpredictability—and wounded egos hate that
 • Narcissistic people often use predictable dynamics to feel safe and in control (Millon & Davis, 1996).
 • But someone with ADHD might:
 • Start sweeping and end up alphabetizing condiments.
 • Say “sure I’ll help!” then forget entirely because they hyperfocused on reorganizing a Lego bin from 2002.
 • Cry because a raccoon looked at them with judgment, then immediately give a TED Talk on trauma healing through mushroom foraging.

 AudHD people are emotionally and cognitively nonlinear.
And for someone stuck in trauma loops and control patterns, that’s like watching a cat type on a keyboard—terrifying and somehow personal.

Scene 2: Why They Can’t Let Me Be
 • “You need help staying on task.”
 • “Let me organize that for you.”
 • “If you just followed my system…”
 • “Are you always like this?”

They need to fix me.
They need to figure me out.
Because if they can’t, then it means not everything can be controlled, and that reality is too painful for them to face.

 My existence is a constant reminder that healing is possible—
but only if you let go of control.

I didn’t do anything. I just sat down, spilled my coffee, and emotionally bonded with a bird out the window.

But to them? I’m a walking Rorschach test.
They see chaos. Or defiance. Or… freedom.

Scene 3: The Twist Ending

Here’s the plot twist they didn’t expect:

I’m not broken. I’m brilliant.
 • I notice patterns others miss.
 • I feel deeply.
 • I survive sensory hellscapes daily and still find time to comfort crying strangers at Walmart.
 • I create systems that actually work for me, not for imaginary audiences in my head.

And while they’re busy trying to “fix” me to soothe their own discomfort, I’m out here building compost systems, hyperfixating on trauma-informed practice, and developing emotional intelligence at a level they haven’t even downloaded yet.

Moral of the Story:

If you’re AudHD, you are:
 • A walking honesty grenade in a world full of masks.
 • A glitch in the Matrix of Performative Stability.
 • A lighthouse for wounded people who haven’t healed—and sometimes, a disco ball of anxiety for people trying to control what they refuse to face.

But most of all?

You are proof that living out loud, imperfectly, and neurospicily isn’t just possible—it’s powerful.

So keep being you.

Let them stare. Let them spiral.
And remember:

 You didn’t attract them to fix you.
You attracted them because, somehow, you reminded them that freedom is real.

THE END.

“During my 15 years as a detective, my partner retired and I had to partner up with the department's most proficient and loved detective, Hartmann. Hartmann is known for his introverted and stubborn nature, so I was already dreading what he had to say about me working with him. While walking through the old run down precinct on a rainy morning, I head to his desk in the bullpen. He seemed to be absorbed in his own paperwork, He looks up at me and speaks

Detective Hartmann: 
“I guess we're partners now. I just hope you're able to do your part well.""

Detective Hartmann leaves his seat to make himself a cup of coffee.

Detective Hartmann 
""We've been underfunded lately, because the Mayor is using the tax money to enjoy his 7th vacation while the city goes to hell. Typical politician bullshit."" He said ith a hint of bitterness in his voice.

Sam Lovethrone:
“To my surprise he’s actually affable despite his introverted nature.”

Detective Hartmann: “The captain told me before he passed out drunk in his office, that you've been working on this job for 15 years. The more experienced the better. So more about you, Lovethrone. What's your story?”

Sam Lovethrone: Well I was born and raised here and I've got a loving wife and a daughter.  My first wife passed away from an illness You?

Detective Hartmann: “Well, I was also born here as well. Well my parents have been long gone, but I was adopted by a sweet couple who was infertile. I never got a chance to meet my grandparents either. And I rather keep it that way” he says while grabbing his mug tightly

Sam Lovethrone: “Are you related to the elderly man who shot a younger man for “breaking in”? I remember it quite vividly in a newspaper when I was turning 15. “

Detective Hartmann: “No I am not.” He says quietly. 

Detective Lovethrone: I could tell he was lying, and I seem to have struck something with the question. I don't want to make him feel worse with the questioning. After a couple of minutes, our Captain stumbles in drunk as a skunk.

Captain James: “Hartmann, Lovethrone, there's a report of a man found dead in his own hotel room, get out there and solve it!”

Detective Hartmann: “We're on it, Cap.” Come on, Lovethrone.”

I grab my coat and walk with my partner. The rain and clouds paint the sky a bleak gray, and reminds me of my wife. She always loved the rain. While heading down stairs, I realized I don't have my umbrella, but I headed outside of the precinct to see my partner waiting for me with his umbrella. 

Detective Hartmann: “Here, I noticed you forgot your umbrella, we can share it .”

After slowly walking with my partner in the rain, we head into an old beat up car. Presumably issued by the station. 

Detective Hartmann: ""It''s not much, but the heater and AC works. The body was found in the bad part of town. He was found by a female witness. We should go talk with her after we observe the crime scene.”

Chapter 2 
After pulling up into the crime scene we find the bloody scene. There's a look of  anguish while his limbs are twisted in an uncanny way. The body was as stiff as a board, so he has been dead for at least a few hours. From close examination, my partner found multiple stab wounds that made it look like he was killed by a wild animal. Whoever did this really must've hated him to brutally murder him. 

Detective Hartmann: ""Look what I found. It looks to be a letter  so I guess we have a case of insurance fraud as well. Check it out""

I grab the paper for the insurance claim and read it. 

Detective Lovethrone: ""1000$ Dollars. Jesus Christ, you're right Hartmann. I'll run the names through R&I.""

After the whole insurance claim, I noticed something on the nightstand in the dilapidated hotel room. There's a broken window, a match box to a bar.

1o3itnj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3itnj,Got a little too excited with new roasters… and now I’m buried in beans 🤷🏼😅,"Decided to branch out and try some roasters I’ve never had before — definitely overdid it this time. My partner and I only go through about 30g/day total, so roughly 210g a week, meaning most of these bags will last a little over a week each.

Based on the roast dates, I’m planning to rest each coffee for up to ~14 days post-roast, then freeze until it’s their turn on deck. Curious what you guys think of that plan — and if anyone has feedback or tasting experiences with any of these coffees!

1o3irrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/jawsurgery/comments/1o3irrf/six_weeks_down_and_here_is_what_i_have_learned/,Six weeks down and here is what I have learned!,"This might be long so I want to use bullets to make it easier to read. I dunno. Maybe this will help someone.

What items truly helped my recovery:

(seriously I did not need more than this... no red light therapy masks... no specific therapeutic methods etc just a surgery on a budget and the basics to keep me sane and healthy!)

\- condiment squeeze bottles were a must! I never bothered with a syringe just straight to the squeeze tubes.

\- baby toothbrush is super helpful when you can hardly open your mouth

\- ice roller feels amazing and who knows maybe it helped with my swelling that seemed to go down fast enough that my surgeons complimented me at every appointment

\- arnica tablets and cream for swelling and bruising! I hardly had bruising last longer than a week and it was only yellow bruising on my chest and neck.

\- bottles and bottles of children's liquid Tylenol and ibuprofen. I had to alternate for much longer than others because I was unfortunately in pain after the surgery. going to the shop to get more was very inconvenient and I wish I had stocked up

\- handheld mirror. I did become obsessive with checking my appearance which was not helpful, but it made eating and drinking mush safer and easier.

\- blender

\- back reading pillow with a handful of pillows propped against it and under my arms so I could not roll around (I did once week one and woke up in blood so highly recommend this)

\- the tattoo squeeze bottles (I don't know what else they are called) are helpful for rinsing your mouth out after meals

\- crossword puzzles were helpful for keeping my mind distracted. a coloring book too! I had to make an effort to force myself to do them. my mental state was not that great in the beginning

\- paper towels/ rags/ wet wipes were enough for me to feel cleanly. I didn't bother with a bib at all and luckily didn't drool or anything like that

\- jaw bra that can alternate cold/ heat packs. I did three days ice then straight to heat and I think that helped my swelling immensely

\- Boost high calorie shakes/ premier protein shakes. they're expensive and I hated feeling like I was wasting my money but I truly didn't lose that much weight and I was horrified that I would as a 105lb woman. I counted, and am still counting, my calories every day. the Boosts I knew of because they're given to eating disorder patients and work well

What I purchased/ was given that didn't help:

\- whiteboards for communicating/ drawing. the drawing aspect was nice for my sister and me, but I could talk after surgery. I sounded ridiculous but my loved ones understood me. felt like a waste of money

\- my friends brought me loads of books, coloring books, and puzzles and I honestly have not been able to even touch half of them because this surgery really takes it out of you cognitively/ mentally. so maybe only have 2-3 to cycle through. I feel like I have a surplus that's going to waste... maybe I will donate them

\- I subscribed to a streaming service anticipating I would watch a lot of tv but in reality I didn't have the bandwidth and either slept, went for a walk, or scrolled on my phone (which I would recommend putting a time limit on)

\- prune juice in bulk. complete waste of money. I didn't consider coffee as a good option, but in three or four days I was able to pass stool and never used any assistance

\- a plethora of supplements. turns out a lot of supplements are HUGE and I still at six weeks can't open my mouth wide enough to take them. I used a mortar and pestle for my painkillers and I never again want to syringe powdered medicines into my mouth.

What I have learned:

\- advocate for yourself! seriously! this surgery is so arduous and recovery is long. if you feel like something is wrong... speak up! I know it is uncomfortable, but I had two infections post-op that my surgeons didn't believe were infections until I pestered them over and over to check. I had to get them irrigated. not necessarily shaming my docs, because blood clots and things can mimic an infection, but you know your body best. this came up again when I was experiencing excruciating pain and ended up in the ER several nights in a row. I had a fracture from a bad split, again not shaming my docs because that can happen unfortunately, but they did not understand the severity until I was in the hospital. if something seems dire, go to the hospital, call your doctor, pester them with questions. oh and take a friend with you to every post-op appt! this helped those around me remind me of what the docs would tell me (painkillers gave me horrible memory and spaciness)

\- kefir was incredibly helpful for me through three rounds of antibiotics to keep my gut biome happy

\- community. I don't have many friends. most of my friendships are long distance. but I am lucky to live close to my sister who took care of me for the first couple weeks. this surgery brought us so much closer together. reach out to your people even if that means multiple short phone calls a day. I did not do well when I was on my own. my thoughts got dark quickly and I am so grateful I had people to help me get grounded

\- asking for help is inevitable. it's uncomfy and you face the fear of rejection or inconveniencing someone, but it's important that you don't lift heavy things, climb stairs alone, go for long walks alone, get out of bed if you feel super out of it or weak, etc. plus, pushing through the discomfort helps you grow in the long run. I feel a lot more comfortable asking those around me for help.

\- limit your social media use and this sub. this sub nearly destroyed my mental state for the first two weeks reading the horror stories, especially as someone with so many post-op complications. it was all my doing but jeez. I had to literally block the url from my cell AND my computer

\- having an able-body is such a beautiful and incredible thing that I never want to take for granted ever again. I get emotional talking to people about it. I didn't realize how difficult it would be to not be able to speak properly, eat, use the restroom on my own early on, clean my clothes, go for a walk... music is my passion and I didn't listen to music for two weeks because it was too emotional for me. not being able to sing along to a song made me sob in the canned soup aisle the first time I went to the grocery store and Elton John came on the radio... I have a newfound love and appreciation for my body for carrying me through life and giving me so many opportunities. I have lived a fearful life in some ways and a carefree one in others... Example: I loved cigarettes, vaping, and going to the bars with friends on weekends and not taking care of my body... but I was afraid of going to a community event alone. I was afraid to put on a pair of rollerskates and give that a go. I was afraid to try new recipes in the kitchen in fear I'd mess up and fail. Now I can't wait to cook. I can't wait to go to community events (even booked a solo sewing class). Etc. this confidence isn't even due to an improved look, it's due to the fact that I have a body that I now appreciate and want to care for.

If you are going through this and finding yourself in the pits of darkness... you will probably hate to hear me say it gets better... but it does. truthfully at six weeks I am still struggling mentally. I want to eat so bad. I was never food oriented before, but now I crave food. I am behind in recovery due to my fracture, but hopeful it's continuing to get better.

1o3iqbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoanMarketing/comments/1o3iqbt/how_to_earn_passive_income_a_simple_guide_for/,"How To Earn Passive Income, A Simple Guide for Beginners","# What if I told you that you could make money while watching Netflix or even sleeping?

Sounds like one of those “get rich quick” YouTube ads, right? But here’s the truth — **earning passive income** isn’t a myth. It’s real, achievable, and something I wish I’d started earlier. The catch? It takes effort upfront, a bit of patience, and knowing what actually works. So, if you’ve ever asked yourself **“how to earn passive income?”**, this is your friendly, no-nonsense guide to getting started.

# What Is Passive Income (Really)?

Let’s clear up the confusion first. **Passive income** doesn’t mean doing *nothing* and magically becoming rich. Nope. It means putting in work once — setting up a system — and then letting that system make money for you with minimal ongoing effort.

Think of it like this: you build a vending machine, stock it up once, and then watch people buy snacks all day while you’re out living life. That’s the dream.

There’s a big difference between **active income vs passive income**:

* **Active income** = trading your time for money (your job, freelancing, etc.)
* **Passive income** = setting up something that earns while you’re not working

The goal is simple: make your money (and time) work *for* you instead of the other way around.

# Why You Should Care About Passive Income

Let me be blunt — relying on one paycheck is risky. Companies can downsize. Freelance gigs can dry up. And inflation? Yeah, it’s not exactly your friend.

**Passive income gives you options.**

* You get more financial stability
* You gain freedom from the 9-to-5 grind
* You build long-term wealth without burning out

And trust me, even if you start small, the results add up faster than you’d think. Imagine earning a few hundred bucks a month from something you set up once — sounds nice, right?

# The Best Passive Income Streams for Beginners

Okay, so let’s talk about where to start. These are **realistic passive income ideas** that don’t need a finance degree or a million-dollar investment.

# 1. Affiliate Marketing (My Personal Favorite)

If you’ve got a blog, YouTube channel, or even a decent social following, **affiliate marketing** is one of the easiest ways to earn money passively.

Here’s the idea: you promote products using a special link. When someone buys through your link, you earn a commission. That’s it.

**Why it works:**

* You don’t need your own product
* You can start with zero cost
* It’s scalable — the more content you post, the more you earn

**Pro Tip:** Focus on products you actually use or believe in. People can spot fake recommendations from a mile away.

# 2. Passive Income Blogging in 2025

Blogging still works in 2025 (despite what people say). The trick is to treat your blog like a business. You pick a niche, post consistently, optimize for SEO, and monetize with ads or affiliate links.

**Here’s how it grows into a passive income machine:**

1. Write evergreen content (like this guide 😉)
2. Add affiliate links or display ads
3. Watch your posts bring in traffic — and income — for years

If you’re passionate about a topic like **fitness**, **tech**, or **travel**, blogging is a long-term win.

# 3. Investing in Dividend Stocks or ETFs

Want your money to literally make more money? **Dividend investing** is your best friend. You buy shares in companies that regularly pay dividends, and every quarter, you get a nice little payout.

It’s one of the most traditional **passive income from investments** methods — steady, low-effort, and smart for long-term wealth.

**Quick tips:**

* Stick to reputable companies with consistent dividend history
* Reinvest your dividends to compound your growth
* Use low-fee platforms or apps to manage your portfolio

# 4. Real Estate Investing (Even Without Owning Property)

Wait, real estate without buying a house? Yep. Thanks to **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**, you can invest in real estate without dealing with tenants or toilets.

**REITs** work like this:

* You buy shares in a real estate company
* They manage the properties
* You get paid dividends from rental income

It’s one of the most popular **passive income real estate investing** options for beginners — and it doesn’t require a six-figure budget.

# 5. Create a Digital Product or Online Course

If you’re good at something — anything — you can teach it. Maybe you’re great at photography, fitness, or cooking keto meals (I see you). Package your knowledge into a **digital course or eBook** and sell it online.

Platforms like Teachable, Udemy, or Gumroad make it super easy. Once it’s uploaded, it keeps earning even while you’re asleep.

**Why it’s great:**

* You build it once and sell it forever
* Zero inventory or shipping
* Scales infinitely

[👉 Create your first digital product and start earning today.](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/361682/andi271982/)

# 6. Try Passive Income Apps (Yes, They Exist)

If you’re in the USA, there are several **passive income apps** that let you earn small but steady cash streams by doing almost nothing.

**Examples:**

* **Honeygain** (share your internet connection for credits)
* **Swagbucks** (earn from surveys, videos, and shopping)
* **Acorns** (round up your spare change into investments)

They won’t make you rich, but they can cover your coffee habit — or at least your Netflix subscription :)

# 7. Start a YouTube Channel

No, you don’t need to be the next MrBeast. You just need consistency. YouTube pays through ad revenue, affiliate links, and sponsorships.

If you make content that people actually search for — tutorials, reviews, or even lifestyle tips — it can become a goldmine over time.

**Quick reminder:** It takes time to grow, but once your videos start ranking, the income keeps rolling in.

# 8. Peer-to-Peer Lending

This one’s for people who like the idea of being the bank. Through **P2P lending platforms**, you lend money to individuals or small businesses and earn interest on repayments.

It’s a higher-risk option, sure, but the returns can be great if you diversify wisely.

**FYI:** Always use reputable platforms and only invest what you can afford to lose.

# 9. Sell Stock Photos or Footage

Got a camera or even a smartphone with a decent lens? You can make money uploading photos to stock sites like Shutterstock or Adobe Stock.

Each time someone downloads your photo, you earn royalties. Over time, a large portfolio can bring in steady income.

**Pro Tip:** Focus on high-demand niches — like business, fitness, food, or travel photography.

# 10. Build a Print-on-Demand Store

If you’re creative but don’t want to deal with inventory, **print-on-demand** is perfect. You design t-shirts, mugs, or hoodies, and the platform prints and ships them for you.

Every sale earns you a profit without lifting a finger. Sites like Redbubble, TeeSpring, and Printify make setup super easy.

[👉 Start your print-on-demand business today.](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/361682/andi271982/)

# How To Start If You Have Little (or No) Money

No cash? No problem. Many **passive income ideas with no money** exist — you just trade your time or creativity instead.

Try these budget-friendly routes:

* **Blogging** with free platforms like WordPress.com
* **Affiliate marketing** using social media
* **Creating YouTube videos** with your phone
* **Selling eBooks or printables** with Canva and Gumroad

The real currency here is consistency. You can scale your efforts later once you start earning.

# Passive Income for Students

Students often think passive income is out of reach, but honestly, it’s the best time to start. You’ve got time, flexibility, and creativity on your side.

**Best picks for students:**

* Start a niche blog about college life
* Sell digital study guides or templates
* Try affiliate marketing for student-friendly products
* Use cash-back and passive income apps

Build the foundation now, and by graduation, you’ll already have a steady side income. Pretty cool, huh?

# Passive Income and Retirement — A Smart Combo

If you’re planning ahead, **passive income retirement strategies** can make a massive difference. Whether it’s dividend stocks, rental income, or online ventures, the goal is simple: replace your working income with automated income.

That way, you don’t just retire — you *thrive*.

# Common Mistakes Beginners Make

Let’s be real. Most people quit before they see results. So, here’s what to avoid:

* **Expecting instant money:** Passive income takes time.
* **Spreading too thin:** Focus on one or two income streams first.
* **Skipping research:** Don’t follow trends blindly. Do your homework.
* **Ignoring reinvestment:** Use your profits to grow faster.

Consistency beats luck every single time.

# My Honest Take (and a Quick Reality Check)

I’ve tested plenty of these methods, and here’s the thing — **passive income is 100% real**, but it’s not “effort-free.” You’ll need patience, trial, and a bit of creative thinking.

But once it’s set up? It’s incredibly satisfying to see money roll in while you’re doing literally anything else — gym, travel, or sleeping.

So, don’t overthink it. Pick one strategy, commit for 6 months, and see where it takes you.

[👉 Here’s a great starting point if you’re ready to take action.](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/361682/andi271982/)

# Final Thoughts

If you’ve made it this far, congrats — you’re officially more informed than 90% of people googling “how to earn passive income.”

To wrap it up:

* **Start small, think long-term**
* **Be consistent, not perfect**
* **Automate, optimize, and enjoy the freedom**

You don’t need fancy tools or a huge bankroll to start. Just curiosity, commitment, and a little hustle.

1o3ipbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1o3ipbl/my_girlfriends_bizarre_secretiveness_was_driving/,My girlfriend's bizarre secretiveness was driving me insane. The truth was not what I expected.,"For the past month, my girlfriend started acting… weird. We've been together for three years, and things have always been super open and easy. But suddenly, it was like a switch flipped. Her phone, which used to be left on the coffee table for hours, was now permanently attached to her hand and angled away from me. She’d take calls in the other room, closing the door behind her, and I'd hear muffled, hurried whispering. My heart would just sink.

My mind, of course, went straight to the worst-case scenario. I started noticing every little thing. The late nights 'finishing up work,' the way she'd slam her laptop shut whenever I walked into the room. I was driving myself crazy, replaying every interaction, looking for clues. The knot in my stomach was my constant companion, and I started feeling this cold, creeping distance growing between us that was entirely of my own making.

Last night, I hit my breaking point. She was on her laptop again, furiously typing, with that same intense, focused look on her face. I just stood in the doorway and said, 'What are you doing?' The way she jumped and fumbled to close the lid… it broke my heart. I was ready for the confession, the excuses, the whole painful ordeal. I braced myself for the worst.

But she just looked at me with wide, panicked eyes and slowly turned the laptop around. She wasn't texting another guy. She was on a website-builder, surrounded by tabs for 'HTML for Dummies' and 'Graphic Design Basics.' On the screen was a clunky, half-finished but incredibly beautiful website for my stupidly niche side-hustle: restoring old vintage radios. She had written an 'About Me' page that made me sound like a genius and was trying to design a logo. The 'late nights' were her staying up after I went to bed to learn how to do it all from scratch for my birthday. I just stood there, speechless, feeling like the world's biggest idiot and the world's luckiest man all at once.

So, Reddit, have you ever been completely, catastrophically wrong about a partner's 'shady' behavior? What’s the most wholesome secret they were keeping from you?",1,1760145443.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1o3ip29,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1o3ip29/this_little_piggy/,This Little Piggy,"“Why are they pushing peanut butter so hard right now?” A question I asked myself today, as I learned Chicago-style egg rolls have peanut butter in them online. Followed by a separate media platform featuring the recipe for peanut butter-maple syrup for waffles. Then I bought Peanut M&M’s— so it’s working.

What do market and viral food trends say about the geopolitical environment? Or if we push the analysis even further- what does it imply about the future food desert before us? Yes, I meant “desert” not “dessert.”

Since Covid-19, food prices have increased exponentially. Rate of inflation for food rose to 11% in August of 2022, the highest since 1979. It has continued to rise 3% each year. A simpler view: groceries have gone up 29% since the beginning of 2020 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The inflation rate affects different food products more severely. These includes meat, poultry, fish, and eggs having the highest inflation rate, and cereals and grain products with the lowest inflation rate.

Pricing steers the consumer to purchase products that are either a necessity, or substitute staples with more affordable options. As animal products become more expensive, alternatives are brought to market.

For example, the Avian flu H5N1 took out flocks and raised eggs prices. Those who could afford to pay nearly $16 a dozen were in the minority. Over 30% of Americans stopped buying eggs altogether.

Tariffs increase the prices of imported products like bananas and coffee, which have few domestic options as replacements. Price-friendly supplemental proteins, like imported fish and shellfish also rose in cost, as much as 130%. 

For those of us who were once starving college students, I ask you to remember your grocery list. Mine was simple, mostly microwaveable. It included: white cheddar Pasta-Roni, margarine (butter was too expensive), Oriental Flavor Ramen, peanut butter granola bars, mandarin orange fruit cups (to prevent the ever-dreaded scurvy), generic Nutella, and pretzel sticks.

In retrospect, this is a bunker diet. Plant based, mainly dairy-free, does not require refrigeration. More importantly, it is not balanced or nutritious.

The foods that are becoming accessible to the American public, or let’s say the 30% that stopped buying eggs during the Avian Flu, are the affordable foods. The food less affected by inflation are shelf-stable, processed carbohydrates and plant-based proteins like peanut butter. Which apparently, I am stuck on. George Washington Carver, thank you.

Because this is the food climate where I believe we are headed. The diet our guts are being guided toward, those of us who are working class. There are factions who believe we are being introduced into consuming insects, like cricket flour, for nefarious purposes. But I view this plotted, omnivorous map as one leading to a kind of “bunker life.” They are training us for less and less.

Maybe they are preparing us for a lockdown lifestyle again? But a longer quarantine, without the factory farms and ports fully operational. Perhaps our electrical grid is more susceptible to go haywire than we ever knew, and we will need to be prepared to live on non-perishables. 

If the above happens, many of us have been eating more and more poorly since 2022– so maybe our tastebuds will forget the taste of an organic, unctuous avocado quickly. Because hangry people are hard to control.",0,1760145420.0,conspiracy,1,0.43,False

I’m a liaison for the Veterans House, and I’m working on a project to help support our local veteran community. A big challenge for many vets, especially student vets, is economic instability. I’m trying to compile a master list of all stores, restaurants, and services in the Columbus/OSU area that offer a military or veteran discount. The goal is to create a single, easy-to-access resource we can share with vets to help them navigate and save money locally.

Instead of just cold-calling businesses, I figured the hivemind of Reddit would be way more effective! Do you know of any places around town that offer a discount? Anywhere from coffee shops and grocery stores to car repair places and movie theaters. Every bit helps!

Please comment with any spots you know of, and if you have the details:

Business Name:

Location (General area or specific address):

What the discount is (e.g., ""10% off,"" ""free appetizer with entree""):

Any requirements (e.g., ""active duty only,"" ""veterans included,"" ""only on Mondays""):

For example: ""Texas Steel on High St. does 10% off for vets and active duty with an ID.""

I’ll take all the info from the comments and compile it into a clean, organized list to share back with this community and, most importantly, with the veterans at OSU and in the area.

My Sons Imaginary Friend

My son just turned 5 this year. As a single dad I’m glad to put him into school now. It gives me more quiet time to work without him coming into my home office to ask questions. Around halfway through the school year I noticed he started telling me about his imaginary friend he made. He would make me set the table for 3 so his friend could eat with us. I had no problem with it. The next day I was getting him around for school when my son said something slightly alarming. “I made a new friend today dad.” 
“Oh yeah?” 
“Yeah, he’s a little weird though, and he’s not so nice to my other friend.” 
“Why is he weird?” 
“He’s got white eyes.” 
“Huh, that is weird buddy. You ready to get going?” 
“Yup.” My son said with a smile. I disregarded his comment, and put my son in the truck. When I got to work my coworkers and I got talking by the water cooler. It was nice catching up with them considering I only came into the office once a week. “How’s Jax doing?”
“He’s doing good. He’s having a hard time making friends at school. He’s got a few imaginary friends he says lives with us.” 
“Woahhhh buddy. Haha. Hopefully no one died in that house.”
“What do you mean?” 
“Well normally, ya know, when little kids have an imaginary friend it’s like a ghost or something.” 
“Haha. Okay man.” 
“I’m serious. You should look it up or something.” 
“Nah man, I’m not worried about it. It’s probably just him coping with not having any real life friends.” 
“Okay man…. I’m just saying if you come to work and are acting weird, im just going to assume you’re possessed.” 
“Okay man, whatever.” I completely disregarded the stupid comment. After work I  picked up Jax. He jumped in the car with an unusual excitement. “I made a friend today dad!” 
“That’s great buddy! What’s his name?” 
“His name is James. He said he lives close by us.” 
“That’s great buddy! Maybe you could have him over sometime.” Jax nodded in excitement. When we got home Jax set his bag down and ran to his room. “I have to tell Todd about my new friend.” He ran off giggling the whole way. I started on dinner while he was in his room. He ended up staying in there for a while before coming out. When he finally did he was crying. “What’s going on buddy?” 
“Todd said that I can’t be friends with James. When I asked him why, he slapped me.” Jax turned his head to the side. A small red mark highlighted is tiny face. “How did you get that mark buddy?” 
“I told you. Todd hit me.” 
“Where is Todd?” 
“He’s still in my room.” I walked past Jax into his room. I rounded the corner around his door and just barely caught a figure slide into the closet. My heart dropped. I ran over to the closet door and ripped it fully open. Children’s clothes swayed back and forth taunting me. “What the fuck.” 
“What’s that mean?” I turned to see Jax standing behind me. “Don’t worry about it. You’re sleeping in my room tonight.” 
That night I tucked Jax into my bed. I walked around to the other side and laid down. The weight of the day slowly took my consciousness. My eyes dropped slowly. I dreamt that night. I was laying in my bed. On the floor near my door Jax and another little boy were playing with their matchbox cars. The other boy was facing away from me. “Jax? What are you doing buddy.” He didn’t acknowledge me. The other little boy stood up. He turned to me. His eyes were white like a corpse. He walked over to the edge of my bed, just inches away from my face. “He’s mine.” He hissed at me in a deep voice. I jumped awake. The room was dark but my eyes had adjusted enough to see a figure sitting on the ground by the door. I flicked on my bedside lamp to see Jax playing with his cars facing me. “Jax, what are you doing dude? Go back to bed.” 
“But Todd told me to play with the cars so he could talk to you.” 
“What?” 
“Todd, he woke me up and told me to play with my cars while he had a word with you.” I took the cars from Jax and put him back in the bed. I sat on the couch in the living room watching TV the rest of the night. As much as I didn’t want to say it, that dream bothered me deeply. The next morning I dropped Jax off at school and immediately began researching my house. I found that it was built 100 years ago in 1925. The man that built it was a single dad named Michael. Michael had two sons. One of them went missing in 1927 at the age of 6. He was never found. In 1940 Michael sold the house to a young couple. The wife died shortly after they purchased the house. Soon after in 1942 the father was arrested for the murder of his adopted son. The house sat abandoned after that. The house wasn’t bought again till 2020 by the real estate company that sold it to me. I dug deeper on the missing son of the man that built the house. The Father, Michael was a suspect, and was questioned constantly for a year before they finally let the case go cold. The son went on multiple talk shows in the 80’s about cold cases talking about how he felt like his dad might’ve had something to do with it. I watched all the way through the episode. Right before I clicked off I heard, “I miss Todd.” The second the name rang out from my speakers I heard a loud bang out in the kitchen. I stood up from my old office chair and walked out to the kitchen. The drawer with the kitchen towels was on the ground and towels were strewn across the wood floor. I picked up the towels and put them in the drawer. I slid the drawer back into its slot before sitting back down at my desk. I needed to stop bullshitting and actually get some work done. At 3 in the afternoon I picked my son up from school. “I told James I am not going to be his friend.” Jax said calmly. “Why is that buddy?” 
“Because Todd told me to.” A slight rage built up in my chest. Residual anger and fear from the previous night. “Listen to me Jax. Todd isn’t real. He is imaginary.”
“No he’s not.” 
“Yes he is Jaxon!” 
“Then how come he can move the towels?” The comment had made my mouth go dry. I thought about the towels getting thrown today. “What do you mean?” 
“Todd brought a towel into my room a few nights ago. He said I had to put it around my neck to be like him.” 
“Enough, I’m done talking about this.” I didn’t cut him off because I didn’t believe him. I cut the conversation off because I started to feel like a scared little kid. That night Jax spent mostly in his room. I heard muffled talking most of the night. When I called him for dinner he didn’t come out. I went to his door and opened it. He was sitting on the side of his bed. I could just barely see him. I saw over the top of his bed the top half of a head. There was someone sitting in front of him. The head slowly turned. The white eyes met mine. I walked closer only for the person to duck below the edge of the bed. I jumped on the bed and stuck my head over the side. Of course, there was no one. “What’s up dad.” 
“Nothing, dinners ready.” I said. Jax stood up and walked out to the kitchen. I did a quick sweep around his room and under his bed. I was looking for anything in particular, just looking. After dinner Jax returned to his room. I noticed he was carrying something in front of him. He was carrying it trying to hide it from me. “Jax, come here.” He stopped but didn’t turn around. “Why?” 
“Because I damn well said so.” I stood up from my chair. He turned around. Hanging from his hand was a kitchen towel. “Give me that, and don’t take them again!” I snatched the towel from him. He walked to his room empty handed and slammed the door. I dropped the towel on the table and sat back down. Jax didn’t come out of his room the rest of the night. I got around for bed and laid down, quickly falling asleep. I woke up to the sound of my door. I rolled over. Jax stood at my door. He threw a kitchen towel at me. “What the hell?” 
“Make me like him.” 
“No what the hell.” 
“Make me like Todd.” 
“Jax, get your ass back in your bed.” He turned around slamming my door. I threw the towel on the ground, and got up. I walked over to the door and flicked the lock. The next morning was unfortunately Saturday. I peaked my head into Jax’s room. He was sleeping soundly. I sat down on the couch with my coffee. Even when Jax woke up the day was pretty uneventful. Jax was still upset from the previous night. After dinner I got a phone call. I stood up and walked into my office, unfortunately not catching my son sneaking into the kitchen himself. I walked back out seeing Jax was gone. I cleaned up dinner and went to bed. Before I could fall asleep I heard thumping coming from Jax’s room. I let it go on for a little while before it finally stopped. After a few minutes I decided to get up and see what was going on. I opened the door to his room. All of the lights were off. I flicked the light on. The lightning McQueen sheets were untouched, still made from this morning. I rounded the corner of the room to see Jax hanging from the closet door. The red kitchen towel holding him up by the throat. “No! Jaxon!” I pulled him off the door the towel fell limp around his neck. I put my head to his chest. No heartbeat. “Jaxon, please.” I began doing CPR, hearing his ribs crack beneath my heavy hands. “Hello? Are you still there? The good guys are almost there.” I heard faintly from under the bed. I reached my hand under the bed. My hand met a phone. I pulled the phone out to reveal my work phone. The phone call screen was displayed. The number 911 shown bright on the screen. I was so distracted by Jax that I almost didn’t hear the front door come crashing down. “Police, if there’s anyone here make yourself known.” 
“Help! In here!” The door swung open. A flashlight blinded me. “Hands up!” 
“No, my son. Help my son.” 
“Put your fucking hands up! Step away from the boy you motherfucker.” 
“What are you talking about.” The cop lunged at me. He tackled me to the ground. “You fucking child murder.” He struck me across the face before cuffing me. The police dragged me out of the house. Before they put me in the car they checked my pockets. I looked back to the house as the paramedics came walking out. A small body bag rested on the gurney. They walked past the window to the living room, missing the two little boys standing in the window waving to me. The red kitchen towels swaying side to side around their necks. Their white eyes admiring the scene in front of them. They both smiled as I was pushed in the back of the police car. About 3 months later my lawyer met with me in the visitation booth. I grabbed the phone off of the rack trying not to tangle the cord in my handcuffs. “They tore down the house. The real estate company says they can’t sell it due to the amount of deaths there. They found a body under where your son’s room was. The corner says he thinks that body’s been there for probably 6 or 7 decades. He has to test the bone to be sure.” I didn’t speak. I didn’t even react. “It’s a child Dan. They didn’t find much else except for some torn red fabric lying next to him.” ",1,1760144996.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I Still Don't Know How to Code.,"**An AI told me I was ""dangerous but not effective."" One month later, strangers are using software I created. This is what happened when the rules changed.**

# The Moment Everything Shifted

Picture this: It's a Saturday morning. Coffee's getting cold. You're staring at a screen.

An AI just evaluated your work.

""You know enough to be dangerous, but not effective.""

Ouch.

But also... accurate.

Dangerous means you're playing with tools you barely understand. You're making things happen, sure. But you're also creating messes you can't fix.

Effective? That's different. That means you build things that work. Things people actually use.

I had thirty days to figure out the difference.

# The $200 Bet

I'm not a programmer. Never took a computer science class. Can't tell you what Python syntax looks like without Googling it.

But I signed up for Claude Code anyway. $200 a month.

Why? Curiosity, mostly.

I wanted to understand AI. Really understand it. Not just use ChatGPT for emails. I wanted to build things. Automate stuff. Create tools that made decisions.

I had weekends. That's it. Saturday mornings. Sunday afternoons. The gaps between real life.

Here's what nobody tells you about traditional coding: It eats your brain.

You sit down for four hours. Load the entire project into your head. All the pieces. How they connect. What depends on what.

Then you stop. Go make lunch. Come back.

Everything's gone. Your mental map evaporated. You spend the next two hours just remembering what you were doing.

Claude Code broke that cycle.

I could stop mid-project on Saturday. Pick it up Sunday. Everything was still there. The AI remembered. The context stayed loaded.

My weekends started stacking instead of resetting.

That's when things got interesting.

# The Discovery That Changed Everything

Week three. I'm building something bigger than before. More complex.

And I realize: I'm not using one AI assistant.

I'm using a team.

Four different conversations. Four separate Claude Code windows. Each one working on a different piece of my project.

One's building the database. How information gets stored and retrieved.

Another's handling the frontend. What users actually see and click.

A third is connecting everything to AI services. Making the smart parts work.

The fourth is fixing problems. Smoothing rough edges. Making it all play nice together.

They're working at the same time. Parallel. Not waiting for each other.

And me?

I'm not writing code. I'm conducting an orchestra.

I tell this one to start. That one to pause. This one to try a different approach. I review what they build. I connect the pieces.

It feels like managing a development team. Except my team works on weekends. And never complains.

# What I Actually Built

A prompt saver application.

Sounds simple. It's not.

It saves prompts you create for AI tools. Organizes them. Optimizes them. Makes them better. Connects to AI services. Processes what you ask. Delivers results.

Real friends are testing it right now. Giving feedback. Finding bugs. Suggesting features.

Is it perfect? Nope.

Do I understand every single line? Honestly, no.

Does it work? Yes.

Do people use it? Yes.

That's the whole game.

# Four Weekends, Four Lessons

Each weekend taught me something nobody mentioned in tutorials.

# Weekend One.

I learned to speak to AI. Not in code. In ideas. ""I need this to do that when this happens."" The clearer my description, the better the result.

Like explaining what you want to a really smart contractor. Specifics matter. Vague ideas create vague results.

# Weekend Two

How do you know if something works when you didn't write it yourself?

You test it. You poke it. You try to break it. You watch what happens.

I learned what ""working"" actually means. Not perfect. Not elegant. Just: does it do the job?

# Weekend Three 

Complex projects aren't one thing. They're twenty small things pretending to be one big thing.

I learned to see the pieces. Database piece. Display piece. Logic piece. Connection piece.

Build them separately. Connect them later.

Like assembling furniture. Follow the sequence. Don't skip steps.

# Weekend Four

The gap between ""it works for me"" and ""someone else can use this"" is massive.

I learned about clarity. Instructions. Error messages that make sense. Buttons that do what you think they'll do.

Making software that works is one skill. Making software that feels good to use is completely different.

# The Before and After

Before this project, I used tools.

I'd see a new AI application. Think ""that's cool."" Use it. Move on.

Now?

I see tools differently.

Every app is a puzzle I could solve. Every feature is a challenge I could tackle. Every problem is just architecture waiting to be built.

It's like learning to see the matrix. Except instead of falling code, you see buildable systems everywhere.

You can't unsee it once it happens.

# What ""Effective"" Really Means

Remember that AI assessment? ""Dangerous but not effective.""

Here's what I learned effective actually is:

It means you ship. You put something out in the world.

It means things connect. Your app talks to other services. Data flows. Systems communicate.

It means you improve. People tell you what's broken. You fix it. They tell you what's missing. You add it.

It means you manage resources. Whether that's people or AI or time or attention. You make calls about what gets built next.

It means you understand trade-offs. This approach is faster but messier. That approach is cleaner but slower. You pick based on what matters right now.

I'm doing all five. That's the proof.

# The Part That Matters Most

Here's what this really shows:

The barrier to building software just collapsed.

Five years ago, my path required:

* $30,000 bootcamp
* Six months full-time study
* Learning syntax for languages I'd rarely use
* Memorizing patterns I'd forget

Today?

* $200
* Four weekends
* Clear thinking
* An AI that handles the syntax

The gatekeepers are panicking. The traditional path just became optional.

Building software used to be about knowing languages. Now it's about understanding systems.

That's a completely different skill. And it's way more interesting.

# What Happens Next

The prompt saver is just round one.

Now I know the pattern. I know I can do this. I know what effective feels like.

The next project will be faster. Cleaner. More ambitious.

The one after that? Even better.

Each thing I build teaches me shortcuts. Shows me patterns. Reveals what people actually need versus what I think they need.

I'm not just building apps. I'm building a system for turning weekend ideas into Monday realities.

And that system gets faster every time I use it.

# The Real Story

Thirty days. Four weekends. One working application with real users.

I moved from ""dangerous but not effective"" to shipping production software.

No traditional coding experience. No bootcamp certificate. No computer science degree.

Just weekends, curiosity, and AI tools that changed the rules.

The path from idea to working software isn't theoretical anymore. It's concrete. It's repeatable. It's accessible.

My Sons Imaginary Friend

My son just turned 5 this year. As a single dad I’m glad to put him into school now. It gives me more quiet time to work without him coming into my home office to ask questions. Around halfway through the school year I noticed he started telling me about his imaginary friend he made. He would make me set the table for 3 so his friend could eat with us. I had no problem with it. The next day I was getting him around for school when my son said something slightly alarming. “I made a new friend today dad.” 
“Oh yeah?” 
“Yeah, he’s a little weird though, and he’s not so nice to my other friend.” 
“Why is he weird?” 
“He’s got white eyes.” 
“Huh, that is weird buddy. You ready to get going?” 
“Yup.” My son said with a smile. I disregarded his comment, and put my son in the truck. When I got to work my coworkers and I got talking by the water cooler. It was nice catching up with them considering I only came into the office once a week. “How’s Jax doing?”
“He’s doing good. He’s having a hard time making friends at school. He’s got a few imaginary friends he says lives with us.” 
“Woahhhh buddy. Haha. Hopefully no one died in that house.”
“What do you mean?” 
“Well normally, ya know, when little kids have an imaginary friend it’s like a ghost or something.” 
“Haha. Okay man.” 
“I’m serious. You should look it up or something.” 
“Nah man, I’m not worried about it. It’s probably just him coping with not having any real life friends.” 
“Okay man…. I’m just saying if you come to work and are acting weird, im just going to assume you’re possessed.” 
“Okay man, whatever.” I completely disregarded the stupid comment. After work I  picked up Jax. He jumped in the car with an unusual excitement. “I made a friend today dad!” 
“That’s great buddy! What’s his name?” 
“His name is James. He said he lives close by us.” 
“That’s great buddy! Maybe you could have him over sometime.” Jax nodded in excitement. When we got home Jax set his bag down and ran to his room. “I have to tell Todd about my new friend.” He ran off giggling the whole way. I started on dinner while he was in his room. He ended up staying in there for a while before coming out. When he finally did he was crying. “What’s going on buddy?” 
“Todd said that I can’t be friends with James. When I asked him why, he slapped me.” Jax turned his head to the side. A small red mark highlighted is tiny face. “How did you get that mark buddy?” 
“I told you. Todd hit me.” 
“Where is Todd?” 
“He’s still in my room.” I walked past Jax into his room. I rounded the corner around his door and just barely caught a figure slide into the closet. My heart dropped. I ran over to the closet door and ripped it fully open. Children’s clothes swayed back and forth taunting me. “What the fuck.” 
“What’s that mean?” I turned to see Jax standing behind me. “Don’t worry about it. You’re sleeping in my room tonight.” 
That night I tucked Jax into my bed. I walked around to the other side and laid down. The weight of the day slowly took my consciousness. My eyes dropped slowly. I dreamt that night. I was laying in my bed. On the floor near my door Jax and another little boy were playing with their matchbox cars. The other boy was facing away from me. “Jax? What are you doing buddy.” He didn’t acknowledge me. The other little boy stood up. He turned to me. His eyes were white like a corpse. He walked over to the edge of my bed, just inches away from my face. “He’s mine.” He hissed at me in a deep voice. I jumped awake. The room was dark but my eyes had adjusted enough to see a figure sitting on the ground by the door. I flicked on my bedside lamp to see Jax playing with his cars facing me. “Jax, what are you doing dude? Go back to bed.” 
“But Todd told me to play with the cars so he could talk to you.” 
“What?” 
“Todd, he woke me up and told me to play with my cars while he had a word with you.” I took the cars from Jax and put him back in the bed. I sat on the couch in the living room watching TV the rest of the night. As much as I didn’t want to say it, that dream bothered me deeply. The next morning I dropped Jax off at school and immediately began researching my house. I found that it was built 100 years ago in 1925. The man that built it was a single dad named Michael. Michael had two sons. One of them went missing in 1927 at the age of 6. He was never found. In 1940 Michael sold the house to a young couple. The wife died shortly after they purchased the house. Soon after I’m 1942 the father was arrested for the murder of his adopted son. The house sat abandoned after that. The house wasn’t bought again till 2020 by the real estate company that sold it to me. I dug deeper on the missing son of the man that built the house. The Father, Michael was a suspect, and was questioned constantly for a year before they finally let the case go cold. The son went on multiple talk shows in the 80’s about cold cases talking about how he felt like his dad might’ve had something to do with it. I watched all the way through the episode. Right before I clicked off I heard, “I miss Todd.” The second the name rang out from my speakers I heard a loud bang out in the kitchen. I stood up from my old office chair and walked out to the kitchen. The drawer with the kitchen towels was on the ground and towels were strewn across the wood floor. I picked up the towels and put them in the drawer. I slid the drawer back into its slot before sitting back down at my desk. I needed to stop bullshitting and actually get some work done. At 3 in the afternoon I picked my son up from school. “I told James I am not going to be his friend.” Jax said calmly. “Why is that buddy?” 
“Because Todd told me to.” A slight rage built up in my chest. Residual anger and fear from the previous night. “Listen to me Jax. Todd isn’t real. He is imaginary.”
“No he’s not.” 
“Yes he is Jaxon!” 
“Then how come he can move the towels?” The comment had made my mouth go dry. I thought about the towels getting thrown today. “What do you mean?” 
“Todd brought a towel into my room a few nights ago. He said I had to put it around my neck to be like him.” 
“Enough, I’m done talking about this.” I didn’t cut him off because I didn’t believe him. I cut the conversation off because I started to feel like a scared little kid. That night Jax spent mostly in his room. I heard muffled talking most of the night. When I called him for dinner he didn’t come out. I went to his door and opened it. He was sitting on the side of his bed. I could just barely see him. I saw over the top of his bed the top half of a head. There was someone sitting in front of him. The head slowly turned. The white eyes met mine. I walked closer only for the person to duck below the edge of the bed. I jumped on the bed and stuck my head over the side. Of course, there was no one. “What’s up dad.” 
“Nothing, dinners ready.” I said. Jax stood up and walked out to the kitchen. I did a quick sweep around his room and under his bed. I was looking for anything in particular, just looking. After dinner Jax returned to his room. I noticed he was carrying something in front of him. He was carrying it trying to hide it from me. “Jax, come here.” He stopped but didn’t turn around. “Why?” 
“Because I damn well said so.” I stood up from my chair. He turned around. Hanging from his hand was a kitchen towel. “Give me that, and don’t take them again!” I snatched the towel from him. He walked to his room empty handed and slammed the door. I dropped the towel on the table and sat back down. Jax didn’t come out of his room the rest of the night. I got around for bed and laid down, quickly falling asleep. I woke up to the sound of my door. I rolled over. Jax stood at my door. He threw a kitchen towel at me. “What the hell?” 
“Make me like him.” 
“No what the hell.” 
“Make me like Todd.” 
“Jax, get your ass back in your bed.” He turned around slamming my door. I threw the towel on the ground, and got up. I walked over to the door and flicked the lock. The next morning was unfortunately Saturday. I peaked my head into Jax’s room. He was sleeping soundly. I sat down on the couch with my coffee. Even when Jax woke up the day was pretty uneventful. Jax was still upset from the previous night. After dinner I got a phone call. I stood up and walked into my office, unfortunately not catching my son sneaking into the kitchen himself. I walked back out seeing Jax was gone. I cleaned up dinner and went to bed. Before I could fall asleep I heard thumping coming from Jax’s room. I let it go on for a little while before it finally stopped. After a few minutes I decided to get up and see what was going on. I opened the door to his room. All of the lights were off. I flicked the light on. The lightning McQueen sheets were untouched, still made from this morning. I rounded the corner of the room to see Jax hanging from the closet door. The red kitchen towel holding him up by the throat. “No! Jaxon!” I pulled him off the door the towel fell limp around his neck. I put my head to his chest. No heartbeat. “Jaxon, please.” I began doing CPR, hearing his ribs crack beneath my heavy hands. “Hello? Are you still there? The good guys are almost there.” I heard faintly from under the bed. I reached my hand under the bed. My hand met a phone. I pulled the phone out to reveal my work phone. The phone call screen was displayed. The number 911 shown bright on the screen. I was so distracted by Jax that I almost didn’t hear the front door come crashing down. “Police, if there’s anyone here make yourself known.” 
“Help! In here!” The door swung open. A flashlight blinded me. “Hands up!” 
“No, my son. Help my son.” 
“Put your fucking hands up! Step away from the boy you motherfucker.” 
“What are you talking about.” The cop lunged at me. He tackled me to the ground. “You fucking child murder.” He struck me across the face before cuffing me. The police dragged me out of the house.

1o3id8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DanglingeyeStories/comments/1o3id8u/my_sons_imaginary_friend/,My Sons Imaginary Friend,"My Sons Imaginary Friend

My son just turned 5 this year. As a single dad I’m glad to put him into school now. It gives me more quiet time to work without him coming into my home office to ask questions. Around halfway through the school year I noticed he started telling me about his imaginary friend he made. He would make me set the table for 3 so his friend could eat with us. I had no problem with it. The next day I was getting him around for school when my son said something slightly alarming. “I made a new friend today dad.” 
“Oh yeah?” 
“Yeah, he’s a little weird though, and he’s not so nice to my other friend.” 
“Why is he weird?” 
“He’s got white eyes.” 
“Huh, that is weird buddy. You ready to get going?” 
“Yup.” My son said with a smile. I disregarded his comment, and put my son in the truck. When I got to work my coworkers and I got talking by the water cooler. It was nice catching up with them considering I only came into the office once a week. “How’s Jax doing?”
“He’s doing good. He’s having a hard time making friends at school. He’s got a few imaginary friends he says lives with us.” 
“Woahhhh buddy. Haha. Hopefully no one died in that house.”
“What do you mean?” 
“Well normally, ya know, when little kids have an imaginary friend it’s like a ghost or something.” 
“Haha. Okay man.” 
“I’m serious. You should look it up or something.” 
“Nah man, I’m not worried about it. It’s probably just him coping with not having any real life friends.” 
“Okay man…. I’m just saying if you come to work and are acting weird, im just going to assume you’re possessed.” 
“Okay man, whatever.” I completely disregarded the stupid comment. After work I  picked up Jax. He jumped in the car with an unusual excitement. “I made a friend today dad!” 
“That’s great buddy! What’s his name?” 
“His name is James. He said he lives close by us.” 
“That’s great buddy! Maybe you could have him over sometime.” Jax nodded in excitement. When we got home Jax set his bag down and ran to his room. “I have to tell Todd about my new friend.” He ran off giggling the whole way. I started on dinner while he was in his room. He ended up staying in there for a while before coming out. When he finally did he was crying. “What’s going on buddy?” 
“Todd said that I can’t be friends with James. When I asked him why, he slapped me.” Jax turned his head to the side. A small red mark highlighted is tiny face. “How did you get that mark buddy?” 
“I told you. Todd hit me.” 
“Where is Todd?” 
“He’s still in my room.” I walked past Jax into his room. I rounded the corner around his door and just barely caught a figure slide into the closet. My heart dropped. I ran over to the closet door and ripped it fully open. Children’s clothes swayed back and forth taunting me. “What the fuck.” 
“What’s that mean?” I turned to see Jax standing behind me. “Don’t worry about it. You’re sleeping in my room tonight.” 
That night I tucked Jax into my bed. I walked around to the other side and laid down. The weight of the day slowly took my consciousness. My eyes dropped slowly. I dreamt that night. I was laying in my bed. On the floor near my door Jax and another little boy were playing with their matchbox cars. The other boy was facing away from me. “Jax? What are you doing buddy.” He didn’t acknowledge me. The other little boy stood up. He turned to me. His eyes were white like a corpse. He walked over to the edge of my bed, just inches away from my face. “He’s mine.” He hissed at me in a deep voice. I jumped awake. The room was dark but my eyes had adjusted enough to see a figure sitting on the ground by the door. I flicked on my bedside lamp to see Jax playing with his cars facing me. “Jax, what are you doing dude? Go back to bed.” 
“But Todd told me to play with the cars so he could talk to you.” 
“What?” 
“Todd, he woke me up and told me to play with my cars while he had a word with you.” I took the cars from Jax and put him back in the bed. I sat on the couch in the living room watching TV the rest of the night. As much as I didn’t want to say it, that dream bothered me deeply. The next morning I dropped Jax off at school and immediately began researching my house. I found that it was built 100 years ago in 1925. The man that built it was a single dad named Michael. Michael had two sons. One of them went missing in 1927 at the age of 6. He was never found. In 1940 Michael sold the house to a young couple. The wife died shortly after they purchased the house. Soon after in 1942 the father was arrested for the murder of his adopted son. The house sat abandoned after that. The house wasn’t bought again till 2020 by the real estate company that sold it to me. I dug deeper on the missing son of the man that built the house. The Father, Michael was a suspect, and was questioned constantly for a year before they finally let the case go cold. The son went on multiple talk shows in the 80’s about cold cases talking about how he felt like his dad might’ve had something to do with it. I watched all the way through the episode. Right before I clicked off I heard, “I miss Todd.” The second the name rang out from my speakers I heard a loud bang out in the kitchen. I stood up from my old office chair and walked out to the kitchen. The drawer with the kitchen towels was on the ground and towels were strewn across the wood floor. I picked up the towels and put them in the drawer. I slid the drawer back into its slot before sitting back down at my desk. I needed to stop bullshitting and actually get some work done. At 3 in the afternoon I picked my son up from school. “I told James I am not going to be his friend.” Jax said calmly. “Why is that buddy?” 
“Because Todd told me to.” A slight rage built up in my chest. Residual anger and fear from the previous night. “Listen to me Jax. Todd isn’t real. He is imaginary.”
“No he’s not.” 
“Yes he is Jaxon!” 
“Then how come he can move the towels?” The comment had made my mouth go dry. I thought about the towels getting thrown today. “What do you mean?” 
“Todd brought a towel into my room a few nights ago. He said I had to put it around my neck to be like him.” 
“Enough, I’m done talking about this.” I didn’t cut him off because I didn’t believe him. I cut the conversation off because I started to feel like a scared little kid. That night Jax spent mostly in his room. I heard muffled talking most of the night. When I called him for dinner he didn’t come out. I went to his door and opened it. He was sitting on the side of his bed. I could just barely see him. I saw over the top of his bed the top half of a head. There was someone sitting in front of him. The head slowly turned. The white eyes met mine. I walked closer only for the person to duck below the edge of the bed. I jumped on the bed and stuck my head over the side. Of course, there was no one. “What’s up dad.” 
“Nothing, dinners ready.” I said. Jax stood up and walked out to the kitchen. I did a quick sweep around his room and under his bed. I was looking for anything in particular, just looking. After dinner Jax returned to his room. I noticed he was carrying something in front of him. He was carrying it trying to hide it from me. “Jax, come here.” He stopped but didn’t turn around. “Why?” 
“Because I damn well said so.” I stood up from my chair. He turned around. Hanging from his hand was a kitchen towel. “Give me that, and don’t take them again!” I snatched the towel from him. He walked to his room empty handed and slammed the door. I dropped the towel on the table and sat back down. Jax didn’t come out of his room the rest of the night. I got around for bed and laid down, quickly falling asleep. I woke up to the sound of my door. I rolled over. Jax stood at my door. He threw a kitchen towel at me. “What the hell?” 
“Make me like him.” 
“No what the hell.” 
“Make me like Todd.” 
“Jax, get your ass back in your bed.” He turned around slamming my door. I threw the towel on the ground, and got up. I walked over to the door and flicked the lock. The next morning was unfortunately Saturday. I peaked my head into Jax’s room. He was sleeping soundly. I sat down on the couch with my coffee. Even when Jax woke up the day was pretty uneventful. Jax was still upset from the previous night. After dinner I got a phone call. I stood up and walked into my office, unfortunately not catching my son sneaking into the kitchen himself. I walked back out seeing Jax was gone. I cleaned up dinner and went to bed. Before I could fall asleep I heard thumping coming from Jax’s room. I let it go on for a little while before it finally stopped. After a few minutes I decided to get up and see what was going on. I opened the door to his room. All of the lights were off. I flicked the light on. The lightning McQueen sheets were untouched, still made from this morning. I rounded the corner of the room to see Jax hanging from the closet door. The red kitchen towel holding him up by the throat. “No! Jaxon!” I pulled him off the door the towel fell limp around his neck. I put my head to his chest. No heartbeat. “Jaxon, please.” I began doing CPR, hearing his ribs crack beneath my heavy hands. “Hello? Are you still there? The good guys are almost there.” I heard faintly from under the bed. I reached my hand under the bed. My hand met a phone. I pulled the phone out to reveal my work phone. The phone call screen was displayed. The number 911 shown bright on the screen. I was so distracted by Jax that I almost didn’t hear the front door come crashing down. “Police, if there’s anyone here make yourself known.” 
“Help! In here!” The door swung open. A flashlight blinded me. “Hands up!” 
“No, my son. Help my son.” 
“Put your fucking hands up! Step away from the boy you motherfucker.” 
“What are you talking about.” The cop lunged at me. He tackled me to the ground. “You fucking child murder.” He struck me across the face before cuffing me. The police dragged me out of the house. Before they put me in the car they checked my pockets. I looked back to the house as the paramedics came walking out. A small body bag rested on the gurney. They walked past the window to the living room, missing the two little boys standing in the window waving to me. The red kitchen towels swaying side to side around their necks. Their white eyes admiring the scene in front of them. They both smiled as I was pushed in the back of the police car. About 3 months later my lawyer met with me in the visitation booth. I grabbed the phone off of the rack trying not to tangle the cord in my handcuffs. “They tore down the house. The real estate company says they can’t sell it due to the amount of deaths there. They found a body under where your son’s room was. The corner says he thinks that body’s been there for probably 6 or 7 decades. He has to test the bone to be sure.” I didn’t speak. I didn’t even react. “It’s a child Dan. They didn’t find much else except for some torn red fabric lying next to him.” ",1,1760144440.0,DanglingeyeStories,0,1.0,False

Certain herbs do make it worse like ceremonial Cacao and weed and maybe coffee (I don’t drink only in certain forms of food). And certain herbs that respond to GABA like silk tree. I’ll be trying my fast in the next couple days affer eating the rest of my food( I can’t waste) then I’ll let everyone know if you see this. I hope this goes well.

1o3i74o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1o3i74o/i_found_a_hidden_camera_pointed_at_where_i/,I found a hidden camera pointed at where I breastfed my baby,"
I’m honestly kind of freaking out right now.

For context: I’m a teen mom to my 7 month old daughter. I recently started nannying again because I needed the income, and I took a job that wasn’t ideal. two kids in my neighborhood for $16/hr. I used to study child health and development in college before I dropped out to raise my daughter, and I’ve got about a year and a half of nannying experience.

I found this family on Care.com, and looking back.there were so many red flags.
She had no profile picture, She refused a phone interview, saying she “only does in-person” because she can “tell character better that way.”,	She used military time for everything (so I assumed she was ex-military she’s not)., and She insisted on meeting at a school, not a coffee shop or anywhere public I suggested.

She was 15 minutes late and showed up in short shorts, no bra, slippers, and high socks. Not exactly the strict, polished person I expected based on her tone over text.

She had three kids 6F, 4F, and almost 2M. The interview actually went okay, and because she lived nearby, I accepted the job on the spot. She mentioned paying me as a 1099 contractor (which is illegal for household employees in my state), so I told her she’d either need to do under the table cash or a proper W-2. She chose cash but refused to sign a contract because she “didn’t want paper trails.”Another red flag I should’ve listened to.

During the interview, I specifically said no secret nanny cams. She told me she only had two cameras both in her kids’ rooms. Which I was completely fine with.

But then weird comments started happening.
	•	One day, I served the kids some fruit that was already cut up in the fridge. Later, she mentioned “you forgot to wash it”
	•	Another time, she brought up a snack I had packed for my daughter one I never left at her house.
	•	She mentioned me wiping down her counters with a reusable towel something she couldn’t have known unless she was watching me.
	•	She also somehow knew I use voice-to-text because of my dyslexia… something I never told her.

At that point, I assumed there was a hidden camera or mic somewhere. which was super offputting, considering she knew I breast-fed my daughter, and had specifically asked if there was any cameras.

The vibe in general was off. She made really degrading comments, like saying she doesn’t understand why anyone would go to college for child development and strictly referring to me as a babysitter . She was dismissive, controlling, and constantly added new chores on top of childcare to the point that I could barely focus on the kids. Her daughter would also often say some weird and concerning things for example “ my mom’s gonna be mad, but it’s okay because she won’t be mad at me”, “the floors are really dirty. You need to sweep them.” and one time she went on a minute, tangent about silly, forgetful people who always forget everything after I left my lunchbox at their house overnight along with this and some other stuff she said I just assumed she was repeating stuff her mother had said.

But today was the breaking point.

My daughter wasn’t feeling well, so she wanted to be held most of the day. The two-year-old knocked over a set of picture frames on himself (the house was not at all child friendly). The 4-year-old had multiple meltdowns, and when I tried to calm her, she started kicking and hitting me. I let the mom know I’d need to leave early, and she agreed as long as both kids were down for a nap first.

While I was feeding my daughter before leaving, I noticed the Alexa was flashing green every time I spoke. I Googled it and learned that means there’s a drop in basically, someone is listening in.

That’s when I started looking around the room. And sure enough.

I found a hidden camera tucked inside an open purse.
Pointed directly at the chair where I breastfeed my daughter.

I froze. My stomach dropped. I grabbed my baby, packed up our stuff, and left without unloading the dishwasher.

A few hours later, she sent me a long text rant about “clarifying expectations.” Basically, she wanted me to be a maid, not a nanny. all while watching three kids.

 After talking to my husband, I’ve decided I’m quitting immediately. I’m still shaken that someone recorded me feeding my baby without consent.

I’ll update once I officially quit and send her my message but seriously. trust your gut .
