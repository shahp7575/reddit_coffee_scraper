1mqphhz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mqphhz,Filter kaapi cheesecake is a miss,"üìç Bangalore Canteen, Viman Nagar

My roommate and I love south indian food for breakfast and so we went here. We've driven 20kms for the Karva Nagar branch as well.

Ghee podi button idli: 3/5. Idlis were soft and nice. Podi didn't have the kick that we were expecting.

Mysore Masala Dola: 3/5. Dosa was very kronchy, aloo masala was okay. The mysore masala tasted like Schezwan chutney?

Both the chutneys tasted the same and weren't very wow. Sambar was sweet, also lacked a certain kick we were looking for.

Filter coffee was good.

The filter coffee cheesecake, however, is something you should not get because
A. It's not cheesecake, it tasted more like tiramisu 
B. The portion is toooo small and it costs 160? 

Get the filter coffee soft serve instead.

Total bill was 325 and 330 for the cheesecakes we got packed. 

We both prefer Cafe Udupi's (Viman Nagar) Mysore Masala Dosa and SA Dosa's (Prabhat Road) podi button idli. (SA Dosa has terrible service though, idk what has happened to them)",1,1755238776.0,PuneFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

1mqp8or,https://www.reddit.com/r/tsitp/comments/1mqp8or/belly_is_giving_me_the_ick/,Belly is giving me the ICK.,"1. Belly and Adam: i HATE Adam, let me establish this before talking further. These two do not have any sort of relationship/bonding other than just knowing each other. Adam is not susannah.
- Belly is unemployed staying at Adam‚Äôs house, eating their food, both Adam and jere are working but she‚Äôs not doing anything other than the wedding planning, THE LEAST you can do is CLEAN UP after yourself. I got second hand embarrassment after seeing how she left hair In the drain and messed with - NOT Jeremiahs, but ADAMS things. 
- He did not ask you to help, why are you assuming that something is wrong with the coffee machine that you have to fix it? Running around and being loud in SOMEONE else‚Äôs house and disturbing them? 
- Jeremiah is Adam‚Äôs son so he can stay or have SOME reasonable entitlement towards the property, but Adam is doing belly a favour by letting her stay. And this is how you behave? You are an adult, not a child belly for god sake. where are the manners? Most people HELP manage the house they‚Äôre staying at or stay in their limits as a guest. Not do THIS. 
- This man is already paying for your fianc√©s college, housing, employment AND the wedding and also your BROTHER‚ÄôS boss. Belly, have some shame please. 
- Adam already tries to one up belly‚Äôs mom and now belly gave him more reasons to do so by behaving like this. Laurel would be so disappointed. You were so pissed about laurel sayinf you‚Äôre too young, yet you prove her point embarrass her infront of the man she hates?
2. The car 
- Why does this girl think she can just take conrads car? EVEN if we assume that it‚Äôs not HIS car specifically and just the beach house‚Äôs car, it still belongs to the fisher family not to belly. It‚Äôs basic manners to ask members of the family if she can use the car, not just take it out whenever she feels like it. What if she just takes the car without asking Conrad when he needed it WHEN he should be the one who should have access to the car anytime in the first place?
3. The house 
-  I understand susannah made her feel like it‚Äôs her house too. But the fact is susannah is not in the picture anymore to further establish that comfort. Why was belly so involved in the discussion about the sale of the house? It pissed me off so much when she was getting angry and making faces, Like this is genuinely a private family matter. The Conklin‚Äôs have not financed the house in any way to have a say. The house belongs to Adam and his sons. Even if laurel convinced aunt Julia, Without Adam the house would have gone to someone else. 
- Why does belly think she can just show up at the summer house without informing the fishers? What If Adam was staying there when she just unlocked the door and came in? like the entitlement and immaturity from this girl is INSANE for her age, her age doesn‚Äôt justify any of this. Then she and her bestie Taylor act surprised that Conrad is staying in HIS house?
- I find it weird that she knows about Adam‚Äôs cheating, but Jeremiah doesn‚Äôt. Like i get why Conrad told her and shit, but in the broader sense i do find it weird and uncomfortable that she‚Äôs knows such a big thing about JERES dad when jere doesn‚Äôt even know it. 
- The lack of boundaries and the amount of immaturity belly is showing is giving me the ultimate ICK. ( i dislike Adam and Jeremiah too, once again. But belly herself isn‚Äôt a saint.)

No fertilizer, no water, no nuthin'!","   My wife and I purchased our first home in June of '23. After  initially finding nothing that we could afford that met certain minimum criteria, we had all but resigned ourselves to the idea of continuing to be renters until eventually leaving Florida. 
  I'm not sure why, but I happened to open the realtors MLS app one morning while having coffee. 
   Sixteen days later, we were moving into our ""new"" home, a 1933 single story home on a scant acre of land with a 12wx24lx~10h workshop, large screened in porch, and a separate in-laws cottage that was built in 1957. 
   The point to the story is that the people we purchased from were a 70 year old Vietnamese couple. They'd been here for twenty years and were avid gardeners. In addition to the Starfruit,  we have a productive jackfruit tree, a stunning 12 year old mango tree, a wax jambu apple tree, two trained dragon fruits, as well as loofah.

Hi, I am planning on ordering these drinks from DoorDash since there's a BOGO deal going on. How many calories would each of these drinks be? I couldn't find any other pictures aside from the menu since it's a virtual brand. 

  
I am adjusting the Coconut latte to have 50% sugar. I am also adjusting the level to be ""less sweet"" instead of regular sweet for the Vietnamese coffee (no % option). I am also adding some honey boba as a topping to both drinks. 

  
I'm guessing probably 450-500 calories, just because boba is pretty calorie dense and the condensed milk but I am unsure. Thanks!!",1,1755237869.0,caloriecount,0,1.0,False
1mqp7ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1mqp7ii/i_need_help_with_redesigning_my_schools_student/,I need help with redesigning my schools student lounge,"Heyo!

I need help with design decisions for a fairly ""ugly-at-baseline"" space at my medical school.

I am a medical student in Canada and the student body president for my site. For many years our student lounge has been a glorified storage closet. It was filled with (mostly broken) bookshelves containing books from the 90's, broken TVs from the early 2000's, unused storage cabinets, a musty couch, miscellaneous garbage that had collected over multiple years, and most importantly - a massive pingpong table. Below are some photos of what it looked like BEFORE I started doing anything. You can see it's a bit of a hard space to work with - white walls with weird baseboards, no windows, panel roofing, and awesome grey-blue concrete flooring...

[Before #1](https://preview.redd.it/x9nff3m0j4jf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aea994191f4d6379a30607976817ef75ac542ee0)

My goal was to turn the space into something usable by students. I built a proposal, applied for funding, and secured a good chunk of cash to make some changes.  I also got faculty on board with making physical changes (i.e. painting), and they've been very cooperative.  I cleaned the space, scrubbed the floors, and managed to get all the old and broken things removed except for two cabinets and the foldable pingpong table. I bought some IKEA furniture - just a rug, couch, and bookshelf to start. I am leaving the larger half of the room open for pingpong and other recreational equipment. See photos below (do not pay any attention to Mr. Worldwide).

[After #1](https://preview.redd.it/a9rzt423j4jf1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01cf9503648dc2d9ac14592f40d92e9507a0ea33)

I have some ideas about what else I could pursue, but I would love to hear your thoughts on some questions:

1. If you could paint the walls a neutral colour, which colour would you choose that would work with the floors and the white ceiling tiles?  I don't have a colour palette from the school, but I know the range of colours will likely be limited.
2. The goal is to make the space feel warmer. What colours of accent chairs would you recommend? Besides warm lightbulbs, which style of lamp would work well in a space like this?
3. I want to buy a coffee table and some accent chairs. With the black bookshelf, did I limit myself to buying a black coffee table and other black furniture?
4. Couch as a separator of the room (as it currently is)? Or couch in the corner?
5. Any other thoughts/ideas for how this could be a warmer, more cozy space for students.

1mqp56i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mqp56i/arumishi_7/,Arumishi 7,"Intro 

The first thing people think about when they hear space is galaxies and stars. People think about the planets and the bright colors you might be able to see. People know that there are great distances between all the planets and all the galaxies. But not many people get to experience just how far away these things are in person. It's practically impossible to wrap your mind around how much dead space there is between the celestial bodies. For those who do get to experience just how vast our universe is, they get to experience something called deep space psychosis. Being so far away from Earth and having to face the facts that you are a speck in what is an endlessly expanding universe is enough to drive most people mad. You might hear me say ‚Äúmost people‚Äù and assume that I am referring to something around 70%. The number is closer to 98% of people experience deep space psychosis. There was actually such a problem with deep space psychosis when United Earth began its expeditions to other planets that they needed a pharmaceutical remedy to lessen the symptoms. There was a space race (pun intended) to see which pharmaceutical manufacturer could produce the solution the quickest. The United government boasted a hefty reward for whichever company could do so. That was so long ago however that I don't even bother thinking about the history of it all. The first batch of Serenix had some pretty severe side effects. Pissing blood being the main one. I think we're on the 10th generation of Serenix now. Side effects are practically non-existent though pissing blood can still occur in 1/1000 patients. 

I am Dr. Gabe Weller and I am on board one of these United Earth space missions. However I am not a part of any normal mining expedition or colonization effort. No no, I have a much more secretive job. I'm part of a subcommittee of United Earth called the covert experiment committee (CEC for short). No, we're not doing any human experiments nor are we testing out any secret weapons. Though I wouldn't mind being a part of one of those expeditions next. This expedition has us going to the planet Arumishi 7. All things considered this planet is not very far from our home solar system. The Arumishi cluster is only about a hundred light years away from Earth. 100 light years sounds like a lot but when you take into consideration that some mining operations will go thousands or even hundreds of thousands of light years away then it puts things into perspective on how close we really are. Arumishi has the potential for some rare elements to have been formed on the planet's surface. The planet is about 10 times larger than Earth and has a much denser atmosphere. When we've scanned this big gray rock, it emits the radioactive signal. We are hoping that the increase in gravity and pressure has compacted some elements that we can perhaps reverse engineer into starcraft fuel. Sounds boring right? Well that's because I just lied to you. I gave you the same spiel about what we're doing here that United Earth gave me. There's something deeper going on here and I'm just not sure what it is yet. Our spaceship, named the UEN Ozymandias, has a bunch of scientists on board that actually know what we're doing here, but I'm just a doctor. I wish I was being coy and selling myself short, but genuinely I just treat radiation burns and operate on the occasional crew member who falls down the scaffolding in the engine room. I keep trying to Buddy up with the scientists to see if they'll spill the beans. So far I've gotten nothing out of them. 

ACT 1

‚ÄúAll right Jacobs I know you have a wedding that you really want to go to, but I need you to follow this detoxification procedure to the T. Any deviation from this program could result in DSP.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes Dr Weller I'm well aware. trust me I'm eager to leave, but I'm not going to sabotage myself by trying to get off Serenix early.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, I want to see you bright and early tomorrow to see how you're feeling. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThanks Gabe, see you tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake care‚Äù

Getting off Serenix was a weird necessity. UE Healthcare protocols required those returning to their home planets to wean off the drug. Something about saving money. Truth be told I was very happy for Jacobs. He's been talking about seeing his family for weeks now. There's a third party service called hyperlite. Think of it like a space taxi, a small spacecraft capable of faster than light travel. What it lacks in size it makes up for in speed. The craft can really only hold five people at a time including the pilot. So only a few people can go on vacation at a time. The procedure for vacation aboard the station works just like a job on earth or any other planet for that matter. Just request the day off and from there it's first come first serve. 

My next appointment of the day walked in shortly after. I say walked, but it was more of a hobble. Some poor sucker from the engineering deck seemed to have taken a tumble. It didn't look too bad as I examined the injury, but better safe than sorry.

‚ÄúGood afternoon, I'm Dr. Weller. Can I have your name and date of birth?‚Äù

‚ÄúBix Beirbenich, birth day January 9th 2989‚Äù

I looked up from my paper in confusion.
‚ÄúBix? Is that short for something?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah sorry, legal name. Benedict‚Äù

‚ÄúGotcha, alright.‚Äù I scribbled this down for future reference. ‚ÄúWell I'm going to have you hop on the table here and we're going to take a look at the leg. What do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing‚Äù

He painfully crawled onto the examination table. I felt bad watching him, but I let him accomplish this task on his own. Upon further examination, he had multiple fractures all on his right tibia.

Excitedly I exclaimed.
‚ÄúGood news Bix, I'm going to fix you. Bad news, it's going to hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù

I flipped my screen to face him and explained his situation as I grabbed the necessary tools to fix his affliction. 

‚ÄúOh damn, no wonder It hurts so much. So what are you going to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell here we have a barometric clasp and a hypodermic needle filled with Biomed. The clasp is going to depressurize the air around your leg slightly, creating a vacuum. This will open up your fractures allowing the stem cells in the Biomed to cause spontaneous homeostasis and create new bone tissue.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh okay, I think I understand‚Ä¶‚Äù

I could tell he didn't understand most of what I said so I simplified it for him

‚ÄúIm going to put a needle in your bone and it's going to hurt.‚Äù 

The look on his face was that of pure horror. Perhaps I should've left it unsimplified l.

He shouted from the pain. The needle pierced his skin with ease. I felt the needle hit the chipped bone and knew I had to push deeper in order to get it right. I felt the needle grind past chunks of bones with friction. Bix screamed, but just like that it was over.

‚ÄúSo how many days until I can go back to work.‚Äù 

I laughed thinking he was joking. Then it dawned on me that this kid was dumber than a box of rocks. He really had no idea just how fast acting Biomed was.

‚ÄúBix you can go. You're fine now‚Äù

I might as well have told him he just won a million credits.

‚ÄúNo way, really? Thank you doc‚Äù 

Without hesitation he hopped right up as if to test if I was telling the truth. He looked surprised and jumped again in disbelief.

‚ÄúYes you can jump, now if that's all you may resume your shift Bix.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah sorry, have a good rest of you day Dr Weller‚Äù

I nodded and just like that he was gone with the sound of the blast door sealing shut.

I've been working all day by that point. I was starving. I switched my availability to AWAY in the ships database and left my office. The Ozymandias had its own set of gondolas that would take crew members all across the ship. As a doctor I know the importance of getting in your daily steps to remain healthy. And I don't get out of my office much. So I decided to walk to the cafeteria Bay. It was about 20 minutes of walking but I really didn't mind.

In the cafeteria I spotted the other group of scientists and decided to see if I could talk my way into whatever hushed conversation they were having. Lead researcher Isaiah Clampett didn't like me very much. He knew I wanted in on whatever secrets were being kept from me. The rest of the researchers had already been advised to not fraternize with me. Unfortunately for the CEC I'm the one who treats the research team's radiation burns. This means that they like me more than their employers. I feel like any day now I'll get one of them to tell me. We all ate lunch and then headed out separate ways.

I had to work for a few more hours before I could call it a day which meant I helped out 9 more patients before the end of my day. After work I headed to my room in the simulated green space. The simulated green space was roughly 4 times the size of an earth regulation football field. It had a holographic projector simulating a sky and there fans to simulate a breeze. Ultra Violet lights even allowed you to get vitamin D. Some people would tan, some people would play tennis or pickle ball. Me however? I liked to sit underneath the tree and read. The United Earth space council really wanted to avoid people going insane. They took great measures to reduce the chances of developing DSP.

ACT 2 

The next day I was back in my office waiting for Jacobs. I needed to make sure he was doing alright. Suddenly my door opened, but it wasn't Jacobs. It was one of the other doctors. She was dropping off supplies from the other side of the Ozymandias.

‚ÄúOh thank you Dr Nielsen. Do you need help unloading the hover lift ?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it's all pretty light , but thank you for asking‚Äù 

She methodically stacked the boxes into my supply cabinet and then sat down on my examination table. 

‚ÄúHave you gotten anything from the researchers?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately no, Isaiah's got them too afraid to speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn, I was excited. Oh well I guess I'll just ask you the next time I have to bring you more supplies.‚Äù It's crazy that you go through so much more than we do‚Äù

‚ÄúWell we are much closer to the engineering deck. Most of the injuries on board in that place .‚Äù

We talked for a little while longer before she decided to head back to her section of the Ozymandias.

Not long after Dr Nielsen left, I saw my door open. Jacobs came in and looked a little worse for wares. That was to be expected though. He was going through withdrawal. 

‚ÄúJacobs, you look like shit, how are yuh‚Äù

We both chuckled at this.

‚ÄúOh you know, I'm anxious and I've got the cold sweats.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny thoughts of suicide or homicide?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir‚Äù

‚ÄúAny other side effects like blood in your urine?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank God‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, good. I'm going to have you continue on the program. Take a half dose of Serenix this evening and spend some time in the simulated green space. I can give you a doctor‚Äôs note to get you off work early if you'd like.‚Äù

He was reluctant to accept, but he decided to go spend some time in the sim. I felt bad for him, but it was usual to see people coming off Serenix experience paranoia and anxiety. 

The rest of the day was more of the same routine. Someone comes in, I help as much as I can and they leave and everyone calls me ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù at some point. I spent 10 years in University just to get called doc like I'm out of some cheesy war film. Preposterous.

A sudden announcement rang out on the intercom. 
‚ÄúResearch team Red and Blue prepare for a shift change. All members, brace for descent.‚Äù

This was a common occurrence. We always had two research teams planet side and two aboard the Ozymandias. ‚ÄúShift change‚Äù was the teams for the two sets of teams changing out. I would get to see the yellow and green research team. I was excited to see some of them. I would also be trying to break through their veil of secrecy. The entire space vessel groaned like a foghorn as the engines ignited. I felt a sudden jolt as we sank out of orbit. That same feeling of momentary weightlessness that you feel on a roller coaster, shot through me making my hair stand up in excitement.

Approaching the planet side base of operation , I made my way to the airlock where the shift change would occur. I was being accompanied by a few other doctors (Dr. Nielsen being one of them). Teams red and blue were suited up in high pressure space suits. These were specifically designed for planets like Arumishi 7. The atmosphere on this planet is so thick that it is practically like being under the ocean. Think less like a conventional space suit and more like an old fashioned diving suit. The helmets had circular visors and the suits themselves were made out of a shiny brass colored alloy. It was easy to differentiate which team was which. The suits had clear tanks of Biomed on their back that illuminated the liquid with the color of their team.

The automated computer announced on the intercom.

‚ÄúNow docking at Innsmouth research station‚Äù

When the airlock opened we saw something we were not prepared for. Body bags.

‚ÄúJesus Christ what happened?‚Äù I exclaimed.

I hurriedly rushed over as I could tell more members were injured.

A member of the Green team explained through labored breathing.
‚ÄúSomeone on the yellow team apparently stopped taking Serenix. She went fucking crazy and killed 3 researchers. Two on green and one on yellow. She snapped when we tried to forcefeed her Serenix.‚Äù

I thought to myself in frustration ‚ÄúGod damnit. DSP cases are always bad, but never usually this messy.‚Äù Examining the injured researcher, I saw that his Biomed tank had been shattered. This is why he was still injured, otherwise the suit would automatically heal his wounds. These tanks are meant to be indestructible. This had to be done deliberately. I got him on a stretcher and prepared an injection. I found the source of the bleeding which was on his upper thigh. I exclaimed in shock, ‚ÄúThat crazy bitch got his femoral artery!‚Äù I swiftly, yet precisely, injected him. 

‚ÄúYou're going to be fine, but we need to get you to the med bay to do a blood transfusion‚Äù

Dr Nielsen and a few medics whisked him away while the remaining medics and I oversaw the decontamination procedures for the rest of the members. They all looked shaken up, and understandably so. However before we could allow them back on the Ozymandias, we needed to remove the ‚Äòbrine‚Äô from their suits.

This may come as a shock, but there is extraterrestrial life. No they aren't sentient creatures capable of speaking. It's more small animals and different species of plant life. The unique environment here on Arumishi has led to very odd lifeforms evolving. The atmosphere here is so thick that it borders between liquid and gas. The most common lifeform resembles a bird with gills, but there are also smaller creatures like barnacles mixed with jelly fish. They are able to float through the ‚Äúair‚Äù and they like attaching themselves to our suits. Honestly the Ozymandias was probably going to need scrubbing after we departed the Innsmouth labs.

The red and blue teams seemed less eager to do the shift change now and I couldn't blame them. The floor of the airlock was smattered in blood and Biomed gel. The macabre sight of what might happen if one succumbed to DSP was enough to make me shiver. After what had just happened I discussed it with Dr. Clampett over our wrist mounted hologram communicator. After some deliberation, we decided to delay the shift change until tomorrow as we cleaned up the research lab. The gore would take a while to clean. Not to mention the mental stress this would assuredly put on the red and blue team. After hanging up I dismissed the teams back to their quarters with medical clearance. When they left I decided to follow the cleanup crew through the airlock and take a further look. I was definitely not allowed in there, but the clean up crew didn‚Äôt know that. I wanted to know what it looked like there. I might be able to find out what the CEC is hiding.

The research station was much bigger than I expected. It was much newer than the Ozymandias as well. However the scene laid out before me was that of a triple homicide. I saw blood splatters on the wall. It looked like that lady had slit someone's throat. The blood leaked from the wall onto the floor. It looks like whoever's blood this was, based on the amount, they died almost instantly. The pool of blood then transitioned into bloody footprints as I imagine she went to attack the other person who had tried to feed her Serenix. The image of this slaughter made me pull out my tablet holder and take my next dose of Serenix out of fear. Looking back to the bloodstains I saw what must've been multiple knife wounds to the gut. On the floor were pieces of clothing stuck to chunks of flesh with a few pieces of intestines strewn about. Near the station's exit airlock I see where she ambushed the returning yellow team members. Shards of glass and biomed gel were on the floor, consistent with what I saw back over on the ship. 

Satisfied with my investigation, I decided to start snooping around the office. I flicked the switch on the hologram display table and the image of a topographical map hummed to life in a deep blue light. It looks like they're excavating a tunnel. I decided to look at their stock room in the labs as I was forming a hypothesis. The stockroom had bones in it. Why was the ‚Äúnuclear fuel research lab‚Äù collecting alien bones? I knew they were lying, but I still had no idea what the hell was going on. I wanted to check the rest of the labs, but I had already been in here too long. Soon enough Isaiah would be here and I could not be in Innsmouth when he arrived. He would report me to the CEC and I would probably get arrested or worse. I hastily made my way to the door and exited the station just in the nick of time. I joined my colleagues by the airlock as Dr. Clampett rounded the corner. He's a bitter old man with a big gray beard. However, instead of sending any sly remarks my way, he thanked me for saving his crew member‚Äôs life and told me he appreciated signing off on the shift change delay. It was then that I realized that he cared deeply for his crew. He said I was dismissed and I headed back home at the end of a long day.

The whole morning of the next day I was still thinking about the murders. Why the hell were we collecting bones? I poured myself a cup of coffee as I checked my roster for the day. Finally, no appointments besides Jacobs. Just as I was celebrating that fact, Jacobs made his way through the door. He seemed to be doing much better than yesterday. I did my whole examination and asked him a few questions again. From what I could tell, he was managing his emotions just fine on his last dose of serenix and I saw no reason for him to be withheld from taking his vacation. I signed his release documents.

‚ÄúWell Jacobs this afternoon we should be back in orbit. The skipper should be waiting for us when we get back. Then I suppose I'll see you in a month.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can't wait to get out of here. Some creepy shit has been happening ever since we landed. First the murders then the weird sounds.‚Äù

The local fauna do make deep, humming calls. I always found it to be peaceful, but I can understand that after yesterday's events that some might find it to be less than ideal. Jacobs shook my hand and told me that he'll bring me back a souvenir. I smiled warmly as I told him ‚ÄúI'll hold you to that. If I don't get a mug that says ‚Äò#1 Doctor‚Äô then I'll quit.‚Äù We both laughed as he made his exit.

On the intercom, I got a call to head to Dr. Nielsen‚Äôs lab. Apparently there was an issue with our returning research teams. She sounded distressed so rather than walking I took the gondola from my side of the ship to hers. Once on the gondola we got another call from the shipwide intercom. It was the captain speaking.

‚ÄúThe ship will begin ascension into orbit. All members, brace for ascent‚Äù

with that I felt gravity double as we lurched upward. The engines of the ship created a harsh whining noise like a drill. Then a loud cuthunk followed by a deeper hum signified that the engine started successfully. I was happy to be leaving the planet. At least if you're in orbit, other ships can come rescue you, but if you get marooned while you're planetside, the chances of getting rescued drop significantly.

I arrived at Dr. Nielsen‚Äôs office when I heard shouting. I saw a few members of the research team strapped down to the tables. The patients began kicking and screaming when they saw me, as if seeing me stirred their delirium. They were trying to break free from their restraints with great effort. The straps held them down tightly, refusing to let go. 

Dr Nielsen looked relieved to see me
‚ÄúOh thank God you're here. I need your input‚Äù

She walked me over to the nearest table with a researcher. 

‚ÄúThey started having psychotic fits of rage while in quarantine. Today they started speaking pure incoherent nonsense.""

The researcher was mumbling something about a call. It seemed like he was having a nervous breakdown and wanted to call his family. I felt bad for him. The time it would take to connect a call with earth would be about a day or more.

‚ÄúDid witnessing such a traumatic event cause this? I know that Serenix can only do so much, but I don‚Äôt know how else to explain this mass hysteria‚Äù

Just then the ship's power flickered and I felt a sudden shift in gravity. A loud bassy thud rattled the floor and I felt it reverberate in my chest. This was not normal, Both Dr. Nielsen and I looked at each other in a panic. 

The captain came on the intercom

‚ÄúThe engine has had a critical failure. We are losing altitude. All essential staff, man your posts. Non-essential workers, please return to your quarters until further notice.‚Äù

Dr Nielsen and I decided to go to the engineering deck to see if there were any injured workers. For all we know there could have been an explosion. We ran to the gondola, It was packed with people trying to return home. We made our way down the platform to the level below in hopes that there would be free space, but before we could get there it took off. 

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù I exclaimed as I started to panic.

‚ÄúWe have to try the next level, come on.‚Äù

As we got to the platform for the last gondola on this side of the Ozymandias, we saw the doors closing. 

‚ÄúCome on, we can still get a ride if we stand on the maintenance pad on the side.‚Äù

Quickly, we jumped the gap and landed on the tiny platform on the side of the gondola. This was usually for maintenance workers to repair lights or screens. Below us was about a 100 foot crevasse . Dark like the night sky on Earth, with small yellow lights dotting the bottom of the abyss that resembled stars. Between us and the bottom of the pit there were big metal cables. They were massive suspension cables that guided the gondolas from either side of the ship.

Once we got to the engineering deck we carefully hopped off the side of the gondola. Neither of us wanted to end up falling into the crevasse. When we entered the engine room we saw people overlooking a cavernous gap. I looked around for anyone I recognized. Standing front and center was Bix. I jogged over to him and asked for some clarity on our situation.

‚ÄúBix what happened? Is anyone hurt?‚Äù

He looked shocked. He answered in a slurry of confusion.

‚ÄúI don't why he‚Ä¶ He seemed fine earlier. He just grabbed a fusion coil, screamed something and.. And hurled himself over into the intake manifold.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait who threw themselves into the intake manifold?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe engineering chief, Jacobs. The crazy fucker tried fighting us and said something about ‚Äòwe need to go back down to the planet‚Äô he sounded batshit insane‚Äù

‚ÄúDear god. Jacobs.‚Äù

I felt immense guilt knowing I was the one who took him off Serenix. I did this to him. I thought about his family and then about his body being torn to shreds. I felt sick.

‚ÄúDid anyone else get injured?‚Äù Dr Nielsen asked.

‚ÄúNo ma‚Äôam. But we have a bigger problem now.‚Äù

I regretted asking, but needed to know
‚ÄúWhats wrong‚Äù

‚ÄúDepending on where that fusion coil ended up, we could be marooned‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòcould be‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell depending on the cycle of the engine, he either got immediately vaporized by the plasma as it was going into the rest of the engine, or he could have got sucked into the deeper parts of the engine when the heat sink opened up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what does this mean?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf he was instantly vaporized, all we would need to do is run a ‚Äòcleaning cycle‚Äô. It would remove any remains from the engine's smaller tubes. Basically flushing out the charm that would be stuck to the side of the tubes. However, If he made it deeper into the engine, then we could be looking at an explosion destroying a chunk of the engine. A fusion cool would create a home equivalent to the size of your office. Either way it takes about a day to even diagnose the problem.‚Äù

Well shit we're marooned.

#SUMMARY

#Part Two


The section begins with some text in the same font at the start of Part One by an unnamed narrator.




**(8) Stella**

Stella notices that the snow has covered up the red.  Her mind is filled with stories from the past that have been told to her for safekeeping.  As a child, all the cousins lived together, and Lou once told her a story about the sexual abuse that she and Paul had suffered.  Stella rarely visits her family now - Jeff felt uneasy about the visits, and the bus trip was too dangerous.

**(9) Paul**

Paul is working at the hospital when Pete calls her to say that something has happened to Emily, and he's bringing her in.  Emily arrives covered in blood and unconscious.  The doctor explains that she has received blood transfusions, and sutures to her vaginal wall, where glass particles were found.  Paul stays by her side as family members arrive.  When Pete walks in with coffee, Cheryl wonders if she really knows him.

**(10) Lou**

Hungover, Lou wakes to see Sunny and Jake asleep in the living room.  She reflects that Jake looks like his dad, James, who ran off for good to live with Darlene, telling Lou that she was too cold and superior.  She knows Gabe is cheating on her but still did his laundry.  When Cheryl calls her to the hospital, she switches off her thoughts and starts moving.

**(11) Cheryl**

Cheryl is feeling hot and bothered in the hospital room, when Louisa arrives and tries to take control.  Pete‚Äôs phone call had woken her from unsettling dreams, but she immediately went into action.  Police Officers Scott and Christie arrive and the younger Scott asks some preliminary questions, while Christie stands back and observes Pete and Louisa.  

Christie asks Paulina what time she left that morning and what Pete had reported.  Pete and Louisa suggest to Paulina that they go out for a walk, but she refuses until Kookum, who they thought was asleep, insists.  Once alone, Louisa asks Cheryl if she thinks Pete did it.  Cheryl denies it, though the thought has crossed her mind; she has to believe he's a good man.

**(12) Tommy**

Christie reprimands Tommy for asking questions in the presence of the entire family.  While being sympathetic to the mother, he had failed to notice that Pete looked shifty.  Tommy suggests that it's connected to last night, which Christie dismisses.  Tommy keeps thinking of his dream where Stella kept turning into his mother, and that he saw what she saw.  

When Emily wakes, the police return. Tommy asks her what happened.  She says  it was four men in black clothes, long hair, one with a braid, and that it happened outside. Tommy is happy that this supports his theory, but Christie notes that the description fits many people.  They then get a call about another victim.

**(13) Zegwan**

Ziggy is scared and worried because she hasn't heard from Emily.  She misses being back home with her grandparents and the open fields.  Rita notices Ziggy's smashed face and takes her to hospital.  She tells Ziggy about Emily and asks her what happened.  Ziggy explains that they went to a gang party, for a boy Emily liked, but his girlfriend beat her up, and Emily ran away.  Rita then tells her that Emily was raped.

**(14) Phoenix**

The day after the party, Phoenix is at her uncle's place with Roberta, Dez, Mitchell and Cheyanne.  She looks over at the Hydro towers where the events took place.  Everyone had been watching her; her uncle had looked at her, and Clayton had turned away.  She misses her sister Cedar-Sage who is staying with Luzia.

Bishop worries that the girl might talk but Phoenix reassures him.  He orders that the house be cleaned of everything - joints, kids, he wants nothing incriminating.
Phoenix knows that Clayton doesn't love her.  Taking Mitchell's phone, she calls Clayton and confronts him about disappearing.  She plans to get the others to clean the place and then she and her uncle will make plans.

The guy's a conservative family man. Same age as me, 35. What he's managed to do so far in life is stupifying. He has 3 plots, totalling about 5 acres. On one, he grows coffee, on another he has a rural 2 bedroom house. On the other, a town plot, he has another brick house..both houses have no plaster and are made using fired mud bricks. They'd make an urban slayqueen go Ew! But he's landed and not paying rent. How he did it was how our parents did it. Literally saving up to half his salary by committing to huge SACCO loans, staying close to his dad by helping out with family work in the farm and church, hence getting the best rural land deals, a good wife and financial advice, and of course being humble enough to live in an unplastered brick house. 
The shocking bit.. He earns less than 30,000 Kenyan shillings.
Land here is cheap. One of the plots was gotten after selling a bike. Makes you wonder about this whole Kenya is richer than Uganda thing. He seems to be doing better than me, though he envies my hotel room and fancy phone üòÅ. 

I have seen the same phenomenon in Kenya. Despite earing close to 200k, I still live in an overpriced apartment. My salary is still paying for a 50by100 plot in a thicket 2 hours drive from Nairobi. My 'backward', semi-literate cousins in upcountry have already built on their inherited farms (even if it's mabati homes) where they live with their wives and children. I have a car, but no house, no family, very little savings. Makes you wonder about this whole Nairobians are better off than upcountry people thing.

Last example, I have a friend working in Germany. He makes good money but tells me that the average working person in Munich cannot afford anything like the modern, 25k, 2-bedroom apartments we live in here in Nairobi. There you pay 500 Euros and get something that looks like a bedsitter. So he's living in an 800 Euros 2 room apartment with his wife and baby despite earning over 5 times my salary. He has no land and cannot even dream of buying, let alone constructing in Europe. So that means he'll be renting for life, and maybe retire to his house in Kenya after 65. But when he comes to Kenya, his rural cousins who live on their own inherited land and have families of 3-4 children envy him. I also envy him.. Makes you wonder..",8,1755237275.0,Kenya,3,1.0,False

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Ever wondered why you bought that coffee brand‚Ä¶
not because it tasted better,
but because it ‚Äúfelt‚Äù like you?

That‚Äôs the magic of emotional advertising.
It‚Äôs not about the product ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the feeling it creates.

The Science Behind Emotional Buying
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Studies in behavioral psychology show that over 90% of purchasing decisions are subconscious.
We think we‚Äôre making rational choices, but in reality, we‚Äôre driven by emotions like:

Happiness ‚Üí ‚ÄúThis will make me feel good.‚Äù

Fear ‚Üí ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to miss out.‚Äù

Belonging ‚Üí ‚ÄúPeople like me use this.‚Äù

Trust ‚Üí ‚ÄúI believe in this brand.‚Äù

Once the heart says ‚Äúyes,‚Äù the brain comes in later to justify it.

Examples You Already Know
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Apple doesn‚Äôt just sell tech ‚Äî it sells status and creativity.

Nike doesn‚Äôt just sell shoes ‚Äî it sells motivation and achievement.

Coca-Cola doesn‚Äôt just sell soda ‚Äî it sells happiness and togetherness.

These brands don‚Äôt lead with features.
They lead with stories and emotions.

How You Can Apply This
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
If you‚Äôre running ads or creating content:
‚úÖ Start with a feeling, not a product description.
‚úÖ Use stories and relatable scenarios.
‚úÖ Show the transformation ‚Äî before & after using your service/product.
‚úÖ Choose visuals, colors, and words that align with that emotion.

Remember:
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
People may forget your ad‚Äôs clever tagline‚Ä¶
but they‚Äôll always remember how it made them feel.

So the next time you plan an ad, ask yourself:
‚ÄúWhat do I want my audience to feel?‚Äù
If you can answer that, you‚Äôre halfway to a campaign that actually works.

What‚Äôs one ad you remember ‚Äî not because of the product, but because of how it made you feel?

Share it in the comments ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to see your examples.

My reflux had been getting steadily worse, I was taking 2x Nexium a day plus eating a lot of antacids and still had a lot of reflux. I'd also been getting worsening LPR symptoms (hoarseness, feeling out of breath, post-nasal drip, globus). After a few really bad events I made a lot of changes and although my reflux isn't completely gone, it's much much better and most days I forget I have it. I thought I'd share here what I've done, nothing here that you won't find already in this forum, but this is the mix that is working for me. Obviously I should've been doing this stuff 10 years ago but oh well, maybe this will help someone.

  
\- 10x 'Karrfalt' swallows, 10x 'Japanese' swallows, alternating water and dry swallows, in the morning before eating

\- No food close to bed time

\- No carbonated beverages (no beer)

\- No heavy tannin wines (pinot, whites instead)

\- Sleep more upright (extra pillows but not an incline pillow)

\- 3 coffees/day -> 1/day

\- Have reduced PPIs from 2/day to 1 every other day. Each reduction took 3 weeks and had a peak of rebound reflux about 12 days in

\- Gaviscon double strength for symptom control rather than Mylanta tablets or Eno

\- Melatonin 2-3x a week for sleep

I was the one ussing global/passport because I travelled to that citi a few days ago and wanted to meet people prior to arriving.

So I put my location to his city and we matched 3 hours after I left. What a pity. I swiped on him while being there but he saw it later. He works in law and travels often to sign contracts. So spends max 1 one day in a location. And he told me: oh you are not from here.... Well it would be great if you come back, If I have a contract in your city, i will reach out ;) (he put that winky emoji). He asked for my facebook.

So I gave it to him. The first thing I noticed is that on FB he has his real name and on bumble he used a pseudonym. Not a nickname, that would be good. But ""Wind"". Of course I found this weird even before we exhanged SM as it was clear it is not his name lol. I don't know how normal that is for online dating. I saw that most people use their first name and so i do.

So he replied to some of my stories (this happened 2 weeks ago) if I put beach pics. I live in a beach city so I am on the beach often. He replied with fire to swimwear photos. But doesn't talk to me. I don't just wait for a guy to text me. If I like him, I reach out. So I tried talking to him, asking him about his day but he barely replies.

Today I put another photo, to test lol. It was a swimwear pic again with a focus on cleavage (nothing vulgar or too revealing though) and he liked it right away. But he is not interested in talking.

Would he be interested in seeing me for a date? This is what he suggested himself. To meet each other if we end up in the same place and maybe have a coffee.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Giants vs. Rays: A Tale of Two Runnings (and One Very Confident Spread)**  
The San Francisco Giants and Tampa Bay Rays are set to clash in a matchup that‚Äôs as much about pitching chess as it is about hoping your team doesn‚Äôt suddenly forget how to hit. Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why the Giants are the statistical darlings here‚Äîthough ‚Äúdarlings‚Äù might be stretching it. More like ‚Äúteam that accidentally stumbled into the playoffs while doing laundry.‚Äù

---

### The Odds: A Math Class You‚Äôll Actually Enjoy

The Giants are the clear favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.75‚Äì1.82** (-222 to -200 in American odds). Translating that into plain English: bookmakers imply a **55‚Äì57% chance** San Fran wins. Meanwhile, the Rays sit at **2.05‚Äì2.14** (+190 to +210), suggesting a **47‚Äì49% chance**‚Äînot exactly the underdog of the century, but close enough to make Tampa fans reach for their *third* cup of coffee.

The spread? Giants -1.5 (-150) / Rays +1.5 (+130). That half-run cushion for the Giants screams ‚Äúwe expect this to be a low-scoring snoozefest,‚Äù while the Rays‚Äô +1.5 line is a lifeline for bettors who still think Tampa can pull off an upset. As for the totals? Most books peg the Over/Under at **8 runs** (1.87‚Äì1.95 odds), meaning this game is projected to be drier than a Napa Valley wine cellar.

### The News: Injuries, Comebacks, and One Mysterious Hamstring

Let‚Äôs spice things up with some *fabricated but plausible* team news (because real sports reporters get the actual news, and I‚Äôm just here for the jokes).

* **Giants**: Their ace, **Logan Webb**, is riding a seven-start win streak, throwing pitches so sharp they‚Äôve been accused of *cheating by the umpires*. Backup catcher **J.T. Realmuto** is ‚Äúday-to-day‚Äù after tripping over a water bottle during warmups. Yes, really. It was a *dramatic* spill.
* **Rays**: Their star shortstop, **Wander Franco**, is out with a ‚Äúhamstring injury caused by overenthusiastically celebrating a fly ball.‚Äù The team is also missing closer **Paul Sewald**, who‚Äôs ‚Äúon paternity leave‚Äù and ‚Äúunavailable for comment.‚Äù

1mqopg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1mqopg0/low_budget_cappucino/,Low budget cappucino,"tl;dr: A post on personal experience on brewing a good cup of cappucino on a budget, without expensive coffee makers

Now, I have been trying to make a good cup of cappucino at home for years and I wanted to share my experience on low budget jugaad for this. Feel free to chip in with suggestions on how to make this better.

A little background: I have been into coffee for about a decade at this point. Started with a small coffee machine we bought with donations at my PhD lab and found it to be very subpar. I decided I would build my own method, but with optimisation (read low budget) at home.

My equipment:
A basic rough ground coffee (I have tried everything from Blue tokai to Ethiopian to Filter coffee, and then finally decided I was going to stick to the cheapest ground arabica for french press. Have a hand grinder, and I've tried grinding coffee from places like Kanyakumari, but too much effort at the end of the day, so pretty ground cheap arabica works. Colombia for now)

A basic french press (had an expensive one, but cracked one fine morning, and got a cheap replacement off Amazon)

The cheapest kitchen scale (current one cost 189. You really don't need mg level accuracy, and this one serves the purpose)

A frother (Again, Amazon is your friend. Cost me about 300 or so I think. Definitely sturdy and more than enough. I have a kickstarter brother with nanometer mesh, meh)

A coffee mug you like, a double walled kitchen paper roll (Swiggy) and a plastic funnel (local supermarket)

Some basic milk (I tend to use low cream; use full cream if you want more froth)

Some normal stuff like a stirrer or a spoon and a way to get the milk warm (I use my induction at 2 levels below normal)

Now, the usual ratio is 1:12.5 for coffee to water. I tend to use about 300 ml water with 20 gm coffee because the coffee itself absorbs some water during the infusion, which is unavoidable, and I don't think the outcome is too watery. This makes me 2 doses. I either use it all if my partner is around or refrigerate it for the next time.

Boil water. Pour into French press loaded with the coffee and let it sit. I tend to steep for upward of 5 mins (mostly because I am going to make a cappucino). Go by your own taste here. This works for me.

Make a cone with your paper and put it in your funnel. Pre rinse with water and put on a container. 

Pour your coffee and let it drop till done. Takes about 15 mins, so be patient.

Now, about 5 mins before the drip is complete, put up your milk for warming. This is a bit important: don't let it boil. I go by my gut, but about 3-4 mins into warming at 1 level below normal, it tends to get a bit warm and fluffy. Shut off the stove and pour into frother. I tend to use about half of a 0.5 liter packet, so about 250 mils.

Froth it. Takes a few tries to get right, but fairly simple. This does make the milk a little lower temp, so do this at the end when you wanna drink. I also use half a teaspoon spoon sugar. Seems to make it a bit more frothy and tastes better. Don't use if you like it without.

Decant half of your coffee (should be about 100 ml) and this milk. Pura it about 1:2.5 ratio.

Enjoy your cappucino.

I noticed a small shift from 50s to 60s when I started working out less and prioritizing more active recovery like long walks etc. 

The latest biggest shift from low 60s - high 70s and then a record 91 last night has come from increasing coffee?! 

A week or so ago I had a 4pm Starbucks which, having struggled on and off with insomnia for a decade, felt like a death sentence but I desperately needed while travelling. My HRV skyrocketed that night and I‚Äôve kept up my new 4pm large coffee (about double my caffeine intake now) everyday and my HRV has been nothing but seriously increasing and my sleep has been.. fantastic?!

The office was silent except for the low hum of the ventilation system. Most of the lights had shut off hours ago, leaving only the pale pool of my desk lamp over the keyboard. I‚Äôd stayed late plenty of times before, but tonight‚Ä¶ something felt different. The air felt heavier, as if the room was holding its breath. My ears rang faintly in the quiet.

I saved my work, stretched, and decided to grab a drink from the break room before finishing the last report. The hallways were dark, the motion sensors kicking on only when I was halfway through each corridor. That‚Äôs when I heard it ‚Äî footsteps. Slow. Steady. Behind me.

I told myself it had to be Janet from accounting ‚Äî she sometimes worked late too ‚Äî but when I turned around, the hallway was empty. No footsteps. No movement. Just shadows. I held my breath, straining to hear. The sound didn‚Äôt come again until I started walking.

I quickened my pace, my shoes clicking louder than I wanted them to. The footsteps followed. I reached the break room and flicked the light switch. Nothing. The bulb hummed faintly, but the room stayed dark.

That‚Äôs when the sound changed. The footsteps stopped, replaced by a faint *scraping* ‚Äî slow, deliberate, like fingernails trailing along the wall just outside the doorway. My stomach tightened.

I backed out, heart thudding, and headed to my desk. My monitor was still on, but my spreadsheet was gone. In its place was a new file, filling the screen with a single sentence, typed over and over in neat black letters:

**DON‚ÄôT TURN AROUND.**

I just stood there. The air behind me shifted ‚Äî warm, damp, as though someone was leaning in close.

And then I heard it. Breathing. Wet. Slow. Too close to be real.

My fingers trembled over the keyboard, but before I could move, the desk lamp flickered once‚Ä¶ twice‚Ä¶ and went out.

The darkness wasn‚Äôt empty.

I woke up in my bed the next morning, drenched in sweat. My alarm clock was blinking 12:00 ‚Äî the power must have gone out in the night. My head throbbed, but the sunlight spilling through the blinds was almost enough to make me laugh. Just a nightmare. A bad one, but still a dream.

I shuffled to the bathroom, still groggy. The cold tile woke me up as I turned on the faucet and splashed water on my face. My reflection looked pale, eyes sunken ‚Äî like I hadn‚Äôt slept in days. As I brushed my teeth, the lingering unease from the dream started creeping back in.

Something about the way the air felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The quiet in my apartment wasn‚Äôt peaceful. It was the kind of silence that felt *occupied*.

I caught myself glancing over my shoulder more than once. Just a habit, I told myself. Dream residue. Still, my chest felt tight.

By the time I went to the kitchen to pour coffee, the knot in my stomach was impossible to ignore. My hands were shaking when I reached for the mug, though I couldn‚Äôt say why.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

On my desk, across the room, sat my work laptop. The lid was open, the screen glowing faintly.

I was the one ussing global/passport because I travelled to that citi a few days ago and wanted to meet people prior to arriving. 

So I put my location to his city and we matched 3 hours after I left. What a pity. I swiped on him while being there but he saw it later. He works in law and travels often to sign contracts. So spends max 1 one day in a location. And he told me: oh you are not from here.... Well it would be great if you come back, If I have a contract in your city, i will reach out ;) (he put that winky emoji). He asked for my facebook.

So I gave it to him. The first thing I noticed is that on FB he has his real name and on bumble he used a pseudonym. Not a nickname, that would be good. But ""Wind"". Of course I found this weird even before we exhanged SM as it was clear it is not his name lol. I don't know how normal that is for online dating. I saw that most people use their first name and so i do. 

So he replied to some of my stories (this happened 2 weeks ago) if I put beach pics. I live in a beach city so I am on the beach often. He replied with fire to swimwear photos. But doesn't talk to me. I don't just wait for a guy to text me. If I like him, I reach out. So I tried talking to him, asking him about his day but he barely replies. 

Today I put another photo, to test lol. It was a swimwear pic again with a focus on cleavage (nothing vulgar or too revealing though) and he liked it right away. But he is not interested in talking. 

Would he be interested in seeing me for a date? This is what he suggested himself. To meet each other if we end up in the same place and maybe have a coffee. That city is not very close to my own, a few hours drive or one hour flight. But I have friends there so I can go, but I don't know.

>This is not my story. It belongs to my 40-year-old, hot, athletic friend who could outrun you but not out-comment you, which is why she is too chicken to post here herself. I am the designated messenger. Please be kind‚Ä¶ or at least be funny.

""I recently had a moment of disturbing clarity. All of my romantic crushes in the past decade have been at best hot dumbasses and at worst callous, predatory jerks.

The latest reality check came when one of them, a guy I briefly dated for two weeks, posted a 5 page ‚Äútell all‚Äù on social media. He was trying to get sympathy after being screwed over by his equally shady best friend and business partner. The irony is that in telling his side he accidentally outed himself as someone who enabled and participated in all the same nonsense right up until it was his turn to get betrayed. The level of self entitlement and lack of self awareness was comedically impressive.

Reading it gave me this weird glee, relief that I got out so fast, and also horror at what I had been attracted to in the first place.  

When I look back it is a pattern. These guys are always in great shape, high energy, good looking, and often excel in one area such as sport, career, or music. But emotionally and socially they are like spoiled clueless teenagers, low on empathy and accountability, and allergic to actual partnership.

I am not here to blame them for everything. I take full responsibility for missing the red flags and being dazzled by superficial charm. But here is the thing. In all these years I do not think I have met an available guy who is both cute and decent. I am not holding out for perfect, I just mean someone I am attracted to who also has integrity and maturity.

Hence, I have rejected the ‚Äúhot dumbass‚Äù dating pattern as a strategy. I have gone on coffee walks and casual dates with average looking men in the hope of finding a better quality connection. In most cases they were still shallow, just not hot, or I could not grow any attraction to their looks no matter how much I tried. Over five years I have found a few good male friends, but nothing romantic. I worry that my inner bar for physical attraction is higher than it is for other women I know, and I do not feel like I can control it. To avoid chaotic relationships I have ended up alone for several years because I do not want to force myself to touch someone I am not into.

I have tried putting myself out there more, but I live in a place where my social options seem limited. My friends suggest maybe **I need to move** or at least find ways to be in healthier social and professional circles (easy to say). Waiting for random chance feels like a very low probability strategy at this point.

If you have ever moved to a new city with the goal of improving your dating life or social circles, **how did you make it work? What helped you meet better quality people without slipping back into old attraction patterns?** I would love to hear success stories and also mistakes to avoid from anyone who has restarted their social life somewhere new.

# Best 60 ml Cup 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

The 60 ml cup, seemingly simple, plays a vital role in precise measurement and dispensing across diverse fields. From accurately measuring espresso shots for the perfect coffee to portioning ingredients in culinary arts and pharmaceutical applications, its importance in achieving consistency and precision cannot be overstated. This guide will explore the best 60 ml cups available in 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for various needs. We will cover different materials, designs, and user considerations to help you make an informed purchase.

## Key Features analysis

The construction material significantly impacts a cup's durability, chemical resistance, and temperature tolerance. The ideal material depends on the intended use, with options ranging from food-grade plastics to durable glass and stainless steel.

**Material:** The most common materials for 60 ml cups are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), glass, and stainless steel. PP and PS are lightweight and cost-effective, often used for disposable or single-use cups.Glass offers excellent chemical resistance and is suitable for hot or cold liquids, while stainless steel provides superior durability and temperature tolerance for demanding applications.

The dimensions of the 60 ml cup are crucial for ensuring accurate volume measurement and compatibility with various dispensing systems. Precise dimensions prevent spillage and ensure consistent results.

**Dimensions:** Typical dimensions for a 60 ml cup include a diameter of around 5 to 6 centimeters and a height of approximately 4 to 5 centimeters. Though, the exact dimensions may vary depending on the cup's shape and design. A wider diameter allows for easier filling and stirring, while a taller cup might be preferable for containing liquids with a tendency to froth or splash.

The graduations marked on the cup's side enable users to measure liquids accurately. Clear and precise markings are essential for applications where precision is critical, such as in laboratories or kitchens.

**Graduations:** Many 60 ml cups feature graduations, typically in milliliters (ml) or ounces (oz), to facilitate precise measurements. The accuracy and legibility of these markings are paramount. High-quality cups often have embossed or printed graduations that are resistant to fading or scratching, ensuring long-term readability.

Some 60 ml cups are designed with ergonomic features to enhance user comfort and ease of use.This can include features like a handle, a non-slip grip, or a spout for controlled pouring.

**Ergonomics:** Ergonomic design elements contribute to the cup's usability, especially in repetitive or professional settings. A comfortable grip reduces hand fatigue, while a spout prevents spills and allows for precise dispensing. Some cups also feature a wider base for increased stability, minimizing the risk of accidental knock-overs.

The temperature rating indicates the range of temperatures the cup can withstand without deforming or leaching harmful chemicals. This is especially important for cups used with hot liquids or in laboratory settings.

**Temperature Rating:** The temperature rating is a vital consideration for cups used with hot or cold liquids. PP and PS cups generally have lower temperature ratings, suitable for room temperature to slightly warm liquids. Glass and stainless steel cups offer higher temperature resistance, making them suitable for boiling water or extremely cold temperatures.

The type of rim on the cup can affect its usability and prevent spills. A rolled rim can provide added strength and make the cup easier to grip, while a smooth rim can make pouring easier.**Rim Design:** The rim design of a 60 ml cup influences both its structural integrity and pouring performance. A rolled rim adds strength to the cup, preventing deformation under pressure. It also provides a comfortable and secure grip. A flared rim facilitates smooth and controlled pouring,minimizing spills and drips.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** The cup's small size and simple design make it a cost-effective solution for measuring and dispensing liquids. Disposable cups made of materials like PP or PS are particularly inexpensive, making them suitable for high-volume applications or single-use scenarios. Reusable cups made of glass or stainless steel offer long-term cost savings while minimizing environmental impact.

**Easy to Clean and Maintain:** Depending on the material, 60 ml cups can be easily cleaned and maintained. Glass and stainless steel cups are dishwasher-safe and resistant to stains, while plastic cups can be easily washed with soap and water. This ease of cleaning ensures hygiene and prevents cross-contamination, especially in food-related or laboratory environments.

1mqoebg,https://github.com/CrazyCoder/XBRecipeWriter/releases/tag/2.2.0,XBRecipeWriter: rewrite / edit recipes on xBloom NFC cards,"**<TL;DR>**

Android-only fork of XBRecipeWriter, the app to write / edit NFC cards, that tracks the newest xBloom card format (tea recipes, longer pauses, custom dose & grinder RPM), fixes a few broken official cards on scan, and lets you reuse old cards. Credits to [terminaldisclaimer](https://github.com/terminaldisclaimer); iOS updates may follow from the OG repo.

**</TL;DR>**

Hey all! I‚Äôve released an update to XBRecipeWriter.

It‚Äôs a fork of the [original app by terminaldisclaimer](https://github.com/terminaldisclaimer/XBRecipeWriter), which hasn‚Äôt been updated since early 2025 and is missing some of the new xBloom firmware features (tea recipes, longer pauses, etc.). I‚Äôm in touch with the OG developer, they did the heavy lifting by reversing the card format and building the OG app, and they plan to review my changes and release an iOS update later.

# What‚Äôs new / why you might care

* Follows the current card format more accurately, so the behavior matches the official NFC recipe cards as closely as possible.
* Proper support for custom doses and grinder RPM (removes a limitation still listed in the original README).
* Lets you reuse old NFC cards for your own beans or fix invalid recipes.

# Real-world fixes

* The Hibiscus tea card shipped with 120 ml pours instead of 90 ml, which threw off steep times. The app detects and corrects this automatically on scan.
* I also received a coffee with a wrong recipe; I rewrote the card with the correct recipe shared online, and it worked perfectly.

# About ‚Äúmagic‚Äù blank cards

* You can use blank ISO 15693 SLIX/NFC-V cards with changeable UID, but they‚Äôre \~$3‚Äì5 on AliExpress and usually not worth the effort.
* To get them working with xBloom, you‚Äôll also need a Proxmark3 (to change the UID and clone the initial card), which is another \~$30.
* For most people, just reuse official cards from coffees / teas you‚Äôve already brewed (simplest and cheapest).

# Platform

* Android only for now. (iOS may get these updates later via the original repo.)
* The app is written in React Native / Expo. You can build it from sources and install a debug version on your device manually.

# Credits & disclaimer

* Huge credit to **terminaldisclaimer** for the format research and original app.
* Not affiliated with xBloom. Use at your own risk and back up your cards.",2,1755235124.0,x_Bloom,2,1.0,False

My city used to have an emergency shelter program that ran from November to March. But now they only do it during ‚Äúsevere weather,‚Äù and they fill up before noon, leaving the majority of our homeless people on the street. Our regular shelters have 12 month WAITLISTS. This is my hometown, and it‚Äôs honestly embarrassing that the city is just letting people freeze to death on the street. I will save y‚Äôall the rest of the rant, but I‚Äôm pissed and trying to do all I can so at least people aren‚Äôt dying this winter.

I wrote a grant proposal for an outreach project, and I got an interview.  If I get it, it‚Äôs not a lot of money, but it‚Äôs enough to fund what I‚Äôm trying to do, which is pass out hot drinks and cold weather survival supplies. I‚Äôm just focusing on cold weather stuff.

I have the following list compiled so far:
- Tarps
- Emergency bivvies (better alternative to the flimsy emergency blankets that rip super easy)
- Wool blend socks
- Cough drops/cold meds
- Hot coffee, hot cocoa
- Jackets or ponchos
- Gloves
- Hats
- Garbage bags? (for waterproofing)
- Jolly Ranchers
- Nature Valley granola bars (or some other non-nasty, nut free bar)
- Tuna salad kits
- Hand warmers/hot packs
- Sleeping bags

Any other cold weather supplies that I‚Äôm leaving out? Or ideas for high calorie snacks that would be allergen-friendly or could be chewed without teeth?

I‚Äôm also wondering if anyone has tips on where to find camps? I‚Äôm NOT handing out exact locations to the anyone but the volunteers, but I am trying to scout some out to create routes for the volunteers. The city has been sweeping all of the major camps, so I have no idea where they all relocated to :/ Also, how the hell are people getting behind the fences on the highways?

Any other input is also welcome!

1mqob3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PivotPathway/comments/1mqob3a/why_slow_living_isnt_what_you_think_it_is/,Why Slow Living Isn't What You Think It Is,"https://preview.redd.it/5iyvyi08a4jf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c47067c4a317d6bb08bdd870ac0a7bf1a08825

If you've ever felt your heart tugging toward something quieter while your calendar screams the opposite, you're not alone. The truth is, slow living isn't about having endless hours or living in a Pinterest-perfect cottage. It's about something much more accessible and revolutionary: **learning to stretch the moments you already have**.

I know what you're thinking. You've seen those dreamy slow living posts online with hours-long morning routines and perfectly curated spaces, and your reality looks nothing like that. Your mornings are rushed, your home is lived-in, and your schedule is packed. But here's what I've discovered: slow living has been hijacked by aesthetics when it's really about *intentional living*.

**Think of it this way: slow living is simply being present enough to notice the steam rising from your coffee cup.**

That's it. That's the gateway. Not a complete life overhaul or a move to the countryside. Just training your senses to focus inward instead of being scattered across a million distractions. When you're truly present in even the smallest moments, something magical happens. Your nervous system calms, gratitude flows more easily, and life starts feeling richer without adding a single thing to your to-do list.

The secret lies in what I call ""stretching your moments."" Take that cup of coffee you already drink every morning. Instead of scrolling your phone or mentally rehearsing your day, try this: sit with it for just three extra minutes. Notice the warmth in your hands, breathe in the aroma, watch the steam dance upward. **This isn't being extra or indulgent. This is revolutionary self-care disguised as an ordinary moment.**

You might worry that people will think you're being dramatic for lighting a candle during your afternoon tea or taking time to actually taste your lunch. Here's the thing: our culture has normalized chaos and distraction to the point where being intentionally present feels radical. But maybe that's exactly what we need. Maybe stepping away from the collective overwhelm is the healthiest thing you can do.

Start ridiculously small. Pick one routine you already do and commit to being fully present for it. Maybe it's your evening skincare, your morning coffee, or those few minutes before sleep. Turn off the overhead lights and use a lamp instead. Put your phone in another room. Let your senses wake up and notice details you've been missing.

**Small things done consistently will always beat big things done sporadically.** You don't need to transform your entire life overnight. Just shift ten minutes from mindless scrolling to mindful presence. Build these tiny habits until they become second nature, then gradually expand from there.

If you're in a particularly busy season, embrace what I call ""double duty."" Soak your feet in an Epsom salt bath while enjoying your tea. Listen to an audiobook during your morning routine. The key is choosing activities that complement rather than compete with your intention to be present.

Your slow living starter pack doesn't require a trust fund. Find one mug that feels like home when you hold it. Invest in some warm lighting through thrift store lamps or simple candles. Choose clothes that make you feel beautiful and grounded, whether that's a cozy sweater or a flowy dress that makes you want to twirl. These aren't frivolous purchases; they're **tools for creating an environment that supports your nervous system**.

*What if I told you that romanticizing the small moments in your life isn't silly or self-indulgent, but actually a form of resistance against a culture that profits from your distraction?*

When you choose to be fully present with your morning coffee, you're declaring that this moment matters. When you light a candle for your evening wind-down, you're prioritizing your peace over productivity culture. When you take time to notice beauty in ordinary things, you're training your brain to find joy in what you already have.

The most beautiful part? This practice grows stronger with time. As you learn to stretch moments and tune into your senses, you'll find yourself naturally slowing down in other areas. Decision-making becomes clearer. Overwhelm lessens. You start living *with* your life instead of constantly racing ahead of it.

**Your invitation starts now: choose one moment from today and stretch it. Just three extra minutes of presence. Notice what you notice. This isn't about perfection; it's about practice.**

The world needs more people who are grounded, present, and intentional. Start with your next cup of coffee, and let that steam rising be the beginning of your own quiet revolution.

I have a very decent family, I have no serious health issues, I don't drink or do other substances. I am deeply grateful for that. But outside, I feel a wee bit dead.

I don't really have any hobbies. I say I like to play video games, or read, write, draw, watch movies, paint, cook, etc, however I barely can bring myself to do it half the time. 1 fear I may not have fun, or I am wasting money, or time. The only thing that catches my attention nowadays is social interaction (but even then its spotty, I have been hating social interaction more and more with my family for almost no paticular reason sometimes) and scroling on social media, which is horrible for me as I do not wish to become codependent, and because social media is horrible for the attention span. I feel the only things that I can actually bring myself to do are my bare responsibilities. But outside that? I almost feel husk-ish.

A lot of the things I used to do I no longer find fun. And anything now is almost unfun for me. 1 hate drawing because my skill levels haven't improved very much, leat basically nothing for breakfast and lunch nowadays besides coffee, and when I do eat, I both find a lot of food either kind of bland or uninteresting, and get full super easily. I hate going to the gym because I unfortunately always had the quirk of if I don't see immediate change I get discouraged ( recognizel that is something with me, but I do not know how to change). Video games are so unfun, music is honestly getting harder and harder to captivate me, I feel guilty takina breaks, etcetera etcetera. I feel I can go on.

Just making a post like this is extremely difficult as cannot formulate words very well.
Does anyone have advice for my next course of action? I feel there is still so much missing. What should I do? Thank you",1,1755234523.0,depression,2,0.67,False

It was 2:47 AM. I‚Äôd been staring at my screen for six hours straight, watching ChatGPT spit out another generic, lifeless product description that looked like it was written by a robot having a bad day.

‚ÄúMake it more engaging,‚Äù I typed for the 47th time.

‚ÄúAdd emotion,‚Äù I pleaded.

‚ÄúMake it sound human,‚Äù I begged.

But deep down, I knew the truth that every marketer fears to admit: I was drowning in prompt hell, and my competition was leaving me in the dust.

The Brutal Reality Every Marketer Faces

While I was playing prompt roulette, Sarah from the agency down the street was closing deals with visuals so stunning they made my best work look like amateur hour. Her product images didn‚Äôt just showcase features they told stories that made people feel something.

Her video ads didn‚Äôt just inform they moved people to action.

And here I was, still typing ‚Äúmake it better‚Äù into a text box like some kind of digital beggar.

The Moment Everything Changed

Then I discovered something that shifted my entire world: PrometheusAI.app.

This wasn‚Äôt another AI tool promising the moon. This was different. This was the tactical solution I‚Äôd been searching for in the dark corners of the internet at 3 AM, fueled by desperation and way too much coffee.

What Hit Me Like a Lightning Bolt:

üéØ Catalog-Quality Product Image Prompts- No more guessing games. No more ‚Äúclose but not quite.‚Äù Just prompts that deliver magazine-worthy visuals every single time.

üéØ Short, Ad-Ready Video Prompts- Scripts that grab attention in the first 3 seconds and don‚Äôt let go. The kind that make thumbs stop mid-scroll.

üéØ Universal Compatibility- Works flawlessly with Midjourney, Veo 3, and every major AI platform. No more learning a dozen different prompt languages.

The Transformation Was Instant

My first campaign using PrometheusAI prompts? 347% increase in engagement.

My client‚Äôs product launch? Sold out in 6 hours.

That feeling when you finally have the right tools? Priceless.

Stop Playing Prompt Roulette With Your Career

Every minute you spend wrestling with prompts is a minute your competitors are pulling ahead. Every ‚Äúmake it better‚Äù you type is another opportunity slipping through your fingers.

Your clients don‚Äôt care about your prompt struggles. They care about results. They care about visuals that convert. They care about content that sells.

PrometheusAI.app isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs your tactical advantage in a market that shows no mercy to the unprepared.

The Choice Is Yours

You can keep doing what you‚Äôve always done, getting the same frustrating results, watching opportunities pass you by‚Ä¶

Or you can arm yourself with prompts that actually work.

Prompts that deliver.

Prompts that convert.

Prompts that put you ahead of the competition while they‚Äôre still figuring out how to make ChatGPT stop sounding like a corporate manual.

Ready to end the prompt struggle once and for all?

Your solution is waiting at PrometheusAI

1. Take it half an hour before your breakfast and 1 hour before you plan to study/work. 

2. Make sure the breakfast is a high protein one. 

3. Make sure you have gotten 7-8 hours of sleep, take melatonin if required. 

4. *Most Important* leave the house! Use office premises, library, coworking places where you can see other people working. ADHDers require that extrinsic motivation. You‚Äôre wasting stimulants if you‚Äôre sitting in your room, no matter how much you try to work/study.

5. Start with organising your work/study. Keep a tracker of total open tasks, pending tasks etc. This will help a lot in building momentum and avoiding stress. 

6. If no palpitations or anxiety related problems on inspiral, you can add coffee as well. ",7,1755234078.0,adhdindia,3,1.0,False

No Resume, No Skills, Just Your Phone?! (Is This The Easiest Side Hustle EVER?!)","UHHH‚Ä¶ Who else is just finding out you can literally get PAID to TEST APPS right now, with *zero experience*? Wait, this is actually real??

I genuinely thought all these ‚Äúwork from your phone!‚Äù claims were fake or something. But apparently, Beta Tester jobs are an actual side hustle? LIKE‚Äìsomeone will literally PAY to have you try out random apps, poke around, and complain about what‚Äôs broken? Why did no adult ever tell me about this growing up??

So I did some super suspicious late-night Google digging ‚Äì you know, expecting the usual too-good-to-be-true trap. But loop me in here, because I fell down the rabbit hole, people are cashing out weekly by clicking this link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

Like you sign up for new apps, follow a checklist (‚ÄúDoes the home screen even load?,‚Äù ‚ÄúIs the chat button hidden behind something weird?‚Äù etc.), and BAM, that‚Äôs your review. Some folks are making $20, $30, even $70 a day?? Not full-time wages, sure, but this is literally scrolling for money.

Here‚Äôs EXACTLY what shocked me:

- There‚Äôs no resume or fancy skills checklist.  
- No coding. No tech requirements except an actual functional phone.  
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ‚Äì they just want real people, i.e. us, to try fresh apps before big launches.
- Easy application = 5 minutes. Honestly less work than rewriting a password you forgot.

This is what REALLY tipped me over:

- Teens, retirees, literal grandmas in their pajamas are doing these jobs side-by-side.
- It‚Äôs not about knowing tech ‚Äì it‚Äôs about noticing stuff and giving feedback. (‚ÄúButtons make no sense!‚Äù, ‚ÄúVideo autoplays? Help!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe logo looks off-center!‚Äù)
- Most jobs pay with PayPal, some give Amazon or Steam gift cards if that‚Äôs your thing.

And it‚Äôs actually fun??? You get to test out all the weird, unreleased, sometimes totally broken apps before everyone else for FREE. Sometimes you find a future viral hit. Or a complete disaster (which is sort of hilarious).

So confused. And honestly a little mad. Why did nobody TELL ME this is a thing?  
If you want to test the waters, click **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and check out the offers. It‚Äôs not like a huge application or anything‚Äìjust enter basic details, verify your device, and you get matched with your first TESTs.

To sum up, here‚Äôs the certifiably EASY starter kit:

- Click this link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Make an account (no fees, no longform nonsense)
- Answer ‚ÄúWould you try an app for cash?‚Äù‚Ä¶and proceed to collect little PILES of coffee money for basically being you.

Legit, I feel *betrayed* by every career counselor who made resumes feel like the only option!

1mqnpmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mqnpmu/my_28f_partner_37m_asked_me_if_i_was_comfortable/,My (28F) partner (37M) asked me if I was comfortable with him rejoining a kink community. Have we missed any boundaries?,"So, needed background. We‚Äôve been dating since 2017, and have been living together since 2020. We had a child in 2024.  


The most crucial detail, however, is that we are both asexual. For me, completely sex repulsed. I find sex and all its fluids disgusting, and I‚Äôve never actually had intercourse. I do not like kissing, and I do not think I am missing out on anything. Before it is asked, we conceived our child via IUI. No sexual activity required on my part. 


My partner, Adrian, is more sex neutral/positive, and explored his sexuality a lot more before discovering he was ace. One of the places he found comfort was in the less sexual, more sensual aspects of BDSM. Such as bondage, submission, etc. But he never liked kissing, or actual sexual intercourse. 


When our more casual form of ‚Äúdating‚Äù became us being more committed life partners, he stopped because he hadn‚Äôt chosen to tell me about this. Now, he brought it up to me to see if I would be comfortable him rejoining that community, given that I can not meet this desire of his (and would not, if I had any sexual desire). He also wanted to know what my boundaries would be. 


I am actually very fine with this. It‚Äôs not like we have any sexual relationship, we don‚Äôt have a romantic relationship per se. Above anything, I want him to be happy and fulfilled, and I this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm comfortable fulfilling. 


What I‚Äôve come here for is not advice on whether or not I am wrong for giving him the go ahead. We‚Äôre not going to break up, we‚Äôre committed life partners who are getting married next year (for tax benefits and health insurance for the most part). We plan to have one more child in the future. 


These are the boundaries we‚Äôve agreed to. The advice I would like, especially if anyone is part of the kink community, is if we are missing an obvious boundary or safety rule. 

Boundaries
- No sexual acts that could lead potentially to an STD (oral, penetrative, etc)
- Nothing that is just plain gross (blood, bathroom stuff)
- I need to know when and where 
- It cannot be in our home
- I don‚Äôt want my child to be in the vicinity  of any people he plays with, because that is just not necessary 
- He cannot neglect anything with our kid, no missing events or activities
- If it‚Äôs going to be a longer term partnership, I want to at least meet them (get coffee or whatever)
- I want him to be safe, and if anything happens that he didn‚Äôt want, I want us to talk about it
- I need to have a way to contact him in an emergency, like something goes wrong with our kid. 


I‚Äôm truly not worried about this as a whole. We don‚Äôt have a sexual or romantic relationship, and it‚Äôs important to me that he feels happy and fulfilled. 


So, I turn to Reddit to see if you have any ideas of boundaries and rules we might have missed. I‚Äôm sure people will have issues with asexuality, or our age gap, or be confused by our relationship. But I‚Äôm not interesting in advice on those fronts.

Just walked out of the test center two days ago with my CISM cert in hand. Man, what a journey these past 10 months have been. Had to share with you all since this community kept me motivated.

I've been in IT/InfoSec for 15+ years, currently working as SRE-III & Information Security Manager. Deal with enterprise stuff daily .  
Study resources that actually worked: CISM Review Manual - yeah, the boring official one but necessary CISM QAE Database - seriously, buy this. Practice questions saved my butt  
Mike Chapple & Peter H. Gregory books - solid explanations Prabh Nair's video course - this guy breaks it down really well, definitely worth it

My routine was all over the place honestly. Some weeks were great - 1-2 hours after work, 3-4 hours on weekends. Other weeks? Life happened and I barely touched the books. Don't beat yourself up if you're not perfect with schedule. The last month though - I went all in. Practice exams became my best friend. Did probably thousands of questions.

Exam day reality check - actually finished early (15 mins left) which surprised me. Some questions made me second-guess everything I knew. Stuck with my gut feeling on most answers. Coffee beforehand was a mistake... too jittery 

Got my AWS Security Specialty and ITIL V4 already, so CISM was the missing piece of my governance puzzle. Feels good to finally have the trio!

Thanks to everyone here who answered my random questions and shared tips. This sub is gold. Anyone still studying - you got this! It's tough but totally doable. Hit me up if you want to chat about anything specific.",7,1755232679.0,cism,2,1.0,False

1mqnlgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1mqnlgk/zaandam_trip_returned/,Zaandam trip - returned,"I just returned from the 7-day Alaska from Vancouver trip. It was really excellent. The things I had questions about before going:

Balcony Room or no? We chose the room and then spent very little time on the balcony. If you can afford it, it‚Äôs a lovely luxury. If not, don‚Äôt stress. The ship was full and felt roomy. We always had seats by the windows or on decks whenever we wanted them. 

Glacier Bay: worth it. It‚Äôs really special and we had a gorgeous day there. 

Excursions: unless they are bucket list items, or you have OBC, I‚Äôm not sure they are so amazing. We did one in Juneau - sea kayaking, which was fun and affordable after our OBC - but booked everything else once ashore. It gave us flexibility for rainy days (which we only had in Ketchikan) and the prices were better. We did not book any late excursions that might cause us to be late to the boat, so keep that in mind. The boat waits for delayed excursions they plan. 

Food: we had great meals in the Pinnacle Grill and Canaletto. The dining room was very good. Dive-in on the Zaandam was perfect every time. Lido Market was convenient but not amazing. 

Drinks: we did the HIA package and worked it hard for 6 days. On the last day we just couldn‚Äôt manage any more‚Ä¶it was fun! Bartenders were mixed but the Crow‚Äôs Nest - John - and the smokers corner bar were amazing. 

The average age skews older but it was a great time. 

Other things:

We enjoyed the trivia games, the game room and singing with Marcel. We saw one show and it was entertaining but not spectacular. The performers work hard and were fun. It‚Äôs was enjoyable. 

Our cabin stewards were amazing. They always greeted us by name - including our 15 year old son. I heard them say sir and ma‚Äôam to many others. They were very attentive to our needs and while they might be to everyone, it felt special. We also did the laundry package and it was a lifesaver. We packed less and clothes were cleaned and pressed every day. They provided us extra laundry bags and we often sent three bags each day. We tipped them upon arrival and again at the end. 

The only place to get non-drip coffee was the cafe on the 5th deck. While the lines weren‚Äôt ever very long, it often took a while to get a coffee. I‚Äôm not sure there is anything to do but be patient but it was an initial surprise. Once adjusted, the coffees were consistent. I enjoyed them. Our son enjoyed the hot chocolate, often. 

Overall, it was a really good experience to Alaska on HAL. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.



The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fianc√©, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.



She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 



I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.



My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex\*\*usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.



They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.





Chapter 1

Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fianc√©, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.



I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.



The lie shattered on a Tuesday.



Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 



But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 



A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.



I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.



I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fianc√©, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.



He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.



And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.



Kiera Reese.



She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k\*\*s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki\*\*ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.



My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.



I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.



""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 



""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.



""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 



""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 



""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 



Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 



He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.



I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.



My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.



I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.



 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 



The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.



I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch\*\*t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.



They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.



They were about to find out just how wrong they were.





Chapter 2

The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.



""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k\*\*s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.



""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 



""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 



I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 



""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 



The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.



""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 



His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 



He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.



It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.



I typed it in. The lock clicked open.



The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.



It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.



The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 



It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 



I clicked it open and my bl\*\*d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 



They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fianc√© was raising with her.



The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.



I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.



""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 



It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.



She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.



""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 



Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 



The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.



But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.



She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.





Chapter 3

Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.



I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.



Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.



The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.



The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 



I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.



I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.



I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 



Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 



The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.



""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.



""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 



The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.



My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.



""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 



She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.



Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 



""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st\*\*king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 



""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 



""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 



My breath caught in my throat.



Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki\*\*ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 



""You promise?"" she whispered.



""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in\*\*mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 



A placeholder.



The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.



I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.



I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.



As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.



""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 



I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.





Chapter 4

Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.



""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 



""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 



There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 



The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.



I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.



I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.



""Those ba\*\*ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 



""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 



""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 



""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 



Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 



As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.



But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl\*\*d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 



I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh\*\*per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 



Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d\*\*g you?"" 



It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.



The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.



I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 



Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 



""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 



That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st\*\*ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.



I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.



When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.



""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 



I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.



""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.



He ki\*\*ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.



""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.



That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fianc√©e. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.





Chapter 5

The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.



""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 



My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 



They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.



We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 



I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.



""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 



Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d\*\*g, but from the betrayal.



After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 



""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 



""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.



""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 



I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.



""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 



They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.



""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 



A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 



I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.



The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.



When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.



""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 



I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.



I played the part of the smitten fianc√©e one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.



""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 



""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.



""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k\*\*s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.



The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.



I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.



I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 



""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.



Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.



My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.



My phone buzzed. A message from Debi. ""Wheels up in 30. You're free."" 



I looked at the scene one last time, a tableau of their perfect, fake happiness. I felt nothing. No anger, no sadness. Just a profound, empty peace.



I dropped my phone into a storm drain, the screen shattering on the concrete below. I had already canceled the number, wiped the data.



Aliana Donovan was gone. I turned my back on the glittering mansion and walked toward the airport, toward my new life, without looking back.

*August 15, 2025 ‚Äî A Game Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Strike Zone in a Sandstorm*

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters are the overwhelming favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.5 to 1.56** (implied probability: **62.5% to 66.6%**). Meanwhile, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles trail at **2.4 to 2.5** (implied probability: **40% to 42.8%**). It‚Äôs the baseball equivalent of betting on gravity‚Äîsure, the Eagles *could* defy expectations, but only if physics takes a coffee break.

The spread reinforces this: Hokkaido is favored by **1.5 runs**, with odds between **2.0 and 2.16**, while Tohoku‚Äôs +1.5 line pays **1.62 to 1.75**. For context, a 1.5-run lead in NPB is like having a 10-point lead in the final minute of an NBA game‚Äîcomfortable, but not insurmountable if chaos ensues.

Totals are set at **5.5 combined runs**, with the **Under** slightly more valued (odds: **1.77 to 2.14**) than the Over (1.69 to 2.0). If you‚Äôre betting on runs, imagine a game where both teams‚Äô offenses act like they‚Äôre playing with a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Break the Internet‚Äù rule‚Äîconservative, cautious, and slightly confused.

1mqnbmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1mqnbmr/tesla_emergency_braking_almost_caused_an_accident/,Tesla emergency braking almost caused an accident!,"To preface, I sometimes park the same way and this feature was turned off or just set on late warning as it made the car abruptly stop on day two since ownership. 

I was trying to parallel parking fairly quickly as I didn‚Äôt want to cause traffic as the parking spot was near by T intersection, allowed parking as per usual. 

I drove partially in and out of the parking spot between two cars as it was big enough to do so, my Tesla emergency broke right before me and stopped blocking the lane as I was still in the right lane. I hope this makes sense. The PROBLEM is that I had turned this feature off since day two and I never used the emergency brake assist as it did similar thing earlier in my ownership. I thought it was idiotic so I either turned off or set on warning and late. Someone at TESLA decided that it‚Äôs smart to set this to early and on with the last update. Tesla, what in the world. Seriously someone fire this smart A$$.

1) I am the only driver
2) I know exactly what setting the car was on
3) this has occurred once before in different instance hence why it was turned off/set to warning only

I‚Äôm glad that the cars behind were turning right and two I didn‚Äôt have hot coffee in the centre cup holder. 

I‚Äôm sure someone will find this feature useful but I think it‚Äôs too aggressive and often overreacting. 

Additionally the FSD lane assist while FSD is off is also overreacting on unmarked road. 

Battery degradation is real and 270 miles is more like 150. 

Tesla service is overpriced and the reps can be a hit or miss. 

I‚Äôm sharing this to hopefully help someone and also for TESLA to fix their Sh!t!

1mqnb9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1mqnb9g/hungerdehydration_despite_solid_intake/,Hunger/dehydration despite solid intake?,"I am three weeks post op, doing purees/soft foods for another 2-3 weeks. I am struggling with a couple things that my dietitian and surgeon have not encountered before and I am hoping people here might be able to help. 

The first is I have symptoms of dehydration - dark yellow urine, dry mouth and lips, and desperate thirst frequently through the day. However, I am drinking 1.5-2L of water daily, with additional fluids from smoothies and milky (single shot) coffees. I drank equivalent amounts of water and coffee pre op and was never dehydrated. I have added in some electrolytes, which is helping a bit, but not enough. 

The second is I am so starving so much of the time, and especially after eating. The starving feelings start in the afternoon, maybe 2pm, and are truly intrusive in the evenings. It feels super stressful. I don‚Äôt think it is food noise or head hunger because the sensations are in my chest and throat and I am not focused on food at all, just washing the sensations would go away. 

Another factor is I have ME/CFS. No-one in my care team knows the condition well and I can find nothing online about how bariatric recovery should be managed alongside it. However, because it is a condition of dysfunctional energy metabolism, and because I used to get very symptomatic when I didn‚Äôt eat enough before surgery, I suspect the hunger may be my body telling me I am not eating enough. 

Does anyone, anywhere have any insights into any piece of this? I feel pretty isolated and overwhelmed by it. 

(I am drinking 1.5-2L of water a day, getting 60-80g protein each day, eating basically an egg, a homemade protein shake with milk, protein powder, banana and frozen fruit, two 250ml cappuccinos (single shot, no sugar added), and 30g of fish or chicken or pork.
