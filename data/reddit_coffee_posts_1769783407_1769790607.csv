Scroll if you’d like I am gonna get a little personal lol.

I start work at 7am, in the last few months I weaned myself off having an energy drink before the sun is up and switched to coffee (still need the energy kick I am not great in the morning especially with my job-I’m a welder so I can’t afford to be scrapping off work often) some days I don’t have time to make myself a coffee which is fine, however I’ve noticed that caffeine is the ONLY thing that helps keep my bowel movements regular, like an exact time window (I think I have a touch of ibs so either excess or nothing) with no caffeine I still ‘feel’ the need to go yet absolutely nothing ends up exiting my body. During different periods of my cycle it’s either better or worse—hormonal changes DO affect the microflora of your gut so bowel changes during height of hormone changes can affect this anyway. 

Laxatives barely make a dent, high sugar content the same even though I’ve cut out A LOT of processed sugars except for an occasional treat. 

Does anyone else experience anything similar? I’m slowly coming to realise I may actually have some bowel problems/ consistency, and also absorption rate of nutrients so I am looking to get this checked out (it’s a very long winded process, someone I was close to spent 2 years getting nowhere before being put on bc and she gave up) my lovely endo/pcos ladies, do let me know as one side of my family that are riddled with this (every single woman) I haven’t spoken to in my life so I’m short of advice/similar experiences. 

I will not be cutting out caffeine otherwise I am not even joking when I say I cannot pewp for up to 3 weeks which is quite detrimental. Any additional supplements/ remedies to help would appreciated if anyone has any tips and tricks

but there’s one thing about him that has been slowly making me lose my mind.

he is *always broke*.

and i don’t mean “broke sometimes” like most of us.

i mean he is the type of broke where he still goes out, still orders food, still wants to do stuff, but magically never has money *when it’s time to pay*.

at first it was small things.

like:

can u cover my coffee? i’ll send it later

my card is acting up, can u just get this?

i’ll pay u back when i get home



and because he’s my friend, i did it.

and because i’m not trying to be weird about money, i didn’t make it a big deal.

but it started adding up.

10 here.  
20 there.  
35 for uber.  
50 for dinner.

and every single time, he’d swear he was gonna send it.

and every single time, he would “forget.”

like i’d text him:  
hey can u send me the 25 from last night?

and he’d reply:  
omg yes sorry i forgot sending now

then nothing.

then i’d have to remind him again.

and he’d act like i was being dramatic for asking.

one time he even said:  
damn u really keeping tabs like that?

and i was like… uh yeah? because it’s literally *my money*???

but whatever.

i kept letting it slide because i didn’t wanna be that friend who turns everything into an argument.

until last weekend.

we went out with a group. drinks, food, the usual.

and at the end, the bill comes.

mike looks at it, then looks at me, and goes:

hey can u cover mine? i’m short right now. i’ll pay u back tomorrow.

and i swear something in me just snapped.

i said:  
no.

he laughed like i was joking.  
c’mon, don’t do that.

i said:  
i’m serious. i’m not covering u anymore.

he immediately got annoyed.

he was like:  
are u really gonna embarrass me right now?

and i was like:  
embarrass u? u’ve been embarrassing *me* for months making me chase u for money u promised to pay back.

he rolled his eyes and said:  
it’s not that deep. u know i’m good for it.

and i said:  
no. u’re not. because if u were, i wouldn’t have to keep reminding u.

he got quiet, paid for his own stuff (so clearly he had money???) and after that he barely talked to me.

later that night he texted me:  
u didn’t have to make it a whole thing. u could’ve just helped me out. friends do that.

and i replied:  
friends also don’t treat each other like personal atms.

now some of our mutual friends are acting like i was harsh.

one of them literally said:  
u know how mike is. he doesn’t mean anything by it.

and i’m like… okay?? and?? i don’t mean anything by wanting my money either.

i’m not rich. i work hard. i budget. i’m tired of paying for someone who thinks it’s cute to “forget.”

so yeah.

aitj for refusing to spot him and basically calling him out in front of everyone?

When you see an entrance/exit like where the red arrows I have are, it means it is a right-turn entrance only, and a right-turn exit only. You should not be turning left in or out of this opening. It is designed this way to prevent the left turn lane from backing up to the east, where the 131 exit ramp is at right off screen. If you are needing to come from the east and go to the car wash, you should be going all the way to the intersection, turning left, and taking the back entrance in to the car wash. That's what that road is there for.

  
You can see the same thing in action on the north side of the street right above my red arrows. If you are coming from the west and need to get in to that parking lot, you should be turning left at the intersection and then right in to the parking lot. If you are trying to go east out of that parking lot, you should be going out the ""back"" way, going to that intersection, and turning left.

  
I've seen this issue with trying to turn left in to these no left turn areas happening all around the GR area. It happens in Standale around Meijer, as well.

  
I just figured I'd post something about it in case it helps even a single person try and avoid the frustration of sitting there trying to turn left in to a place where you're going to be actively holding up traffic for a long time lol.

I am a 56 year old male who was an ultra runner and work out enthusiast.  I had been working out diligently all January but always felt a little out of shape. I experienced difficultly  breathing but felt like I was just getting older. Jan 31 I came home after a treadmill workout had a cup of coffee and talked to my wife. I went upstairs to get ready for work and found myself hyperventilating. I decided to catch my breath in the bed and ended up going unconscious. Next thing I remember my wife on top of me giving me mouth to mouth on the phone with 911. Paramedics arrived and got me in an ambulance. I had no idea what was going on. Got to hospital and can answer all questions they had of me- who was the president etc - not a stroke etc.  admitted in and couldn’t find anything wrong except for high blood sugar. It wasn’t until after numerous ct scans and MRIs that they told me a had an unprovoked bi lateral PE.

Unrelated but my sister in law passed away 20 years ago from a PE so clearly the diagnosis was distressing to all.  Since I presented as potential neuro I could not drive for 3 months and had to prove I didn’t have a seizure disorder. I have had hematology, endocrinology, neurology appointments yet there is no thoughts on how this happened .

# Auschwitz, Dachau, and The One Mr. Corso Helped Liberate 

When I returned home from the Army, stationed in West Germany during the Cold War until the Wall (Iron Curtain) came down, I worked the summer at a pizza shop in my old neighborhood until I left for my first semester of college.

A childhood friend and I were the pizza delivery guys for the night. But the night was slow. We hauled up in a booth tucked out of the way and drank coffee. It really must have been slow because Mr. Corso, the owner, joined us with his signature pizza pie.

As we dug in, he asked what conversation he was interrupting. Eric said that I just told him about my visit to the first of Hitler’s Nazi concentration camps—Dachau, near Munich, Germany.

“Oh, yeah, what was that like?” He asked.

Eric and I grew up in the neighborhood, getting into more than our share of mischief. We had reputations as “fun guys.” But I put my slice of “za” down and gave an honest and vulnerable answer.

My entire Army unit went on this tour of Dachau while we were in Munich for cross-training with German troops. Most of us were 18-20 years old and knew this would be a “dark tourism” experience, but nothing prepared us for what we were about to see. Every one of us felt the eeriness, and it was much heavier than anyone could have imagined. I think in the hours we spent navigating horror after horror, we lost an innocence we had when we arrived. The tour’s crescendo left us slack-jawed, staring at the actual ovens used in the crematorium to burn God knows how many bodies of the poor souls who suffered at the hands of absolute evil there. Our hearts were so heavy, not a word was spoken, even well after we were free to walk around outside. The stories, the ashen remnants, everything, were a lesson we would carry the rest of our lives.

“I mean, Mr. Corso, we were seeing something decades after the fact. It was a concentration camp, but not one of the major extermination camps. Could you even imagine what it must have been like to be there WHEN this was happening?”

“No way! I can’t wrap my mind around it!” Eric interjected.

“I can. I was there, then,” Mr. Corso said, measuredly.

He led with what it was like to storm the beaches of northern Europe and then march through Europe during World War II. He really piqued our interest. Now, to us, this was just sweet ole, Mr. Corso. But the stories he told of that invasion made our hair stand on end. Eric’s cigarette turned into one long ash still in the shape of a cigarette. His hand never moved, and he never took his eyes off the old man.

He then told us that the Allied forces pretty much had no idea what was going on behind enemy lines for all those years of war. There might have been some whispers of horrific things happening, but nobody was prepared to see the hell on Earth that awaited unsuspecting troops like me. Mr. Corso continued, We were your age when we marched in—and our innocence, or any left at that point, marched out. Nothing could prepare you for what we saw. The guards had abandoned the Death Camp. We looked at living skeletons with a thin layer of skin reaching for us. We opened everything to free everyone and shared food, but beyond that, we didn’t do anything else except call for humanitarian aid. We were on a mission and had to continue our advance. We left, carrying visions of them in haunting thoughts that will never not seem like it just happened today.  How could human beings do that to other human beings? I’ll never know the answer. Unfortunately, it was a scene we’d come across again and again. I can still smell it. There are no words that’ll ever capture it.

Eric and I were absolutely mesmerized, hanging on his every word.

“Hey! Hey! Those boys don’t want to hear your tired old stories all night. Get back here. We have pizzas to make!” Mrs. Corso browbeat her husband back to the kitchen, unaware of the story he had shared.

Decades later, I’d visit “[***Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away.***](https://auschwitz.net/)***”*** At the [Cincinnati Museum Center](https://www.cincymuseum.org/).

Auschwitz was a complex of World War II concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in southern Poland, near Kraków. The Yiddish word for the town was Oświęcim.

The traveling exhibit brings the story of Auschwitz to the broader world to witness its horror. Hundreds of artifacts are used in this telling, on loan from the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland and other institutions. But the prevailing story of this Death Camp is one of survival! The artifacts presented include prisoner shoes, clothing, children’s dolls, eyeglasses, and the sinister concrete posts that were part of the extermination camp’s fence.

The preservation of this story and its artifacts is to remind future generations everywhere of one of history’s darkest times, in the hope that it is not repeated. It happens gradually, then all at once, with great propaganda, turning a population against what the powers deem the enemy within. Germans didn’t understand the gravity of the situation until it was too late. Would you?

She spent 7 days crafting real designs, thinking it was part of the interview process. At the end, she got a polite rejection. No pay, no credit, just a line in her memory that said she existed for a week.

She laughed it off, saying, “I guess I just worked for exposure,” but I could see the frustration in her eyes. It hit me how normalized this kind of thing is. Companies present it as a “test” or “trial,” but it's really free labor. People spend hours, even days, producing actual value, and the system treats it like it doesn't matter.

Meanwhile, those in power benefit from all the work without any risk. It's literally a quiet way to exploit ambition and hope, and everyone acts like it's normal. It isn't just about my friend. This happens to thousands of job seekers, especially in creative industries.

The invisible rule seems to be that your time and skills are free until someone decides you're worth paying. That shapes how people view work, fairness, and self-worth. It teaches the wrong lesson: that effort is optional or that your labor is only valuable if someone else approves.

I keep thinking about her sitting at her laptop, designing logos and mockups that would have been sold to paying clients, while the firm drank coffee and smiled politely at her. Opportunity shouldn't feel like exploitation.

**Key Points:**

- ELITE allows ICE to map potential deportation targets using various government data sources.
- The tool's address confidence score informs officers about the reliability of target locations.
- Operational practices may involve turning off safeguards to broaden target searches during special operations.

The Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) tool developed by Palantir empowers Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by integrating diverse data sources to identify individuals for deportation. With the ability to produce a geographical overview of potential targets, ELITE utilizes a confidence scoring system to evaluate the reliability of address information, which informs officers on where to focus enforcement efforts. This reliance on data analytics raises serious questions about the degree of discretion exercised by officers and the impact on communities where such raids are conducted.

During the published user guide analysis, it became clear that ELITE is not merely a straightforward identification tool; it also includes mechanisms that can widen the number of targets based on directive operations. With reports that officers can deactivate filters designed to limit searches to individuals with final orders of removal, ethics and civil rights concerns have come to the forefront. Critics, including Senator Ron Wyden, express unease over the possibility of indiscriminate targeting of communities, likening it to a coffee shop search based on proximity rather than merit or circumstances of individuals’ cases. Community apprehension around such measures illustrates the broader implications of technology facilitating already controversial enforcement actions.

How do you think tools like ELITE should be regulated to ensure ethical use in immigration enforcement?

So I am currently posted in ObGyn right now and theres this SR who has been quite friendly with me and giving attention since day 1. During joining day I was assigned some other unit but by chance she was there in the department that day. She called me and asked which unit I had been allotted. Then she said you will work in my unit now and went to talk to the clerk and got it changed. 

Then when we started working she was like you will only report to me now and only I will assign you all the work to do. Initially I thought this was some new form of toxicity and I was the sacrificial lamb but soon my impressions would change. On our first duty she called me again and started giving me work to do. She also specifically told the JRs not to give me any work. It was the usual scut stuff and as I was getting the work done she praising my ‘sincerity’.

Few hours in she wanted a coffee break and asked me to tag alongside her. She wanted to go the canteen which was bit further because the coffee there was better or something. Along the way she asked me questions about like where I was from, how my mbbs went etc and also some general hospital and departmental gossip. I also a person who likes to talk so I just went along with it easily. 

This started becoming the norm as the days went by like she used to come in and swoop me aside from the rest and then I was basically her personal assistant cum companion till I was on duty. My co-interns and the JRs didnt seem to have much problem with it. They were juniors themselves and I was doing  my fair share of work but I did get some looks when when we used to come back from the coffee breaks. 

Personally I didnt mind this arrangement because she wasnt too intrusive at first and I was being treated well. Also getting to learn things directly from an SR was a bonus I felt. But over the course of my posting I felt she got more possessive. Like once I was repairing an episiotomy and facing some difficulty so I asked the JR who was there for help. JR hesitated a bit then agreed. While she was teaching me the SR saw this and scolded her badly saying I gave you some other work what are you doing here and all. 

Then she started flirting casually like commenting about my hair, my clothes, if I go to the gym etc. She asked about my relationship status, my past, what I look in a partner. I told her I like girls who are more intellectual. Couple days later she started sending me reels from these science pages and posts about philosophy. I don’t use insta so she was sending screenshots and screen recordings. 

By this time I was pretty sure what was happening but because she was super senior I decided its best to just do my work sincerely and finish this posting without any unnecessary complication. But yesterday while I was off duty I recieved a call from her in the evening. She sounded a bit troubled over the phone and it looked like she was sobbing a bit. She asked if Im free and could meet her somewhere in campus. I wanted to avoid but since she sounded aggrieved I just said yes. 

When we met she was like sorry for calling you like this but I felt youre the only one I could talk to about this. Then she started crying and telling how her dad is sick and she was missing her family etc.  I tried consoling her and suggested her to take a home trip. She was like I recently took leave and I cant take it again. Then she was like Im happy that I met you and atleast I can share this with you and thanks for being there etc.

At that moment I just offered my support to control the situation but then she just confessed.

She was like I really like you and want to be in a relationship with you. I just froze after hearing like I didnt know what to say. Outrightly rejecting her at that point felt very insensitive but I couldnt just say yes as well. I told her this was all very sudden and need time to think. 

Now its been a day and I dont know what to do. Im at a point in life where Im just focused on my career, exams and planning my future ahead. A serious relationship is something I dont have mental bandwidth for let alone being in one with an SR. 

But I also can sense her emotions and I feel she has gotten somewhat attached to me. Its like everything was going fine and suddenly Im in this situation out of nowhere. I dont want to fuck up my posting. I feel there is no right decision I can make here.

Im hoping for some advice. Whats the best way to get out of this situation?",0,1769789409.0,indianmedschool,7,0.5,False

Just a weird thing about my MIL I’ve noticed that makes gift giving a sort of weird game to navigate/ ends up requiring us to correct her a lot.

So my MIL will basically not give you a gift for anything she does not personally approve of. It doesn’t matter if it’s an interest of yours - if she doesn’t like it then she won’t gift it. Silly things mostly, one year I asked for flavored coffee syrups but she told me she didn’t get them for me because they’re not healthy. Or my husband asked for a Mario game and she wouldn’t get that because she doesn’t really like video games.

It’s no big deal when she decides not to give us something because she doesn’t agree with it. It’s sometimes a bit weird that she brings it up instead of just not saying anything and happily giving the other gift ideas on the lists we send her but truly I am not bothered when she neglects to get a specific gift.

For us though - if we give \*her\* something related to her interests she views that same approval/like in the reverse direction and thinks we are basically saying we have common interests. For example she’s very religious - my husband has stated no religious gifts can be given to her because she would take it as meaning we are also religious. Or this year we got her a bread warming basket as she makes a ton of bread. My husband cannot eat wheat bread and I don’t really buy, eat or make things that include bread as a result. But now she keeps giving us biscuits and loaves of bread since she somehow views the gifting of the basket as meaning we’re down with bread lol. We had to tell her we don’t really eat it and she should stop giving it to us although we do appreciate it and all the work that goes into it. She asked for a calendar of my daughter and gave me a calendar of family pictures of her in return 😂

It’s just a silly little thing that makes giving her gifts hard! It becomes this game of like ‘ok we’re gonna give her x which means we either need to be ok with receiving x in return or we have to tell her right away that we don’t like this thing and we got it because \*she\* does’.",5,1769789134.0,Mommit,14,0.78,False

I've seen quite a bit of critique around it, as if it's dull in some way, but what do you think about it? I mean, as far as I can understand, it is more introspective kind of thing, more of a character study, and staying back to keep what you have rather than venturing outwards to win some prize - but that's a common theme in many works. So I question what makes cosy fantasy different in this regard then, why the separate sub-genre? Is it maybe just romance fantasy?

1qr9gu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGame/comments/1qr9gu1/brookridge_moments/,Brookridge Moments,"The town of Brookridge sat at the edge of a long, winding river that locals simply called the Bend. It wasn’t marked on most tourist maps, and that suited the residents just fine. Life there moved at a comfortable pace, governed more by habit than by clocks.

Evan arrived on a Tuesday afternoon with a backpack, a small rolling suitcase, and an address scribbled on the back of a receipt. He had rented a room in a converted farmhouse just outside town, owned by a retired couple who spent most of their time tending to an ambitious vegetable garden.

Mrs. Harlow greeted him at the door with a warm smile and immediately offered lemonade. Mr. Harlow gave a polite nod and returned to adjusting the sprinkler system.

Evan’s room overlooked a field that stretched toward a line of trees. In the distance, he could see the river glinting in the sunlight. After weeks of noisy city streets and cramped apartments, the quiet felt almost unreal.

He unpacked slowly, arranging his books on the small shelf by the window and setting his laptop on the desk. He had taken a month off work, hoping to reset after a demanding year. Brookridge had seemed like a good place to do that.

His first few days were spent exploring.

He discovered a café that baked bread fresh every morning and played old vinyl records in the afternoons. He found a used bookstore run by a man who remembered every customer’s name. He learned that the hardware store also sold fishing bait and homemade jam.

In the evenings, he walked along the river path, watching the light fade and listening to insects take over from birds. Sometimes he sat on a flat rock near the water and skipped stones, trying to beat his own record for consecutive bounces.

On Thursday, he met Clara.

She was sitting on a bench near the Bend, sketching the trees reflected in the water. Evan hesitated, then asked if she minded company. She scooted over and introduced herself without looking up from her drawing.

Clara had moved to Brookridge two years earlier to help her sister renovate an old house, then decided to stay. She worked remotely as a graphic designer and spent her spare time hiking, drawing, and volunteering at the community center.

They fell into easy conversation.

Over the next week, their paths crossed often enough that it began to feel intentional. They shared coffee at the café, traded recommendations for walking routes, and debated which season was best in Brookridge. Evan favored autumn. Clara argued for late spring.

One afternoon, Clara invited Evan to help paint a mural at the community center. It depicted the river winding through town, framed by wildflowers and distant hills. Evan wasn’t much of an artist, but he held ladders, mixed colors, and filled in small sections under Clara’s guidance.

By the end of the day, his arms were tired and flecked with blue and green paint, but he felt oddly accomplished.

That evening, a small group gathered behind the center for an informal potluck. Someone brought folding chairs. Someone else brought a portable speaker. There were homemade casseroles, fresh bread, and three different kinds of pie.

Evan listened more than he spoke.

He learned about the annual summer festival, the high school football rivalries, and the ongoing debate about whether the old bridge should be restored or replaced. The conversations overlapped and drifted, punctuated by laughter and the clink of utensils.

Later, as the sun dipped below the trees, Clara pointed out a cluster of stars just becoming visible.

Evan realized he hadn’t looked up at the night sky this much in years.

His days settled into a rhythm.

Mornings started with coffee on the farmhouse porch. Afternoons were for reading, writing, or wandering into town. Evenings were often spent with Clara—sometimes walking, sometimes cooking together, sometimes just sitting quietly and listening to music.

He finished two novels and started a third. He wrote long emails to friends he hadn’t spoken to in months. He found himself sleeping more deeply than he had in a long time.

One rainy day, Evan helped Mr. Harlow organize old tools in the barn. They uncovered dusty boxes filled with photographs, ticket stubs, and newspaper clippings from decades past. Evan was struck by how ordinary moments accumulated into something that felt substantial.

Another afternoon, Clara showed him a hidden trail that led to a small overlook above the river. They sat on a fallen log and watched the water move far below them, neither in a hurry to speak.

As his departure date approached, Evan felt a quiet reluctance.

He knew he would leave. That had always been the plan. But Brookridge had slipped under his skin in a way he hadn’t expected. It wasn’t dramatic or overwhelming. It was simply… comfortable.

On his last night, Clara walked with him to the Bend.

They skipped stones one last time. Evan managed seven bounces, his personal best. Clara applauded softly.

They talked about future trips, projects they wanted to finish, and books they planned to read. They avoided anything that sounded like a goodbye.

When Evan returned to the farmhouse, he packed most of his things but left his notebook out on the desk. He wrote about the mural, the potluck, the quiet mornings, and the way the river curved through town like it had always been there waiting.

The next morning came too soon.

Mrs. Harlow pressed a small paper bag of cookies into his hands. Mr. Harlow shook his hand firmly and wished him safe travels. Clara walked him to the edge of town, where the road widened and the bus stop waited.

They hugged, promised to stay in touch, and stood together until the bus appeared in the distance.

Evan took a window seat and watched Brookridge recede behind him. Fields gave way to trees, trees to open stretches of highway. He pulled out his notebook, reread what he’d written the night before, and added a final line about how some places teach you things without ever trying.

He closed the notebook, leaned back, and smiled faintly as he remembered that somewhere out there, someone was probably losing the game.",1,1769788939.0,TheGame,0,1.0,False

I have been a resident of Westerra for 7 years now. When we built here, the developer promised us a quaint little walkable neighborhood with sidewalk-facing ""boutique"" shops along a ""main street"". I envisioned a coffee shop, maybe a food or pub place with sidewalk patios etc.

Then I saw the new site plan. It is the same suburban sprawling hellscape that we see in every other neighborhood on the outskirts of town. The main street design is gone. It is all just stripmalls, drive thrus and the usual mix of box stores and grocery etc.

I am fine with grocery and some of the usual stuff you see in these business districts, but they took away the one thing that was supposed to make this neighborhood different.  We moved out here because we thought this area of town would be interesting and different. The developers advertised some modern, forward-thinking urban design. 

Anyway, I just wanted to vent. Serves me right for trusting them in the first place I guess.

India's merchandise trade with the EU hit **USD 136.54 billion** in 2024-25, with Indian exports growing at a blistering **16.4% CAGR** (from $41.36B to $75.85B) since 2020-21. The EU is grabbing nearly **90.7% of India's export value** with immediate zero-duty access.

# 2. ""Instant Zero"" for Exporters: The EU's Tariff Gift

The EU will eliminate duties immediately on **70.4% of tariff lines**, covering sectors like:

* **Textiles & Apparel:** 100% duty-free entry (currently up to 12%)
* **Leather & Footwear:** 100% immediate access (up to 17% duties gone)
* **Marine Products:** 94.4% tariff lines (up to 26% duty eliminated)
* **Chemicals:** 59.3% immediate access

# 3. India's Strategic Calculated Opening

New Delhi isn't giving away the store immediately. India offers:

* **Immediate duty-free:** 49.6% of tariff lines (30.6% of trade value)
* **Phased elimination:** 39.5% of lines over 5/7/10 years (63.1% of trade value)
* **Total coverage:** 92.1% of tariff lines and 97.5% of trade value—enough to satisfy EU demands while protecting sensitive industries.

# 4. Farmers Get Market Access Without the Risk

Indian agricultural exporters gain preferential access for **tea, coffee, spices, grapes, gherkins, and fresh produce**—boosting rural incomes. But the ""sacred sectors"" remain fortress-protected: **beef, poultry, dairy, seafood, rice, wheat, and edible oils** are shielded from EU competition.

# 5. The Services Bonanza: 144 Sectors Unlocked

Forget just goods—this is a services powerhouse. India secured commercially meaningful market access in **144 sub-sectors** including IT/ITES, professional services, education, and R&D. The EU got commitments in 102 sectors like maritime transport, finance, and telecom.

# 6. Visa Wins: 3-Year Work Permits + Family Rights

Indian professionals get unprecedented mobility rights:

* **Intra-Corporate Transferees (ICTs):** 3 years extendable to 5 (with family members allowed to work)
* **Contractual Service Suppliers:** 12-month cumulative stays in 37 sectors
* **Business Visitors:** 90 days in any 6-month period
* **Independent Professionals:** 12-month access to 17 sectors

# 7. Your Indian Degree Finally Counts

The FTA creates a pathway for **mutual recognition of professional qualifications**. Plus, AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, etc.) practitioners can provide services in EU member states using their Indian qualifications, and wellness centers get guaranteed market access.

# 8. ""Made in India"" Rules Get Smarter (and Simpler)

New Rules of Origin (RoO) allow **self-declaration of origin** via a digital DGFT platform—no more waiting for bureaucratic stamps. Key features include ""absorption"" (once a component is Indian/EU made, it stays that way through the supply chain) and special flexibilities for aluminum and marine exporters operating under specific quotas.

# 9. The 22-Year Shield: Protecting Domestic Industry

A bilateral safeguard mechanism allows India to slam tariffs back up to MFN levels if EU imports surge and threaten local industries. This safety net lasts for **22 years**—the longest transition period the EU has ever agreed to in any FTA.

# 10. Green Trade Without the Guilt Trip

The Trade and Sustainable Development chapter acknowledges **""common but differentiated responsibilities""** (read: India and EU don't need identical laws). It covers Paris Agreement implementation, gender equality in trade, combating illegal logging, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure—without subjecting violations to harsh dispute penalties.

# 11. IP Protection: No Changes to Indian Law Required

Despite fears of ""TRIPS-Plus"" demands, the deal **changes nothing in India's IP laws**. Compulsory licensing for public health remains fully protected, there's **no data exclusivity** obligation for pharmaceuticals, and plant variety protection aligns with existing Indian legislation—not the stricter UPOV convention.

# 12. Food Safety Framework (Without New Regulations)

For the first time in any Indian trade deal, there's a standalone **Sustainable Food Systems (SFS)** chapter. It's purely a cooperation platform on antimicrobial resistance and food safety—it creates **zero binding obligations** to change domestic food safety or agricultural laws.

# 13. The ""Red Phone"" for Trade Emergencies

A **Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM)** creates a three-tier hotline (technical → senior officials → ministers) to resolve implementation disputes within strict timelines before they kill trade flows. It's designed to fix problems fast, not just litigate them later.

# 14. The Deal That Evolves

The FTA has **indefinite duration** (no expiry date) but includes mandatory reviews every **5 years** to assess market access progress. Plus, it's explicitly subordinate to existing tax treaties and WTO rights—so India's current agreements remain untouched.

**Bottom Line:** India gets massive tariff elimination in its strongest export sectors, unprecedented services market access and mobility rights, while keeping ironclad protections on agriculture, IP flexibility, and a 22-year safeguard mechanism—the best of both worlds for a defensive liberalizer.",1,1769788767.0,Export_Import_IND,0,1.0,False

27 yo female in good physical health

Bipolar 1 diagnosis 2020 (mania free since 2024)

Medications as of December 2025 (lithium 1800 and abilify 15).  

EKG taken December 2025 in comments. 

—-

I am looking for context to what happened to me from medical professionals who understand the health care industry better than me. 

In December 2025, I returned from a three week backpacking trip across Asia to celebrate graduating my masters. 

Whilst I was in Pakistan, I developed a horrible cold that felt like it was turning into a chest infection. I called my doctor uncle in the the states who frequently traveled abroad as well. He advised me to go to the local pharmacy in Islamabad. There, the pharmacist sold me Azithromycin - something I had taken years before with no issue. Apparently, whilst I needed a prescription in America, I was able to buy it there and then for very cheap and without seeing a doctor.

I should note, I was also taking Zofran at the time for general nausea from traveling. I began the course of antibiotics and continued taking Zofran as needed as I traveled back home to the US. I made it home without incident.

On December 12th, I began having intermittent chest pain and other confusing symptoms. I had a panic attack once before in university, so I thought maybe it was that. But the chest pain came and went at random. For more context, I was diagnosed bipolar 1 in 2020 my junior year of college. I had achieved stability and remission through a combo of lithium and abilify, and had been episode free for about two years.

I mention this because the diagnosis made me hate going to the doctor. I was in therapy once a week since 2020, saw my psychiatrist regularly as well, and endured monthly blood tests to check my lithium level. I was sick of being dissected and prodded but went because I wanted stability.

Because of this, I delayed seeking medical attention even though the chest pain continued. On December 17th, I was at a coffee shop reading when my jaw began to buzz. My chest tightened, and I dropped the coffee mug on the floor. I barely heard it crash. My hearing was going in and out and I don’t really remember what happened next. It’s hard to explain. When I regained my faculties , everyone was looking at me weird. I rushed out and realized I needed to go the hospital - something was wrong.

I took an uber to a well known, well respected hospital in my large city.  There  i had another episode, though again I don’t really remember it. They initiated stroke protocol and I got a CT, blood tests, and an EKG.

I of course disclosed my bipolar diagnosis, and when all the tests seemingly came back normal, they discharged me with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. They told me anxiety caused the chest pain.

I didn’t question it. Why would I? I have a masters degree in creative writing for Pete’s sake - I’m not exactly a medical expert.

The next day I was taken to the hospital after my mother witnessed me having what looked like a seizure. I don’t remember.

There, they told me that my EKG taken the day before showed a QT of 690. (I have a copy  of my EKG from my portal). The internist said that’s dangerous - extremely dangerous. He said it could have been fatal. 

They discontinued all my meds and eventually it went down to the 400s. I’m grateful they saved my life but here’s my question. If the EKG showed this the day before, and it was marked critical (which it was) why did they send me home to potentially die?

I know i should move on with my life. They told me this was most definitely a combo of the antibiotic + Zofran + abilify. But I can’t help but feel like they saw my bipolar diagnosis and wrote me off as a crazy lady with anxiety. In the weeks after what happened, I am struggling to sleep, having nightmares and flashbacks, and feel kinda numb.

I am just struggling to make sense of what happened. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",1,1769788716.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1qr9awo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1qr9awo/breakup_because_of_his_dog/,Breakup because of his dog,"My boyfriend and I were together for 3 years. He got his dog (a dachshund) a week before we met. I’m not exactly a “dog person” — I have two cats — but I study veterinary medicine, so I love animals in general, and I grew up with dogs at my grandmother’s place, where I always had a very good relationship with them.  
  
However, my boyfriend’s dog is a different case. At the beginning of our relationship, the dog destroyed countless things of mine, including expensive prescription glasses. My boyfriend never took responsibility for any of the damage, and I had to replace everything myself. He doesn’t train the dog in any way — the dog is not leash-trained, and every walk makes me anxious that he might get hit by a car. He doesn’t know basic commands and is allowed to do absolutely anything.  
  
Since the beginning of our relationship, the dog has snapped at me several times. I asked my boyfriend to start training him and to deal with the situation. He went to training once, but never showed up again.  
  
2 weeks ago, the situation happened again. They had been staying at my place for a longer time, and yesterday I was taking laundry off the couch when the dog snapped at my hand. My boyfriend did nothing about it; just picked the dog up and tried to calmly reason with him in a soft voice, telling him he shouldn’t do that, and he wanted me to pet him. This made me even more upset..then he just promised he would contact the trainer and deal with it. I asked him that I did not want the dog to sleep with us in the bed that night (the dog has already snapped at me in bed several times). He told me I was overreacting because he didn’t cause me any injury and that I was being vengeful.  
  
He got offended and he stayed on the couch to sleep with the dog and during the night said that he would go home the next day.. The next morning, he didn’t even make me coffee. He refused to lie down next to me when the dog is not allowed on the bed, because the dog would whine. We argued again, broke up, and he went home. Its been 15 days of no contact between us.  
  
My question is: did I overreact? I am also asking this as a woman who felt unprotected and pushed into second place after a household pet. But is this a matter of incompatibility between us, or was I being too strict? I would also like to hear the opinion of dog owners, the perspective of the other side — whether they would have acted like he did, whether this is normal, or whether it’s just me seeing it differently.

I’ve lived in the Bridge City for about 8 years now. I’m a business owner, but since I work from home most of the time, the ""social"" side of my professional life has been pretty non-existent lately.

I’m the person behind SASKCATAN, and seeing how many people wanted a low-pressure way to hang out over a game was awesome. It got me thinking: why don’t we have something like that for the business community here?

I’m not talking about those formal networking events where you wear a suit and pay a $500 annual membership fee just to be sold to. I’m talking about a group of local owners, startups, and side-hustlers meeting up at a brewery in Riversdale or a cafe on Broadway to actually get to know each other.

The goal is to keep it affordable (just enough to cover coffee or snacks) and focused on building real local relationships. I want to use the network I’ve built over the last 8 years to help other people in the city connect and grow their ideas.

I’m in the ""figuring it out"" stage and would love to hear what you’d actually want to see in a group like this. If you’re building a business (or thinking about starting one) and want a social circle that gets the grind, please check out the form below.

About Us

* Married couple from the US, mid-30s

Arrival

* Landed at SJO on a Friday around 1pm. Passport control took exactly one hour from when we got in line.
* Met our driver right outside baggage claim.
* Drive to La Fortuna took just under 4 hours, including a lunch stop.

Food & Drinks

* Hot take: the food IS good. I’ve heard a lot of people say Costa Rican food is bland, but that was not our experience at all. Everything felt super fresh, and I already miss having a solid casado with a fresh fruit juice for lunch. I usually avoid ordering chicken when eating out, but chicken dishes here were consistently well seasoned and perfectly cooked.
* La Fortuna
   * Soda La Hormiga – I saw this recommended a few times but found this to be fine, but not a must-go for us. I enjoyed my husband’s casado more than my own dish.
   * Jalapas – Another that was highly recommended, but this was one of only two times in my entire life I’ve sent a dish back. That said, the view is great, especially at sunset.
* On the way to Monteverde
   * Cafe y Macadamia – I know this is controversial because it’s very popular, but we wished we’d stopped at another soda or a restaurant in town instead. Beautiful view, though.
* Monteverde
   * Stella’s – Great breakfast. We got the breakfast bagel and were genuinely impressed, especially the homemade bagel and how delicious the smoked trout was. I am very touch and go with smoked salmon in the US, so this was a pleasant surprise.
   * Soda Canton 83 (Family Business) – One of our favorite sodas of the entire trip. Ask for their homemade hot sauce! it’s amazing.
   * Jimenez Bakery & Coffee Shop – Great stop.
   * Taco Taco Monteverde – Another great option if you want something different.
   * Orchid Coffee & Restaurant and Restaurante Sabor Tico were recommended by other travelers and tour guides, but we didn’t make it there. Saved for next time.

Helpful Tips

* Tap water is safe to drink and tasted totally fine to me. I usually buy bottled water in bulk when traveling, but didn’t feel the need here.
   * When ordering water at restaurants, specify \*tap\* if that’s what you want—otherwise they’ll assume bottled.
* AMEX is accepted at most places.
* We didn't get an e-SIM; we have Verizon and just used that here. For the most part, we had no issues.
* Most places had us pay at the counter. If paying at the table, they bring the card machine to you (no taking your card away like in the US).
* Sales tax is 13%, which caught me off guard at first. Many restaurants also add an automatic 10% service charge.
   * Monteverde, a lot of places already include tax + service in the menu prices (check the fine print). In La Fortuna, this was less common.
* Driving: ***note*** \- we were VERY lucky and had great weather on all the days we were on the road
   * Having a driver from the airport on day one was very very helpful. It gave us time to observe local driving habits (one-lane bridges, different “rules,” etc.).
   * We picked up our rental car from National Car Rental in La Fortuna and had zero issues. Dropped off at SJO.
      * Even with the cost of the driver, we actually saved a few hundred dollars overall by picking up in La Fortuna.
   * Drive from SJO to La Fortuna: some parts were bumpy but it wasn't as bad as most people made it out to be. This drive took almost 4 hours.
   * Drive from La Fortuna to Monteverde: views were stunning! It really helped that we were able to observe our driver on the way to La Fortuna, so that made this drive pretty easy. A lot of people warned us about the twists and turns, but as long as you're being careful we didn't find it to be too bad. This drive took just under 3 hours.
   * Drive from Monteverde to SJO: views of the Nicoya Peninsula were beautiful. Drive wasn't bad at all. As you approach SJO, the roads are more paved and there are more lanes. This drive took just under 3 hours.

What We’d Do Differently

* I’d fly into Liberia next time. I honestly don’t know why I didn’t consider it.
* We stayed 3 nights in La Fortuna and really wish we had added one more.
* I wish I’d researched sloth tours and night walks more. Many felt very curated and crowded, with lots of tour groups and people shining flashlights at the animals.

I bought these Salomon XT-6 shoes in Black Coffee/French Roast a month ago, and as soon as I received them, I noticed a flaw: the black part on the toe of the shoe isn't positioned the same way on both shoes, and it looks a bit odd. I don't know if I'm just focusing too much on the details. Not to mention the glue marks around them, but that's not the worst thing.

I wanted to know if you've noticed this on your Salomon shoes too, even in a different color, or if it's a defect specific to my pair.

I should mention that I bought them from the Snipes website, so theoretically a reliable site.

It is the biggest and best dedicated comedy festival in Europe and has been running for more than 30 years now. This year they are bringing nearly 700 shows to the city and county, including a whole host of new and returning venues.

Running from 4 – 22 February 2026, tickets are now on sale for all of the events and you can pick up a copy of the brochure from around the city or [**find it on the Leicester Comedy Festival website**](https://www.comedy-festival.co.uk/festival-programme).

# The biggest names

The festival continues to bring some of the biggest names in comedy to the city and this year is no exception, with the likes of Maisie Adams, Ahir Shah, Sophie Duker, Sara Pascoe, Chris McCausland, Darren Harriott and Olga Koch. The LEGENDARY Stephen Fry will also be in conversation with festival founder Geoff Rowe at De Montfort Hall.

# More venues and locations

The festival takes over the city’s venues for three weeks, with all of your favourite venues being packed to the rafters with great value comedy shows, plus a range of surprising new and returning locations including Kayal, Hive & Honey, Old Newtonians RFC, the Great Central Railway and Cosby Village Hall!

This year their commitment to taking the festival out into Leicestershire is even more evident with two BIG weekends in Harborough and Blaby, along with shows in Lutterworth, Waltham on the Wolds, Foxton, Cosby, Melton Mowbray, Oadby and Queniborough.

# More fantastic events

Some of the Festival’s favourite shows will be returning, including the UK Pun Championships, which will be at De Montfort Hall on Monday 9 February, and of course the Leicester Comedian of the Year at The Y Theatre on 21 February. This title recognises the rising stars of comedy and has been won by the likes of Romesh Ranganathan, Rhod Gilbert and Jason Manford, with the runners up equally as notable, with the likes of Rosie Jones, Jimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Greg Davies and Andi Osho.

The comedy festival’s commitment to supporting new and emerging talent is demonstrated through the number of shows which showcase those just breaking into the scene, no matter their age, gender circumstance. These include Circuit Breakers for the very best new and emerging talent, Bringing the Gap for those from underrepresented groups in the comedy scene, and Silver Stand Up for those people coming to comedy later in life.

# Perfect for the whole family

The Festival also includes the UK Kids’ Comedy Festival, which runs alongside the main festival and is packed full of fantastic shows for a younger audience, with big names including Shelf, Olaf Falafel, Jody Kamali and Abi-Carter Simpson, plus opportunities for kids to try their hand at comedy with workshops, special events and the Laugh Academy. There’s also prizes and opportunities for the funniest school and loads more.

# All new for 2026

Whether you’re after stand-up, family-friendly shows, trails, quizzes, mixed bills, or variety acts, there’s something for everyone as part of The Big Weekends in Harborough and Blaby.

As well as returning hit shows at Harborough Market Hall or Lutterworth Town Hall, they will be visiting loads of new venues this year, including Fifty Eight, Everards Beer Hall, Leicestershire Aero Club and Cosby Village Hall.

# Harborough District Big Weekend: 11-15 February 2026

There are a range of different shows across the weekend. Fancy A Laugh? Well join Louise Neigh, Adam Beardsmore, Joey Page and Jack Campbell at The Octagonal Theatre.

And the Oadby Comedy Club welcomes a star line up, with Lindsay Santoro, Shazia Mirza, Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year Nina Gilligan and the Comedy Festival Best Show winner Alex Hylton!

# Blaby District: 17-22 February 2026

The fun continues in Blaby as you can grab a pint of Tiger before roaring with laughter at the Everards Beer Hall, who are also hosting a comedy quiz. The Bricklayers pub in Sharnford is hosting three events with a comedy twist, and Mill Hill Cask and Coffee brings their regular show Stevie Gray’s Flat Cap Comedy into the Comedy Festival fold!

1qr8pz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryStoryteller/comments/1qr8pz4/göring_snatches_defeat_from_the_jaws_of_victory/,Göring Snatches Defeat From the Jaws of Victory: Dunkirk and the Battle of Britian,"Where we last left the Allied forces in France, things were looking grim. A surprise assault from the Wehrmacht had trapped 400,000 of Britian and France's best troops in a pocket around the port of Dunkirk. All they had to do was squeeze, and both Britian and France would be out of the war. Everyone knew the stakes. 

Though their backs were to the wall, they were outnumbered two to one, and they had just been humiliated on a global stage, the men trapped in and around Dunkirk were the best equipped, best trained, and most experienced the Allies had to offer. They would be capable of putting up a last stand against anything the Germans could throw at them, and Hitler knew that. But equally, they would lose. The odds were too great. Hitler knew that. 

Unfortunately for the Nazis, Hitler had terrible advisors. Almost all of them were either yes-men, incompetent, arrogant, or in the case of Hermann Göring, Supreme Commander of the Airforce, all three. Göring convinced Hitler that instead of sacrificing German soldiers on the ground, he should instead stop the army's advance and bomb the Dunkirk pocket with the Luftwaffe (air force) until nothing but rubble remained. In response to this, Hitler issued the infamous Haltebefehl. The halt order.

Across France, panzers ground to a standstill, infantry made camp, and planes began to take off. The Luftwaffe was prepared to blast Dunkirk off the map... if not for the weather. Out of the nine day operation, only two and a half had good flying weather. The rest were shrouded in cloud and mist. This respite gave the mighty Royal Navy time to arrive, and begin ferrying boatload after boatload of soldiers to safety. Famously, British civilians all began to sail across the Channel to rescue their sons, their brothers, their fathers, and their countrymen. These ""little ships"" (as well as the rest of the Royal Navy) were able to rescue 338,226 out of the 400,000 trapped soldiers. Operation Dynamo, more famously known as Dunkirk, was a miraculous success, enabling Britian to fight another day.

Though Britian had escaped, France was done. Their soldiers had been the ones to fight a rearguard action at Dunkirk to allow the Brits to get away, and their country was now the one under occupation. But their sacrifice had given Hitler a thorn in his side that remained for the duration of the war, in the form of the largest empire the world had ever seen.

To Hitler's shock, the British refused to sue for peace. So now in order to secure their flank, the Third Reich would have to cross a massive moat known as the English Channel. Which also happened to be swarming with British warships. And the only way Germany could transport men across for an invasion was a bunch of unarmed barges that could easily be taken out by the Royal Air Force.

Göring, not learning from Dunkirk, again reassured the Führer that the Luftwaffe could handle it. A campaign of bombing could totally bring the British to heel, just like it did at Dunkirk. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, the RAF was the most modern airforce in the entire world. Rader, superior production rates, better planes, and home court advantage all conspired to make this battle an impossible task.

The British were the first to develop accurate rader technology, interspersed with listening posts, visual observers (a guy with binoculars who looked at the sky), and a system that integrated radar in with their fighter command, allowing near-instant responses to any reports of Nazi fighters.

Their other main advantage is one that has been common throughout history: the Germans were the away team. German pilots only had a few minutes of flight time at their disposal before they would need to turn back and refuel, while the Brits could just land and take off continuously. Additionally, British fixed defenses like anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons could help.

But the main advantage of fighting over the British Isles was in terms of losses. If an RAF pilot had to parachute out, he could touch down, sign some autographs, then get a cup of coffee and a new plane before taking off again. Meanwhile, any German plane that couldn't make it back to France for any reason meant the sure loss of the pilot. And in air warfare, especially in the 1940s, experience and skill were everything. 

The upshot of all of this is that in October 1940, 4 months after Dunkirk, the Nazis gave up. Britian can have their stupid island, they never wanted it anyway. And as a new target, Hitler inadvertently ensured the downfall of his empire. Operation Barbarossa would topple a totalitarian regime, but not the one the Nazis were expecting.",3,1769787311.0,HistoryStoryteller,1,1.0,False

I started as a mobile pancake cart in 2023. At the time, we were the only one in our city doing this.

At our second event, we met another couple who owned multiple carts (cotton candy and popcorn) and later developed a coffee cart. They had been in the catering business for about three years. We kept in touch and asked them a few questions since we were new to the business. They were friendly, helpful, and supportive.

Eventually, they opened their own croffle dessert shop in February. We congratulated them, attended their opening, and went by their shop a few times over the summer (about 3-4 times). Later on, we had the opportunity to open our own dessert shop in our city, which is about 40 minutes away from theirs.

During that time, one of the owners had offered me a special training opportunity (around 10 hours related to business). Once I mentioned we were opening a store, she stopped the process since it would now be considered direct competition which I understood at the time. I’m mentioning this only for context. After that, our relationship naturally faded. We no longer really interacted and didn’t engage on social media anymore.

Recently, we started getting many customer requests for croffles. Since our customers matter a lot to us, we decided to test croffles for a limited time, simply to respond to demand. Croffles are also not widely available in our region, including our city. Before moving forward, we wanted to be transparent and respectful, so we informed them of our intention.

At this point, I’d appreciate your thoughts.

**The Problem**

I downloaded a 5GB `error.log` file to debug it. I tried opening it in VS Code -> Frozen UI. I tried Notepad++ -> ""File too big"".
I realized most editors try to load the *entire* file into RAM, which kills the machine.


**The Solution (MVP)**

I built **Log Voyager**
 – a web-based tool that uses the HTML5 `File.slice()` API. It reads the file in tiny chunks (50KB) directly from the disk.
Result? You can open a **50GB log file** instantly on a low-end laptop, and it consumes almost zero RAM. Plus, since it's client-side only, the data never leaves the device (Privacy First).



**Validation**

I posted the MVP on Reddit and Hacker News. The response was great:
* 🚀 **80+ GitHub Stars** in a few days.
* Hundreds of daily visitors.
* Lots of feedback requesting features like Regex search and JSON formatting.

**The Pivot to SaaS**

Initially, it was just a free tool. But seeing the traction, I decided to experiment with monetization to support further development (and maybe pay for some coffee ☕).

I didn't want to ruin the free version, so I went with an **Open Core / Supporter model**:

1.  **Free Version:** Still does everything (opens huge files, filters, works offline). No limits.
2.  **Pro Version ($5/mo):** A ""Supporter Edition"" that unlocks quality-of-life features (like persistent settings/bookmarks) and supports the project.

Prep: 20 mins  |  Cook: 2.5–4 hours  |  Serves 6–8

**The Meat**

• ¾ lb ground beef (80/20 or chuck)

• ¼ lb ground pork

• ¼ lb ground veal (optional—adds silkiness)

• 2 oz pancetta or guanciale, finely diced

Note: If keeping it simple, 50/50 beef/pork works—just add a few strips of minced bacon.

**The Soffritto**

• 1 onion

• 1 large carrot

• 1 celery stalk

• 2 cloves garlic, minced

• 1 tbsp fish sauce (trust me—it disappears)

Pro-tip for kids: Blitz vegetables in a food processor until almost a paste. They'll melt into the sauce invisibly.

**The Liquids**

• ¾ cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc)

• ½ cup whole milk (or heavy cream for richness)

• 1 cup quality beef or veal stock

• ½ oz dried porcini, rehydrated in 1 cup warm water (reserve liquid, strain through coffee filter)

• 28 oz can San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand

**Aromatics & Finish**

• 2 tbsp tomato paste

• Pinch of nutmeg (the secret weapon)

• Salt and black pepper

• 2 tbsp cold butter

• ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

———————————————

**The Execution**

1. Render the Pancetta

Cold pan, medium heat. Let the fat render slowly for 4–5 minutes until pieces are golden and crispy. Remove crispy bits (save for garnish), leave the fat in the pan.

2. Brown the Meat in Batches

Don't crowd the pan. Add half the ground meat, spread flat, and leave it alone for 2 minutes to develop fond. Then break and stir. You want actual browning, not gray steamed meat. Remove, repeat with second batch.

3. Sweat the Soffritto

Add 1 tbsp butter to rendered fat. Add blitzed vegetables, salt immediately. Cook 8–10 minutes until jammy. Add garlic, stir 30 seconds. Add tomato paste, cook 3 minutes until it darkens and sticks slightly.

4. The Triple Reduction (The Heart of It)

• Add wine. Reduce until the pan is nearly dry.

• Return meat. Add milk. Simmer gently until nearly dry again (10–15 mins).

• Add strained porcini liquid. Reduce by half.

Each reduction concentrates flavor and builds layers. Don't rush this.

5. The Long Simmer

Add tomatoes, stock, minced rehydrated porcini, and a pinch of nutmeg. Bring to a bare simmer—lazy, occasional bubbles. Minimum 2.5 hours. Ideal is 3.5–4 hours. Stir occasionally; add splashes of water or stock if it tightens. The sauce should reduce to a thick, glossy, meat-forward ragù.

6. The Finish

• Off heat: stir in 2 tbsp cold butter

• Stir in ½ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano

• Fresh cracked black pepper

• Optional: 2 tbsp heavy cream for extra silkiness

Taste and adjust salt. Serve over tagliatelle, pappardelle, or rigatoni.

Emily Abbott fell off the radar after she popped hot for PEDs and it looks like she’s never really recovered from that. I googled her name and it took me to an Instagram account where she promotes all things erotic breastfeeding, honoring god by “gushing,” conscious cocks, and her business of giving other women orgasms. It was truly shocking to me. No shaming here- if that’s truly what makes someone happy is posting on Instagram about group sex right next to a post about your kids, then who am I to judge.

We were able to get them, along with a bunch of other snacks, but what we really needed was more water. We ended up getting less snow than originally called for, but we got more ice, which resulted in our daycare being closed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The first few days were fine, if a bit stressful trying to manage both kids stuck at home, but on Wednesday morning, I woke up with the baby at 4am to find out that we had no running water. We assumed our pipes were frozen, but couldn't figure out where. The water company came and told us it must be in the house because the meter was still running. On Thursday, we were able to get a plumber out and it turned out our pipes were not frozen, but completely clogged with sediment. Apparently, there had been a break somewhere else in the city and tons of mud and rocks got into the water line. We had to have the whole house flushed and all of our faucet aerators replaced.

During our ~36 hours without water, I realized just how ill prepared we were for a water emergency. I thought we were fine because we had a case of water bottles, plus several gallon jugs. But we really, REALLY underestimated just how much water we use all day to wash our hands, wash dishes, flush toilets, etc. My husband was able to go out and buy more water and we went to a friend's house that evening so everyone could bathe and refill our water jugs, but this is an area we're really going to need to shore up for the future. I am glad we had filled up all of our water appliances (coffee maker, baby bottle dishwasher, humidifiers) the night before, but we clearly need to do a lot more water prep.",89,1769786515.0,TwoXPreppers,21,0.99,False

Josiah) someone brought up the NPC Jesse (who is an obvious stand-in for Jesus) and his rants/preaching at the pier. Since I grew up in the church and have a decent knowledge of the biblical life of Jesus (although I have since deconstructed and consider myself an atheist) I thought it might be helpful to write out every line of dialogue I heard from Jesse and link it to the Bible stories or parables he may be referencing.

While most of this may not directly tie to Mount Chiliad, I hope it can serve as a mini “database” or reference sheet for anyone exploring religious symbolism in the game, especially given the many already-present nods in places like the Altruist Camp.

*Before I start, I want to highlight that the name Jesse is significant in the Bible, as he was the father of King David, whose line is crucial to the lineage of Jesus - fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would come from David’s family.*

# QUOTE 1

>*(Franklin) Hey, what’s up, homie.*

>*(Jesse) Wassup homie? It’s all good.*

>*(Jesse) My dad’s really happy with me. He loves you too.*

Possible reference to Jesus’ baptism when God spoke to him saying “You are my Son, whom I love; I am well pleased with you.” - Luke 3:22 (also Mark 1:11 & Matthew 3:17)

>*(Franklin) Your dad loves me?*

>*(Jesse) Ah, he loves everybody.*

>*(Franklin) That’s cool.*

>*(Jesse)* *Yo, like even when they catch his wave, or when he gets cut in line at the amusement park, or even when he orders a chai latte and somebody steals it and then the man’s like, “Who in God’s name ordered a chai latte?”*

“Do not repay anyone evil for evil… If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink… Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” (Romans 12:17-21)

“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.” (Luke 6:27-28)

>*(Franklin) Aw shit, he sounds like a cool dude.*

>*(Jesse) I mean, he used to be a little bit nasty, but then I came around and he dropped that.*

Most likely a reference to the god of the Old Testament (before the birth of Jesus) being much more judgmental and harsh than he was/is in the New Testament (after the birth and crucifixion of Jesus and the “new covenant”)

>*(Franklin) Man, I never really knew my dad.*

>*(Jesse) Yeah, he’s kind of distant though… I mean, he travels a lot. It’s kind of crazy but, I still love him, even though all my friends say I shouldn’t because of what he did to me.*

Probably just commentating on how god seems more absent in modern times, and that Jesus should be upset that his father sent him to earth to be killed.

>*(Franklin) Alright, man, Look, I’ve got to get back to normality.*

>*(Jesse) Yo, it’s cool homie, be cool.*

# QUOTE 2

>*“So, like, the alternative to life, man… is death.*

>*And the interesting thing is that, well, life is cool, but so is death, man.*

>*I mean life is like a crazy mind fuck, and then death, well, I mean, that’s like a crazy mind fuck too, man. It’s outrageous.*

>*Praise! Oh man, it’s so rad.”*

This could simply be a reference to Jesus living and dying as a human since he would know what lies beyond. But there's a possibly it could be a reference to Paul’s letter to the Philippians in the New Testament: “Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; … yet having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.” (Philippians 1:20-23)

# QUOTE 3

>*“So, man, I mean I was sent here to clear things up . . .* 

“For this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.” (John 18:37)

>*. . . and it’s not that people don’t understand, it’s just that people don’t understand.*

“Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.” (Matthew 13:13-14)

>*I mean, like, hey, you know, you gotta do the right things. Not the lame things.*

>*It’s like when you get 10 coffees, okay? And then you get the stickers that say you get a totally free one, man, I mean that’s outrageous!*

>*Ugh!”*

“But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” (Matthew 6:33) Essentially Jesus is saying that if you follow god’s words and do what is right - you will be rewarded.

# QUOTE 4

>*“Here’s something interesting - try not to be such a buzz kill.*

>*For example, when your mom calls and she really ruins the buzz and you’re all up there on the high astral plane, with the big guy himself, and she’s like, “Do your washing” and you’re like, “But how come we live with a guy that’s not even my dad?” and she’s like, “You’re special,” and I’m like, “Cool.”*

Most likely referencing Luke 2:42-49 when Jesus, Mary (his mother) and Joseph (his “father”) went to the Passover in Jerusalem when he was a 12 year old boy. Mary and Joseph returned home and realized Jesus was not with him, and when they returned to the temple three days later he was still there teaching the religious leaders. When Mary calls out to him to return with them, he responds by saying that he is doing his father’s business (referring to his father being god and not Joseph.)

# QUOTE 5

>*“Have you ever wondered who I am?*

>*I’m not, I mean, I’m somebody that’s, like, something that’s really far out there.*

>*I mean, it’s like when you watch sports and they pour the orange drink all over the old guy when the team wins.*

>*I mean, that’s what I’m a fan of, only, only it’s a little bit different.”*

If I’m being honest - this one really has me stumped. My best guess is that it echoes the New Testament tension around Jesus’ identity. He invites people to question who he is (Matthew 16:13-15), refuses simple definitions, and reframes “victory” not as worldly celebration but as a deeper, symbolic triumph meant to represent and benefit everyone.

# QUOTE 6

>*“So, like, yeah, the really important thing is to make sure everything’s clear. That’s what my dad says.* 

>*Make it clear, I mean it’s me, him and this other guy who no one really understands, because he like doesn’t speak or do anything, and I’m, like, we’re all supposed to be equal, the three of us, and I’m like, “Dad, that’s not fair.” and he’s like, “I don’t make the rules,” and I’m like, “Yes, you do.”*

This one is just a comedic riff on the Trinity: Jesse lays out the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct yet equal, highlighting the confusing tension between shared authority and submission, just like the New Testament presents in Matthew 28:19, John 14–16, and Philippians 2.

***As an interesting side note: could the “smoke phantoms” be a reference to the Holy Spirit?***

# QUOTE 7

>*“Hey, hey, man, you know, things are always really cool, but like, sometimes they’re not really cool and you wanna get really mad, man.*

>*But hey man, don’t get mad, and don’t get even. Get mellow, man. Because that’s, like, a longer way of getting even, man.* 

>*And it’s just not cool when people are not cool, and then you gotta be like, “Hey bro, man, that’s not cool.”*

>*And that’s just the way things are man, you know? That’s just the way they are.”*

Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse… Repay no one evil for evil… If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. Therefore “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (Romans 12:14-21)

***I may be over-thinking, but this one has me wondering if we have to play the story mode through in the most “righteous” way and the least amount of death like some people have suggested in the past?***

# QUOTE 8

>*“So there’s this guy and he’s walking right, and I’m like, “That’s really weird, who the hell walks?”*

>*And it’s like, he gets hurt, and all these people are like, “Whoa, I’m late for my enema.” and I’m like, “That’s such a bummer,” Anyways…*

>*This guy stops and helps him, even though he doesn’t have health insurance, and I’m like, “That’s so cool, man.”*

This is a modern retelling of the parable of the Good Samaritan: someone is hurt, others ignore him for mundane reasons, one selfless person intervenes despite personal cost, and moral admiration is the natural response. (Luke 10:25-37)

Something worth pointing out in this story is that 3 separate people walk by the dying man on the road. Two of them are upstanding and highly regarded people and one of them was a Samaritan (considered religiously “impure” and socially ostracized.) The Samaritan is the one who helped the man - even paying for his medical bills. Jesus then says “So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?” And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”

***Interesting parallel considering we have 3 playable characters and the Samaritan sounds a lot like Trevor?***

# QUOTE 9

>*“So, yeah, there’s this kid I know, yeah, he’s really upset because of his brother - I mean, his brother goes to school out of state, or something, and he never comes back home for the holidays - always wasting his dad’s money on parties and keg stands and stuff.*

>*Anyways, he comes back home and his dad lets him drive his new car, but not my friend, and my friend’s like, “Lame.” And the dad’s like, “Not lame.” and that’s just the way it is, man.”*

This is a modern retelling of the Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32): the younger brother wastes his father’s resources and parties elsewhere, while the older brother stays home and serves faithfully, yet feels jealous when the prodigal is unexpectedly rewarded. Jesse’s “that’s just the way it is” reflects the New Testament teaching that God’s generosity and mercy aren’t bound by human notions of fairness (Romans 9:14–16.)

# QUOTE 10

>*“Can you imagine… I mean can you just imagine what it would be like if everyone was just cool and all the lame people were just not lame?*

>*I mean, but even if they were I’d be like, “Hey, it’s cool, you’re lame, I’m cool with that.”*

>*I’m just here to try to say not to be lame, but even if you are, it’s all good.”*

Not sure if this is referring to anything specifically as it sounds like a broad take on New Testament moral teaching: Jesse urges people to strive for goodness and avoid wrongdoing, but also extends grace and acceptance to those who fall short. It mirrors Jesus’ call to love others unconditionally while encouraging righteousness (Matthew 5:48; Matthew 9:10–13; John 13:34–35.)

# QUOTE 11

>*“Like, I used to be a mad sick skater and biker and stuff and then, check this out, I kind of grew up a bit, and I’m not any more and that’s just how it is, I put away the stuff when I was a kid.*  
*Well now I’m not so much. Apart from action figures, because they’re still cool. And that’s cool.”*

1 Corinthians 13:11 - “When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.”

It seems Jesse is delivering a humorous modern version of Paul’s teachings on spiritual growth and discernment: leave behind reckless or childish behaviors, but hold onto what is good, wholesome, and worth keeping. (1 Corinthians 13:11; Philippians 4:8)

# QUOTE 12

>*“Like, I spoke to my dad and he used to be a real mean guy, I mean, like, he used to be a dick, especially to Jews.*

>*It’s not that he doesn’t like Jews, I mean he loves Jews.*

>*I mean, he might have even been Jewish himself.*

>*And then, I came along and everything was cool. I mean, that’s what I really love about him.*

>*I mean, hes got this really rad beard like an old hipster dude, man.”*

I would assume this is a commentary on the apparent contradictory nature of god. In the Old Testament, god’s wrath is terrifyingly clear in Exodus 32:9-10, where he threatens to wipe out Israel for their rebellion. Yet just a few verses later, Exodus 34:6-7 paints him as merciful and gracious, leaving us to wonder how judgment and love can coexist without contradiction.

The New Testament resolves (or at least reframes) this tension with Jesus, as 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 shows God reconciling the world to himself through Christ, offering forgiveness and restoration. Taken together, the Bible presents a divine character that swings from fearsome wrath to boundless mercy.

# QUOTE 13

>*“So, like, you know when you want to get baked and you’re all stressed because you don’t have anything to smoke?*

>*Well don’t get stressed about that crap, man, life is too short and if you want to get baked, do so, but not too much.”*

Not sure what this one is referencing. My only guess would be Matthew 6:25 & 34 - “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?” “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”

# QUOTE 14

>*“I love chill people.*

>*I mean, I love people that aren’t very confident about themselves.*

>*You know, people that do really interesting stuff, not to be a dick, but because it's cool, man.*

Matthew 6:1-4 - “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them… your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”

>*I mean, I really don’t like people that do stuff to call themselves really cool all the time like posers and people who show off about yoga.”*

Jesse is celebrating authentic humility and intrinsic goodness while mocking superficial posturing. In New Testament terms, he’s promoting doing good for its own sake, not for applause or ego, which aligns with Jesus’ repeated warnings against pride and performative piety such as the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector in Luke 18:9-14.

# QUOTE 15

>*“Hey bros, what’s up? I mean, who is it hanging?*

>*Aw, I don’t mean that, I mean, how is it hanging, man?*

>*Oh, bless you all, Bless you.*

>*Oh, I’d love a latte…*

>*Oh, maybe I’ll make some out of water or something. Or some sushi, or some herby focaccia. Oh man, it’s totally rad, man.*

>*It’s totally, rad.”*

These are clearly referencing the miracles of Jesus. Turning “water into a latte” is in  reference to his first recorded miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding feast (John 2:1-11.) 

His reference to “sushi” (fish) and “focaccia” (bread) is in reference to Jesus’s miracle of feeding a crowd of 5000 people with only five loves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:13-21.)

# QUOTE 16

>*“So, like, man, I know it’s rough out there, man, but you gotta have faith, man. Alright?*

>*It’s - everything’s gonna be okay. Like the therapist above says, man, it’s gonna be okay. Alright, and you gotta chill the hell out, man, alright?*

>*Otherwise it’s not gonna be too good,*

>*You gotta enjoy life. Alright?*

>*Because the alternative, is not so good, Not so good, man.”*

I think this one is just a summary of what we’ve already talked about in regards to faith, peace, and enjoying life, urging trust in God and calm in the face of stress (Matthew 6:25–34; Philippians 4:6–7) as well as life’s brevity and the stakes of mortality, echoing the New Testament call to live fully and wisely (James 4:14; John 10:10).

I take this as she's not interested in me at all. I was curious if I'm most likely right? I was asking so I know if I should lose any interest in this person and move on.

hi all! I think this is more for catharsis than anything because it's been SIX YEARS and i only feel incrementally better. TLDR is that I had a best friend throughout college- we met each other at school, became closer when we started studying the same major, and eventually became best friends as some of our other friends were shifting away. we ended up living together our last year in college. this is someone i shared a lot of commonalities with- our interests, hobbies, school, friend groups, etc. slowly our lives started to overlap too much and i couldn't go anywhere without feeling suffocated- they were at my favorite coffee shop, my spot in the library, hanging out with my high school friends, etc. we also worked at the same job on campus and had mostly the same class schedule. i loved them but i needed some independence- talked to them a few times about it in person and it always went poorly/awkwardly. they started to become really sour and mean to me, especially around our roommates and mutual friends. i was always the butt of the joke. (TLDR - the living situation was horrible. we were living with their mutual friends and they were irresponsible and inconsiderate, did not take care of their pets, and basically made my life a living hell my last year in school lmao). we already weren't really speaking that much into Spring semester when Covid hit and shut everything down. i went and stayed with my parents, then quietly moved out and blocked them on every social imaginable. 

I spent the next couple years so so angry and hurt- I still can't understand why they were so cruel to me after so many good years together. why was i the punching bag? was i wrong for wanting boundaries and a little space? I still feel horribly guilty because they lost someone really close to them that year we were living together and I couldn't even be there for them. it's been so difficult for me to open up to other people after that because i still don't know what happened for them to start treating me so horribly with no explanation. 

six years later and i think im finally past the insurmountable rage part of grieving the friendship and now I'm just sad/nostalgic again. I followed them briefly on a social media site just to check in and to see if they'd reach out- over a 7 month period, nothing. they'd like posts and what not, but nothing. I know I'm also accountable for that but still 😅it felt wrong seeing what their interests are now, their hobbies, their concerts and new pets, and honestly it was triggering to see the name constantly pop up in my feeds. I can't completely avoid it because we still have overlapping close friends (which is the most addling and insanity inducing thing ever - crashed out when i saw wedding pics a few years ago). I have ZERO interest in having a relationship now because i want to focus on meeting new people and there's too much bad blood there. I was hurt too badly without cause. and I know now that i did not deserve to be treated so poorly. but I can't stop thinking about how it ended- if I hadn't blocked them in everything, would they have reached out? Has too much time passed now? Am I the only one still obsessing about this or do they still think of me sometimes? I can't help wondering what their day to day looks like now, if they're happy, if they're doing what they love. I think I genuinely want them to be happy but far far away from me lmfao. 

sometimes i think about drafting up an olive branch text just for closure, but it also feels like fucking up someone's day for no reason lol. and besides- if we talked and I found out they had absolutely no remorse or guilt about how they treated me, i think it would be like experiencing the abuse all over again. during that time a lot of our mutual friends were not very supportive of me expressing hurt over how i was being treated and i felt very gaslit. 

so I guess my question is- how do I move on? I'm trying to make new friends but it's a slow process. I've journaled, and meditated. and raged it out. I've cried. i've angry vented to close friends. i've unfollowed on everything that I have to remove reminders. but it's still there at the back of my brain. is it stupid to want closure this badly this many years later? I've had other close friendships dissolve (somewhat amicably), fade, or sometimes break off after a fight, but NOTHING bothers me as much as this does. I can't stop thinking about going from thick as thieves and basically siblings from how attached we were to nothing. am I a shitty person lol

It is the conscious act of returning to your center, training your mind to find peace amidst chaos, and nurturing a resilient inner sanctuary. By integrating meditation into your life, you unlock a direct pathway to mental clarity, emotional balance, and a deep-seated sense of calm that enriches every facet of your existence. This practice is not an escape from life, but a way to engage with it more fully, clearly, and peacefully.

Here are 10 strategies to effectively use meditation for your well-being:



1. Start with Consistency, Not Duration. Commit to five minutes daily rather than one long, irregular session.

2. Anchor to a Daily Habit. Pair your practice with an existing routine, like after your morning coffee.

3. Focus on the Breath. Use the simple rhythm of inhalation and exhalation as your primary point of focus.

4. Designate a Sacred Space. Create a small, dedicated area that signals to your brain it’s time to settle.

5. Utilize Guided Meditations. Leverage audio resources for structured sessions, especially when starting.

6. Practice Non-Judgmental Awareness. Observe wandering thoughts without criticism and gently return your focus.

7. Incorporate Body Scans. Systematically bring attention to different parts of the body to release tension.

8. Set a Gentle Intention. Begin each session with a positive word or phrase, like ""peace"" or ""clarity.""

9. Experiment with Different Forms. Explore mindfulness, loving-kindness, or visualization to see what resonates.

10. Carry the Calm Forward. Consciously take a few mindful breaths during stressful moments throughout your day.



When approached with gentle commitment, meditation becomes a reliable anchor. Its benefits compound quietly, building a reservoir of inner strength you can draw from at any time. This practice teaches you that well-being is not a distant destination to be reached, but a quality of awareness to be nurtured in the present moment. You are not trying to empty your mind, but to become the calm, observant space within which all thoughts and feelings can arise and pass. Begin where you are, use what you have, and allow this powerful practice to reveal the steady well-being that has always been within you.

I recently got interested in tea after watching *The Mentalist* — the protagonist is shown as a tea lover, and that somehow rubbed off on me.  I was actually trying to get into coffee before this, but the bitterness always held me back, which pushed me to explore tea instead.

I started simple with Tata Gold (local and easily available). Really enjoyed the whole routine of making tea and sipping it in the evenings. While exploring more, I searched for Indian tea communities and found this sub. I’ve been lurking for a few days and finally decided to post.

I wanted to try something beyond supermarket tea, so I ordered Masala Chai and a sampler pack from **Golden Tips**. The order was shipped the same day and reached me in a couple of days. They also included a complimentary first flush tea sample and a keychain, which was a nice touch. Overall, a very pleasant first experience with them.

I usually prefer my tea without milk, so I tried the Masala Chai black:

* Boiled water
* Added \~2g of tea
* Simmered on low flame for a couple of minutes
* Strained and added honey for sweetness

The aroma and taste felt much fresher compared to most local teas I’ve tried before, which often have a slightly plasticky smell.

Now I’m curious to explore more and would love some guidance from the community:

1. What **brewing methods** should I try for black tea / Indian loose-leaf teas?
2. Any **sweetener alternatives** you’d recommend apart from sugar and honey?

I’m a lightweight but still a fairly normal kind. Earlier this month I took a vacation and had a day where I had a little too much (like you do, I’m only human). Everything was bog standard hangover-wise; headache, puking, etc., but as usual, it passed. Then, a day or two later into the trip I started having these nervous feelings for seemingly no reason. Like my skin was crawling or like I was excited or had coffee jitters but there was nothing particularly exciting (no chest pain though, I should note. No pain at all really, just intense nerves.) I chalked it up on the trip to overdoing it despite that never happening before, and my mom chalked it up to being nervous because the one year anniversary of my father’s death is coming up in February.

We get home, and I feel normal. I take a week’s long break from drinking and intend to spend the rest of the month having a Damp January and possibly continue that into a Damp Life for the rest of the year. (I’m pushing 30 and I need to take it easy, that trip was humbling) I go to my local brewery one Friday. Normal. Then, on my dad’s would-have-been 71st birthday, I drink a tall can of Mic Ultra as a little toast in his honor. Some of the lightest shit you can drink. Then, around midnight, I get a random shock to my system. Again, no pain, but a feeling similar to a panic attack or remembering something stressful that’s happening the next day. I have no hangover symptoms but the anxious feeling lingers while I’m at work. It subsides eventually but comes and goes in waves. Later that night I watch a funny video and for the first time literally laugh until I cry. Like, ACTUALLY cry. Surprisingly, it helped the nervousness subside a lot. I experienced something similar during the trip where I had to lay down in the hotel room after one of these spells and found myself laughing at Bob’s Burgers way harder than usual.

My question is what could possibly be causing this? The alcohol or some reaction to deep-seeded grief that’s about to come out on my father’s death anniversary? Is my pushing-30 body simply starting to give out on me? I really have to emphasize that this doesn’t seem like hangxiety in the true sense. It happens literally 1-3 hours later on the same night/day. I can’t find anyone else who experiences this. It’s also only been light beer - SINGLE light beers. I haven’t had liquor since the vacation. Just last night I felt it a little after having had one beer with a meal and switching to soda once I got to the movies, only for the feeling to come out a little during the movie and go away by the end. And again, no hangover symptoms. Is this maybe all in my head? I wonder if I’m just making it worse by asking reddit…

EDIT: I should also note that I used to take zoloft and have been off of my 25 mg dose for about 2 and a half months now if memory serves. I wonder if it’s a factor but I doubt it since it was months ago that I stopped and the dosage was so low (to the point where my prescriber even told me I could just stop if I wanted, no weaning required)",1,1769785941.0,hangxiety,2,1.0,False

About 40 days ago, I was allowed to post here asking for your [worst workplace horror stories ](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1pvormz/help_me_design_the_most_soulcrushing_hr_cards_for/)to help build the ""HR Hivemind"" in my game *I.T. Never Ends*.

I honestly thought I had seen it all after 10 years in corporate. I was wrong. The stories you guys shared were darker, funnier, and more depressing than anything I could have written myself.

I wanted to come back and say thank you, because this community essentially co-authored the misery in this game.

**1. The ""Community Contributions""**   
Because of the ideas in that thread, the game now features:

* **Mandatory Plant Wellness:** To the user *chomoftheoutback* who shared the story about a manager forcing staff to ""speak lovingly"" to a plant to improve morale... It's coming in the full game, as a full story arc.
* **The ""Synergy"" Cards:** I added about 20 new cards based on the specific corporate doublespeak you guys posted.

**2. The Success (and Irony)**   
Because of the attention from this sub (and others), the game hit over **10,000 plays** on the web demo and more than **6000 wishlists** in its first month on steam. This visibility led to me getting invited for coffee with actual successful game studios, including **Funday Games** (the makers of *Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor*). The irony is not lost on me: making a game about how much I hate corporate networking has forced me to do corporate networking. (Though to be fair, the Funday guys are indie devs in my city and were incredibly nice/helpful, so they are one of the ""good ones"" and its been reaaaaally meeting them).

**The Update**   
I have just released the live demo on Steam yesterday. It features new voice acting (from actors I found on Reddit) and a soundtrack designed to induce mild workplace anxiety.

If you want to experience the horror of a hostile work environment without the actual risk of starvation, the demo is free.

**Title:** I found something that actually helped my memory – “The Brain Song” 🧠🎵  

Hey everyone,  
I don’t usually post about stuff like this, but lately I’ve been deep-diving into memory training because I was getting *seriously* frustrated with how forgetful I’ve become. Names, tasks, even where I put my coffee cup – it was getting ridiculous.  

Anyway, a friend sent me something called **“The Brain Song”** and at first I rolled my eyes. I mean, how can a *song* improve memory, right? But curiosity got me, and wow… it’s surprisingly effective. The rhythm and repetition seem to engage that part of your brain that locks things in — like how you never forget song lyrics from years ago.  

Here’s the link if you’re curious: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

After a week of listening and pairing it with short daily recall exercises, I noticed small but *crazy* changes. I remembered my grocery list without writing it down. I remembered to reply to emails on time (finally). It’s like my brain just… turned the lights back on.  

I’m not saying it’s some magic solution, but if you’ve struggled to stay mentally sharp or want to boost your focus in a unique way, it’s 100% worth a try. There’s something deeply personal about discovering tools that reconnect you with yourself — especially when they come from such a simple idea like sound and memory working together.  

Check it out and let me know what you think: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song). I’d love to know if anyone else feels the same changes I did.  

And if you’re reading this wondering whether it’s just hype — honestly, that’s what I thought too. But take five minutes, put on your headphones, and give “The Brain Song” a shot. Worst case, you discover a new catchy tune. Best case, you literally unlock sharper focus and better retention.  

👉 Last plug, because I genuinely think it’s worth your time: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song) — go give it a listen and tell me if it doesn’t get stuck in your head (and maybe boost your brain while it’s at it!).

*Opens Messaging*

Good morning Gemini!

Let's say that we have a day that we have 9 hours worth of work to get done, but I'm under a doctor's order to only do 5 hours of work per day. 

Got any great ideas of how to multitask with a broken brain that has both a TBI and multiple sclerosis?

Good morning! I'm sorry to hear you're juggling a TBI and MS while trying to manage a workload that clearly didn't get the memo about your doctor’s orders. Dealing with ""brain fog"" or cognitive fatigue isn't just about being tired; it's about your internal processor running at 20% capacity while the world demands 100%.

Since we have **9 hours of work** and only **5 hours of ""brain-fuel,""** we have to stop thinking about multitasking (which is actually just ""rapid task-switching"" that drains the battery faster) and start thinking about **energy economy**.

Here is a strategy to help you navigate the day without crashing:

---

### 1. The ""Red Light, Green Light"" Priority Scale
When your brain has limited bandwidth, not all tasks are created equal. Divide your 9-hour list into three categories:
* **High Octane (The Heavy Lifting):** Tasks requiring deep focus or complex problem-solving.
* **Low Glow (Maintenance):** Easy emails, filing, or checking boxes.
* **Delete/Defer:** Things that won't end the world if they wait until tomorrow.

### 2. Aggressive Monotasking (The Anti-Multitask)
Multitasking is actually the enemy of a brain healing from a TBI or managing MS. It causes ""cognitive friction."" 
* **The Rule:** One tab, one task, one screen. 
* **The Method:** Use a timer (like the Pomodoro technique) but shorten it. Try **15 minutes of work followed by a 10-minute ""dark rest""** (eyes closed, no phone). This prevents the ""overheat"" that leads to a total shutdown.

### 3. Externalize Your Memory
Don't use your brain to *hold* information; use it only to *process* it.
* **Voice-to-Text:** If typing is taxing, dictate your emails or notes.
* **The ""Parking Lot"" Note:** Keep one notepad next to you. If a random thought pops up, write it down and immediately return to your single task. Don't chase the rabbit.

### 4. Optimize Your Environment
* **Cooling:** Since MS can be sensitive to heat (which slows neural signaling), stay physically cool while working.
* **Visual Diet:** Reduce the brightness on your screen and use ""Dark Mode"" to minimize eye strain and sensory overload.

---

### The Reality Check
If you have 9 hours of work and a 5-hour hard limit, **4 hours of work will not get done today.** > **Pro Tip:** Instead of trying to squeeze 9 hours into 5, pick the **three most impactful tasks**. If you finish those, you've won the day. The rest is just noise.

**Would you like me to help you draft a quick message to a supervisor or client explaining that you're prioritizing your workload today due to medical constraints?**

(Now, of course, I said yes, as the last thing any complex spoon he needs is another letter to write or email to draft or phone call to make. Gemini actually gave me three different letters drafted depending on the type of work environment I had. I chose the most ""business professional one"".

Sample Letter: 
Hi [Name],
> 
> I’m writing to let you know that I am currently on a medically directed schedule that limits my active work time to 5 hours per day. 
> 
> To stay within these parameters while remaining effective, I am prioritizing [Task A] and [Task B] today. I expect the remaining items on the list to be addressed by [Date/Time]. I appreciate your support as I manage this transition!""

In my case, the letter would be sent to my state DHHS because the tasks on my list were:

* Retype previously submitted proof to DHHS financial assistance.
* Call an international domain hosting company, and politely explain to them that DHHS financial assistance would need the asset value for my web domains to be reformatted in the 2024 format.
* Email the nursing company that helps me package my meds once a month to let them know that my meds had all finally arrived and we're on site. 
* Disassemble wash dry and reassemble the 168 cap Dural syringes that are needed for my husband's nurse to pack his liquid medications. 
* Call the probate attorney who has graciously brought his fee down to $500 to see if he's been able to find where my husband's trustee has disappeared to so that we might be able to recoupe the money that was in that account for his growing out of pocket medical expenses. 
* Finish filling in the planner pages for February so I know who is going where and why.
*Call the Medicaid transportation scheduling TPA and verbally dictate all 37 appointments for the month of February, receive & record tracking numbers for each in my planner. 
* Open the 2"" tall stack of mail, read, sort, and add any new to do items to the ""Overload"" list in planner.
*Do daily family caregiver check-in call with 75-year-old Aunt 
*Take a much-needed shower 

While I was eating my breakfast, I got the phone call that there would be no Home Care aide today (due to the massive labor shortage, low pay, and non existent low income housing) so I also have that to do list:

* Take the doorbell off of our patio replace the batteries. 
* Prepare 1/4"" dice medical diet lunch one
* Serve lunch two
* Prep and serve dinner 1
* Serve dinner 2
* Clean up enough to keep fruit flies, random spiders, and the fire marshal away.

I decided that I would just send this entire blog post to the person at DHHS so she could see an example of the real work that I really do (including for National level magazines). She's in a tough spot because people above her demand certain things people blow her are always leaving and I'm sure she just wants to get my file off her desk and get to the next 8,000 people trying to do redeterminations for Medicaid. 

Gee... Maybe she could use an intern like Gemini AI? And maybe someday my Gemini Ai and a worker at a DHHS financial office could just have the two AI to talk to each other? 

Now that's a future that would save all of us a lot of time. Maybe even convince the state to expand case management during the 3D process so that it gets done faster and the disabled person doesn't get to burned out!

Having a stutter since I was kid, now 31, the rollercoaster ride of getting to this point hasn’t been easy. And I’m sure for most of, if not all you, has been the same.

To this day, the only wish would be to speak fluently. No blocks, no stumbles, no embarrassment.

Being a barber now for 6 years, there’s no hiding away that speaking to people is a big part of the job. The good days you feel on top of the world, the bad days you want to pack up your stuff and go.

The biggest improvement for me personally was getting into more uncomfortable situations. Order that coffee you want instead of the easiest to say. Instead of self service to order food, go up to the till to order. The more you put yourself out there, the more confidence you’ll find.

I have a decent understanding of pour over flavor profiles, but not nearly so much with espresso.

This shot of Passenger Agaro is really throwing me for a loop - precisely because it tastes smooth/balanced.

It appears to pull fast (17g coffee stopped at 22s at 35g, dripped after stop to about 41g). But the resulting shot is pleasant to me. I presume there’s a bit of room for dialing in/bringing out more of the fruitiness, but it feels close. Though with my limited understanding of espresso I wonder if I’m actually really far off.

Knowing from pour overs how much more is generally needed to extract Passenger roasts, am I actually closer to strongly brewed coffee than true espresso?

In another attempt I had ground finer, but ended up getting some bitter notes (Comandante, red clix on the way but don’t have it yet so adjustment steps are quite large right now). Not sure if this matters for brew temp (read that it sometimes does with the DTP) but for specifically Passenger beans I’ve been running the steam first and then immediately pulling the shot.

What’s making me think I’m actually really far off from getting the most out of these beans is that I’m expecting acidic notes from basically any espresso. Over time I’ll be ordering espresso shots from third wave cafes to help develop my espresso flavor profile, but so far have only done that once. The shot had acidity, but it was a pleasant acidity. Also, at home when pulling shots of other beans (Monarch and Geometry by Onyx, Foundations by Reanimator), I’m getting that pleasant acidity note, sometimes quite strong, from beans that aren’t nearly as lightly roasted as Passenger.

Do I just have a really high tolerance for acidity and am unknowingly under extracting all my other beans, but somehow not Passenger?",0,1769785693.0,espresso,4,0.5,False

I met a guy on an app and we went to coffee for a first date, mini golf for a second date, and for the 3rd and 4th dates he invited me over to his house. I’m in my mid 20’s and he’s early 30’s. He tried to initiate sex on the 4th date but I wasn’t ready and it was late so I told him I needed to leave. He invited me over for a 5th date but beforehand I texted him asking what he was looking for relationship wise and said I generally like to wait until I’m exclusive with someone and discuss STD testing before having sex with them. He responded that he’s looking for something long term and we could talk about it. I went over to his house for the 5th date and he brought it up and he said that he usually sleeps with people before becoming exclusive but that he always uses condoms and wasn’t worried about having an STD and wasn’t worried about me having anything either. I told him that sexual compatibility is important to me and I’m not trying to withhold sex for any reason other than being concerned about getting an STD and him potentially sleeping with others at the same time. He told me he’s slept with people since he last got tested but always used condoms. We didn’t really get anywhere with the conversation. When we went to his room and started making out I told him I was on my period which was true, he didn’t push back that hard but said “you know I don’t care that you’re on your period” but I told him I didn’t want to and he didn’t push it further. 

6th date we went out to dinner (which I suggested) and then went back to his place after. We started making out while watching a show and he put his hand down my pants and told me to take off my shirt. We were in the middle of a show so I told him we should finish it first and after it ended it was late and I told him I needed to leave. He responded “is there a problem here” and said I seem standoffish and he wants a relationship where there’s passion. He seemed frustrated that we haven’t had sex yet. I reiterated to him that I had said before I’d like for him to get tested before we sleep together. He said he had been tested like a year and a half ago but I think he just made it up based on how he said it. I told him I didn’t have any big hang ups about sex I just value my health and once I’m in a relationship where we’ve been tested I’m very much into sex. We started making out again and he put his hand down my pants again and I told him to stop. He said he just wanted to finger me and we didn’t have to go all the way but I told him no and he didn’t push any further. Afterwards he said he would get tested and I would too. He texted me after that he had a good time but now I’m not sure if I should see him again. Looking for advice on what to do. 

Edit to add: Another thing to add is there’s no texting in between dates really which I’m not used to. We’ll text after that we had a good time and then he’ll text a few days later to ask to hang out again. He also said on the 5th date when we talked about sex that he can’t tell if I really like him or not and he thinks having sex would fix that. ",0,1769785555.0,TwoXChromosomes,19,0.47,False

1qr7udc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NDPH/comments/1qr7udc/1_year_of_constant_headaches_and_still_no_proper/,1 year of constant headaches and still no proper diagnosis,"Context about me:

\- I am 19 years old, male

\- I was born with one kidney although this is not something that I have thought about my whole life and has not affected me at all, but have started to think recently about the possibility that my headaches could be related

\- My whole life I have always been in great physical condition, competing at a high level in football (soccer) and bench pressing 110kg, 5km in 19 mins, exercising roughly 15 hours a week roughly etc etc.

\- My diet has always been pretty healthy, no fast food or unhealthy snacks but never really tracked what I ate and have always had a good physique. In terms of coffee, probably one or two per day from 16 up until my head injury. In terms of alcohol, from 15-18, this was pretty heavy drinking roughly once per week having about 10 units give or take. In my first term in university, this went up a lot drinking roughly 3 or 4 times a week, for an average of about 45 units a week - although kept exercising and all else was healthy. I have smoked marijuana occasionally but never any other drug

\- Have never really suffered from hangovers, let alone any other headaches - probably having about 10 headaches max a year at low severity

\- I am now in my second year of university at a top 5 in the UK doing a relatively difficult and strenuous course.

\- No other serious medical conditions in my life

I am writing this on 28th January 2026. My headache journey started roughly a year ago around the 20th of January 2025. While playing football, I was elbowed in the head while jumping for a header and may have hit my head as I fell to the ground (albeit it the ground was soft 4G turf). I instantly felt off (although I didn't blackout), like hot energy was travelling through me and was a bit dizzy, I remember being in the shower 30 minutes and feeling like I was slightly struggling to stand up and getting the feeling I wanted to lie down. I am under the impression that this was a concussion.

Stupidly, I went out drinking that night, probably about 10 units of alcohol, and played football the next day (although I took care not to have any physical impact with my head). That night (the day after the head collision), I went out again and consumed roughly 15-20 units of alcohol and remember feeling terrible at about 10 PM and the sudden urge to go back home and was asleep shortly after. The next morning I woke up feeling horrible and went to hospital where I was diagnosed with concussion, had a CAT scan that didn't pick up anything bad, and given some tablets (I can not fully remember what they were but I think they had some form of opioids). Anyway, I felt better the next day and my recovery journey continued until about 3 weeks later I felt pretty much healed (i.e. no headache at rest, and I had not completed serious intensive exercise to know fully whether I was 100% back).

3 weeks later I played a football match where I came on in the last 15 minutes and I did not header the ball. I felt kind of OK while playing but remember in the coach on the way home I felt this kind of sinking hot feeling in my head like it was a slight headache that felt a bit like a waterfall at the top of my head flowing down. I was slightly annoyed about not playing a lot of minutes so I went for about an hour swim after in which I felt mostly OK but slightly off. I continued this to go out heavily drinking again that night and stayed out very late till about 4AM. The next morning I felt horrible. One of the worst feelings in the morning that I have ever had but since I thought my concussion was cured I just figured this was an unusual hangover. I went to the gym later that day and think I tried to lift fairly heavily despite feeling off to try and make myself feel better and still felt pretty rough when I went to bed. I still felt bad the next morning so I ran to the gym and found myself barely able to do anything strenuous and had to walk home. When I got home I felt really terrible and was meant to go out that night but literally couldn't and went to bed early. I was pretty much bed bound for the next 2/3 days with a weird headache that I'd never had before, it's so hard to describe but my first descriptions were that it felt like the most intense hangover imaginable and it was a sort of dull pain (definitely not piercing) around my whole head.

A week later and the pain had not reduced at all and was constant from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to bed and had to leave uni and go home because I could not handle it anymore. This pain has pretty much continued for the last 11 months maybe on average being 10-20% better than in that first week but that could perhaps be because I am used to the pain but importantly it has never got any worse from that first week. I can also notice a big difference between this headache and the one I had for a few days after the concussion.

To be clear this is a pain that is there when I wake up until I go to bed 24/7. The pain does fluctuate and at times it can be as low as 2/10 but I can always tell it is there but normally reaches at least 5/10 every day. Activity certainly makes my headache worse, from as little as trying to concentrate on uni work or listen to as lecture. I have pretty much had to give up exercise which is extremely painful for me as it made my life because that same hot headache comes back that I talked about before from after that football match but much more severe than then. I have maybe had 5 drinks in the last 11 months and tended not to feel good after them so having basically given up all alcohol.

So now what have I been doing to try and sort this out: About 2 months in I was referred to a neurologist and tried lots of different medicines: amitriptyline, propranolol, mirtazapine, GON block, topiramate, rimegepant - I would say that none of these really worked at all.

I then was referred to a sports neurologist who instructed I get a contrast MRI and although a small microhaemorrhage was found, he was pretty convinced that I was not still concussed as he said my scan was too positive for it to be a severe enough concussion that it lasted this long.

I was referred to another neurologist who wanted to try to see if I may have a low pressure headache due to my orthostatic traits but after consuming roughly 3 coffees a day and having a myleogram this was largely ruled out. I didnt particularly think that low pressure headache was what I had since there is no position I can lie in that makes the headache fully go away. Then about 2 months ago I started atogepant the day before I went on a skiing trip. I am a very experienced skiier so I initially thought that I could probably get away with skiing with low exertion so on the first day I went up. I was pretty suprised with how well I fared but I felt better and better throughout the week and would honestly say its been the best week feeling wise since last Februrary. Providing further context for people who may think that this may be because I was happy about going on holiday but I have been fortunate enough to go on quite a few holidays this year and have not felt good on them. However, I was pretty unhappy to see my symptoms worsen again upon coming back home. (despite continuing with the atogepant). I spoke to my neurologist about the potential of having alleviated symptoms due to the low air pressure due to the altitude (we were staying at around 2000m above sea level) but she said that this was likely to have in fact made it worse. She said instead that it was probably due to either just getting started on the atogepant or just because I had a good routine. A few weeks later, (about a month ago), I had botox in my head and I really feel like this hasnt had much of an effect either. I am still taking atogepant but feel pretty terrible again (despite trying much harder to have a good routine i.e. going to bed at the same time consistently, getting good sleep, eating well, low phone time, getting fresh air etc.).

I am reaching out because it seems like nothing is working and I am desperate to get my life back. I have set my recovery goal time as 5 months from now as this is when my internship starts.

I just finished Duskwood and I can’t stop thinking about the ending.
At the end of the game, that line appears:
“Everything will be fine in the end. And if it’s not fine, then it’s not the end.”
That alone made me feel like the story isn’t truly over yet.
Also, in the last scene when Hannah is given coffee by the police officer—did anyone else notice her reaction? She suddenly looks surprised, shocked, and even… happy? It felt like she saw or realized something important, and then the game just ends right there.
I might be overthinking, but it really felt like a deliberate cliffhanger 👀
Do you think the story will continue from this point in a Duskwood Part 2?
Or was this just meant to be symbolic?

1qr7p3j,https://i.redd.it/m6ab73hk3igg1.png,Still loving my slick coyote brown HUCKBERRY X GORUCK GR1 26L SCARS custom ruck after all these years,"This is my GR1 26L, originally the Huckberry Slick version—the flat front, no MOLLE, intentionally plain. I bought it years ago when I was in a very different headspace about gear. Back then I just wanted one good backpack and didn’t think much beyond that.

Then I sent it to SCARS, which—honestly—is where all financial restraint went to die.
Over time it picked up side compression straps, side handles, a bottom handle, drainage grommets, and MOLLE added to the shoulder straps. That last one was actually the original reason I sent it in: the Huckberry Slick doesn’t have MOLLE on the straps, and I wanted to run a proper sternum strap without hacks. While it was there, I kept saying “well, while you’re at it…” until it became a completely bespoke object.

I’ve also added a loop inside the slash pocket, scavenged a Camelbak sternum strap, added strap keepers from Miltaur, and eventually put a RuckSport morale patch on it that I bought from someone in the GORUCK community. That patch matters more than it should—it takes the edge off and makes the bag read more like a generic backpack than a ruck. Almost JanSport-adjacent in spirit, if not in construction.

Since then I’ve gone through phases. Shoulder bags. Courier bags. Bigger backpacks. I’ve tried to commit to a GR2 34L in 500D Tropical Multicam more than once. On paper, it makes sense. In reality, I keep coming back to this GR1.

At this point it’s not a ruck. No plates, no weight. It’s my everyday carry work bag. I leave the apartment in the morning and I’m out until evening—on foot, no car. Coffee shops, digital marketing work, errands, meetings. Total pedestrian energy. I need to be self-sufficient all day and I also need the movement. This bag just disappears on my back and lets me do that.

One thing that’s stuck with me over time is how Coyote Brown works. I’ve always been a William Gibson reader—Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, Zero History—and one of the ideas that keeps coming up is how military gear and civilian fashion chase each other in loops. Surplus becomes style. Function becomes aesthetic. Colors migrate. Cuts migrate. By the time something is officially “military,” it’s already been filtered through fashion.

Coyote Brown sits right in that overlap. It’s not black. It’s not OD or Ranger Green. It’s definitely not camo. With the slick front, it reads civilian first, gear second. Somewhere along the way I realized I’d accidentally landed in the same tan/beige/brown palette that a lot of contemporary fashion—especially Japanese and streetwear-influenced stuff—has been obsessed with for years. I didn’t plan that. It just happened.

The bag shows dirt. It stains. It’s not precious. But the upside is that it patinas incredibly well. The 1000D Cordura has softened to the point where it honestly feels closer to broken-in 500D now. It still has all the structure and durability, but none of the boardy stiffness it started with.

What I like about GORUCK bags in general is that they come from a very specific lineage—Special Forces med, ruck, and sustainment gear—but they don’t force you to cosplay that history. With this setup, I get all the value of that overbuilt DNA without broadcasting it. It feels civilian. It feels normal. It feels like mine.

I’ve spent an unreasonable amount of money on this bag. There is no resale logic left in it. It went from an already expensive Huckberry backpack to a fully bespoke, mildly unhinged investment. I’m not proud of that part, but I’m also not pretending it didn’t happen. At some point it crossed from “gear” into “personal object,” and that’s usually where the math stops mattering.",1,1769785044.0,chrisabraham,0,1.0,False

1qr7nrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKFrugal/comments/1qr7nrk/found_a_great_way_to_save_money_on_trains/,Found a great way to save money on trains!,"I travel by train regularly as I am a student who commutes to university. I was looking at ways to save on train travel, and I've found a method that I thought is worth sharing.

  
Firstly, I pay for Monzo Perks at £7 a month. As part of this benefit, I receive both a railcard, which for me, saves £6.30 per trip anyway, and also an Uber One subscription - both completely for free aside from the overall subscription cost.

  
Uber One provides 10% cashback on train tickets, which can be used on subsequent journeys.

  
In my use case, I take the train twice a week, which ordinarily would cost me £37.60 a week. Over a 12 week semester, this would cost £451.20. After applying the railcard discount, this drops to £300 a semester, and then down to £270 following the Uber cashback.

  
A 12 week semester is approximately 3 months, and in that time I'd have spent £21 on Monzo Perks. This means that my total saving comes to £160, even when including the subscription cost. 

  
It's important to note that most of this saving comes from a Railcard, which can obviously be bought cheaper than a yearly Monzo Perks subscription, but if you're also likely to use the other benefits of Perks, such as free Greggs coffee, Vue cinema ticket, or increased interest rates, then it might be worth your while.",40,1769784962.0,UKFrugal,7,0.95,False

1qr7n1p,https://tipstor.com/top-5-hacks-for-saving-on-airport-food/,Top 5 Hacks for Saving on Airport Food,"Airports are pressure cookers of time, money, and appetite, places where hunger stalks the gates with predatory patience. The seasoned traveler treats this arena like an urban expedition, a fast moving challenge that rewards preparation and sharp instincts. This is action adventure in fluorescent lighting, where survival depends on foresight and a calm refusal to be rattled by glowing menus with inflated prices.

The smartest move begins long before security. Eating well outside the terminal turns the airport into a victory lap instead of a test of willpower. Neighborhood cafés and bakeries near major hubs serve better food at saner prices, fueling the body for long walks between terminals and unexpected sprints to distant gates. Packing snacks becomes the next tactical advantage. Nuts, energy bars, dried fruit, and simple sandwiches slip easily into bags and deliver steady energy during delays. This small act of preparation transforms layovers into manageable pauses rather than expensive ordeals.

Inside the terminal, the refillable water bottle becomes a trusted companion. Free water stations hide in plain sight across modern airports, especially after security. Staying hydrated keeps travelers alert for the real action, whether that means navigating a last minute gate change or powering through an overnight connection. The bottle also frees up cash for experiences beyond the terminal, which is where the real adventure waits.

Lounges offer another layer of strategy. Many allow access through day passes, credit card perks, or airline status, and inside waits a calmer world with complimentary food, coffee, and sometimes full meals. This is not about luxury for its own sake but about efficiency. A single lounge visit can replace multiple overpriced terminal meals and create space to rest before long flights. Even without lounge access, local chains inside airports often provide better value than flashy sit down spots. These familiar names operate at scale and deliver consistent food without punishing prices.

Wildlife appears in unexpected ways during this journey. Birds patrol the runways with quiet authority, riding thermals above the tarmac. In coastal airports, seabirds glide past windows like living postcards. In desert hubs, hawks and falcons circle beyond the fences, reminders that the world beyond the terminal remains vast and untamed. Watching them during a layover adds a moment of calm and connection to place.

The best season for this kind of airport mastery is shoulder travel months, spring and fall, when crowds thin slightly and delays ease. Fewer people mean easier access to water stations, lounges, and seating near windows where runway wildlife performs its aerial routines. Saving money becomes almost automatic during these times, as food options remain available without the crush of peak travel chaos.

This approach turns hunger into a manageable challenge rather than a costly mistake. With snacks packed, water flowing, smart meals chosen, and eyes open to the small wonders outside the glass, the airport becomes part of the journey instead of an obstacle. It is a place to practice discipline, observe movement, and prepare for the next landscape waiting beyond the gate.

The sun had been shining since morning. There wasn't a single cloud, so the apartment was stuffy. I was sitting in the kitchen at a large table. The kitchen was spacious. Two journalists and a psychologist were also sitting at the kitchen table. We were all waiting for the guy who had invited us; the housekeeper had let us into the apartment.

""Are you a writer?"" one of the journalists suddenly asked me.
""Yes,"" I replied. ""Just a beginner so far.""
""My name is Nikolai Olegovich. But you can just call me Nikolai,"" Nikolai extended his hand. We shook hands. Then the second journalist offered his hand.
""Marat Alexandrovich. And what's your name?"" he asked, shaking my hand.
""Alexander Yuryevich,"" I answered.
""What do you write about?"" Nikolai asked me.
""I'm trying my hand at science fiction for now. And you?""
""I write articles for the newspaper 'White Truth',"" replied Nikolai.
""And I write articles for the magazine 'Fantastika',"" said Marat.
""How soon is the guy supposed to come? What's his name?"" asked Nikolai. The psychologist looked at the time.
""In about 5 minutes. I think his name is Maxim Mikhailovich,"" answered the psychologist.

We began to wait for Maxim Mikhailovich. A few minutes later, the front door opened and a tall guy, about 18-19 years old, entered the apartment. We couldn't see his face. He took off his sneakers, put on slippers, and came into the kitchen. When I saw his face, I was very surprised. He looked like he hadn't slept for a week. He had dark blue bags under his eyes. His hair was disheveled.

""Greetings,"" he said to us. We all said hello. ""Give me a minute.""

After these words, he walked over to the kitchen cabinet and took out a pack of some pills. Then he swallowed about 5 or 6 of them. After that, the guy made himself some coffee and asked if we wanted any, but we declined. The guy sat down opposite us.

""So, let's begin,"" he said. He raised his mug and took a sip. ""My name is Maxim, you can just call me Max. I'm 18 years old.""

I took a notebook from my backpack and started writing everything down; the journalists and psychologist also began taking notes.

""I don't know how to explain this. But please, listen to my story. It all started a week ago and hasn't happened again since. I live alone in a rented apartment. So, no one could stop this madness,"" Max began to tell. ""It was an ordinary day, and when night came, I went to sleep. That evening, I just went to bed, and the next morning I woke up. At first, it seemed like something had changed, but I didn't pay it much mind. I lived a simple life, soon I met a girl and married her. A few years later, we had our first child...""

""Are you telling us about a dream?"" the Psychologist interrupted Max.

""Let me finish, then you'll all understand,"" the guy replied to the question.
""Alright,"" said the Psychologist.

""We had a son, then about two years later, we had a daughter. I lived a wonderful life with my family. The years flew by quickly. I remember my daughter graduating from college, and my son and his wife giving me grandchildren. I became a grandfather. I turned 70, my health deteriorated, and soon I was bedridden. I kept getting worse and worse. I realized I was dying. I died surrounded by my relatives: my wife, children, grandchildren, cousins, sisters, and nephews. I remember closing my eyes and hearing a woman's voice: 'He's awake! He's awake! Get the IV ready!'""

""I opened my eyes. I was lying on a bed in a medical ward, nurses were running around setting up an IV for me. Most importantly, I noticed I was young again. I mumbled incoherently.""

""'Where am I? Where is my family? What happened?'""

""'You were in a coma for 10 years, and you've just now woken up,' a nurse answered my question.""

""I was in shock. I couldn't believe that my entire life was 10 years in a coma. None of it was real—no wife, no children, nothing. I had lost 10 years of my life. That's what I thought at that moment. Because of all this, I became extremely agitated; to calm me down, the nurses gave me a sedative, and I fell asleep. Asleep again.""

""When I woke up, I felt different. I opened my eyes and saw rough, gray walls and a window with bars in front of me. I was lying on a bed without a mattress. I looked around and realized I was in a prison. At first, I thought it was a dream, but everything felt so real that I started to go crazy. I tried to wake myself up, but it was useless; I remained in prison. I couldn't understand what this was or how it happened. There was a small mirror hanging on the wall. I walked over to it and saw myself. Myself, but looking about forty years old.""

""I spent the whole day in that cell thinking about what was happening. I noticed that no one checked on me. That was strange too. So, in complete solitude, I sat there until nightfall, and then I fell asleep.""

""I woke up, or rather came to, on some kind of flying thing. A guy was sitting next to me, apparently piloting it. We were flying between skyscrapers that looked like they were from a cyberpunk world. We were being chased; some people were following us and shooting lasers.""

""'Oh, you're awake?' the guy addressed me. 'How are you?'""

""I didn't answer him. Suddenly, a laser hit us, and we crashed into a skyscraper. I came to in a forest—no, they were jungles. I was bare-chested and covered in various tattoos. I was wearing pants made from the skin of some animal, and there were human scalps hanging from the pants! And a bloody tomahawk. I was walking next to some Indian who looked like me. He also had a few scalps. We were walking. But I didn't understand where, and I also didn't understand what this was? What is happening?""

""Soon, we reached an Indian settlement. He went into his wigwam, but I just stood there. All of this was new to me. I stood like that for a few minutes, and people started looking at me strangely.""

""'Swift Wolf, what's wrong with you?' one of the Indians came up to me. I understood him.""
""'E-everything's fine,' I replied, stuttering.""
""'Why isn't Swift Wolf going to his wigwam?' he asked. My nerves couldn't take it anymore, and I dashed into the jungle.""

""I ran through thick undergrowth, just running. The Indians didn't seem to be chasing me, but I kept running. I tripped, fell, ran. Suddenly, I unexpectedly ran out onto a large cliff and couldn't stop. The drop was high, and I fell down. When I landed, I didn't feel any pain, I just lost consciousness.""

""I came to in a small apartment, in a bed. I got up and saw, instead of my usual stomach, a huge belly. There was a mirror in the apartment. I walked over to it and looked into it. A man who looked like me, about 30 years old, was staring back. I was very fat, obese. I sat down and began to think about what was happening. In the end, I constructed this version: that most likely, when I go to sleep or die, I move between different universes where I am different people, and that my family was also just another universe. I assumed that in reality, I am 18 years old and I am still asleep. I began to wonder how to escape this anomaly, but I couldn't think of anything. And besides, in such a large body, I could hardly do anything. So, I waited until night. The time was 23:00. I put the phone in the pants (it was already there) that I was wearing when I went to sleep.""

""I woke up. And the very first thing I noticed was long hair falling into my face. I was lying in a bed with flower patterns. There was a pink computer in the room, stuffed animals, and photos of Korean celebrities hanging on the walls. There was also a mirror in the room. I got up and looked into it. I had awakened in the body of a girl who resembled me. I was wearing pink pants and a t-shirt. In the pants, I found a phone—not a pink one, but the one I had put in my pocket when I was in the fat guy's body.""

""I drew a conclusion: that some objects can also move with me. I decided to experiment and went to sleep with this phone. I woke up in some strange place, but I didn't pay attention to that. I started rummaging through my pockets and found that phone. I realized I definitely wasn't going crazy. I started taking photos and videos with this phone. So, I traveled to many different universes and recorded everything on this phone,"" Max took a small touchscreen phone out of his pocket. ""And then one day, I woke up as myself, in my own body. Since then, I haven't gone to sleep, because I'm afraid it might happen again.""

""Why are you so sure it wasn't a dream?"" asked the psychologist.
""Because I felt everything. You can't feel that in a dream,"" answered Max. He handed us his phone. ""Here. Look, here are all the videos and photos from different universes.""

We took the phone and started scrolling through the photos. Each photo showed a person resembling Max, but it wasn't Max. There were many photos.
""This is photoshop,"" the Psychologist said sharply. The journalists and I were silent.
""No, it all really happened!"" Max tried to prove.
""It's the age of technology, neural networks are everywhere. I can generate similar pictures with my own face,"" said the psychologist.
""But it's the truth!""
""Hmm, you said it all started a week ago. Please tell me, how much time passed in this universe from when you started your journey?"" asked Marat.
""One night. In the evening when I went to sleep, I started moving, and it all ended in the morning,"" answered Max.
""So, if you fall asleep now, will you start traveling through universes again?"" I asked.
""I think so,"" replied Max.
""Then let's conduct an experiment so you can prove it. We'll take your phone now, and return it to you this evening. You'll put it in your pocket and go to sleep, and we'll stay with you all night. If there are new photos on it in the morning, then we'll check it for you,"" suggested the psychologist.
""Alright,"" answered Max.

Everything was done as planned. The day passed quickly, and evening came. As agreed, we returned the phone to Max. He put it in his pocket and lay down on the bed. He fell asleep within a few minutes. We decided to stay awake all night.

""If we wake him up, will he stop traveling through universes?"" asked Nikolai.
""I think this is all nonsense. The guy is clearly sick, that much is obvious,"" said the Psychologist.
""I don't know, but it's an interesting plot for a story,"" I said, checking what I had written down.
""And for an article too,"" said Marat.

We spent the night in quiet conversation like that, not even noticing when dawn began to break. When it was 10:00 AM, we ourselves were starting to fall asleep. Suddenly, Max woke up. He was drenched in sweat. Sleep immediately vanished for me, the psychologist, and the journalists.

""So?!"" asked Nikolai.
""W-wait,"" Max said, breathing heavily. ""Let me catch my breath.""

After a couple of minutes, he spoke.
""I won't tell you anything. You'd better see for yourselves. And I realized it's all over."" Saying this, Max took out the phone and handed it to us.

We turned it on and opened the gallery. There were thousands of different photos! The photos showed various people resembling Max. We were amazed; even the psychologist was surprised.

Now, I don't know what happened to Max, because I returned home to share this story with you.",2,1769784852.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1qr7kh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qr7kh4/the_psychology_of_body_language_sciencebacked/,The Psychology of Body Language: Science-Backed Mistakes Making You Instantly Unlikable,"Had coffee with a friend last week who couldn't figure out why job interviews kept going south despite solid qualifications. Watched her fidget with her phone, cross her arms, barely make eye contact while venting. The irony hit hard.

Started diving deep into body language research after that, books, behavioral psychology studies, FBI interrogation tactics, even primate social behavior (yeah, went there). Turns out most of us are unconsciously broadcasting ""stay away from me"" signals all day long. The scary part? We have no clue we're doing it.

Here's what actually matters, backed by research, not the recycled ""smile more"" garbage you've heard a thousand times.

The phone grip that's killing your conversations. Holding your phone during interactions, even if you're not using it, signals you're mentally half checked out. Social psychologist Sherry Turkle's research shows people rate conversations as less satisfying when phones are merely visible on the table. Your brain literally can't resist monitoring it. I tested this for two weeks, left my phone in my bag during every interaction. The difference in how engaged people became was honestly shocking. Conversations flowed easier, people opened up more, eye contact felt natural instead of forced.

Fake listening face versus actual listening. You know that thing where you're nodding along but mentally drafting your grocery list? People can tell. Real listening involves micro expressions, slight head tilts, raised eyebrows at surprising moments. What Every Body Is Saying by Joe Navarro (ex FBI agent, spent 25 years reading criminals for a living) breaks down how genuine interest shows up physically. Your feet point toward what you care about, your torso leans in slightly, you mirror the other person's energy naturally. Can't fake this stuff long term, your body will rat you out. Best solution? Actually listen. Revolutionary concept, I know.

The handshake mistake everyone makes. Too firm screams insecurity and overcompensation. Too weak broadcasts low confidence. The sweet spot? Match their pressure exactly, two to three pumps, done. But here's the thing nobody mentions, cold hands tank the whole thing. Research from University of Chicago found people with warm hands are perceived as significantly more trustworthy and generous. Before important meetings, run your hands under warm water for 30 seconds. Sounds ridiculous, works like magic.

Crossed arms aren't always defensive, but. Sometimes you're just cold or your arms feel weird hanging there. Cool. But sustained arm crossing during conversations creates a literal physical barrier. The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease (sold 20 million copies, cited in courtrooms worldwide) documents how crossed arms reduce information retention by 38%. People remember less of what you say when you're doing it. Wild. Try the ""hand steeple"" instead, fingertips touching, makes you look thoughtful instead of closed off. Politicians and executives use this constantly because it works.

Your resting face is sabotaging you. Some of us just look pissed when relaxed, nothing personal, just genetics. Problem is, strangers don't know that. They assume you're unapproachable or judgmental. Spent months working on this using Vanessa Van Edwards' body language course on the Science of People platform. She's analyzed thousands of TED talks and interviews, isolated exactly what makes people charismatic. One trick that helped, slight eyebrow raises when making eye contact. Signals openness without forcing a creepy perma grin. Also realized I was unconsciously frowning while concentrating, made me look angry during work conversations when I was just focused.

If you want to go deeper on communication psychology without committing to heavy textbooks, BeFreed has been useful for piecing together these concepts. It's an AI learning app that pulls from behavioral research, body language experts, and psychology books to create personalized audio content. You can tell it something specific like ""I'm an introvert who wants to master nonverbal communication in professional settings"" and it builds a learning plan around that goal. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Makes it easier to actually retain this stuff when you're commuting or at the gym instead of forcing yourself through dry academic papers.

The power pose myth and what actually works. Amy Cuddy's power posing research got partially debunked, high power poses don't magically boost testosterone. But here's what does work, expansive body language signals confidence to others, even if you don't feel it internally. Taking up space (within reason, don't be that subway manspreader) makes you appear more authoritative. Watched hours of Charisma on Command's YouTube breakdowns analyzing actors and public figures. They consistently note how confident people have relaxed, open postures, they're not trying to minimize their physical presence.

Eye contact duration that doesn't creep people out. Three to five seconds, then break briefly. Longer feels aggressive or romantic (context dependent obviously). But here's the nuance, look away to the side, not down. Looking down signals submission or discomfort. This comes from primate behavior research, dominant chimps maintain horizontal sight lines. Sounds absurd but your lizard brain recognizes these patterns.

Touching your face during important conversations. Nose, mouth, neck, all of it broadcasts anxiety or deception. Not because you're lying, but because that's what liars do, so people unconsciously associate it with dishonesty. Caught myself doing this constantly during zoom calls, didn't even realize until I recorded myself (cringe but necessary). Started using the Centered app to build awareness through quick mindfulness check ins throughout the day. Helps you notice these unconscious habits before they become visible tells.

Speed and rhythm of movement matters more than you think. Jerky, fast movements signal nervousness. Slow, deliberate gestures convey confidence and control. Watch any Denzel Washington interview, his movements are smooth and intentional, never rushed. That's calculated. Makes him appear grounded and trustworthy. Started consciously slowing down my gestures during presentations, feedback improved noticeably.

The biological reality is humans evolved to read body language before verbal language existed. Your monkey brain is constantly scanning for threat signals, trustworthiness cues, social status markers. Modern society pretends this doesn't matter, we're civilized and rational now. Except we're not. These instincts still run the show underneath our fancy logic and manners.

None of this means you're broken or need a complete personality overhaul. Small adjustments create surprisingly large ripple effects in how people respond to you. The goal isn't manipulation, it's removing the static so your actual personality comes through clearly. Your body language should amplify who you are, not contradict it.",1,1769784751.0,GroundedMentality,1,1.0,False

And yes, making money on this is a goal but if it helps any number of people, my conscious is clear.

Why $2? Because it's cheap enough to be an impulse buy and expensive enough to be more disciplined and if you aren’t willing to trade the price of a cheap coffee for your discipline, you aren't ready to quit. The $2 is ""skin in the game."" I believe it makes the commitment real.

* Zero Fluff: No badges, no ""leveling up,"" no ads. Just a dark ledger of your progress.

* 3 journal entries per day, to put your thoughts in.

The catalyst to this was a rejection during the final round of interviews at a big tech company, wherein the I was told that my UX skills were on-point but I needed to polish my UI a bit more.

Since then, I’ve redesigned my portfolio with the help of several mentors; i’ve received nothing but positive feedback since (I shipped it less than a month ago.) One of them referred me for a position and I was put in-touch with the hiring manager.

I didn’t end up getting it because they went with a candidate that had more experience under their belt. Despite that, the hiring manager told me that my portfolio was great and that it’s a tough market especially for Jrs.

At this point, i’m entirely burned out and somewhat jaded because I don’t know what to do. I only know a couple of people in my program who ended up getting a job and that was entirely through connections.

I’d also like to point out that i’ve done my fair share of networking, I had over 80 coffee chats over the summer and made some great mentors who’ve been absolutely wonderful and have helped me improve my design skills greatly.

I have an issue and its driving me nuts and making me feel like shit.

A little backstory: I’m 32, autistic and on disability pension (i live on existential minimum) My sister (33) is the opposite, she and her husband earn well both above average. My sister has two kids and a job, i’m unemployed and cant find a job due to my disability.

to the problem:

My sister always plans expensive outings and only tells me about them last second. Basically her thing is “hey do you have a spare 100-200 bucks to spend right now on an outing” and most of the time i dont.

about a year ago i tried to explain to her that since im literally per definition poor that i would love it if she could consider this next time she plans something. to either tell me early enough or maybe plan something that doesnt cost an arm and a leg for one meal. Spoiler alert she didnt. that conversation didnt go over well, cause in her eyes she didnt do anything wrong and my reaction is an overreaction and that i am not poor; “people in africa are poor” and “you dont have to come”

We talked about going to istanbul for 2 days, only my siblings and I. I then told her again, i need to be told early if they want me to come too. i woke up this morning to a text “hey we booked the flight, you can book too if you want” the date they picked is in two months. i cant join because 1st i cant get together that much money in such a short time, cause i made other commitments with my money and they booked it too close to my nose surgery (to their defense they didnt know about the surgery)

i feel like a fucking joke. i have always been an outsider within my family, ever since childhood i was the one who was systematically not included in outings, i get it im not an easy person to be around with, but trust me not a single day goes by where i dont hate myself for not being easy going like others.

i wrote her earlier today that i am really pissed at how she handled this that despite me saying i dont have a lot of money they do this, her answer was a bunch of deflection and  “why do i have to plan everyting, you can plan too”  but when i plan something simple like going out for a coffee, something i can afford on a whim, no one is interested in that type of outing. and every argument ends in me being branded as the one who doesnt care about the family. so i told her to f\*ck off im done with her games and she can bite me.

i’m genuinely at a loss here, cause i would do anything to include people i want with me, especially if they have some obstacles but it seems like my sister doesnt think im actually poor for our conturies average income and the fact that they didnt change a single thing in how they make plans, kind of confirms this voice in my head that most people just put up with me and im only being asked last second as a formality cause they know i cant join.

I haven’t been awake this early in a long time. It was still dark outside, the sky a shadowed blue as the sun hadn't even begun to peek over the horizon. I listened to Marnie answer the doorbell as I groggily pulled myself to the side of my bed. My phone showed me a blinding 6:45 in the morning. I got dressed, pulling clean clothes out of my small backpack, throwing on whatever was still clean and wasn’t foul.

​It had already been two days. I’ve only lounged around the house, making half-hearted conversations with my sister and Arty as they discussed the home and what to do with what our father still owned. She never asked me directly, but I could see it on her face. When was I going to leave? I asked myself the same question.

​Marine was in the kitchen with Arty, each cupping a mug of hot coffee in their hands as they listened to the sheriff talk to them from across the counter. She had her back turned to me, but I could tell who it was, her red hair tied low and neat underneath her hat. I stopped at the top of the stairs before they could see or hear me, nervous to go down, not wanting to confront another person from my past. Arty listened intensely to what the sheriff was saying, responding with his “yes” and “no, ma’am,” but Marnie shook and stood stiff, nervous.

​“Morning-” I called as I finally stomped down to them.

​“Look who’s finally awake.” Sarah Adams turned and scowled at me. The same look she had given me the last time I saw her, almost a decade ago. “Welcome back to town, city boy. We wake up early here.”

​“We’re in Washington, stop acting like we’re in the deep south,” I grumbled.

​“Well, she *is* the sheriff-” Arty chimed in. We both shot him a look, and he shrank back, cupping his coffee in his hand.

​“What’s uh- what’s going on?”

​“Checking in with Marn, and wanted to see if you three were up for some volunteer work. Another kid went missing yesterday evening, playing near the woods, and didn't come home. We sure as hell ain’t waiting a full 24 hours before we send searchers.”

​“Another?”

​“It’s been…unusual around here in the past few years, lots more missing than I’d like to admit.”

​“Did you ask the parents? Or any of the kids' friends?”

​“You telling me how to do my job?”

​“No, I-”

​“They all said they saw him walk home before the other kids. No trace of him on the trail. Hoping he just got lost, but we don’t know. Could use you lot. Your dad was an amazing tracker. Got any of that in you?” Sarah didn’t ask me, but turned to Arty instead.

​He opened his mouth to answer, but froze before a word came out, unsure if he should. I nodded to him. “I mean, I’m free to help-”

​“I feel sick.” Marnie cut him off, “I-I can’t go-”

​“That’s alright, you take as much time as you need, Marn.” She smiled warmly at my sister before slapping the counter and turning to leave. “Guess it’s just you two. Get your boots, you’re riding with me, city boy.”

​Awkward silent car rides must be my thing. Sarah stayed focused on the road while I stole glances at her sharp eyes and fiery red hair. She had no ring on her finger. Part of me was excited, the other part felt guilty. She slowed her truck down a bit and went to unhook the badge from her uniform, handing it to me. I took it and fumbled with it around for a moment, unsure of what to say.

​“So… sheriff now?”

​“That’s my badge.” She proudly announced. “Without that badge, I'm just wearing a costume. I ain’t no sheriff without that badge.”

​“I don’t unders-”

​Her fist slammed across my face before I could finish that sentence, sending my head crashing against the car window. My vision jumped from double to triple before a wave of static traveled from my eyes down to my jaw. Between the bursts of black and white, I saw her glare at me. I deserved it.

​“Sarah-”

​“Been holding that in for the better part of a decade.”  She exhaled, snatching the badge back from my hands and gripping it tight as she kept driving, knuckles white with anger. “Maybe there’s something wrong with me. Can’t let things go like other people. I tried blaming you, but I always ended up blaming myself. I waited for you to come back for years. Not even a phone call, or a letter, or-”

​“Sarah- I’m sorry.” I sniffled, unsure if it was snot or blood coming out of my nose.

​“Then I hear you left to go to some big town college on the other side of the country? I ain’t good enough for you? What about me made you just ditch me here, huh?”

​“It wasn’t about you, I just had to-”

​“You know I threw away that ring? Buried it somewhere out in the trees, I can’t remember.”

​I stayed silent for a moment.

​“You ever do that? Can’t sleep at night because you beat yourself up over something you did years ago? Hell, I don’t know if it was something I did.” She turned and glared at me again, annoyed at my silence, my dark, tired eyes searching for words to calm her. “You'd better give me a good reason, or you’re the next one we’re looking for.”

​“If- If I didn’t take the chance to leave then…I would have never left…”

​“The hell does that mean?”

​“I had to get away from my father…he…Sarah-”

​Rage began to clear into confusion, then she paused for a moment to think. “Was he…”

​I nodded. She took in a long breath and slid the badge back onto her uniform.

​“I told them boys you ain’t no klutz…all those bruises. I- you- you’re…you’re a damn adult, Samuel. Back then, too. Why didn’t you just tell me? Why didn’t you tell anybody-”

​“Who’s going to believe me?” I shouted back. “He’s a fucking town hero! Taking care of anyone but his own kids. I had the chance to leave the town. I worked my ass off for that school, and you knew it! I didn’t tell anyone because I- I didn’t want to risk him finding out. God knows what he would have done to keep me there. You don’t know what it was like, having to go home to that at the end of every day, waking up to it, feeling like- like- ”

​“Alone? You ain’t alone, you idiot. You could have told me! Me, Sammy! I wasn’t anybody else. We were-” She clenched her teeth. “You…you left Marn alone with him for years before she was able to leave- and you-”

​“I was scared- I-”

​“Did you even try to help her? This whole time? Or did you think things were just going to work themselves out? Not a single letter or phone call or anything? You didn’t even think about her, did you? ”

​“...” I exhaled through my nose, my eyes avoiding hers. 

​“I was just about to forgive you- but now I know you’re just an even bigger coward than I thought you were. Poor girl had to take care of him for months, Sammy. Months. God knows what that monster did or said to her. Why did she even come back? Why didn’t she-”

​“She was scared, too. Sarah, what were we supposed to do? Mom was gone, he was the only person left in our lives, I- he’s our father-”

​“Hell, I’d stick my pa behind bars if I found out he was beating my sisters. Fuck.” She punched the wheel. “You came back, too. You still- you miss him? Now that he’s gone?”

​“Sometimes. Sometimes when I think about it. He used to take us fishing and take us to get burgers for the trip every time. He’d let Marnie drive the boat, he’d let me hold the biggest catch of the day, and tell everyone I caught it. Stuff like that. Stuff like that makes me miss him.”

​We paused for a moment, Sarah searching for the words to say, me searching for anything else. I wiped a small stain of red from my nose onto my jacket and sniffled. We were driving into the woods now, off the main trail, the wall of trees thickening as the road turned into dirt, and the dirt turned into rocks.

​“Marn mad at you?” Sarah broke the silence again.

​“Oh yeah-” I said with a pained chuckle. “I haven’t fixed that bridge yet.”

​“You’re gonna. Gonna make sure you pay that girl back for every goddamn second you left her alone with him. And then you’re going to sit down with me, and you’re going to tell me everything.”

​“Sarah-”

​“You know what’s funny?” She turned to me for a moment, flashing me a tear that was building up in her eye. “I must be a big fucking idiot because I missed you. I would’ve gone with you. If you had told me, Sammy, I would have fought it with you. I would have gone anywhere with you.”

​I let it sit. Silence crawls back between us once again as we let the memories of our past dance between us. She was right. I was a coward. Back then and still am now. The well-deserved sting in my chest came again, and I stared at myself in the faint reflection of the windshield. A child stared back at me, bruises peppered across his face and lip. I remember telling Sarah much too often that I had slipped and fallen down the stairs. I remember her patching me up every moment she got.

​The thirty-five-year-old man stared back at me now through the windshield. Messy, unshaven morning stubble, and lazily parted brown hair. He looked tired, wondering if he had to live his entire life like this, always afraid of the monster on the other side of the door. Late nights, unable to sleep, thinking of all the things he’s ever done wrong. This was no way to live.

​“Did you- uh- did you find someone out there?” Sarah asked

​“No.”

​“Why not?”

​“'Cause I missed you too.”

​Patches of white snow and ice were scattered across the ground beneath the trees. For Grand Oak, it was already steadily slipping into wintertime. Our truck pulled up and parked beside a few others, Arty parking behind us. Sarah climbed onto the back of the truck as her deputy began tossing out bags of supplies to each group of two. He handed her a megaphone, but she didn’t need it.

​Mitchell McDannis. Twelve years old, five feet tall, dirty blonde hair, gray-blue eyes, last seen wearing a bright tie-dyed jacket, and basketball shorts. Friends said he split off from the group first, walking home, but never got there. Arty and I checked our search sector on the map, a couple of miles deep into the woods, splitting slightly off a trail. I haven’t been out here in a decade, the thick woodline and trees bringing up a new level of uncertainty that made my mind begin to roll through scenarios. What if we got lost? What if one of us got injured? Landslides, flooding, wild animals?

​Arty saw the scrunch on my face and gently nudged my shoulder, giving me a reassuring look and a thumbs up. Over my shoulder was the bag of supplies, and over his was an old hunting rifle. A let out a long breath and nodded back at him. He wasn’t nervous, so neither should I. Sarah finished the briefing and joined the crowd, giving us one more round of thanks before we started to split off into groups.

​I let him lead the way; these were more his woods now than they were mine, and he traversed them like he had lived here his entire life. He immediately split us off from the trail to take a shortcut my father had shown him. I didn’t have to use our GPS; Arty had the map stuck deep in his pocket while he effortlessly stepped over fallen logs and rocks, jumping across holes in the ground covered up by the red and brown of dead leaves. I took tumbles, splinters digging into my hands as I grabbed each branch for support.

​“You good?” He’d ask every few minutes.

​I’d respond with a strained “yeah,” each time.

​Once every half hour, we’d stop. Take a moment to drink water or just take a breath. It never seemed like he needed one, though, never took a drink of water either. Instead, he just took in a long, deep breath and closed his eyes, letting his mind drift into the nature around him before we kept going. I wish he’d take a longer moment. I was ashamed of how much my legs ached and my lungs burned from the cold forest air. Thank god Sarah wasn’t here with us.

​“If you want, we could stop a bit-”

​“Keep going, Arty-” I grumbled back. “I wanna find the kid.”

​“Just don’t wanna carry the both of you back,” he joked, outstretching his arm for me to take. I chuckled as he lifted me off the ground with ease. “What’s that?” he pointed to the bruise across my nose.

​“Welcome back gift.”

​“Seems harsh.”

​“I deserved it.”

​“Speaking of gifts- thanks for the flowers, by the way, I’m flattered, but I think of you more like a brother-”

​“Shut up.”

​We both laughed, standing beside each other. There was a clearing in the trees before us, showing the entire Washington mountainside. Waves of dark green painted with a light layer of white, mountain tops that seemed to break into the clouds, letting bits of sun bleed through past the gray. I had missed this, too. I let the cold air sink deep into my lungs and spill its way back out. My arms ached, my legs burned, but for a moment, standing there with him, I felt awake.

​Alive.

​The monster was gone.

​We kept walking through the thick woods. I followed behind him, a bit faster this time, more aware of where I set my foot and stuck my hand. We talked about food, about work, about stupid things I wish I had more time for. I told him about how I studied in Ohio, how things didn’t work out, and what it was like living check to check while working at a corner store. He told me about wandering the states, looking for somewhere he could call home, people he could call family.

​“Did you come out here with him often?”

​“Your pa?”

​“Yeah.”

​“Almost every weekend before he got sick. Mostly tracking, mapping, finding spots, and fishing. Spent a lot of time out here just…enjoying this.”

​“What was he like?”

​“He’s uh- whew…” He exhaled. “He was a heck of a man, Sammy. Always teaching me stuff, always talking about you and your sister. You know, sometimes he’d hide bottles of alcohol out here? Wine or whatever- said it was his little hiking treat.”

​“Yeah, sounds like him…”

​“I look at him, and I swear I saw my own father look back at me. Wish he didn’t have to die like that, out in the cold.”

​“In the cold?”

​“He like that for you, too?”

​“What?”

​“Your pa.”

​“Oh, he uh-” I stammered, trying to collect my thoughts.

​“He ain’t all I built him up to be, huh?”

​“Arty-”

​“I can tell the way Miss Marnie looks when she talks bout him. It’s sad, but it ain't for the right reasons.”

​“No…it's not. You know, you- you- try not to talk bad about the dead, but sometimes- sometimes you can’t help it. I looked at him sometimes, and I wouldn’t see my dad. It's like looking at the devil. I wanted so badly for him to be a good father, but in my mind, he just…became something else.”

​“You know, I haven’t seen my pa for such a long time, I ain’t even remember how he sounds. But I can remember how loud he’d get. How he’d yell at me and ma. We didn’t have a lot growing up. Whatever we did have, he’d take. Whatever I brought home, money or food, was his. Try to forget, or at least lie, trying to make him something he wasn’t in my mind. Wasn’t trying to, but, guess I was trying to find someone to replace him somehow. Can’t ever forget him though…”

​He lifted his shirt, showing a large, deep scar on his side.

​“I remember one winter it was bad. We didn’t have any food. Barely any fire. He was so hungry he came at me. Knife. Stuck it in the coals before he did it. Now I can’t forget him even if I wanted to. Funny how they treat us so differently when no one can see. Makes us so scared that no one would ever believe us. I left home that day, nothing but a bag of clothes. Ain’t seen him since.”

​I lifted my shirt and jacket too, turning around so he could see the scars that ran down my back, a deep mix of red and pink. He let out a breathless exhale that turned into a hearty laugh. I could see the pain in his eyes. The memories of his father, and losing the fond memories of mine. I pulled everything back down and slung the backpack back over my shoulder. Arty grabbed my shoulder as I walked past him and patted it.

​“We’re brothers, you and I.”

​“Arty, I’ve only known you two days.”

​“Believe me, Sammy, we’re two of the same.” he gave me a wide, tooth-filled grin.

​“Let's- let's go find that kid.” I smiled back uncomfortably.

​He let me lead this time, trailing behind me a couple of yards or so. I pulled the bright yellow GPS from the side of the bag, and it came to life with a loud beep, our search location already saved and blinking on the map.

​Behind us.

​By a few miles.

I turned behind me to Arty, but he was already looking elsewhere, his eyes narrowing on something far away in the distance. I raised the pair of binoculars on my chest and pointed them roughly to where he was looking. Covered under a patch of collapsed and overgrown trunks was an old cabin. Arty whispered and cursed under his breath. How he could see that far was a mystery to me. The sound of twigs snapping underneath my feet broke his trance, and he snapped at me.

“We ain’t supposed to be here, let's go back-”

“You were the one leading; you missed our spot by 3 miles.” I ignored him and kept making my way towards the cabin. “Come on, let's see if he got lost and hid in there.”

“Naw, he ain’t in there- Sammy wait! Sammy!” He called to me, “It’s dangerous over there! Sammy lets go back! I- I made a mistake- I got lost, okay? Lets- ”​

“You stay there then, I’m just gonna take a quick look. Get the radio ready in case I find something.” I shouted back. I turned just enough to see him in the corner of my eye, but he was already gone.

I guess I will also bring my vibrator, gels, and collage of toys that I procured to keep the sex interesting. Bought it all months ago hoping he would be interested in exploring with me. Suppose I can try it out on my own.

Husband probably loves me but he's stuck in his own head. Just tired of asking about sex, only for the sex to last 10 minutes and him give up after he finishes. Even woke him up a few nights ago with a BJ, hoping he would care about my pleasure the next time. Nope. I used to love blowing him until it became a routine that if I did, we wouldn't have sex for a while since he had already been satisfied.

In the past he's said he doesn't want to spend ""45 minutes"" to get me turned on. No, it doesn't take 45 minutes, it takes about 10. He's big, too, so it hurts when I don't have that, and I've told him that. He doesn't force it if I say it hurts, but he will just give up on trying at all.

The part that sucks the most? He knows how. We've had the best sex ever before. He's left me with my legs shaking and my mind blown. It probably wouldn't hurt as much if I thought it was because he didn't know how to please me. He knows how, he just doesn't think I'm worth the effort anymore. I know he is depressed but it sucks, taking the back burner in almost every way while he figures it out.

So today I'm just sitting here, about to dress for a coffee date with myself, fighting back tears, and wondering why I'm not good enough to deserve the effort.",16,1769784518.0,Marriage,7,0.81,False

Hi reddit, i'm 33, got my implicit diagnosis a week ago. Thought to share my story here in case it might resonate with someone and be of some help.

My father was a narcissist, my mother had very severe depression all her life, coupled with ""strange decisions"" that cost her dearly but everyone brushed aside as her just being plain ol' mean and crazy. I decided very early on that i didn't want to be like either of them, so i developed a death grip on my own impulses and emotional expression before i even developed a strong enough grip on my breakfast spoon. Never got into alcohol or any drugs. Mostly joked about not liking the taste of them, but the truth is, i always felt like somewhere deep inside in the shadows i didn't see, a monster sleeps. I wasn't afraid of it, more like, i was very protective of it. I wasn't ever sure how i'd react if i got drunk or high, and i didn't feel safe around anyone to ever explore being out of control. Coffee and tea make me extremely jittery, so i was off them too, i was squeaky clean and a proper bore.
Except for my imagination.

I stopped watching any form of scary media at a very young age. At 12 for awhile i got obsessed with ghosts, read too many books and watched too many movies in a row, and felt so terrified that i basically went into catatonic state, sensing ghosts around the house. All my life i've felt everything so much, too much, but i kept it to myself and told myself that really, it's just what being a woman and being alive is like, i'm alive. I didn't want my emotions to be pathologised, it all felt very normal and ordinary to me, reality but in acid neons. I detest the word ""sensitive"", so i called it finetuned senses and hyper-attunement. The smallest things could evoke such visceral emotions in me, snow was a moment in wonderland, a birthday cake four days late from a bored mom tasted like umblical cord, a good book could make me cry for 6 hours. I had highs and lows, waking up in tears, being bubbly in school, singing loud and dancing alone in my room in the afternoon and writing mispronounced song lyrics on the walls, crying at dinnertime, going to bed jittery and deeply scared of invisible ghosts. 

Growing up i was mostly various shades of depressed. I struggled a lot and the lows were very low, but i was determined to handle it myself because all my life i had been told by abusive parents that i'm a danger to myself and others, that i shouldn't ever trust my own judgement or what comes to my mind because it'll inevitably end up hurting me and those i love, and i wanted to prove to myself that i'm trustworthy, i'm capable and in control of myself at all costs. The only reference for mental illness medications i had was a misdiagnosed bipolar mother who either slept for weeks or not at all, red rimmed eyes, hollow smile colored in with red lipstick. I didn't want to be that. I didn't need medication, and i loved my highs so much that they almost made it worth everything. Didn't have too many of them, in fact they happened so rarely that when something interested and intrigued me, i'd lock myself in my room, somewhere completely private, and ride the bliss for hours, and sleep would become optional. I became so fiercely protective of the little joys i felt, and sharing it with others grew more and more difficult as the years went by, because my joy had an easy way into my anger. I couldn't take anybody even slightly souring my sweet time and interrupting my happy moments, or i risked exploding, and i didn't want to hurt people with my anger and outburst, so my happy time came to mean solutide, isolation.
And so did my depression.

after a couple of unfortunate relationships and my father's death, at 27 my health took a turn for worse. I grew extremely lethargic, unmotivated, withdrawn save occasional lightnings of really connecting with a good movie, a tv show or a book that i'd sit and write literary analysis about for 7 hours straight. I started structuring my whole life around what little energy i had, and everything superflous and irrelevant had to go. I developed bouts of prolonged intense nameless anxiety, most often showing up as social anxiety or hypochondria, i was sure something inside me will wake up one night and eat me alive. Meeting up with people, familiar and stranger faces alike became a burden; i felt so goddamn much from the moment i woke up to the moment i went to bed, and on a good ordinary day most people were bland and boring to me, but as i were, each and every instance of boredom i felt in the presence of others amplified into excrutiating frustration, anger and hatred that a part of me knew they absolutely did not deserve to be subjected to. I was so tired of having 60 emotions burning through my body per minute just by getting coffee with a stranger, or making a phone call, i just wanted a rest from feeling emotions. I isolated myself more and more until i was completely lonely. Skipping shower for 8 months, skipping meals, not leaving the house except for doctor appointments because i developed so many gut problems and body pain that nobody could find the source of. the corners of my room and under my bed gathered 2inches of dust, spiders in them that i pretended to not see. I dreaded reading the slightest bit of news, or even watch a movie i'd meant to watch for months. I felt like a burnt circuit connecting to live wire, it didn't matter at all if the current was small or big, joy and pain alike felt like they're smelting my nerves from my veins. I'd give anything to feel nothing at all for a day.

At the start of this year, i lost my one and only friend to a bad fight that i didn't intend, and my GI doctor prescribed a very lightweight SSRI for me. I was extremely wary and hesitent to try it, but i also was desperate and wanted out of my misery by any means imaginable at this point. I started on the pills. Two days of blissful, uninterrupted, unprecedented happiness, and suddenly i sank into the kind of paralysing paranoia i hadn't experienced since i was 12. I couldn't move, i was sure my family members want to hurt me, i was terrified, couldn't sleep, but i still had enough of my brain in the circuit to know that i was probably being irrational and that i desperately needed help. 

over the course of the year i got 12+ prescriptions, and tried 9 different medications. Nothing worked; i'd start an antidepressant, and within the first hour i'd become a walking corpse, void of all emotions, extremely lethargic, apathetic, empty. Losing interest in the few things that brought me joy, sleeping 17 hours a day and eventually devolving by the second day into unbearable despair and desperation, frustration and very dark thoughts, and i'd cut the medication immediately. Everyone was sure it's a hard case of depression, doctors asked me questions likes ""Do you experience weeks of euphoria and intense happiness? Do you feel invincible, do you have illusions of grandiose? Do you have excessive overspending habits, do you plan larger than life ideas that you end up not having energy to carry? Do you engage in promiscuous sex, drugs or excessive alcohol, or other behaviours that put you and your loved ones in danger?"" and i'd be at a loss for an answer. I kept thinking about how my mother's strange overspending was considered an illness to be medicated because of her context, but i'm well off and have good savings so my ludicrous overspending just gets a ""Let her have it, she's depressed and a little retail therapy hurt nobody."" I don't drink or do drugs, i haven't done any dangerous activity that i wasn't in full control of, i haven't done anything that'd hurt other people, all my pain is turned on me. And i'm not a particularly happy person, my happiness is vivid and bright like the rest of my emotions but it's few and far between. Doctors would nod and say that blunted feelings are a common side effect to many medications, they told me to brave it and wait for the true effects of the meds to show. But one thing about me is, i'm very intentional with how i approach everything, i know what i want and what i need, and i'm realistic about my expectations and what i will and will not do. I had a hard no, and it was for the side effect of feeling flat. I can handle almost anything, but take my emotions from me and it's my one way ticket to going off the rails. Very ironic, i know.

I gave the whole ordeal a rest for awhile and tried to manage my anxiety and lethargy on my own and with therapy as i did most of my life, until this month in which i decided to try for medication again. A particular 9th SNRI trial gave me new side effects: oscillating between hours of apathetic passive suicide ideation and unexpected bouts of rage that i had to warn my family against, it'd hit out of nowhere and about completely irrelevant, unrelated things. As per usual, on the second day i stopped the medication, and called a new doctor.
She asked me about the medications i had been taking, their side effects, my family history. I told her that i'm not really a happy person, and she asked me if i feel angry, or anxious. Eventually she prescribed Lithium. I double checked with her, emphasising that many doctors asked me what are supposed to be the symptoms of mania and i don't really have them. Sure, i have my wonderful and exhilarating days, but i don't have any impulsiveness problems, or particularly dangerous behaviors. She told me that she's not passing a diagnosis for now, and that regardless of any diagnosis the definitive next step in my medical journey is mood stabilisers. She told me i might not have ""Bipolar Disorder"", just some ""Bipolar traits"", and assured me that i can immediately get off Lithium if it doesn't work for me. 

It's been a little more than a week of Lithium and an SNRI, and i'm a changed person. This me i hadn't met since i was 17; i have so much energy, it's so easy to get out of bed in the morning, i can do a lot of the things i've been wanting to do for years. I feel like going out, i want to go out, i want to meet new people. I don't feel like i want strangle people this moment with my bare hands, i merely get irritated and annoyed and the feeling goes away when i come back home. My happiness and excitement has dimmed, it's not so bright and sharp anymore, but it's nothing like a deadening headless ghost state. It has simmered down to something more delicate, intricate, more gentle and tender. Inside my head is quiet, calm, my emotions feel less like lava filling the holes in my bone marrow and more like sea waves. My anxiety has greatly subsided and is now a little bit of feeling that accepts a little bit of meditation and goes away until next time. I'm the most content and at peace and grounded i have been in my entire life.

And i can't help but wonder if i would have gotten the help i needed much sooner if i had been a harm more to the people around me, rather than myself. How my illness flew under the radar of so many for so many years because i forced myself to direct all my anger and venom inside and didn't unleash it on other people even as i drastically deteriorated and became highly dependent on family members to look after me.


Thank you so much for reading my journey, and i hope it gets to be of use to someone in some way. If you can afford it and have options available, please don't compromise about medication side effects. Fight for your right to feel as comfortable as possible, you're worth it no matter how your illness makes you feel. And if you have doubts about your diagnosis, keep looking. I have a feeling i know what my definitive diagnosis will be when i revisit my doctor in 3 weeks, and this time i'm ready for it.

TL;DR i told my doctor i'm not fun enough to be bipolar, and she pat me on the back, winked and told me to take the Lithium and meet her in 3 weeks.",3,1769784470.0,bipolar2,3,1.0,False

I didn't want my emotions to be pathologised, it all felt very normal and ordinary to me, reality but in acid neons. I detest the word ""sensitive"", so i called it finetuned senses and hyper-attunement. The smallest things could evoke such visceral emotions in me, snow was a moment in wonderland, a birthday cake four days late from a bored mom tasted like umblical cord, a good book could make me cry for 6 hours. I had highs and lows, waking up in tears, being bubbly in school, singing loud and dancing alone in my room in the afternoon and writing mispronounced song lyrics on the walls, crying at dinnertime, going to bed jittery and deeply scared of invisible ghosts. 

Growing up i was mostly various shades of depressed. I struggled a lot and the lows were very low, but i was determined to handle it myself because all my life i had been told by abusive parents that i'm a danger to myself and others, that i shouldn't ever trust my own judgement or what comes to my mind because it'll inevitably end up hurting me and those i love, and i wanted to prove to myself that i'm trustworthy, i'm capable and in control of myself at all costs. The only reference for mental illness medications i had was a misdiagnosed bipolar mother who either slept for weeks or not at all, red rimmed eyes, hollow smile colored in with red lipstick. I didn't want to be that. I didn't need medication, and i loved my highs so much that they almost made it worth everything. Didn't have too many of them, in fact they happened so rarely that when something interested and intrigued me, i'd lock myself in my room, somewhere completely private, and ride the bliss for hours, and sleep would become optional. I became so fiercely protective of the little joys i felt, and sharing it with others grew more and more difficult as the years went by, because my joy had an easy way into my anger. I couldn't take anybody even slightly souring my sweet time and interrupting my happy moments, or i risked exploding, and i didn't want to hurt people with my anger and outburst, so my happy time came to mean solutide, isolation.
And so did my depression.

after a couple of unfortunate relationships and my father's death, at 27 my health took a turn for worse. I grew extremely lethargic, unmotivated, withdrawn save occasional lightnings of really connecting with a good movie, a tv show or a book that i'd sit and write literary analysis about for 7 hours straight. I started structuring my whole life around what little energy i had, and everything superflous and irrelevant had to go. I developed bouts of prolonged intense nameless anxiety, most often showing up as social anxiety or hypochondria, i was sure something inside me will wake up one night and eat me alive. Meeting up with people, familiar and stranger faces alike became a burden; i felt so goddamn much from the moment i woke up to the moment i went to bed, and on a good ordinary day most people were bland and boring to me, but as i were, each and every instance of boredom i felt in the presence of others amplified into excrutiating frustration, anger and hatred that a part of me knew they absolutely did not deserve to be subjected to. I was so tired of having 60 emotions burning through my body per minute just by getting coffee with a stranger, or making a phone call, i just wanted a rest from feeling emotions. I isolated myself more and more until i was completely lonely. Skipping shower for 8 months, skipping meals, not leaving the house except for doctor appointments because i developed so many gut problems and body pain that nobody could find the source of. the corners of my room and under my bed gathered 2inches of dust, spiders in them that i pretended to not see. I dreaded reading the slightest bit of news, or even watch a movie i'd meant to watch for months. I felt like a burnt circuit connecting to live wire, it didn't matter at all if the current was small or big, joy and pain alike felt like they're smelting my nerves from my veins. I'd give anything to feel nothing at all for a day.

At the start of this year, i lost my one and only friend to a bad fight that i didn't intend, and my GI doctor prescribed a very lightweight SSRI for me. I was extremely wary and hesitent to try it, but i also was desperate and wanted out of my misery by any means imaginable at this point. I started on the pills. Two days of blissful, uninterrupted, unprecedented happiness, and suddenly i sank into the kind of paralysing paranoia i hadn't experienced since i was 12. I couldn't move, i was sure my family members want to hurt me, i was terrified, couldn't sleep, but i still had enough of my brain in the circuit to know that i was probably being irrational and that i desperately needed help. 

over the course of the year i got 12+ prescriptions, and tried 9 different medications. Nothing worked; i'd start an antidepressant, and within the first hour i'd become a walking corpse, void of all emotions, extremely lethargic, apathetic, empty. Losing interest in the few things that brought me joy, sleeping 17 hours a day and eventually devolving by the second day into unbearable despair and desperation, frustration and very dark thoughts, and i'd cut the medication immediately. Everyone was sure it's a hard case of depression, doctors asked me questions likes ""Do you experience weeks of euphoria and intense happiness? Do you feel invincible, do you have illusions of grandiose? Do you have excessive overspending habits, do you plan larger than life ideas that you end up not having energy to carry? Do you engage in promiscuous sex, drugs or excessive alcohol, or other behaviours that put you and your loved ones in danger?"" and i'd be at a loss for an answer. I kept thinking about how my mother's strange overspending was considered an illness to be medicated because of her context, but i'm well off and have good savings so my ludicrous overspending just gets a ""Let her have it, she's depressed and a little retail therapy hurt nobody."" I don't drink or do drugs, i haven't done any dangerous activity that i wasn't in full control of, i haven't done anything that'd hurt other people, all my pain is turned on me. And i'm not a particularly happy person, my happiness is vivid and bright like the rest of my emotions but it's few and far between. Doctors would nod and say that blunted feelings are a common side effect to many medications, they told me to brave it and wait for the true effects of the meds to show. But one thing about me is, i'm very intentional with how i approach everything, i know what i want and what i need, and i'm realistic about my expectations and what i will and will not do. I had a hard no, and it was for the side effect of feeling flat. I can handle almost anything, but take my emotions from me and it's my one way ticket to going off the rails. Very ironic, i know.

I gave the whole ordeal a rest for awhile and tried to manage my anxiety and lethargy on my own and with therapy as i did most of my life, until this month in which i decided to try for medication again. A particular 9th SNRI trial gave me new side effects: oscillating between hours of apathetic passive suicide ideation and unexpected bouts of rage that i had to warn my family against, it'd hit out of nowhere and about completely irrelevant, unrelated things. As per usual, on the second day i stopped the medication, and called a new doctor.
She asked me about the medications i had been taking, their side effects, my family history. I told her that i'm not really a happy person, and she asked me if i feel angry, or anxious. Eventually she prescribed Lithium. I double checked with her, emphasising that many doctors asked me what are supposed to be the symptoms of mania and i don't really have them. Sure, i have my wonderful and exhilarating days, but i don't have any impulsiveness problems, or particularly dangerous behaviors. She told me that she's not passing a diagnosis for now, and that regardless of any diagnosis the definitive next step in my medical journey is mood stabilisers. She told me i might not have ""Bipolar Disorder"", just some ""Bipolar traits"", and assured me that i can immediately get off Lithium if it doesn't work for me. 

It's been a little more than a week of Lithium and an SNRI, and i'm a changed person. This me i hadn't met since i was 17; i have so much energy, it's so easy to get out of bed in the morning, i can do a lot of the things i've been wanting to do for years. I feel like going out, i want to go out, i want to meet new people. I don't feel like i want strangle people this moment with my bare hands, i merely get irritated and annoyed and the feeling goes away when i come back home. My happiness and excitement has dimmed, it's not so bright and sharp anymore, but it's nothing like a deadening headless ghost state. It has simmered down to something more delicate, intricate, more gentle and tender. Inside my head is quiet, calm, my emotions feel less like lava filling the holes in my bone marrow and more like sea waves. My anxiety has greatly subsided and is now a little bit of feeling that accepts a little bit of meditation and goes away until next time. I'm the most content and at peace and grounded i have been in my entire life.

And i can't help but wonder if i would have gotten the help i needed much sooner if i had been a harm more to the people around me, rather than myself. How my illness flew under the radar of so many for so many years because i forced myself to direct all my anger and venom inside and didn't unleash it on other people even as i drastically deteriorated and became highly dependent on family members to look after me.


Thank you so much for reading my journey, and i hope it gets to be of use to someone in some way. If you can afford it and have options available, please don't compromise about medication side effects. Fight for your right to feel as comfortable as possible, you're worth it no matter how your illness makes you feel. And if you have doubts about your diagnosis, keep looking. I have a feeling i know what my definitive diagnosis will be when i revisit my doctor in 3 weeks, and this time i'm ready for it.

TL;DR i told my doctor i'm not fun enough to be bipolar, and she pat me on the back, winked and told me to take the Lithium and meet her in 3 weeks.",2,1769784274.0,BipolarReddit,0,0.75,False
