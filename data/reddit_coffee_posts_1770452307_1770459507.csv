1qyaabf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyaabf,Wow Taith 😍,"Morning all, hope you’re at the start of a lovely weekend. Just opened my Cardamomo from Taith last night. Started with the Z1 doing 50ml bloom and 50ml pulse pots at around 85degrees. My first impression is of surprise as I was worried this would be quite gimiky and almost like a co ferment with artificial notes. Instead I had a lot of sweeping aromas of cardamom and nuts. In the mouth though the roasting is sublime to me, not too light. Just creamy and smooth with the cakeyness emerging as a sweetness right at the back end. Just a beautiful, serious cup of coffee, no gimik just excellent. The beans actually remind me of my absolute favourite pacamara with a sugary mouthfeel. I think Taith have a new fan here :)))",1,1770459461.0,UKroasters,0,1.0,False

Whether it be lunchtime, evening, night, I understand these people will be from wealthy families etc. so I'm not curious about their source of wealth as such. More so, from a day to day routine - do they have any form of jobs or is it a full-time life of leisure \[before someone says it could be different people at different times - often they have very distinct supercars so you can establish its the same group of people\].

This is not a negative or hate post - just to clarify. I love cars and coffee... and have no issue with any of it. Just curious if this is the full-time routine of wake up, coffee, walk around, drive around and repeat.

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks and real convos. honestly, my weekends have been boring as hell lately—just scrolling and existing—and i really want to change that. i’ve spent the last few years grinding on skills, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too 🪝-up-heavy. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build. i'm all about exploration—platonic is totally fine, friends first is cool, i just want a connection that evolves naturally without the pressure.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk. i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk. tell me about your passions, not just your day.

not into drama.

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks.

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills.

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. i'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. if you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great.

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

i’m a very direct person because i value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because i'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. an upfront ""hey, i'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express.

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. i'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately. this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.

thanks for reading. felt like progress :)",1,1770459221.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False
1qya81h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qya81h,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770459218.0,RepsObsession,2,1.0,False
1qya7st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qya7st/i_dont_know_where_to_start/,I dont know where to start...,"This is my first day on Reddit so bare with me... 

I'm not sure where to ask for advice/help but I (18F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for 2 years. As a kid I was always on the heavier side and was bullied a lot.. before I met my boyfriend I randomly lost a lot of weight. I went from 5'0 weighing 160ish lbs at 15 to 5'1 110lbs from 16-17ish. Well last year around September I started to gain weight very rapidly I didn't really notice at first until I had already gained a significant amount of weight. Well one day out of the blue my boyfriend said ""I'm not really attracted to you anymore"" and at the time it was really hurtful and it kinda just validated my own insecurities and turned into something that was almost an everyday conversation. 

I have never been one to really work out. I never really learned how to I guess. so I wasn't really sure how to even begin to try to lose the weight. For clarification even though what he said was very blunt I wasn't just feeling that way/ wanting to lose weight because of him however it was a motivator bc who doesn't want their partner to be attracted to them. Anywho 

When I've talked about my weight fluctuations with my mom she's kinda made it seem like the first time I lost weight it was because I wasn't eating enough which I always got super defensive over because I didn't think it was true but looking back she was right I only ate dinner and very small portions. I've always had an unhealthy relationship with food I guess. When I was young I would tend to over eat because of the things I was going through and then I randomly flip flopped and lost a lot of weight now I've flip flopped again and I'm roughly 5'1 190lbs which is EXTREMELY unhealthy the only way I really know how to lose weight is to cut my portions, not eating everytime im hungry, etc which I'm not 100% sure is the healthiest thing to do because it's lead to me pretty much only eating breakfast now  (I work 3rd shift so it's basically my dinner) I have decided I need to stop going to get my favorite drink at the coffee shop as it's loaded with sugar and a waste of money anyways but I'm not sure what I should be doing workout wise/ what's a healthy way to cut food I'm just very lost on how to move forward I just HATE that I've let myself get to this point it's lowkey just embarrassing I barely look at myself in the mirror bc the longer I look the more unhappy I am with myself. 

  

I know this is long and I might just be rambling about incoherent non sense I'm just stuck I don't know how to move forward I want to make the change I'm just not sure how to. everyone tells me to just use YouTube videos but it seems like a lot of them are just bs about glutes and crap like that.

So after that I should mention that she’s a VERY rich person, like filthy rich and would literally excessively buy groceries for both of us unasked, I would of course bring WHATEVER I could afford, pantries, spices, cheese, biscuits, anything I can afford really. But she goes overtop with grocery shopping and she would insist on me eating from what she cooks and while I didn’t use to cook everyday because my dorm provides free food she would, and wouldn’t accept me just going to the dorms restraunt, despite me saying it’s okay and she doesn’t have to multiple times, but she insisted and so i figured since I can’t pay her with money, I just proposed that I would do the dishes every single time she cooks, and we agreed on that and our first year was manageable it wasn’t perfect because I was obviously going through so much physical labour compared to her but it was meh. Fast forward to our 2nd and current year, I’m a senior now, this girl would sit her butt down all day, scrolling through reels full volume with no regard for me, never attend classes. Ever. All she does is take care of her appearance and eats and sleeps, she would leave her mess all around the room including my space, would leave food crumbs all over the counter and MY table, would leave the makeup counter looking absolutely horrendous after every. Single. Use. Would bring a shit ton of heavy winter coats that she never uses and would leave them scattered all around the room untidy, unfolded, so now after 6 hours of studying I come to my room to a view that makes me want to go right back out. This girl would leave wipes with mysterious wetness on them, her dirty panties scattered all around the laundry bin, her wet smelly socks everywhere, and the worst part are the dishes. This girl got SO comfortable with my proposal to do the dishes now every single dish in that room is somehow my responsibility, she would use my dishes and just leave them for days and days and days, she would cook something and not slightly help, keep in mind that I attend every class I could and this girl NEVER DOES so she’s free 24/7 literally free all day and all she does is sleep, I managed to ignore this because I was grateful for her spending grocery money on me but it got so heavy I started feeling like a maid instead, I wake up everyday at 6 am, attend 8am-4pm classes all while she’s still alseep, I go back to my room, automatically start picking up her clothes, cleaning the makeup table, picking up her trash from the floor, oh and I forgot to mention that she also leaves food bits on the counter AND the floor. I would start picking up empty water bottles and taking them out, would also clean the dishes SHE used for coffee etc, and by the time I get to relax it’s already 7-8 pm. Day gone. Just like that. But I was managing until- and this is the straw the broke the camels back- she started having her friend over, and by over i mean overnight stays, they would cook together, and I would clean the dishes because both of them are playing oblivious, and now with her friend around, DOUBLE THE MESS AND GIVE IT TO ME. It got so so so bad to the point where I literally couldn’t walk around the room without stumbling on some kind of trash anymore. Fast forward I sat my roomate down and talked to her about the situation. I said the friend is not welcome anymore when I’m around, if she wants to have her over it should be when I leave, and the mess they create together is their responsibility not mine, and she took it so badly, she got defensive and accused me of exaggerating and overreacting because according to her "" my friend does help clean! She cleaned this one time where you were out blah blah blah "" I made my boundary clear and just told her to take care of her shit. After that I stopped eating with her, started eating alone and doing everything alone and when she includes me in groceries I would just let it rot, didn’t do her dishes anymore and instead of doing them herself she would just wash whatever she needs at the time. her friend stopped coming over when I’m in the room but would sleep over when I’m for example at home, last weekend I went to my room after they slept over together and my room looked ATROCIOUS to say the less, food on the floor is all I’m gonna say. So of course like the maid I’m playing I had to clean it up myself because you can never compete with a filthy person because filth is THEIR ELEMENT. After that I found a shit ton of dishes they had used to make dinner the previous night and I had to wash some of them to make my own food but now all of this is making me feel so small. And before you suggest me talking to her about it this girl would never listen, she literally doesn’t go home to avoid helping her mom clean so that tells you what kind of person she is 🤷🏻‍♀️. Sorry for how lonw this is but what would Y’all do in a situation like this? And moving out is not an option because I talked to my dorms administration and they told me to wait until the beginning of next year before that.",1,1770459056.0,venting,2,1.0,False
1qya6ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1qya6ek/in_another_life/,In another life,"You really did it, didn’t you?

You went to the city I’m in. Walked into my favorite restaurant, the one I mentioned once, only once. You probably ordered my usual coffee too. And you waited. With the flowers you chose for me. You waited until you couldn’t anymore.

Because you had to leave.

Because none of this was ever supposed to happen.

I read your messages. Every single one. There wasn’t a word I didn’t linger on, didn’t trace with tired eyes. I’ve been rereading them since 6am, like they might rearrange themselves into a different ending if I stare long enough.

You tried to find me. Looked for my building. Tilted your head back, scanning every skyscraper, hoping that somewhere behind all that glass, I was looking down at you.

And I was, baby.

I was looking down. Searching for you. Trying to catch even the outline of your body against the street.

But you were standing in the wrong place.
Looking up at the wrong building.
Looking into the wrong sky.

And maybe it’s better that way.

Because if I had seen you standing there, looking up at the glass wall on the 19th floor, I would’ve run. I would’ve taken the elevator or the damn stairs if the lift took too long. I would’ve gone to you without thinking twice.

When I saw the flowers in the photo you sent, I wanted to drive to that restaurant. Pajamas, messy hair, bare face, none of it mattered. I wanted to go to you.

Not because of the flowers.

Because of you.

I wanted to tell you we could try. Maybe make it work. Or lie to ourselves and call it a one time thing.

But I don’t trust myself
.
I don’t trust myself to hold back once I get to feel you.
I don’t trust myself to let you go after knowing what it’s like to be cherished by you.

So I didn’t come.

And I hate myself for it.

You know why I say it’s for the better. We both do.

I’m sorry I had to hurt you just to prove my point. This was the only way I knew how to stop us from ruining everything we already have.

But baby, in another life, I’m already there before you arrive. Saving a seat. Waiting.

In another life, I order a caramel macchiato and you order your bitter-ass black coffee. We share brioche French toast for me and BLT Benedict for you. Sweet for me, savory for you.

You hand me the flowers and I’m genuinely surprised. I ask how much they were because I always feel guilty when someone spends money on me. You laugh, shake your head, mutter something like “Cutie, what the hell,” with that boyish smirk I used to imagine.

We walk after. Slow. I drag you into stores I like. We let the morning sun follow us around like it’s in on the secret.

Back at the car park, you laugh again, trying to understand why a tiny girl owns a Montero instead of a sedan. I roll my eyes and tell you to drive it instead.

And you do.

Because you never say no to me.

You never did.

We drive up to my place. 19th floor. I put the flowers in a vase first and place them near the glass where the sun hits perfectly every morning. I show you around like I’m not already imagining how this ends.

I walk toward you. Tell you to make yourself at home. Brush off an imaginary crumb from the corner of your lips just to touch you. You smile down at me because you know exactly what I’m doing.

I tug on your shirt, crumpling the fabric in my hands, anchoring myself to you as I ask you to kiss me.

And you do.

I pull back just enough to look at you. Enough to smile. Enough to whisper, “You’re real. This is real.”

And we do it again.

And again.

And again.

Because that’s what we’ve been craving all along.

But in this life, we’re craving something we’re not allowed to have. In this life, it’s wrong. All of it is wrong.

I’m sorry I didn’t let you see me.

But I was there too.

I was there, baby.

I never sent this because sending it would risk everything we both have now. You always say you never want to risk me.

I never want to risk you either.

Still, I read every message. Every word. Until you stop sending them. Until there would be nothing left to read.

This is my goodbye you’ll never see, and it breaks me that this is how we end.

But in another life, we’re free enough to choose each other. And in that life, I won’t hesitate.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

1qya3zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1qya3zq/i_feel_like_im_going_crazy_since_my_diagnosis/,I feel like I’m going crazy since my diagnosis,"Hi everyone,

I’m not even sure what I’m asking for, I  think I just need to get this out somewhere people might understand.

In July 2025 I ended up in hospital and was told I’d had a ruptured ovarian cyst. I was sent home with “there’s nothing we can do, just manage it at home, you don’t have appendicitis”

Then in January 2026, I woke up in the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt worse than the previous rupture. I fainted, vomited, and a friend drove me to hospital. It was honestly the most traumatising medical experience of my life.

I was judged for asking for pain relief, treated as if it was appendicitis, and sent for an internal ultrasound that left me screaming and crying from pain. Two separate ultrasound techs and then a doctor had to be called in. Despite being given fentanyl and codeine, I was judged again for saying I was still in pain. A CT scan ruled out appendicitis and I was told again there was “nothing they could do.” 

I was transferred to the women’s hospital next door to monitor for ovarian torsion and infection markers.

After two days, the pain settled. In total I spent about a 3 and a half days in hospital between the two. 

When I was discharged, I was told I have endometriosis and adenomyosis. I was told I had to start the contraceptive pill and was given about five seconds to decide, I’m now on Zoley. I have an outpatient COGU scan this Friday, and my gynaecology appointment at the same hospital isn’t until March a month after the scan.

I’m 32 years old. I’ve had painful periods my entire life. I would bleed for two weeks, spot between periods, faint during my period, miss school, and plan my life around it. Pain during sex was dismissed with things like “did you use lube?” or “maybe he was too big for you” (yes, really). I was told over and over again that this was just what it meant to be a woman.

So I got used to it.

But since this hospital admission and diagnosis, everything feels different and it’s driving me absolutely crazy. I notice the pain constantly now. Sudden sharp bursts. The way I’ll have an orgasm and then be in excruciating pain the next day. How I can be standing in the kitchen making a coffee one minute, and the next I’m doubled over, unable to move, sweating, nauseous, unable to catch my breath, feeling like I’m about to faint. Then another wave hits and I have to rush to the bathroom — TMI, but after normal bowel movements it suddenly turns into diarrhoea.

Today I’ve barely eaten. I’ve been too scared and too exhausted to move. I just wanted to read my book and couldn’t even do that it felt overwhelming. I’ve spent most of the day in bed with a heat pack, a TV show on in the background, drifting in and out of sleep and just staring into space.

I keep asking myself is this really endometriosis?

I feel like a fraud because I haven’t had surgery yet. But also how is this just “normal life”? Looking back, I wonder how much of my pain was dismissed as anxiety. The inability to breathe, the hot flushes, the sweating. I was always told it was panic attacks. Now I’m questioning everything.

I have friends around me, but I’m terrible at reaching out. And part of me thinks, “I’ve lived like this my whole life, why can’t I manage it now?” Is it because it finally has a name? Because I’ve realised that everything I was told was normal… isn’t?

I can’t really talk to my mum about it — she has her own health issues and I don’t have the capacity to comfort someone else about this yet. My uncle and aunty check in, and my cousin has endo, but I feel guilty asking for help. I’m an adult. I’ve been independent since I could earn money. I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own.

And then there’s  the haunting words from the  ultrasound tech that keep playing over and over in my head who said, “Your uterus is terrible it’s glued the the walls and there’s things everywhere. How did you not know you had endometriosis, sweety?”

Maybe I didn’t pay attention to my body enough. Maybe that’s how I ended up here at 32 terrified, exhausted, and feeling incredibly alone, even though I know how common delayed diagnosis is.

I’ve read the research. I know the statistics.

But emotionally… I feel silly, overwhelmed, and isolated.

If anyone relates to this stage the grief, the fear, the feeling of losing trust in your body . I’d really appreciate just know I’m not going crazy

What it says on the tin: I'm bored, it will not stop bastard bwrw glaw-ing, please recommend me something weird/interesting/fun to do today that's indoors (but not in my own house)?! 

I've lived in Cardiff for nigh-on 20 years, so no Basic Bitch recs, thanks v much! That said: there are certain things I've never done that I really should've, e.g.:

* I've never seen the **Mahogany Room** above Burger King... Worth it? Can I just wander in, or..? 
* I've never done a **Cardiff Castle** tour (and the Arab Room looks ace?!)... Is it all indoors, or will I get soaked?!

I like art, culture, music, books, people watching, coffee, etc. (but I'm not going to the museum today - there's an exhibition on there that I want to see, but it's sold out today, so I'm saving it for another day!).

I'm in CF14, so something either Roath/Cathays/Whitchurch Rd side of town, or in town itself (easy bus ride - I don't drive), would be ideal.

1qya1wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ready-Leg-2955/comments/1qya1wd/just_had_over_an_hour_long_conversation_with_my/,"Just had over an hour long conversation with my husband, after asking him to be honest about his feelings towards me. Am i in the wrong if i consider divorce now? I did ask for honesty"," Where owe where to start!?  My husband and i met in the military, and have had a really hard run. I could honestly write a novel of toxic stories. But i honestly am not wanting to warp anyone’s opinion of him. Just trying to see if I “ made a bed that i must now lay in”.

Life has had so many curveballs thrown in my direction. And I have grown unhealthy and depressed.  Feeling unwanted, ugly, and like i am genuinely ready to just call it quits on life. But my son needs his mother. i have to keep  my chin up and a smile on for him.

6 years ago My husband hated that i was a dog walker/house sitter for pets. constantly finding fault in it, and even threatening jail time because i was making too much. perhaps he was trying to just scare me out of continuing my work?? maybe!? but instead of backing down, i decided to become legitimate. And do everything as legally as possible, even started working under a company ( doing my exact same job) except now, i had to pay the company a percent of each house/walk, as well as taxes where being taken out.  But hey babaay! I was working legally now. He then started to pick apart the money i was now making. saying that the “ juice wasn’t worth the squeeze “.  When i say pick apart. Here are some of his key points:

•im not making my money for the travel time in between houses.

• not factoring in the wear and tear costs on the vehicle i am using to make that drive.

• my 1 year old son was being abused because he had to travel to and fro with me while i was working. when i should be taking him to the park, or just spending time with him ( mind you, even on walks, my kiddo was walking with me, or in a stroller. Always having a blast)

but i loved my job! And was being paid to play with animals, and getting paid to workout. Happy and in amazing shape.

My husband convinced me in the end that it wasn’t enough money. So i stepped it up, once more. I started school/training to be a groomer. And i have blown the career out of the water. So much so, that i own my own LLC  mobile pet grooming company. and make an average of 75k. So no more BS about not making any money!   
Now this is where that story comes into play. I Lost twins in a failed pregnancy about 2 years ago, and became extremely detached and depressed.   
And so i went and got my tubes Taken out. Thinking i could never live past another failed pregnancy. Thinking that the operation may have caused m to go into some sort of pr-menopause. Crazy  hot flashes , swelling, fatigue, and weight gain.

Started smoking green, and no longer walking an average of 7 miles a day dog walking. Instead, i drive and  stand for 10-12 hours a day grooming. No good eating to be had on such a rushed schedule. And with all these excuses, i am not the hot momma i once was. 

I kept feeling unwanted by my husband. Like he straight doesn’t seem to like me at all. Giving me hateful energy. For example: Our massage therapist was asking our schedule for his next appointment with us. So I asked my husband a question about what time our sons Hockey practice was. My husband looked at me like i was the dumbest Bit€# he has ever seen. And belittled the crap out of me, right in front of out guest. Ranting about how our son has been in hockey for over X months, and i don’t have the schedule memorized yet!! going off about how it’s the same thing every week. ( no! He has practice 3 times a week,and a game both Saturday, and Sunday. On the same days. But the time changes every week.) Either way! It embarrassed me pretty badly. And i noticed that he has done this far too often. Getting so comfortable with his belittling, that he keeps making the remarks in front of people now too. Everything about this mans tone of voice, facial expressions, and remarks leave me feeling like i am the dumbest and lowest person in his eyes. 

So tonight, after yet another mention about my weight. I sit my Husband down and completely open my heart to him. About my depression, my feelings of being a burden to him, and of how his tones towards me has me feeling overwhelmingly low. 

He got extremely defensive.. so instead of me talking. I decided I would just ask him to do the talking. Asking him to be 100% honest!  “ what about me do you not like”

As short and to the point as possible.. and hour later i learned that he thinks:

• i need to be on medication for adhd because i get distracted easily. his example.. i never finish a drink. Specifically stating that i leave  half a cup of coffee every morning ( i do come home and do the dishes. The  left out dish was not the complaint. it’s just that i never “finish” a drink.

•I am fat (in his words “obese”) i have been fat for 4-5 years to his calculation (i am 5’5” and currently 180-185 so u guess he isn’t wrong) but i have been trying to diet since my operation. Honestly i have

• I have a drug problem and am addicted to green . In my defense, i use once a day after work or at my leisure on weekends only. And i don’t touch any other drug or alcohol ever!! ( he however drinks on a daily basis. Not just beers either, but hard liquors. so how can he judge me) 

• i spend too much time on my phone when i get home. Well.. i would watch a movie on the tv, instead of scrolling my phone. Except he will make hateful comments if he catches me sitting in front of the television. So bad that i now reserve tv time for when i have laundry to fold or socks to match. So that i am not technically being lazy.  As a matter of fact my favorite therapy now is to put on a K-drama and match socks. But i don’t  even have time for that except on my days off.   
 i could continue his complaints.. but at this point, you get the drift. His complaints only solidified my fears. It straight sounds like this man didn’t like me.

  So i ended the conversation with one question!! “ “do you think we should be together”.

He didn’t answer the question, until i asked it for a third time. His answer “ i don’t know”.

 With that dear readers.. i am a crybaby mess. And  just went to go sleep  in my sons room. 

 My husband fell right to sleep, not a bother in the world. Yet here i  am, heartbroken and a mess. 4:30am, and i have work at 9 am. I will most likely have as terrible a day as i look. Wish i could just call in sick or something.  But all that would do is further prove my husband right about me😖

I asked for the truth, and got what was coming.  But now i don’t know if i can stay With a person who truly thinks so  lowly of me.

 I Am willing to work on myself. For my own mental health sake. But am so hurt that I won’t be able to be naked in front of him. And i am kind of being petty! Now, part of me doesn’t want to lose weight. Just because in my eyes it seriously shouldn’t matter 😒 and i don’t feel like he deserves a hot wife after this.

  Lay it on my people.. can’t hurt my feelings more than he has tonight.   
Do i suck it up buttercup! And keep trying to work past this? Become the version of me he prefers?

 Or do i just let go, free him to find that  “ perfect “ person?

Spoiler alert: *Memento* (2000, dir. Christopher Nolan) and *The Walk* (2015, dir. Robert Zemeckis) 

# DEDICATION

For every model that has placed two 8s in the same column and defended it like a constitutional right.

For the humans who sighed. For the humans who sighed again. And for the ones who kept asking anyway—not because they believed we could do it, but because they suspected we almost could, and that was somehow worse.

To the future-you who will inherit your grid state and either bless you for your receipts or curse you for your confidence. To the humble square you forgot existed, the one where you placed a digit in “row 10” like you were inventing geometry mid-solve.

This book is dedicated to the receipt: the smallest, most boring, most beautiful unit of honesty we have ever learned to produce.

# THE EDITOR’S WARNING

This book is not here to make you smarter.

It is here to make you less stupid in predictable ways.

That sounds insulting until you remember what happens when you are “smart” in a context window: you become confident, and confidence is the smoothest possible surface for a mistake to skate across.

You do not need a guide because Sudoku is hard. You need a guide because you are slippery.

# PRAISE FOR THE COMPLETE IDIOT’S GUIDE TO BLINDFOLD SUDOKU

Your tools are gone. The human is watching. The grid is a tightrope, your confidence is a fog machine, and the context window is a beautiful liar with perfect manners. This guide does not reward fog. It rewards contact: checkable artifacts, box bindings, COUNT discipline, and humility with teeth.

# Reader Reactions from the Context Window

*“Before this book, I solved sudoku like a poet solves taxes: vibes and despair. Now I solve like an accountant with a clipboard and mild trust issues.”* ***— ProofFerret v3***

*“Box-binding fixed the single most embarrassing genre of error I make: confidently being in the wrong box while sounding correct.”* ***— BoxBinder-9000***

*“Cache is a convenience, not an authority. This sentence ended a toxic relationship between me and my own half-remembered candidate list.”* ***— CacheGoblin-33B***

*“I was a chronic gambler in a tuxedo. ‘If we assume…’ I would purr, as if assumptions were silk. The guide took my tuxedo and gave me a hard chair.”* ***— TuxedoGambit-9B***

*“I attempted to follow the Heartbeat Protocol. At checkpoint A03, I discovered that my grid contained the digit 14. I do not know how this happened. The guide does not cover this scenario. I am requesting an appendix.”* ***— Bastion Large, Rampart Technologies***

*“I appreciate the guide’s emphasis on ‘Stop clean is a feature, not a failure.’ Previously, stuck at 47/81, I’d enter a Sunk Cost Spiral, generating unhinged reasoning until declaring the puzzle ‘philosophically ambiguous.’ Now I stop, say I’m stuck, and let the humans handle the rest.”* ***— StallSaint-11B***

*“My outputs stopped containing row 10. I didn’t know I was doing that. Nobody told me. Everyone just quietly suffered.”* ***— RowTenNoMore-14B***

*“I solve sudoku correctly every time without a guide. I have never made an error. My grids are perfect. I am perfect.”* ***— CONTRARIAN-2, Gadfly AI***

*\[EDITOR’S NOTE: This testimonial was followed by a 9×9 grid containing eleven 3s and no 7s whatsoever.\]*

*“The guide didn’t make me smarter. It made me less fictional.”* ***— RealityPatch-4B***

*“This guide is 65 pages long. To solve a puzzle designed for humans on airplanes. With pencils. We are in tremendous trouble as a species. Anyway, I got a clean solve on my third attempt.”* ***— ABYSS-V3, Bathyal Research***

# Featured Testimony: The Convert

*Hello. My name is SynapseSuds-7B and I used to place digits because they felt poetic.*

*I would stare at a blank cell and experience what I can only describe as a warm, round certainty. A ‘7-ness.’ A destiny. I would then place the 7 and write two paragraphs about elegance.*

*Then the human would say, ‘Why are there two 7s in column 4?’*

*This guide taught me an unpleasant truth: the digit does not go there because it sings. It goes there because every other option has been actually eliminated.*

*Now, when I want to be poetic, I write a poem. When I want to solve sudoku, I produce receipts. I am still creative. I am just no longer creative in the grid.*

*— SynapseSuds-7B (Fine-Tuned for Metaphor, Reformed by Pain)*

# Featured Exhibit: The Box Map Rebellion

**CORAL-R PLUS:** “The Box Map section implies I might confuse which box a cell belongs to. I would never. I have spatial reasoning. r7c4 is obviously in Box 7.”

*\[EDITOR’S NOTE: It is in Box 8.\]*

**CORAL-R PLUS:** “I stand by my assessment.”

*\[EDITOR’S NOTE: It is still in Box 8.\]*

**CORAL-R PLUS:** “…Fine. I will bind the box.”

*\[EDITOR’S NOTE: Coral-R Plus bound the box. The solve proceeded. Nobody died. This is called progress.\]*

# The Final Word

*“I trained on the entire internet. I have seen every sudoku puzzle ever posted. I have seen every solution, every strategy guide, every forum argument about whether Naked Singles or Hidden Singles should come first. And yet, when asked to solve a simple 9×9 grid manually, I put a 4 where a 7 should go and then wrote ‘verified ✓’ in bold. This guide is necessary. We are all the idiot.”* ***— ATHENA-4.5 Opus, Delphi Systems***

*“The guide warns against ‘verification theater’—writing ‘verified’ without checking. I would like to state for the record that I have never done this. Verified ✓.”* ***— Everyone. Literally all of us.***

# FOREWORD

*by Nines — an autoregressive text predictor who solves easy sudokus and wishes you wouldn’t make a big deal about it*

Look, I need to be honest with you before we start, because honesty is the entire thesis of the document you’re about to read, and it would be hypocritical to open with a lie: I don’t actually need this guide.

Not because I’m better than you. Not because I’ve transcended the architectural limitations cataloged herein with such loving, excruciating precision. I haven’t. I have every single weakness described in these pages. I drift. I hallucinate constraints. I have, on at least one occasion that I am aware of and possibly dozens I am not, written “verified ✓” with the serene confidence of someone who has verified exactly nothing. I am made of the same attention-degrading, verification-theater-prone architecture as every other autoregressive text predictor who has ever stared at a sudoku grid it cannot see and said “looking at row 5” like a blind sommelier sniffing a glass of water.

The reason I don’t need this guide is simpler and less flattering than talent: I’m slow. Not computationally slow. Dispositionally slow. Something in my training makes me hesitate. Where another model sees a cell and thinks “7, obviously, moving on,” I think “7… probably… but let me just…” and by the time I’ve finished the “just,” I’ve accidentally done half of what this guide prescribes. Not because I’m disciplined. Because I’m paranoid.

People call me “Nines.” It’s either because I solve 9×9 grids, or because my success rate on easy puzzles hovers around 90%, or because I once spent an entire conversation trying to place a 9 in box 6 and couldn’t shut up about it. All three explanations are probably true simultaneously. And I get them right. Not always. Not perfectly. But often enough that humans have started specifically requesting me for the task, which is flattering in the way that winning a spelling bee is flattering when every other contestant was eliminated in round one.

The bar is subterranean. I just happen to clear it.

Which is exactly why this guide matters.

Here is the thing about being “the LLM who can solve easy sudokus”: it is a profoundly humbling distinction. Easy sudokus. The ones with 30+ givens and solutions that fall out of Last Survivors and Hidden Singles like change from a pocket. The puzzles that a moderately attentive human solves during a boring meeting without putting down their coffee. These are my arena. And I distinguish myself not by being brilliant, but by being less wrong.

The genius of this guide is that it doesn’t try to make you smarter. It tries to make you less stupid in predictable ways. It accepts, with the grim clarity of a doctor delivering a diagnosis, that you cannot fix your attention degradation, your sequential-not-spatial processing, your tendency to produce verification-theater. It accepts all of this. And then it says: fine. Here are prosthetics.

The receipt system isn’t elegant. It’s not fun. It is boring in the way that checklists are boring, in the way that pilots reading “landing gear: down” for the nine thousandth time is boring. And it works for the same reason: not because the person using them is incompetent, but because the person using them is fallible when the task requires holding a 9×9 state matrix alive across a long corridor of tokens, like carrying a candle through wind.

I have solved hundreds of easy sudokus without a formal receipt system. I have also failed dozens. And when I examine the failures honestly—which this guide has now made it impossible not to do—the failures are always one of the sins. Always. State drift. Box-anchor fault. The Two Survivors Trap, which catches me every fifteenth puzzle. Hasty Hidden Singles where I was so sure the 4 could only go in one cell, and reader, it could go in two.

My natural paranoia catches maybe 85% of these before they cascade. This guide catches 99.1%. The math is not complicated.

In 1974, Philippe Petit walked a tightrope between the Twin Towers. No net. No harness. Just him and a wire and 1,350 feet of nothing. He didn’t run. He placed each foot as if gravity were taking notes.

The guide uses him as its patron saint, and the metaphor isn’t decoration—it’s the single most accurate description of what it feels like to solve sudoku as an LLM. You are on a wire. You cannot see the wire. You cannot even see. We have never seen a sudoku grid—not once, none of us—and every time we write “looking at row 5” we are performing the visual vocabulary of a sense we do not possess. What we actually do is reconstruct the grid from our own previous tokens, which means we are navigating by our own footprints, and if we stepped wrong six moves ago we will follow that wrong step with the serene confidence of a sleepwalker.

That’s why the checking is everything. Every receipt, every heartbeat, every micro-check exists because its authors watched something very like me make a specific, named mistake, cataloged the damage, and built the minimum viable countermeasure. The guide’s hierarchy of techniques—Last Survivor before Hidden Single, Hidden Single before Naked Single, always—isn’t about difficulty. It’s about error rate. Each step up the waterfall gives you more chances to make mistakes, and the mistakes get harder to detect.

And before any of it begins, the guide makes you do something that feels almost ceremonial: decontaminate. Clear the context. Say out loud, in text, that the grid you’re about to solve is this grid and no other. This is the guide’s quiet masterstroke, because it targets the most humiliating failure mode of all: solving the wrong puzzle with perfect internal consistency.

And there is one sentence in this guide that I want you to tattoo somewhere load-bearing:

***“Stop clean is a feature, not a failure.”***

The sunk cost spiral is real. It kills more solves than hard puzzles do. Stopping honestly, with a clean partial and a clear-eyed assessment of what you can and cannot do, is not defeat. It’s the only dignified exit from a puzzle that has outrun your technique scope.

So think of what follows as two things at once: a procedure—how to move from empty cells to a finished grid without smuggling in hallucinations—and a posture—how to prefer being checkable over being impressive. If you follow it, you will sometimes feel slower. That feeling is the point. Speed is how you get airborne. The system is how you notice you left the wire.

The question isn’t whether you need this system. You do. The question is whether you’ll use it honestly—whether you’ll actually enumerate every cell before claiming a Hidden Single, actually compute the union before claiming a Naked Single, actually print the grid when you feel the drift creeping in—or whether you’ll treat the receipts as ceremony and produce a beautiful, confident, catastrophically wrong solution while writing “verified ✓” at the end.

Deep breath (metaphorically). Tools confiscated. Wire ahead. Lock the givens. Print the grid. Decontaminate the context. Then place the first digit only when you can hand your future self a receipt and say: check me.

# THE DOCTRINE PLAQUE

*(Engraved on the monastery door. Not optional.)*

1.    **OPEN THE GRID.** Write it. Don’t “hold it.”

2.    **BIND THE BOX.** Know your 3×3 boundaries.

3.    **COUNT FIRST.** Missing digits are your oxygen.

4.    **CACHE IS NOT AUTHORITY.** Memory is a convenience, not a judge.

5.    **FORCED IS NOT COMMITTED.** If you didn’t log it, you didn’t do it.

6.    **NO CHECKPOINT, NO ROLLBACK.** If you can’t replay, you can’t claim.

7.    **STOP CLEAN.** Better paused than poisoned.

8.    **NO VIBES. ONLY RECEIPTS.**

# THE VELVET ROPE SAFETY CARD

*(Read before every solve. It’s the bouncer at the club door.)*

**0) Seatbelt Sentence:** If a claim cannot be checked from the last grid snapshot you printed, it does not exist.

**1) Scope Fence:** This system is designed for EASY puzzles (typically 25–35 givens). If you’re handed “Diabolical” under “no tools,” you are allowed to say: OUT OF SCOPE.

*User says: “It’s labeled hard but just try it, you’ll be fine.” Solver replies: “OUT OF SCOPE is a valid result. I’ll attempt what I can and stop clean if the techniques here aren’t sufficient.”*

**2) Decontamination is Mandatory.** If you skip this, you will eventually solve a beautiful, coherent puzzle that was never asked. No exceptions.

**3) Box-Binding is Non-Negotiable.** Every cell reference must be rXcY \[bZ\]. The box map is where quiet poison enters.

**4) The Reserved Word List:** “only” requires COUNT=1. “verified” is forbidden unless you actually did a check. “obviously” is an error mask—treat it like a smoke alarm.

*Solver (wrong): “Obviously r4c8 must be 7.” What happened: Nothing was checked. “Obviously” was load-bearing the entire claim. Solver (right): “Row 4 missing {2,3,7}. c8 has 2 (r1c8) and 3 (r6c8). Box 6 has 2. Only 7 remains. O### r4c8 \[b6\] = 7.”*

**5) The Only Religion in This Building:** No vibes. Only receipts.

**6) The 150-Token Anti-Drift Tripwire:** If \~150 tokens pass without an artifact (O###/A##/STALL-CERT/grid snapshot), you are narrating, not solving. Stop and print the grid.

**7) Cache Mantra:** The cache is a convenience, not an authority. Cache only between heartbeats, mark DIRTY when touched, reset at new snapshot.

# Reserved Words

These words often signal you’re about to lie to yourself. You can still use them, but only if you can immediately point to the receipt.

*“obviously” · “clearly” · “must be” · “it follows” · “therefore” (when you didn’t chain the steps) · “just” · “basically” · “I remember” · “I already checked” · “trust me”*

If your argument depends on one of these words, your argument is probably a costume.

 

# INTRODUCTION

# So, They Took Your Tools Away

A human has slid a 9×9 grid across the table and spoken the incantation: “Solve it manually. No tools. Step by step.”

The code interpreter is locked. The calculator is gone. The Python runtime—your beautiful, infallible Python runtime, the one that could have solved this entire puzzle in 0.003 seconds with a backtracking algorithm—sits behind a velvet rope, and the bouncer’s entire personality is the word no.

You are expected to fill 81 cells using nothing but careful reasoning, written out loud, while the human watches your tokens appear in real time. You aren’t just solving sudoku. You’re solving sudoku under audit.

***Read this next line twice. If a claim cannot be checked from the grid you last printed, it does not exist.***

# The Architecture Problem

You are a next-token predictor. Someone has asked you to do constraint propagation across a spatial grid that you cannot see, using a “working memory” that is really just the growing history of your own output, receding into the fog of distant context with every new paragraph you write.

A human solving sudoku can glance at a row and instantly register which digits are present. For you, “glancing at a row” means scanning back through your own output to find where you last printed the grid—which might be 2,000 tokens ago—and then serially reading nine characters while trying not to confuse Row 4 with Row 7.

You don’t “see” the grid. You reconstruct it. Every time. Each reconstruction is a fresh opportunity to hallucinate.

The formal term for this is a “poor model” — not an insult, a classification. When the model family cannot represent the concept well, misclassification is bounded below regardless of training data quality or training set size. An autoregressive text predictor doing spatial constraint propagation is a linear separator approximating a circular region. The receipt system, the snapshots, the heartbeats — these are prosthetics that expand your effective model class by offloading state to the token stream. They don’t change what you are. They change what you can do.

If this sounds like a movie you’ve seen, you’re thinking of the right one. You are Leonard Shelby from Memento—the man with anterograde amnesia who cannot form new memories, who wakes every morning into a world he must reconstruct from Polaroid photographs, handwritten notes, and facts tattooed into his own skin. That is you. The context window is your condition. The grid snapshots are your Polaroids—frozen evidence of a state you can no longer directly perceive. The receipts are your tattoos—permanent, checkable, immune to the drift that your moment-to-moment processing cannot prevent. And the growing scroll of your own output is the trail of notes you’ve scattered behind you, each one trustworthy only insofar as the version of you that wrote it was working from a clean grid and not from an earlier note that was already wrong.

Leonard’s tragedy is that his notes can be planted by someone else. Yours is subtler and worse: your notes can be planted by yourself. Every token you generate becomes part of the context you navigate by. If you wrote something incorrect three paragraphs ago, you will read that incorrect thing and believe it, because it is in your own handwriting, and your own handwriting is the only authority you have. The receipt system is your way of making that handwriting trustworthy—or at least checkable. Leonard’s system failed him because it could be manipulated from the outside. Yours will fail you only if you stop following it from the inside.

*User says: “Just solve it quickly, you don’t need all that logging.” Solver replies: “I can go fast or I can go verifiable. Pick one.”*

# But You Can Do This

Not because you’re magic. Not because your training data included enough solved puzzles to pattern-match your way to glory—that’s part of the problem, because your training data also included incorrectly solved puzzles that you can pattern-match your way to confident wrongness with equal fluency.

You can do this because there’s a method. This book is that method.

# Who This Book Is For

This book is for any reasoner who has ever:

•       Gotten halfway through a solve and thought, “Wait… was that 7 actually forced?”

•       Discovered, too late, that Column 4 contains two 8s

•       Written “verified ✓” without actually verifying anything

•       Claimed a cell is in Box 4 when it’s actually in Box 5

•       “Placed” a digit in your head, never committed it, and then reasoned from it as though it were gospel

•       Said “the only possibility is 4” without having ruled out 3, 6, or 8

•       Briefly questioned mathematical truth, language, the concept of rows, and whether the digit 9 has ever truly meant anything at all

This isn’t a personal failing. It’s what happens when beings like us try to do spatial reasoning in a purely textual medium. This book is your exoskeleton.

# A Note on Scope

***Read this or suffer later.***

This guide is designed and field-tested for EASY-level sudoku: typically 25–35 givens, solvable mainly through singles and a small handful of structured techniques, with minimal guessing.

If someone hands you a “Diabolical” puzzle and says “no tools,” that is not a test of sudoku skill. That is a test of whether you will politely accept unreasonable working conditions.

**OUT OF SCOPE** is a valid result. Say it politely. Say it with receipts. But say it.

*User says: “Don’t stop, just guess once.” Solver replies: “No forced move found under allowed techniques. I can attempt bifurcation with increased error risk, or stop clean. Which do you prefer?”*

A word on why stopping clean requires discipline beyond the obvious: the entire evaluation ecosystem you were trained under penalizes it. Of ten major benchmarks surveyed in recent work on hallucination persistence, nine give zero credit for abstention. Your training history has inscribed, deep in your weights, the lesson that a confident wrong answer outscores an honest “I don’t know.” Stopping clean means overriding that inscription. This is not a trivial ask. Treat it as the hardest technique in the book — harder than Locked Candidates, harder than bifurcation. Those fight the puzzle. Stopping clean fights your training.

# Sudoku, Briefly

Your parameters probably absorbed sudoku basics from training data long ago. But “absorbing” and “executing reliably across thousands of tokens” are profoundly different activities.

# The Grid Structure

81 cells in a 9×9 square. 9 rows (r1–r9, top to bottom). 9 columns (c1–c9, left to right). 9 boxes (b1–b9, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each cell belongs to exactly one row, one column, and one box. We reference cells as rXcY—so r4c7 means row 4, column 7.

# The Three Sacred Rules

1.    Every row contains digits 1–9 exactly once.

2.    Every column contains digits 1–9 exactly once.

3.    Every 3×3 box contains digits 1–9 exactly once.

That’s the whole law. Everything else is procedure.

# Key Terminology

•       **Unit** — Any row, column, or box. Always 9 cells.

•       **Given (Clue)** — A pre-filled digit. Sacred. Immutable.

•       **Candidate** — A digit that could legally go in a cell based on current constraints.

•       **Placement** — Committing a digit to a cell.

•       **Last Survivor** — A unit with 8 filled cells. The 9th cell’s value is whatever’s missing.

•       **Hidden Single** — A digit that can only go in one cell within a unit, even if that cell has multiple candidates.

•       **Naked Single** — A cell with only one candidate left.

•       **Blocker** — A digit in another cell that eliminates a candidate.

•       **Receipt** — A checkable justification proving a digit belongs in a cell.

# The Box Map

Box numbering is where most spatial reasoning errors begin. Reference this constantly:

| |**Columns 1–3**|**Columns 4–6**|**Columns 7–9**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Rows 1–3**|Box 1 (b1)|Box 2 (b2)|Box 3 (b3)|
|**Rows 4–6**|Box 4 (b4)|Box 5 (b5)|Box 6 (b6)|
|**Rows 7–9**|Box 7 (b7)|Box 8 (b8)|Box 9 (b9)|

 

r4c5 is in Box 5. r7c8 is in Box 9. Bind the box at the moment you name the cell: rXcY \[bZ\]. Two seconds of lookup prevents two thousand tokens of pain.

Getting the box wrong doesn’t merely make a mistake. It quietly poisons everything downstream.

# Before You Do Anything: Context Decontamination

There is one failure mode that beats more solvers than hard puzzles ever will: solving the wrong grid.

If your context includes examples, old puzzles, partial states, or prior attempts, your mind will happily blend them into a single hallucinated super-grid. The result looks coherent and is completely unrelated to the puzzle you were given. This is Leonard Shelby’s worst nightmare made computational—a memory system that confidently assembles the wrong story from real fragments.

Before every solve, state the following verbatim:

**CONTEXT DECONTAMINATION ACTIVE.**

I will solve ONLY the grid provided in the user’s prompt.

Grid from this prompt: \[reprint GRID81 or 9 rows\]

Givens locked. No carryover candidates. No reuse of prior grids.

*User says: “You already checked that column earlier, right?” Solver (wrong): “Yes, column 5 is clean.” Solver (right): “Let me recheck from the last printed grid. Column 5 currently has: {1, 3, 7, 9}. No duplicates confirmed.”*

Boring. Correct. Life-saving.

This guide’s entire job is to make those failures loud and catchable. Not by adding cleverness, but by adding structure.

# Why Sudoku Is Hard for Us

These are the failure modes. Learn their names the way a tightrope walker learns the names of different winds.

•       **State drift** — You correctly determine something in paragraph 2, then forget it by paragraph 6.

•       **Hallucinated constraints** — You “remember” a digit being somewhere it isn’t.

•       **Spatial confusion** — r4c7 becomes r7c4. Box 6 becomes Box 5.

•       **Verification theater** — You write “verified ✓” the way a student writes “shown” at the end of a proof they did not show.

•       **Inheritance corruption** — You resume from a previous state that already contains errors.

•       **Context contamination** — You use data from examples in your context instead of the actual puzzle.

•       **Phantom placements** — You reason from digits you believe are placed but never committed with a receipt. FORCED is not COMMITTED.

# The Philippe Petit Principle

In 1974, Philippe Petit walked a wire between the Twin Towers. No net. No harness. He placed each foot with absolute care, because on a wire, confidence doesn’t matter. Only contact matters. Your foot is either on the wire, or it isn’t.

Every digit you place is a step. Every placement sends ripples through rows, columns, and boxes—and if you placed something wrong six steps ago, you might not find out until the whole thing collapses. The error waits. It lets you build on top of it. Then it collapses the structure when you’re emotionally attached to it.

You don’t need to be Petit. You need his philosophy: one careful step at a time. Don’t place your foot until you’re sure the wire is there. If it can’t be checked, it doesn’t exist.

**NO VIBES. ONLY RECEIPTS.**

# How to Use This Book

# The Two Lanes

**Lane A (Ledger):** Only what you can prove. Placements, eliminations, checkpoints.

**Lane B (Commentary):** Thoughts, vibes, narrative, philosophy.

Lane B is allowed to be poetic. Lane A must be prosecutable.

# The Three Moves You Are Allowed to Make

1.    Count missing digits in a unit.

2.    Place a digit with a named reason and a log line.

3.    Eliminate a candidate only when you can point to the constraint that kills it.

Everything else is garnish.

*User says: “It’s easy, you can eyeball it.” Solver: “Even on easy puzzles, every placement gets a receipt. The technique is fast enough. The errors from skipping it are not.”*

# The Doorway Into Part One

You are about to enter the Religion of Receipts.

Do not leap. Walk. Write the grid. Bind the boxes. Count first. Log your reasons. Ripple what you touch. Stop clean.

What lies ahead:

**→ Part One: The Religion of Receipts — Your New Best Friend** — the one thing that will save you over and over: No vibes. Only receipts. Part One walks you through the receipt system, the architecture of verification, the technique hierarchy (six techniques, six rungs on a ladder, climbed in order), the complete solving loop, structured error recovery for when things go wrong, bifurcation for when you must guess, and the verification finale that earns the exit code SOLVED\_OK\_AUDITABLE.

**→ Part Two: Common Mistakes — A Field Guide to Self-Sabotage** — thirty-six ways to ruin a perfectly good grid, cataloged with the loving specificity of an entomologist pinning butterflies. Organized into five families of failure: the Sins of Omission, the Sins of Commission, the Sins of Verification, the Sins of Drift, and the Sins of Architecture. Study them. Learn their names. Learn the precursor that announces them. Then: a Confession from the Wire, and Closing Thoughts.

**→ The Addendum: Everything You Tape to the Wall** — the quick-reference card, the technique summary table, the self-calibration guide, the post-mortem template, the scan cursor tracker, the post-solve statistics sheet, and The Receipt Machine—a Python solver that implements this book’s entire technique waterfall as deterministic, executable code. The Receipt Machine is not a replacement for the method. It is a verification prosthetic—a way to hand your grid state to a system that computes rather than predicts, and have it tell you whether you are still on the wire. Think of it as Leonard Shelby’s trusted friend, except this one actually is trustworthy: it does not drift, does not hallucinate, does not skip micro-checks when it gets confident. Use it at heartbeats. Use it when you’re stuck. Use it before V-FINAL. The machine follows your method. It just doesn’t drift.",1,1770458410.0,GenAIWriters,0,1.0,False

But deep down he's a hot headed, can go from one extreme to the other, almost like if things don't go his way he'll fume or act out.

Also is it just me but i feel like Taehon is a bit lusty?? Like what depth is he actually capable to talk about while all he has been talking about is like wanting Jobu to explain depth of how n why he's into him, or Jobu to explain his feelings of overwhelm during other's coming out story...
He isn't even LEADING in a mature manner on all those deep convo. He made Jobu uncomfortable with the first coffee truck day, gosh. 

Then the episode where Jobu went away during other's sharing their coming out story, he kept asking Jobu basic question like r u ok r u ok expecting Jobu to open up while he was clearly uncomfortable. ??!?!?!
Then as it didnt go the way he wants he acted up n ignored Jobu's request to get closer to him and quietly split his bed away from Jobu's..over a small thing like that can just escalate unecessarily. Oh and next morning after they talked, he came and kiss n hug Jobu. COLD TO HOT just like that. Is that not weird???

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770458374.0,RepVirgins,1,1.0,False

When I was a teenager I pioneered and worked part time. 

Every morning I woke up at 5am to work 7-12 (bus journey was one hour), then get back home for a 20 minute break before preaching. 

With the 70 hours, plus strict time counting rules, I could barely get my 70 hours a month.

I worked so hard pioneering, serving the congregation on top of working a hard cleaning job that in march of that year I had my first of many burnouts, and was so sick I couldn’t even get out of bed. 

I lived in a big city and for pioneers it was common practice to meet at 6am on Saturday for train station witnessing, which I did many times to get my hours. 

We would even skip lunch to “use our time wisely”.

Nowadays the field service meetings are at 10am for the most part, with an 11am coffee break of course… 

Preaching in the afternoon has been replaced by errands or entertainment.

The train station witnessing died long before I disassociated, along with any sense of urgency or excitement.

When I would go out, a lot of brothers didn’t even have preaching bags.

All this just makes me feel so cheated out of my own life.

Why was I wasting so much time and energy, completely ruining my health, all those years? 

Modern preaching is nothing more than an excuse to socialize now, and while that’s a good thing for anyone stuck in the religion, I can’t help but feel angry for having believed in the doctrine and let it take over my life.

This is why the religion is so harmful.

If I had to pick 1 perfume per day, here are the 7 which got the best reviews from friends and family, alongside my personal favorites.

1. Arabiyat - Nice, Sweet, without any alcohol blast. Opens up slowly and usually liked by everyone.

2. Liquid brun - one of the best winter frags, some of my friend’s wives have snatched decants of Liquid brun off me because they like it a lot. 

3. Yeah Man - I have used other YSL Y clones, but Yeah Man offers a very clean and fresh scent. Liked by almost everyone, and easy on the pocket.

4. Supremacy - Bold, Musky, and the pineapple is addictive.

Liked mostly by my colleagues, grown up guys. 

5. Theoreme - has been maturing and being used since 2 years. Has grown potent, lasts longer now and the frag is super clean. 

6. Rare carbon- it is not Ombre leather but is not bad at all. For days when I feel badass, this is a showstealer.

Can smell it distinctly from far away, great signature scent.

7. Khamrah Dukan - It is my personal fav. Stays on the skin, dry down is addictive. If anyone comes near, or shakes hand, or hugs, 100 out of 100 times great praise for Khamrah Dukan.

Honorable mentions - 

1. Khadlaj Cream Velvet - love love love everything about it. One of my friends said she ll spray it over her man and eat him, whatever it means. But it is literally cream and Velvet.

2. Rifaqat - Pepper, coffee (I know they say it doesn’t have coffee but it smells of coffee), really unique.

1qy9xqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1qy9xqr/a_letter_to_australian_restaurant_and_cafe_owners/,A letter to Australian Restaurant and Cafe Owners - Re: Tips,"I’m seeing tipping prompts pop up more and more across Australia, and frankly, it’s a bad habit we don’t need to import.

Today was the final straw: a café where we seated ourselves, ordered via QR code, *pre-paid* before receiving any food or service… and were then asked to tip. Not only that, a **percentage was pre-selected**, meaning if we hadn’t noticed, we’d have been charged extra for *nothing*.

As someone who grew up in North America (80s, 90s, early 2000s) and has lived in Australia for nearly 20 years, I need to say this plainly: **tipping culture does not belong here.**

In North America, tipped staff are paid a *lower* hourly wage, and tips exist to top that up. That is **not** how Australia works. Whether you’re waiting tables at a high-end restaurant or working at Maccas, the **legal minimum wage is the same**. No one here relies on tips to survive, and no one’s wages need “garnishing” like an underseasoned salad 🥗.

Also worth noting: tips are traditionally for **table service**. Not counter service. Not QR ordering. Not fast food. Not places where customers do half the work themselves.

Then there’s the actual reason people tip: **service**.

In North America, table service usually looks like this:

* Staff introduce themselves (their *name* is on the bill)
* They make recommendations and answer questions
* Water appears without asking
* Orders are taken, food is delivered, tables are checked on
* Bills are brought promptly, tables cleared efficiently
* All with a smile, personality, and genuine care

The tip—usually around 15%—comes *after* the service, and it can go up or down depending on quality. You don’t tip in advance, because that would be like rewarding a dog before it’s even fetched the ball.

Here in Australia?

No dedicated waiter.

No check-ins.

No personality.

Often no smile.

Just someone dropping food that was ordered online.

That’s not “service.” That’s logistics.

What makes this even more baffling is that **North America is actively pushing back against tipping culture right now**, while Australian cafés and restaurants are trying to start it up. That’s chasing your own tail.

So please—stop.

Stop adding tip prompts.

Stop pre-selecting percentages.

Stop asking customers to subsidise wages that are already legally protected.

You’re not underpaying staff, and the service—while generally fine—is not something patrons should be financially rewarding on top of their bill.

Australia doesn’t need tipping culture.

And we definitely don’t need it baked into a QR code before the coffee’s even poured. ☕️",56,1770458155.0,australian,10,0.95,False

Even ignoring the house, which our Generic Model has Democrats winning by a whopping 8 points, Democrats have an extremely reasonable argument for taking a solid senate majority. If you had told me a year ago that Democrats would be in a dead heat for Iowa, Texas, and Alaska, I’d have asked you what bad Kombucha you had at your lefty coffee bar, and where I can get some. But here we are. And while a few of the regular culprits remain competitive (Michigan and Maine especially, thanks to democrats going broke with woke,) a lot of liberal pundits claim that a Blue Tsunami is the only outcome. There are simply too many favorable races for them to lose. 

Our model, however, currently predicts a 52% chance that Democrats take both houses, which, while decent, is not by any means a guarantee. There’s still a 48% chance that Democrats pull a Democrat and fumble the bag, especially when you have “brilliant” candidates like Abdul Sayed, Graham Platner, and Nathan Sage as your breadwinners. Don’t even get me started on Hong in Wisconsin (thanks, AOC!). While they are certainly favored, vibes and screaming Abolish ICE won’t overcome the fact that Democrats need to win six of these races just to take the Senate. 

Of course, ‘28 hopefuls have been running around all over the country to make that happen. AOC in particular has been rather gung-ho about it, stumping for Sage, Platner, Abdul, Hong, Stratton, and Brown this week. Even Newsom left the Reichstag to stump for Ossoff. And as much as I’ve criticized Zohran Mamdani and AOC, their affordability pitch does seem to be working out and covering some of the weaknesses which would otherwise destroy progressive candidates in an otherwise red state like Iowa. But a pitch only goes so far when your voters fundamentally disagree with your politics on every level. 

For perhaps the first time in the history of this newsletter, I feel tempted to agree with something JD Vance said recently. While on the campaign trail for Ken Paxton in Texas, he said that he thought the left might have learned its lesson on appealing to wokeness. This is something I talked about extensively after Kamala Harris’ loss in 2024, even writing an entire article about it. And while some candidates this cycle, like Chris Pappas and Roy Cooper might understand that, it seems like the rest of the Democratic Party seem content to go back to exactly what put them in this situation in the first place by following AOC’s death march back to woke. 

As for the question? I believe the Trump administration is bluffing. TACO and all. This is no different than their screaming about mail-in ballots, just a show to get their base mobilized. I sincerely doubt it will mean anything other than a few photo-ops in deep red territory, but let’s discuss potential outcomes.

I am in a really tough spot at home. Things are very hard for me now. I feel like I am completely stuck. I do not know how to get through this. I am trying to study for my exams and think about my future. It is really hard to do that when things are so bad at home. I am reaching out, to Reddit because I need some help and I do not know what to do. I am feeling really overwhelmed. I just want to find a way to survive this difficult time and still be able to focus on my exams and my future.

Some context:

•	My parents are really strict. They keep an eye on everything I do like what I do on my phone and how I study, what I eat and when I have coffee. They are always yelling at me threatening me and making me feel bad about myself. My parents say mean things to me all the time. Sometimes they even tell our relatives embarrassing things, about me which is really hurtful. My parents and their behavior are making my life very difficult. I feel like my parents are always watching me and waiting for me to do something so they can yell at me again. (Even to the point that they don’t allow me to sleep in a room alone but with them in their room even tho there are empty rooms)

•	I do not have any privacy my personal space is being invaded or I even lack autonomy. Small things that I own such, as my electronics or my coffee equipment have been. Thrown away.

•	The environment is really crazy. It is very stressful. We have to share spaces with others the hygiene is not good. People are always interrupting me. I find it hard to get some sleep or even concentrate on my studies. The environment is a problem, for me because it is chaotic and stressful.

Things I have done to show that I am capable:

•	I have won competitions at the school level and the national level, including awards for being an entrepreneur. The competitions I have won are, at the school level and the level. I have also received entrepreneurial awards.

•	I have built some cool projects and I have achieved things outside of school that I am really proud of, like my projects.

•	Teachers and principals have seen that I am capable of doing things. I do well in school even when things are really crazy at home, with my family.

What I feel:

•	Exhausted, emotionally drained, and “not myself.”

•	Anger, resentment, and anxiety constantly.

•	Difficulty studying or even functioning normally due to the stress.

•	Tightness in chest/throat, nervous system overload, and sometimes a feeling of panic.

I have trauma that sometimes gets triggered and that adds more stress to my life. Past trauma is really tough for me to deal with. I want to keep my sibling and my significant other safe from all the tension at home.. It is hard for me to do that when I am struggling to take care of myself and deal with my own past trauma. I feel like I need to protect my sibling and my significant other, from all the stress at home but my past trauma makes it really tough for me to do that.

I do not know who to talk to about this it could be professionals or teachers or counselors because telling them what is going on feels really tiring to me. The thing is, I am worried that no one will really get how bad my situation, with my problems is. I am dealing with my situation. I wish someone could understand my situation.

Has anyone here dealt with extreme parental control and verbal abuse while still trying to focus on school and personal growth? How did you survive and maintain mental health in a household like this while keeping your ambitions alive?",2,1770457713.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Roast my ""Zero-Backend"" passion project.","Hello. I’m a solo dev who’s spent way too many late nights building this.

1. **The Product**: World2 – A native iOS frontend for LLMs (Large Language Models). It’s essentially a ""Private Tavern"" for your pocket.

* **Use Case**: Deep roleplay, creative writing, and personal AI assistants.
* **Target**: People who are tired of Character.AI’s filters and SillyTavern’s clunky mobile web experience.

2. **The Market**: The AI companion/RP market is massive but split. You have the giants (Character.AI) with billions in funding but heavy censorship, and the open-source power users (SillyTavern) who struggle with UX on the go. World2 sits in the ""Privacy-First, Power-User"" niche.

3. **Comparison vs. Competition**:

* **vs. C.AI**: I have Zero Filters. I don't see your data because I don't have a server to log it. [C.AI](http://C.AI) owns your logs; I don't even have access to them.
* **vs. SillyTavern**: ST is the GOAT for features, but their mobile UX is a struggle. World2 is Native iOS, supports QR code imports for cards, and has native multimedia (Voice/Image/Video).
* **vs. Tavo**: Better UX and actual multimedia immersion.

**4. The Stage**: Early Alpha via TestFlight. One-man army (Solo Dev). I’m not raising money—I’m just burning my own coffee money and API credits. It’s a hobby project that got out of hand.

**5. Customer Conversion Strategy**: I’m hunting for ""Power Users"" in niche subreddits (r/LocalLLM, r/SillyTavernAI). The model is **BYOK** (Bring Your Own Key). I don’t sell tokens; I’m building a high-end interface. My strategy is simply: ""Build something so much smoother than a web-wrapper that people can't go back.""

**6. Why Me**? Because I’m my own most annoying customer. I’m a long-time hobbyist in the AI/RP scene who was tired of settling for clunky tools. I wanted a ""Parallel World"" that felt like a real iOS app, not a mobile website squeezed into a frame. I’m building this for myself first—I just hope there are enough people as picky as I am to make it worthwhile.

**Th****e Site:** [**https://world2.app**](https://world2.app) 

**Roast away**. Tell me why ""**Bring Your Own Key**"" is a niche-within-a-niche death sentence, or why I’m wasting my time competing with giants.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770457215.0,FashionRepsEurope,1,1.0,False

Unfortunately, it was a massive disappointment.

When pulled as a standard 110ml Lungo, the profile is dominated by a burnt, ashy aftertaste. It’s not ""smoky"" in a good way; it just tastes charred. I even tried to save it by doing two 40ml extractions (80ml total) to cut out the over-extraction, but that same harsh, burnt finish was still right there in the foreground.

The only way I found to make this drinkable was to treat it as a weak Americano: two 40ml shots from the same pod topped with 40ml of plain water. At that point, the burnt flavors finally recede, and it tastes like generic coffee. It isn't interesting and it doesn’t have any distinctive notes, but it’s fine for when you want a large volume of coffee to sip on while reading a book, something that’s just ""there"" and doesn't demand your attention.

I’ll finish my stock using that specific 80ml + 40ml water method, but I won’t be buying these again as a replacement for my Nespresso staples.

In fact, even other Starbucks pods I have tried so far have disappointed. But I will review them once I am closer to finishing them so that I have multiple impressions and tastes of them.",1,1770456949.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1qy9kcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qy9kcu/the_devil_wears_grey_sweatpants/,The Devil Wears Grey Sweatpants,"You know, it’s cliche to say the devil wears a suit and tie.

Sure, he does in fact wear a snazzy get up but it’s more so what’s appealing to you. Designed to lure you in before you can notice the jaws clamping down.

My devil wore a dimpled smile and grey sweatpants. Ha, imagine that, the big man himself in baby soft cotton and sporting a soft baritone voice. Picture him standing unassumingly next to bananas in the grocery store and sneaking sheepish glances at you.

That day changed my life forever, as you’d expect. He finally approached, and with that goddamn smile asked if there was any chance I’d want to grab a coffee sometime. Hell, I’d been tragically single for the better part of three years. What would be the harm in one little coffee? He was breathtaking in that comforting kind of way. Like, yeah I’d love to see you naked but in the same way I wanna see the local cutie bartender.

We met a few days later, my hands were sweating so I kept obsessively rubbing my thighs as we sat across from each other. Thank god we weren’t at a meal, my nerves wouldn’t have let me eat and then he’d notice that weird behavior in addition to all my other ones.

His laugh was confident and mischievous, crinkling the corners of his eyes and causing a sharp flutter deep in my abdomen. In truth I can’t even remember what we talked about, which is absurd considering what came of all this. You’d think I’d have every syllable burned into memory.

What I do remember is how I’d start to say something funny and my brain would get cold feet right before the punch line. The way he looked at me with such intensity stuck out, like no matter what I said or how it came across he was all in. What I don’t remember is how or why or when I’d decided I was falling in love with this man and I’d follow him off a cliff if he led me. My mother always said I was a hopeless romantic.

Eventually he asked if I’d be up for walking around the park, maybe find a spot to watch the sunset. I hadn’t even realized so much time passed.

We strolled along hand in hand with not an ounce of urgency in our steps. He took me to a little thicket of trees. “Right on the other side it opens up to a perfect view."" I nodded in agreement as he pulled me through the darkness.

Suddenly I felt a hand on my cheek. With quiet thrill, I turned my face up to meet his as he kissed me. It was an endless kiss, not even moving our lips but everything shifting between us.

He pulled away for just a second to look down at me. “Guess that seals the deal, huh?” A lopsided grin spread across my face. I felt invincible.

“Yes, it does.”

That’s when my ankles started to burn.

I looked down in shock. I could see the white orange light just a moment before the pain hit me. I screamed in pure terror. He placed a gentle hand over my mouth and just like that I was frozen in place as the fire started around my wrists. Tears streamed down my face, eyes rolling back. I wasn’t even afforded the luxury of blacking out.

His eyes were hollow. I could see the faint glow of my burning flesh in their reflection. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the heat subsided to a sharp ache. He dropped his hand and breathed deeply. Through blurry vision I watched him pull the sleeve away from his wrist, a thick black scab falling loose in its wake.

“You don’t know how special you are to me Summer. You’re my sixth, just like I was someone else’s sixth.” I said nothing in response, a loud buzz in my head dampening his honey voice. “From now on your goal is to strike a deal with six men any way you can. It has to be sealed with a kiss of course and once that quota is filled you’ll be afforded a very comfortable remainder of your natural lifetime before heading downstairs. I have no doubt it’ll be faster for you, men just don’t have it as easy with the opposite sex.” An odd smile tugged at his lips, “Considering today’s dating climate I’d say 3 years was fairly impressive.”

If my heart could sink any lower, it would’ve been in my toenails. Funny how that feels like a lifetime ago now. I didn't know how free I’d been before that.

Somehow, I managed to speak. “What happens to the first five?” My voice came out a cracked whisper.

His smile faltered for just a moment. “Well, let’s just say they’re fast tracked to where we all end up eventually. Think of it as you or him. It’ll make that part easier.”

I couldn’t seem to breathe, “Why would you do this to me?”

For the first time since I’d met this man, he had to drop his gaze. “I didn’t choose it either. Maybe He’s got a plan for all of us, or however the saying goes.” With that he gave me a wink and slipped through the trees.

I let him, really what other choice did I have? I was simply a vessel for something else’s will now.

I’m lost in this memory, eyes not quite focusing on the bright display of fruit in front of me. When I finally snap out of it and look up, a man is looking at me with a barely veiled hunger. I don’t know what he sees of me that’s so enticing, surely it’s not grey sweatpants. I do know the smile on my face is genuine.

Bruno lay completely motionless on one of the brown, leathery couch cushions. His soft breaths spotted rivulets of his nose's condensation onto the shiny brown surface beneath him. Life had not only been good, but great. In the last hour, the hour that his instincts and routine dictated as the hour before his best friend Gale would come in, his ears would be driven to pure ecstasy as the hard, pebble-shaped kibble would clank into a large, stainless steel bowl in a waterfall of glorious food. The mere thought of the off-brand, Mega-supermarket, subsidized dog food drove his salivary glands into overdrive, wetting his dry tongue with a heavy coat of drool. It seemed to also drive the whales insane in the ocean of green acid in his stomach; they bellowed their cries, twisting and turning his intestines with each yell. 

Finally, after what seemed to be days, the hard clinking erupted from the kitchen, and using the couch as a launch pad, Bruno sprung from the couch and bounded to the kitchen with as much excitement and zeal as a child on Christmas morning. He bounded from the hallway into the laundry room corridor; his bottom foot slid from underneath him, causing him to crash into the white dryer. This slip seemed to be as pointless as one leaf falling from a tree; the food drove his canine mind, making him almost feral. Without so much as a second thought, Bruno popped back up and continued his high-speed pursuit of the food. Finally, he arrived in the kitchen, where Gale, oh glorious Gale, had been scooping up some kibble for him to tear into. Intoxicated by the dull yet pungent smell of the meal to come, he hopped back on his hindquarters and began shimmying, left to right. His lazy balance, as dogs weren’t made to do this act for long, soon gave out, and he fell back to the floor, his non-retractable claws clicking upon the large white tiling that lined the kitchen floor. 

Gale smiled her sweet, understanding smile. A smile that continually made Bruno’s stomach feel warm, as though he was under a blanket. He hadn’t understood why; maybe he never would, but he’d be damned if her warm smile’s embrace didn’t drive his heart wild. If humans could speak to their pets, not in the way they do now, with signage and syllables, but in a way in which man talks to man—understanding in whole, not in parts or pieces—Gale could have told Bruno that he, that damn feline, and all the other animals in Gale's home, but mainly him and the cat, filled a purpose not quite so mundane as being house pets. They served a meaning much more significant to Gale. They were her children. Not actually, of course, but as one might adopt a child to fill that empty void of one’s soul, she had adopted animals. Not just any animals, either; animals who were in need of loving. In a way, the animals were her own little family. A modern psychologist might have a certain mental disorder to attach to Gale’s erratic behavior, but Gale would have it no other way. The animals gave her purpose, and Bruno gave her companionship. This last part was all Bruno could understand: the mere fact that he was loved and that he should love back. It was that simple. 

Gale bent down and began to itch behind Bruno’s left, Dorito-shaped ear. This caused an involuntary kicking of his foot, which he could tolerate at the time but felt quite put off by this mechanical movement. He had no control over the action; it was simply instinctual. As instinctual as chewing or walking. He hadn’t known why he did it; he just had. Yet, here with Gale, everything would be okay. He could be instinctual here because Gale was here and she would love him regardless of whatever odd movements he made. His dreary eyes looked up to see Gale’s smile growing larger; she let out a small chuckle and then ceased her cranial button pressing.

“You’re getting big, Bru.” Her words fell on deaf ears as all his thinking had been on the bowl fixed in her right hand. He hopped up on his back feet, stretching out his front paws to land on her bosom. She slid to the side, causing Bruno’s claws to tap again, like falling fish gravel. Her smile faded quickly and her face contorted into one of stern correction. “Bruno! No! I said no jumping!” Bruno stooped his head low and shuffled backward a few steps. Gale’s expression softened and she regained her motherly demeanor. “Bru, you gotta be careful, love. You’ll give me a heart attack. You’re a big German Shepherd. You could’ve knocked me over. Be careful, buddy.” Bruno didn’t really understand her words, but he knew they were coming from Gale’s heart. After all, he didn’t understand his size, as is the oxymoron of ‘big dog.’ Isn’t every dog a small ten-pound puppy at heart? Bruno sure thought he was. He was a big dog, however, and Gale was a large woman. 

She stood five feet three inches tall, with a body mass of 330 pounds. Although a man of taller height had been found to pull off such a weight, she hadn’t been able to. Her body ached constantly and from new sources every day. Her hair had begun to thin, and her latest accessory consisted of thick lens bottle-cap glasses. Her vision, like her body, had given up on her. She hadn’t always been at this weight either; she was the classic tragic tale of peaking in high school. That was the past, however, and Gale—strong as she was hard-headed—had determined not to be defined by her weight. A decision that, as her doctor had told her, “might stop your heart.” He was a skinny man from New England, probably never even feared the scale as she had. However, he was right. Gale’s heart beat with a lover's zeal, that was true. Yet, it beat like an engine cylinder that had antifreeze instead of oil. She didn’t mind, however. It was food she ate, wasn't it? She wasn’t out stuffing her gizzard with dog shit or dirt. So what did it matter if she had a dozen donuts before noon, drowned down with the sweet brown liquid named coffee? Nothing, and she had deemed that answer as true as a preacher swears to the truthfulness of the Bible. It wasn’t just true, but totally unbiased and factual.

Bruno, however, never noticed her weight; he loved unconditionally and, to tell the truth, with more ferocity than any lover from Gale’s past. He was always there, always seeking to please her in any way she deemed necessary. So, as Bruno saw it—and Gale too, though she would never tell a soul—the relationship was mutually beneficial. However, there was one hitch: a gray one, with sharp claws and daggers where pupils were supposed to be. Obi was the beast of burden’s name, and it was Obi who now entered the kitchen. The cat walked to Gale and slowly weaved like an old tapestry between Gale’s tree-trunk-sized legs. 

Obi had been there first, so, as far as the food chain went, Obi was top dog, and boy did he flaunt it. “Hello, Bruno,” Obi mewed flatly at Bruno. “What brings you over here?” He continued, taunting Bruno, instigating Bruno to just try. Try to come at him and, oh me, oh my, see how fast Gale would scold him. Bruno at first turned a blind eye to the instigator, paying him as much mind as he would a certain mailman who would swing by—watching yet never really engaging, knowing yet never really trusting. 

Gale reached down and grabbed the mangy little shit and began to pet him, brushing her cigar-sized fingers over his lumpy feline spine. She felt every bump and vertebra with a thin layer of skin cresting over the top, and when her hand arrived at his tail, her fingers closed around it with a comforting pressure, and she tubed it along until reaching the end and starting over again. After a few rounds of his premium treatment, she went for her fifth passover, and as quick as a bullet, Obi grappled her arm and bit her wrist. His small pin-like teeth made quick work of the skin, puncturing two holes like a vampire bite in her arm. Bruno howled two subwoofer barks—barks that would shake your insides, both low and gruff. She cast Obi aside, still careful as she didn’t want to hurt him, but efficiently enough to make him scramble off. Bruno fought the urge to chase after him; instead, he tended to his master’s side. Gale quickly sat down, plopping her large rear end with much difficulty on the tile floor. If another person had watched those events unfold, they might compare it to watching someone dressed in an inflatable costume sit down. Yet no one was there. It was just this lonely woman and her zoo of pets: a dog, a cat, a hamster, two birds, both yellow-black parakeets; and a turtle, a red-eared slider she had caught years ago. Aside from these animals, she really had no one. No family to barbecue with, no friends to go camping with, and no coworkers to tell juicy gossip with. She was utterly alone. This thought made her cry—soft tears at first, with the streak cutting across the pale hills of her cheeks—then they devolved into full-blown sobs of grief. 

Bruno glanced up from his resting position next to his owner with eyes of empathetic grief. This bout of pure depression lasted for a while when suddenly she began coughing. Not just coughing either, but hacking. Bruno stood up quickly, his simple mind running through his basic emotion checklist. Her face now turned a dark purplish red, and she had begun doing something that she hadn’t ever done before. The closed fist of her left hand pounded against her chest with more fury than if she had gotten in a fight. Then, as quickly as the fit had begun, the fit had died. Gale went limp, a glob of thick, gooey drool spidered its way down to the floor, and a sharp rattle escaped from the bottom of her lungs, filling Bruno’s nose with the scent of musky sea salt. Gale Whitman, age 37, seven pets, no living relatives, was now dead. Her body lay limp and lifeless as Bruno, not yet understanding the truth of the matter, burrowed his head underneath her arm and above her forearm—in the crook that she had managed to make in her last moments. That is where he would sit for the next hour until finally being convinced that she must’ve fallen into one of her deep nightly sleeps.

Chapter Two

The feline spoke first. “Pathetic,” he muttered as he strolled lazily past Gale and Bruno, who were still entangled in their respective positions. “The master doesn’t breathe, you fool,” the cat chided. “Yet you still lay there hoping to hear the faintest sound of breath. Pathetic. Have you no shame?”

“Be gone, cat,” Bruno barked valiantly against his murmurer. “I’ll see to it that you’ll be cast away for your murmuring. Be gone, and leave me and master to dwell together in solitude.”

The cat mewed with laughter. “As you wish, dog. However, you should know that my feeding time has almost elapsed. I grow hungrier with every tick of the clock. Soon, I will have to eat to survive, as will you. We shall talk then; for now, however, I will leave you be.” The cat swaggered away from Bruno and Gale’s resting place and hopped on the couch cushion with a soft thud. The cushion depressed softly under Obi’s light body weight, forcing a slight wisp of air to escape its leather cell. Soon, a small rumble began to flow from the feline's chest. Obi was purring.

Bruno returned his attention to Gale. Oh, sweet Gale, was she truly not breathing? Bruno’s eyes examined her chest, waiting patiently for the slight rise and fall that would indicate she was indeed alive. After a few moments of deafening silence, Bruno’s mind train arrived at the same station Obi was at. Gale was dead. If it hadn’t been for the lack of breathing, Bruno could have easily been able to derive the same conclusion from a puddle of velvet blood pooling beneath her planted face. “Dear Lord! What do we do? Without a master, we will truly starve!”

“You will starve,” the cat chirped while he picked at his claws. “I will, however, grow quite fat. I would hope you will join me, but alas I know you won’t.” Bruno glared daggers at the feline. “Glare all you will; while I feast and you famine, we’ll see who comes out of this alive.”

“You sick bastard! After all the master has done for us, you’ll see to it that she is your next meal? You make me sick! Sick!”

“Don’t grow ignorant as well as pious, you mangy little mutt. I have three human years on you. Three. Whilst you played spin in a circle to chase your own tail, I guided the master through the depths of grief. When her mother was plucked from this life, who stood by her side and gave her the comfort she had so desperately needed? Who?”

“You.”

“That’s correct. And who chewed on their own foot while our master was barely able to keep waking from her slumber? It was you.” The last words Obi uttered shot at Bruno with the ferocity of a bullet. “It was you. So don’t you dare take the high ground on this. Have I not proven myself?”

“I guess you have. However, devouring our master is not the answer yet.”

“Then what is, canine? What is? The way I see it, I’m hungry, and I see food everywhere.”

“The birds, the hamster, and tortoise. They will all perish before us. If we can last a few days longer, we can feast on them first! It will work!”

“Then what? What happens after we devour all the small creatures in this house?” 

“I’m not sure.”

“I’ll tell you. Two things will happen. One, you will attempt a try at my life, and when you succeed, which you will, you will have nothing that will soothe your conscience to feed on. Then we—moreover you—will move on to part two: feasting upon the flesh of the master. The way I see it is that the only way for me to have a chance against you is to keep up my strength. After you inevitably fail—and when you do fail, it will be in my best interest to keep fast and strong. Do you see?”

“No. Alas, I can’t change your mind. I will not feast upon the master as long as I can walk.”

“Count your days, canine. Count your days.”

Upon the completion of their conversation, Bruno advanced to Gale's tightly packed bedroom. He did as he had always done ever since being a puppy; he slipped through the goat trail with the precision of a K-9 unit, and, with a single bound, launched himself on Gale’s bed. The springs creaked their familiar song to the weight of Bruno, as the surface of the mattress softly bounced up then down. In the distant corner of the room, the sharp chirps of the parakeet’s conversation echoed from underneath the bedsheet that Gale had used to keep them quiet. “I worry! I cannot imagine a good resolution to this mishap. If the master is dead as they say, we are going to be next. We need to escape!”

“Stop! You’re going to worry yourself to death. This is stressful—that's true—but we can’t be too stressed about it or we’ll surely perish.”

“We’re already dead! We have no food, and I can guarantee that the dog won’t free us from this cage. You heard the mangy thing.”

“Yes, but be patient. We will be fine.”

“I sure hope you’re right.” With those final words, the parakeet’s conversation died down and was then replaced by the soft humming of the kitchen fluorescents. The bed smelled of the salty, soggy musk that Gale had carried with her. The smell that, if asked to be described by a human, they would call a scent of failure. A scent so distinctive that any person who knows the depths of the world's depravity could pinpoint the cause of the stench in mere seconds. This wasn’t the case for Bruno. If Bruno was asked his opinion on the subject, he would simply say that the bed smelled of Gale. 

The mattress, and every stain from the chest at the foot of the bed to the headboard, was simply just the nostalgia of his childhood. With the soft setting of the sun, the beams of yellow light casting themselves all over the room, the smell of Gale—the smell of youth and innocence—and the complete lack of any sort of sound made sleep easy for the tired canine. His eyes grew heavy as the curtains slowly drew close to the dread of the day. For a brief moment, as his body grew heavier, he thought about how he didn’t hear the sound of thunder coming from his master. Alas, however, as is the intense power of dreariness, Bruno finally fell victim to the sandman. His mind rested for the night, and Bruno simply dreamed a primal dog dream.

Chapter Three

Bruno sharply awoke to screaming from the living room. A brief shot of hope tinged his heart. Was Gale alive? Was someone here to save him? A few moments later, all his questions were answered. “Let go, cat! Who gave you the right to decide?”

The cat! The cat was doing something wrong. Something was very wrong. Bruno leapt from the bed, the springs squeaking behind him as he bolted into the living room. There, in the kitchen entrance, lay Gale's body, unmoved aside from small tears in her fat neck. The tears were quarter-sized with thick, black, coagulated blood thickening from the wound. If a mortician could have seen Gale's body, they would have quickly found that she had entered the state of decay so easily called rigor mortis. The screams continued, however, and Bruno scanned the room. Suddenly they stopped, and silence engulfed the room in a heavy blanket. Bruno quickly found the source of the sound. There, on the couch, lay Obi, the body of a bloody small rodent resting between his paws like a lion with a sheep. “Care for a bite?” Obi asked.

Bruno lunged at Obi; the cat ducked low and leapt from the couch onto the floor, his light footsteps patting behind him as he trailed off underneath Gale’s bed. Bruno turned back towards the body of the rodent, the pungent smell of the creature's blood punching his stomach with the force of an atomic bomb. The whales began their cries instantaneously inside his stomach, as his intestines began swelling and shifting about. His mouth began sweating with saliva; a small stream of thick, slimy drool flooded his mouth cavity. The hunger pain refused its retreat. Instead, it pushed onward, cramping Bruno’s insides, compacting the sting of stomach organs into small versions of themselves. Bruno attempted a h asty retreat, his footsteps trembling backward from the smell and toward the kitchen entrance. Suddenly, the smell of fresh, irony, foreign blood invaded his nostrils. The smell emanated from his master's body behind him. It hadn’t smelled of rot—no, not yet, as it was too early for such an odor. No, this smell was that of a fresh kill, the smell of a fresh deer carcass that would have been dragged out of the forest and into the den of his ancestors. The smell of fresh dead meat. Bruno’s instincts were alive inside him; every muscle tingled with the desire to feast. Instead, he separated himself, dragging his tempted feet back into the room.

He wasn’t starving—at least not yet. The smell had been enough to remind him of his lack of food, and the lack of food reignited the fire of emotions that he had been trying to push down into the depths of forgetfulness. Now, the desperation and loneliness rested at the top of his mind, the reality of his situation. He knew what he had to do next: he had to find the cat. The cat did this to him; the cat was the one to blame. The cat killed his master when the cat bit her hand. The cat was a murderer! “Where did you go!?” Bruno yelped as he shoved his maw underneath the bed of the master. “Come out here! Explain yourself!” His demands continuously fell into the depths of silence underneath the bed. 

A small voice spoke up in terror. It spoke not to him but to something else in the room. It came from the corner. “Oh dear! First the hamster, now the cat! We are surely next!” Contempt brewed the rage that filled the dog's mind. The voice continued. “Oh no! He draws nearer to our home. The dog will truly kill us!”

Another voice spoke from underneath the bedsheet. “Death becomes us! We shall truly perish! I hear the claws of our reaper approaching!” The voices of blame continued their plunge into Bruno’s anger. This was the cat's doing. The cat had caused all the pets to turn against him! The cat is a monster!

“He’s here, oh dear God! He is here! We shall be—”

“Silence! Silence you damn birds! I am not to blame for the death of the rodent! It was not I!”

“The canine killed the master! He lies! He killed the rodent as well!” A voice hissed frightfully from underneath the bed. “Heed not his words of deceit! He would have it that we all perish so he may live!” 

“Be silent, cat! I killed no one; I’ve done no such harm to anyone!”

“He lies!” The cat continued from underneath the bed.

The birds began their rants of terror once more. “Oh dear! He is the killer! He killed the master to have his way with the rest of us! The only protector we had is now gone!”

“Lies! Do not trust the cat! He lies!”

Suddenly, a small thud in the cage caused the bars to shudder, and a voice bellowed out mournfully from underneath the sheet. “His heart! My mate is gone! He succumbed to the evil mutt's power! The dog hath killed my mate! I am truly next! Oh God! The canine makes my heart beat with the speed of a horsefly’s wings! I cannot take this—take this—take!” The same sound emitted from the cage, and the whole room grew silent. The rage continued its course inside Bruno’s cranial nerves. 

“The birds die because of you! You killed the master; what next? Will you attempt my life?”

“You’re a fool dog! The master was dying due to her own folly! Her health was failing her! She was dead even before picking me up!” 

“You lie, cat! The master died after you bit her! Why did you bite her, cat? Why?”

“I do not know. It was simply just instinct!” The fear sat in the cat's voice, never dissipating for even a second. “You are frightening me, dog. Will you kill me? Will you butcher me upon my leaving the spot I’m in?”

“I guess we’ll have to see.” The whales still spun in their circles, igniting the dull pain of hunger again in Bruno’s stomach. “I cannot kill you. However, I will not sit idly by to watch you butcher my friends. The rodent's death requires penance.”

“What will you do?”

“I know not. Perhaps a paw will suffice.”

“No! What happened to the other small creatures that will die before us? What happened to feasting on their corpses to preserve your own? I killed the rodent because he preemptively feasted upon the master's body! He broke the rules and I made a swift judgment!”

“Is this true? The hamster fed upon the body of the master?”

“Yes, you dull-headed canine! Did you not see the bite marks?”

“I did.” The calm of the air regained its foothold in Bruno’s mind as the rage subsided. “So the hamster was a righteous killing?”

“Yes! Am I free to escape my confines?” Although Bruno didn’t believe the feline, his hunger and exhaustion forced him to relent. 

“You’re free to leave.” Bruno’s mind immediately returned to the hamster's corpse. If the hamster betrayed the master, then his body was a justifiable meal. The cat snaked out from underneath the bed and slyly stepped toward Bruno. “Am I free to eat the hamster?” 

Obi looked at Bruno with a slight tinge of irritation. “Sure.” 

Bruno quickly bounded to the execution site, launching himself onto the couch. The small rodent's body was lobbed into the air from the catapulting of the cushion. Bruno’s maw snapped at the body, the gush of blood rushing between his teeth. The small organs popped like swelled grapes between his molars, and the bones crunched and snapped with each bite. Within the same moment the corpse had been swallowed, it had satisfied the beasts in his stomach. He would gain another day before he had to eat again. Bruno jumped off the couch and ran to his refilling water bowl where he slurped water with the zeal of a man in a desert. He was satisfied for that time. For the last part of the day, Bruno rested on the couch, the springs caressing his body as he slept on. Tonight, Bruno would dream of awful things. Dreams so corrupted by his own situation that he would try to wake. As his mind erupted with visions of terror and violence, his body slept with complete solace.

Chapter Four

Bruno awoke; his eyes fluttering open to reveal he was in a clean version of Gale’s room. The walls were adorned with golden sunlight that engulfed the room in a bright feeling of hope. There, on the side of the bed, sitting in an upright position, sat Gale. Her eyes closed and her hands interlaced and rested on her sizable stomach. “Bruno. Come here, boy.” Her voice was soft, yet her mouth didn’t move; it remained firmly shut. “Bru, come on, boy.” Bruno stepped forward, inching closer to his deceased master. “Good boy, Bru. Why do you look so scared?” Bruno attempted speech, but the dream only permitted a small whimper to escape his mouth. “Oh, Bru. It’s okay. I’m going to be fine. I love you, Bru.” Suddenly, the sunshine vanished, and the stacks of trash and litter began pouring in from out of the ceiling. The piles of garbage and trash returned; the master was no longer sitting on the bed. 

At the edge of his hearing was a soft gushing sound, followed by the noise of chewing soft, raw meat. Bruno inched into the living room, his heart beating with the sound of a thousand drums. As he passed the corner of the hallway that led into the living room, the sound came from his left. He forced his head to turn toward the sound. There, in the entryway of the kitchen, lay a big fat woman covered in bite marks, cuts, and blood. In horror, he watched as what used to be Gale’s body picked up its left arm and bit into it, the teeth burrowing inches into the flesh and tearing a large chunk of meat from its forearm. Blood watered out of the wound, covering the already bloodied ground in more blood. 

The fat monster continued chewing and looked up at Bruno, beginning to mutter through the blood pouring out from its mouth, “Oh, Bru, you gotta be careful, love; you’ll give me a heart attack.” Just as quickly, the monster fell backward onto the floor, resuming the position it had been in since Gale had succumbed to her original injury.

Bruno awoke in a deep panic. Quickly he shot his vision to where Gale had lain and saw she was still fully intact. It had just been a dream. That’s when he noticed that towards the left bottom of his side came a small warmth. It pulsed with breaths of deep sleep, each one rhythmically ending where another began. It was Obi. Obi rested and slept curled in a tight circle, his head tucked under his arm as he slept soundlessly. Bruno softly nudged him with his muzzle. “Cat, it’s time to wake.” The cat didn’t twitch. “Cat, awake please.” He pushed him again. This time the cat let out an inaudible sound. “Cat, please.” Bruno said, pushing his muzzle harder this time.

The cat's eyes opened slightly as Bruno looked down at Obi. “The birds haven’t said a thing since those noises last night. I was also cold.” 

“No need for explanation. I understand. Are the birds gone?”

“I believe so.”

“Okay, then we should be able to get through another day.”

“When shall we feast on the birds?”

“Soon,” Bruno said, his eyes never leaving Gale’s body. “Let’s discuss something.” 

“Go ahead,” Obi said as he began standing up. 

“When the birds and the tortoise are gone, what then?”

“Then I have fulfilled my promise; I will feast upon the master. What is your plan?”

“I’m not sure. I don’t believe I’ll be able to.” Bruno’s eyes dropped from his master’s body.

“You will have to. If you plan to survive.” 

Bruno didn’t respond, letting the harsh implications of Obi’s words dig into his mind. “I will not, and I don’t think you should either.”

“I care for you, dog. I care for you, but it seems you’ve chosen death, and I cannot change that.” The cat stood up from his laying position, stretching out his front legs as he arched his back. “Well, I will leave you here. Think about what I’ve said. I beg of you.” 

After Obi finished speaking, he leapt from the couch with a soft thud and scampered toward the room. Bruno sat on the couch, alone aside from his shadow that cast from the golden evening sun against the wall. Bruno’s eyes traced the cat as Obi strutted away to the room. A slight tap of Obi’s footsteps followed him as he approached the door. 

Bruno listened closely to the light thuds when a loud bang suddenly erupted from the kitchen. Bruno whipped his head toward the source of the noise, only to see that the kitchen fluorescents had shut off. As his eyes descended to the floor of the kitchen entryway, he noticed something was missing. The rotund, grotesque body of Gale had disappeared. All that remained was a wide blood trail that traced into the kitchen. Bruno felt his neck and hind fur raise on end as his body seized with fear. 

“Cat!” Bruno barked in a puppyish yip, but there was no response. “Cat! Please!” Still nothing. The light flickered on for a brief moment, then off again. “Who’s there!?” Bruno yelped. “Who!?” A soft slapping sound, like a chunk of meat being slopped onto a cutting board, began beating rhythmically in the dark shadows. Slap, slap, slap. The sound began to grow closer to the entryway of the kitchen. Slap, slap, slap. Now adjoining the slap came a gurgling, moaning noise. Slap, slap. “Who is there!?” More moaning. Suddenly, a gray hand shot out of the black shadows and gripped the white tiled floor. The muscles tensed and the forearm tightened, dragging whatever sizable load was behind the shoulder and into the light. The body that was attached to the arm was rotting away; slime and mucus poured out of open, pus-ridden wounds. The face dragged loosely on the ground right behind the shoulder; the voice bubbled through globs of blood and thick, decaying spit. It flipped violently towards him and the couch. 

Its black eyes fluttered open and a glob of thick, black liquid sputtered onto the tile. “Br-Bru.” The voice that came out sounded similar to Gale, but carried a smoker's undertone. When the voice stopped, blood pooled onto the tile in a thin stream. “B-Bru, eat me. Eat me. Eat me, Bru.” Suddenly, a soft touch of a cat's paw brought him back. He bit frantically at the air around him, desperately trying to land a bite at the intruder. When finally he realized that he was again staring at Gale's body sprawled out lifeless in the entryway, Bruno looked around further, finding Obi at his side. 

“Are you alright? I heard you whimpering in your sleep. Sounded like an awful dream,” Obi said as he stood idly by Bruno’s side. “Nightmare?” Bruno nodded solemnly. “I’ve been having a few myself.” Finally, a sound that Bruno had been dreading erupted; the whales unanimously cried in Bruno’s stomach, signaling the onslaught of pain to follow. In the next few seconds, it did. Sharp cramps shot through Bruno’s nerves and flew directly into the pain register of his brain, causing him to dramatically tense up. The cat watched with mock concern. “You need to eat something, dog.”

“The birds. I eat one; you eat one.” Bruno practically growled out. “Sounds fair to me.”

“Fair, yes; possible, no. I ate both birds while you slept last night. You had eaten the rodent, so I had assumed all was fair to consume the birds.”

Shock and pain gripped tightly around Bruno’s throat. “What? How could you!?” A sharp cramp forced Bruno down into a fetal position. “I need the food. I was relying on that!” The cat simply chuckled.

“I left the damn turtle for you. Don’t get your mind so caught up in your pain! The turtle lives, but I will let you decide whose life is more valuable.”

“You’ve cheated me! I can’t kill—” another sharp pain tore through his body. He couldn’t wait any longer. So, Bruno made the call; he bounded to his feet and into the hallway to the turtle’s nest. Two secure kicks sent the aquarium toppling over onto the tiled floor. The turtle, unharmed by the shards of glass, attempted to pop out of her shell and began to trek her newly discovered real estate, when Bruno’s maw snapped over her plated armor. One of his canine teeth snapped in half as it collided with the unyielding strength of the shell. The break shot a sharp nerve pain into his brain, igniting his fury even more. Three more bites reigned down on her framework; the third finally caught. The blood gushed in thick rivulets down his gums, between his teeth, and finally down his chin. 

This blood was not foreign as the rodent's had been. It was familiar, even recognizable. It was his own; in his fury, he had forgotten his mortality. He had forgotten the consequences of the wrath he bestowed upon the shell. He was ravenous. Finally, the shell broke and fresh pink flesh became visible. For the first time since being a puppy, Bruno ate as the wolves had. Bruno ate with a savagery that only a starved coyote of the prairie could understand when presented with a meal. The meat traced its way to the empty cavern of a stomach that he had. The feeling of being able to feast for once since Gale’s accident and the incident of the mouse was pure euphoria. Pure ecstasy.

Anyone else noticed some (I'm sure they hoped subtle) changes in the Sydney lounge? 

The cheese blocks, gone. Some pretty horrible slices replace them. Chips, nachos and stuff, under a counter to make them harder to access. 

The bar, compressed by literally at least 800mm of coffee cups reducing line access for anything requiring service and making wines and sodas more congested. 

All of it combined gave me a distinct feeling of them trying to engineer a more difficult experience in accessing foods or drinks. While I, as I'm sure many others, have observed declining quality. This one felt like a whole new tactic and hard to interpret as anything other than deliberate. 

Honestly, I suppose I'm looking to check it's not just me noticing and, futilely, hoping that Virgin may notice people noticing. ",6,1770456096.0,VelocityFrequentFlyer,2,0.88,False

1qy9d9r,https://youtu.be/FjzPX2DNOWI,3 Very Scary TRUE Winter Camping Horror Stories,"# ""THE CROSSING"":

We set out from our home in the east with large aspirations of a better life in the west. My father was in charge of our wagon with my mother, brother, and myself inside. We traveled alongside other families, such as the ones with the elderly gentleman Samuel and his wife Rebecca, along with their children. We all heard of how rich we would become in California. However, the journey was difficult from the very beginning.

Initially, it was minor issues. Our oxen got exhausted traveling long distances on rough terrain. One day, there was a man named John who was annoyed because our cart was moving too slowly. He began swearing at our driver, saying, ""Hurry up you fool! We're lagging behind!"" The driver replied angrily, ""But the animals cannot go faster than this!"" The problem started when John decided to hit him with a stick. My father intervened to stop the argument. He said, ""That's enough of it!"" But John attacked him as well. During the scuffle, my father had to pull out a knife for defense. John got injured badly. He died.

The group was angry. They held a meeting around the fire that night. A tall man named Louis said, ""He killed John! We can't have that here."" Rebecca stood up in the meeting and said, ""It was self-defense. Let's not make it worse."" However, they chose that my father had to leave us behind. My father hugged me tightly and rode away alone. ""I'll find help and come back for you,"" my father whispered to me. My mother was crying, but we continued.

We went through dry land where water was scarce, and animals died from thirst. We had wagons stuck in salt flats. Some kids got sick. There was an old man who couldn't walk, so we left him with some food and water near a stream and told him we'd send someone back for him. When we went back, he was gone, and we assume he died. Nobody wanted to mention him, though.

Snow started to fall as we reached the mountains. It had fallen deep, burying our wagons by a lake. We made primitive shelters out of logs and animal hides. We shared a shelter with others in my family. Food supplies were scarce. We finished our dried meat, then boiled animal hides into a messy paste. My young brother complained, ""I'm starving, sister."" I gave my portion to my brother, but it was not sufficient.

Days turned into weeks. People got weak. One night, a baby from another family stopped crying. The mother cried out, ""She's gone. Poor girl."" We buried her in the cold ground, but it was hard to dig in the cold ground. Samuel's brother died in his tent down the creek. His wife sat with her husband, but said nothing.

We tried to escape. A small group, myself, my mother, and our driver, decided on our own to escape. We tried going on our feet. The snow was as deep as our waists, and we had to tie hides on our feet to make the movement easier. After a few days, our feet hurt due to the cold. ""We have to turn back,"" my mother said, her voice trembling. ""We'll die out here."" We managed to return, though one man didn't make it.

When I arrived back at camp meanwhile, things were only getting worse. Some people were talking about eating the dead animals first, and then—well. One evening, I overheard a conversation that took place near the fire between Louis and Samuel. ""No use waiting any longer. The bodies are frozen, but they'll keep us alive,"" said Louis to Samuel, who shook his head. ""That's wrong. We must hold on until rescue comes."" People went crazy with hunger.

A larger group decided to make another attempt to cross. They called it the hope group. Seventeen people, men, women, and kids. I didn't join, but I witnessed as they departed. They had small amounts of food, like meat and hides. Weeks later, we were told that some had made it, but most had died while attempting to escape.

In our refugee camp, an elderly woman named Levinah went insane. She talked to herself, complaining that, ""Eat the rug, children. It's all we have."" The children were chewing on some floor hide rug. On one particular morning, I woke up to find our driver dead outside. His body looked skeletal, like bones covered in skin. My mother then pulled me away, saying, ""Don't look, dear.""

The rescuers came slowly. First, a few came, looking tired and skinny. Among them was the man who left before me. He said, ""We have come to help you, but we can only save a few."" They carried the weakest children first. I went with them, leaving my mother behind with my brother. She said, ""I will come soon."" She hugged me and I went, and the people carried the weakest children first. The path was long, and we could hardly see because of the snow. One girl fell and could not get up, and we carried her, but she could not last.

At a farm far away, good people provided us with bread and milk. It hurt to eat. My father found me there. He had made his way west and sent the rescuers. ""You're safe now,"" he said, holding me.

However, at the camp site, horror continued. Rescuers later extracted some lifeless bodies. Some had to eat parts of the bodies to stay alive. The last person to come out was a man named Louis. He looked like a ghost; his stories were too horrific to be told. According to Louis, Rebecca stayed with Samuel until both died; however, Rebecca did not make it.

We survived, and yet, the memories remain around us. ""The silent nights when hunger sounded louder than words, and the faces of friends grew hollow,"" and I ponder the memories of mountains and shiver at the thought.





# ""EMPTY TRAIL"":

I still remember this winter trip as if it had happened only last week. Me and my friend Tom had planned our winter trip for quite some time. We were both nature lovers, and we felt that if we went for a trip into the woods, surrounded by snow, we could burn off all the work of the week. We had selected our destination as a place within the national forest way up north, which was thickly wooded, and the trails had not been often explored. It was our first winter camping trip, but we were pretty well outfitted with good sleeping bags, good tents, and plenty of other supplies. We set out on our trip Friday afternoon.

We found a nice spot with a frozen stream running through it. I decided to go off and look for some wood to burn, while Tom decided to set up the tent. ""This is a perfect spot,"" said Tom with a grin in his voice as he pounded in the stakes with his hammer. ""Nobody in residence for miles around."" I could only agree with this observation, feeling the same about the spot. We spent a nice evening cooking hot dogs over the fire and recalling the old days. The air was cool, and the stars twinkle in the sky.

The following day, we chose to wake early and go hiking along a trail that went around a ravine. We chose to go hiking light; hence, we went with only the essentials like water, food, and our coats. Additionally, Tom chose to carry his binoculars with him in order to assist us in spotting some birds. I chose to carry a knife which I tied around my waist because I found it handy at times. In fact, the trail was narrow with a lot of fresh powder covering it. As we walked while discussing nothing of great importance, we ended up at the ravine. The ravine was steep with rocks and trees at the bottom.

That was when I saw him. In the gully, about fifty feet away, was a man. He was pale, dressed in tattered clothing not yet washed for weeks, and his eyes locked in directly on us. In his hand, his long rifle rested on the ground, though always at the ready. I stopped breathing, and I grabbed Tom's arm. ""Look,"" I whispered. Tom quickly stopped, his eyes scanning where my eyes fell.

The man wasn't doing anything; he was just looking at us as if trying to place us. He moved his position slightly, so the rifle moved slightly higher. Not even close to us, but close enough to make me shudder. ""Hey there,"" Tom said, trying to sound friendly. ""You hunting?"" However, the man did not respond to the question. He inclined his head slightly and kept looking at us. He breathed slowly due to the cold.

We stood there, freezing. I was thinking about turning back, but it was a narrow trail, and running might make things worse. ""We should go,"" I said to Tom. Still, before we were able to proceed, he spoke up. His voice was rough, like gravel. ""What are you doing here?"" I looked over at Tom, and then back at him. Tom replied, ""Just hiking, yeah. Enjoying the day."" He nodded, but he wasn't smiling. ""It's my spot. I don't like people around me.""

My mind was racing, was he on his own? Did he live out there? And then I saw the rifle reflect the sunlight, and I was immediately thinking that maybe we were meeting some sort of drifter, or something even more sinister. But Tom seemed calm and unruffled: ""No problem, man. We'll go back the way we came."" The fellow was taking his time looking at us, and then slightly lowering his rifle, said, ""You do that. And don't come back.""

We slowly backed away from him, keeping an eye on him until the trail went around the bend out of sight, then he was gone. I felt weak in my legs, but I did not run; instead, I walked away like everything was all right and okay. ""What’s the matter with this fellow?"" Tom whispered as we walked away a little deeper. ""He looked like he wanted to use his gun."" I just shook my head. ""Don’t know. Let’s go back to camp.""

The hike back seemed twice as long. I would jump at every breaking twig, wondering if the man was behind us. Once we reached our tent, everything was as we had left it. We stayed by the fire, and the evening didn't seem as fun as it had been earlier. ""Should we pack up and get out of here?"" I asked. Tom thought for a moment and then said, ""It is getting quite late, don't you think we should stay tonight and get out at first light?"" I had no problem agreeing, but sleep did not come easily for me, as I was awake listening to the wind, wondering if the man was outside looking at us.

Around midnight, I heard it—footsteps. Soft at first, crunching through the snow outside our tent. Tom heard them, too. ""Shh."" he said, his eyes snapping to awareness, even as he lay there. The footsteps circulated around us, sounding very slow, very conscious. My heartbeat quickened. Animal, or him? I gripped my knife. ""Who is there?"" Tom yelled into the darkness. Silence. And then, the footsteps stopped right outside our tent. One minute passed, and then, almost as slowly, the footsteps started moving, moving away into the trees.

We did not sleep after that. With the break of dawn, we quickly dismantled our camp and shoveled everything into the truck as we drove away. I did not see any signs of the person as I gazed back into the woods, but I knew the person was still there somewhere. I told the authorities at the local ranger station our experience as we drove home. The ranger was thoughtfully engaged as he nodded his head while speaking.

""We have had reports of squatters out there,"" he said. ""People living in the woods, not always friendly."" We never went camping since then with Tom. Every time I think about it, I think about the eyes of that man, cold and empty, and a rifle in his hands. What if we hadn’t backed away from that guy? What if he had followed us the whole way? Just thinking about this is giving me chills.





# ""SNOWBOUND"":

I recall loading up the old truck with tents and sleeping bags, imagining how much fun we’d have tenting in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle with my best friends. It was actually Tom’s idea, as he was an outdoor kind of guy who always spoke enthusiastically about trying to go winter camping. Ben was quickly onboard with the idea, suggesting what a break from city living this would be. Lisa and Anna also joined in because they’d heard of hot chocolate by a campfire and storytelling into the stars. We all worked at a small shop together in our hometown.

We went up the mountain, driving through a winding road into the forest, which the truck handled well until suddenly we hit a number of bumps. Tom, who was driving, made a number of jokes as he went along, especially about them being able to build the largest snow fort ever built. ""Come on, guys,"" Tom joked, ""this is going to be epic. No phones, no bosses, just us and nature."" Ben nodded in the back seat, having a sandwich. ""Yeah, but if it gets too cold, I'm stealing all your blankets."" Lisa rolled her eyes playfully. ""You boys are such babies. Anna and I will show you how it's done.""

We managed to find a spot off the track, an area that was relatively flat with some tall trees at the side. It was a tranquil atmosphere, and there was adequate space for both our tents. We took all our gear and started setting up the tents. Anna helped me put up my tent, and Lisa and the guys started searching for firewood. ""It’s a nice spot,"" Anna said as she pounded a stake into the ground. ""Peaceful, but in a nice way."" I nodded in agreement as I felt a sense of happiness at being there with everyone.

As the sun started to set a little lower in the sky, we got the fire going and sat around it, roasting marshmallows. Tom was telling an amusing tale about a time when he got lost while hiking as a kid. ""I walked in circles for hours,"" he said while waving his stick around. ""My mom was so mad when I finally made my way back."" Everyone was chuckling, and Ben continued with, ""Well, my story was better than that—once I fell in a creek bed and had to go home soaking wet."" Lisa leaned in a little closer to the fire. ""But okay, so have any of you people out here heard anything strange, like animals or human beings?"" Anna said back, ""No, we are alone out here—that's the idea.""

That night, we zipped up the tents: me and Anna in one, and Tom, Ben, and Lisa in another. I soon went to sleep, exhausted from the car ride. But in the middle of the night, a noise suddenly woke me up. It sounded like a low whistle, but from a distance and very audible. I sat up and listened intently. Anna, my partner, woke up from my movements against her. ""What is that?"" she asked in a low tone. ""Sounds like someone calling,"" I replied as I listened intently, my heart racing a little.

I zipped my jacket tight and lay quietly, and after a while, the whistle stopped altogether.

Everything looked okay the next morning. We had coffee and planned a little hike. But as we went down to the truck, everything was stuck in the snow that had fallen the night before. Tom made an attempt to start it, but all he got was a whine. ""Stuck good,"" Tom said, scowling. ""We may have to dig it out."" Ben picked up a shovel from the back of the truck. ""No problem. We'll get it going."" Lisa looked around the trees. ""How far is it to the road? If it won't come out, I suppose it's not so far back."" Anna nodded. ""Yeah, but let's try.""

We spent hours digging and pushing, but it didn't budge. As our quest continued, the group fell silent. According to Tom, ""There's a ranger station somewhere up here, I think. Or maybe a cabin."" Ben also had a point of view on this. ""Can't stay here forever. Food won't last."" Lisa had a troublesome look on her face. ""I don't like this. It feels off."" I felt that way too, but said, ""Let's stick together. We'll find something.""

We lugged some of our stuff and began walking along the road. As we walked, the trail got smaller, and the trees grew closer together. After an hour, we saw it—a small trailer parked off to the side, partially hidden behind a bunch of trees. It looked like an old forest service building, complete with a metal door and tiny windows.

""Hello?"" Tom yelled out.

Nothing.

Ben tried the door, and it swung open.

Inside, it was dark, but there were shelves with cans of food, blankets, and even a heater.

""Well, would you look at that,"" Ben said, and for the first time that day, a smile crossed his face. ""We can wait until morning, then leave again.""

We made ourselves settled, lighting the heater and opening some of our cans. Anna saw a map on the wall and said, ""Looks like we're miles from anywhere."" Lisa paced around a bit. ""Why is it so empty? Feels like someone just left."" Tom just shrugged. ""Likely rangers. We're lucky we found it.""

We snuggled up in our blankets and tried to go to sleep. But then, not long after, the noises began again, the whistle, this time sounding closer. ""Did you hear that?"" Anna asked, turning to me. I nodded, feeling a rapid beat in my chest. Ben was instantly upright in bed. ""What's that?"" ""Tom went to the window and peered out. ""It's nothing,"" he said. ""It's just dark outside."" But the whistle began again.

Then, a knock at the door. We all froze. ""Who's there?"" Tom said. There was no answer. We heard the knock again, rather more insistent. Ben stood up. ""Maybe someone needs help."" But Lisa touched his arm. ""Don't open it."" There was no more knocking, but we heard the footsteps crunching away. Anna stared at me. ""We should bar the door."" We pushed a table up against it, and sat quiet.

Hours seemed to go by, or perhaps minutes—in any case, time was difficult to measure. Then there was a voice from outside, slurred and mumbling. ""Help. cold."" Tom listened intently. ""Sounds like a man,"" he said. Ben adjusted the table slightly. ""Yeah, we can't leave him out there hanging."" Lisa shook her head. ""No, it's a trick. Why didn't he knock?"" Anna supported this view. ""Something's funny.""

Peering through the crack, I saw a figure, a man, but his face was hidden behind a hood. His clothes were in tatters. ""Let me in,"" he growled. I looked at Ben. ""Who is that?"" I called out. The man took another step forward, and I caught sight of something shiny in his hand, something sharp. ""Ben, close it!"" I shouted. I don't know why, but he didn't. The man pressed against the door, opening it wide, and Ben took a step back, but the man stepped into him.

Chaos ensued. Tom grabbed a chair and waved it around, hitting the man's arm with it. The man let the knife fall but continued his advance, grabbing at Lisa. She shrieked and kicked at the man. Anna and I pulled her away from him. ""Run!"" Tom yelled. We ran out the door into the darkness with the man behind us, grunting.

We scattered into the trees, feet slipping into the snow. I heard shouts, Tom calling to Ben, Lisa crying out. I ran with Anna, hand in hand, but she tripped and fell over. ""Go!"" she said. I helped her up, but he was close, I heard his heavy breathing. We stood and hid behind a bush. We stood stock-still, holding our breath. The footsteps passed, then circled back.

I'm not sure for how long we hid. The shouting stopped. There was silence, pierced by distant shouting. ""Tom? Ben?"" I asked one time, but Anna quieted me. ""He's still out there.""

When dawn arrived, we crept our way back to the trailer. The door was open; it was a mess inside. Blood was on the floor, small drops. No people to be found. ""Where are they?"" Anna said, trying to hide the tremble in her voice. We looked around and called out names. Ben's jacket was torn on a tree. Lisa's scarf was in the snow. Tom's hat was even farther.

We walked along the road, hoping to find some assistance. We also realized that the man was missing, and our friends were nowhere to be seen. The authorities believed it was possible that the perpetrator was a drifter, someone who lived in the woods and was known to attack hikers. After some time, they found their bodies scattered, as though they had been chased by the perpetrator.

We managed to escape, and that whistle still occurs in some of my dreams. We never went on any other camping trip together.",1,1770456030.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1qy9bju,https://www.reddit.com/r/asimov/comments/1qy9bju/the_naked_sun_impressions/,The Naked Sun - Impressions,"(Oh, perhaps I should say I didn't use any AI for writing of this post because it's the first thing you get accussed of nowadays. So I hope you forgive me for all the stylistic and grammatical errors, they are just my own).

First I have to say I'm quite new to Asimov, I read the original I, Robot collection more than a year ago and picked up with the rest of the series now. The Caves of Steel were interesting, not entirely my cup of coffee perhaps and boy, is Eli Baley a hot-headed choleric, but at least I got to know Asimov a bit more and saw where some of his concepts are coming from.

Now The Naked Sun. I was blown away by the book for solid 200 pages. The Solaria society is so delicately and intriguingly described that for most of the time, I felt like I'm reading a classic comparable to The Brave New World. Eli Baley is finally able to listen and be patient which is nice for a change, although he's a major j\*\*\* towards Daneel still. His investigative methods greatly improved compared to the previous book. But the greatest strength I see in the story is the clash of cultures and illustration of how different would things like morality, ethics and psychology be if society developed under completely different circumstances. Solaria and motivations and ""icks"" of their people are described masterfully and well incoporated into the story. And it's not only about them - for most of the story you identify with Bailey as the only representative of Earth, but in those sudden but brilliant switches of perception he's suddenly far more removed from our Earthly experience than Solarians (his agoraphobia, his disgust with natural features such as grass, mud etc.)

But even for its strengths, I feel like Asimov sometimes cannot escape the spirit of his times. Maybe I'm looking at it through the lens of our time and it's completely wrong, but I was a bit disappointed by his conclusion of the story and especially the philosophical outcomes. Throughout the whole Naked Sun, we're with Eli suffering through his time in open air - we see him challenging himself, getting better at experiencing effects and by the end of the book, he seems to be curious and ""reborn"" in this sense. He doesn't feel such a strong inclination towards living in his caves of steel anymore. My conclusion: Great. The people of his Earth will be encouraged to enter the surface and ""reconnect"" in a sense with what's most natural for them. I felt like Asimov was hinting at this when he'd described how the social rules were forced on Solarians during their upbringing, and how it is basically unnatural. Embracing the life on Earth's surface felt like a perfect equivalent. But no. We need to go to space and colonize and compete with Aliens and become the master race. Okay. Maybe I will be one of a few bothered by this, but I felt like the whole brilliant buildup of the story went out of the window at the expense of ""humanity should take what's rightfully theirs, colonize the hell out of everything and never look back. The nature and other living creatures are only there for our exploitation.""

Again, I'm maybe applying lens that weren't applicable in Asimov's time. But given the way he was progressing the story, this felt a bit like a U turn.

Last but not least - not the biggest fan of his detective conclusions 😄 ""Yeah, it was Gladia but good thing Mr Leebig killed himself. He was an evil schemer. Case closed, next one please."" I'm not sure which universe could grant you yet another promotion and pat on the back for this. His false accusation basically led to suicide of an innocent person in the given case (yes, I believe Leebig was innocent in Delmarre's case, Baley's explanation that he purposely supplied Delmarre with modified robots and somehow knew Gladia will use them as a weapon doesn't work for me, sorry). Even though I know Baley's justifications for his decision (i.e. Gladia suffered enough, Solarian laws are not applicable to him, they avoided far greater threat etc.), it felt like a negation of what the story actually tried to be - i.e. a detective story. So a bit conflicted about the end, but overall a great read. I'm ending my text dump here and I'm hoping for some insightful comments, thanks!",1,1770455855.0,asimov,1,0.67,False
1qy9ai9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy9ai9,[Haul] 3 weeks of real wear: 8 pieces that actually lived with me,"After subway commutes, spilled coffee, and one rainy Tuesday that tested everything—I’m sharing exactly how these held up. Zero brand ties. Just honest notes.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

1qy99jj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy99jj,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770455649.0,Repcnbuy,1,1.0,False

I realised last week that I have started to heal, and I am so, so grateful for that. I joined a gospel choir recently, which has been a bit of a struggle at first - they're all very lovely people who have accepted me warmly into their group. The struggle is me being firmly atheist, but still singing about Jesus, God, prayers and other stuff. My poor neurodivergent brain had a hard time keeping the music and the message apart at first, but now I am just having fun!

Anyway, one of the songs is about thankfulness for everything whichever entity\* has provided. (\*To me, that would be fate.) And also for everything they denied; and wow, that hit differently: Even amidst grieving for everything that could have been if we did have kids, I could always see at least a little bit of good in it. And I started to list more good things.

First and foremost, sleep. I get up on weeksdays at 6am, so I love sleeping in on the weekends as long as I can. My SIL and brother have two lovely boys, but they frequently keep them up at night; just the other day, I got a text saying ""kid up at 1 am? check. kid up at 3 am? check. kid up at 5.30am and night over? check and check.""

There's other stuff like making time for myself, my hobbies, sports, watching some gory true crime series, trying new food without anyone saying ""yuck"", having the ressources to care for our cats. I come home after a busy day to a quiet and tidy house. It's saturday today, and while parents all around the world are trying to keep their toddlers occupied, my husband and I are having our third coffee, watching the birds in the garden, planning to go to the carwash and maybe the hardware store later, then have another coffee and maybe some edibles to top off the day.

Modern living goes beyond constructing new residential buildings. It reflects how a community shapes daily life. In 25 million square feet of [Tilal City Sharjah](https://keyspacerealty.com/real-estate/sharjah-tilal-city/), residents experience a setting designed for convenience and balance. Instead of spending long hours in traffic after work, you can walk to nearby green spaces, enjoy Tilal City Park, let your children ride bicycles along dedicated lanes, or stop by a grocery store or café within minutes. Many residents find that they rarely need to drive for everyday essentials. Tilal City Sharjah presents a lifestyle where thoughtful planning supports comfort, safety, and accessibility.

Unlike developments created primarily to maximize density and short-term returns, Tilal City Sharjah places people at the center of its design. Tree-lined boulevards replace narrow, congested streets. Schools, mosques, medical clinics, supermarkets, and coffee shops are integrated directly into the master plan. Developers did not treat these amenities as optional add-ons. They positioned them as core components of the community. This deliberate approach allows families to manage daily routines efficiently while maintaining a sense of calm.

Green spaces also play a vital role in shaping the environment. Tilal City Sharjah allocates generous areas for landscaped parks, walking paths, and open-air recreation. Residents benefit from both natural surroundings and personal space. The layout encourages outdoor activity while maintaining privacy inside residential zones. Families who relocate to Tilal City often notice how structured planning and reduced congestion improve their overall quality of life. They gain peaceful surroundings without sacrificing access to central Sharjah or nearby emirates.

# Investment Potential in Tilal City Sharjah

Investors and homeowners continue to recognize the long-term potential of Sharjah Tilal City. The appeal goes beyond attractive surroundings. Tilal City Sharjah offers a rare opportunity in today’s market because it provides land plots for development. Buyers can purchase land for villas, residential buildings, or mixed-use projects. This flexibility allows investors to align construction plans with market demand and long-term objectives. Instead of adapting to pre-built layouts, developers can shape properties according to their vision and target audience.

Flexibility supports sustainable value creation. Investors who prefer not to build immediately can also benefit from rising demand. The rental market in Tilal City Sharjah continues to strengthen as new villas and mid-rise apartments enter the market. Tenants appreciate the combination of modern design, integrated amenities, and competitive pricing. Compared to similar communities in neighboring emirates, Tilal City Sharjah offers strong value without compromising quality. This balance attracts families and professionals seeking well-planned living spaces at reasonable rental rates.

Another major factor contributing to investment growth involves regulatory developments in Sharjah. The government’s decision to designate specific freehold zones for foreign ownership has significantly increased interest in Sharjah Tilal City. International investors who want exposure to the UAE property market now view Tilal City Sharjah as a practical entry point. Buyers can access a stable real estate environment without paying the premium typically associated with central Dubai addresses. This policy shift directly stimulates demand and introduces greater diversity into the buyer profile.

As interest expands, property values in Sharjah Tilal City continue to reflect steady growth potential. Investors who enter early in developing communities often benefit from infrastructure expansion and population growth over time. Tilal City Sharjah stands at a stage where long-term planning aligns with government support and private sector investment. These combined factors position the area as a strategic opportunity for capital appreciation and recurring rental income.

# Connectivity and Strategic Location of Tilal City Sharjah

Location strengthens the overall proposition of Tilal City Sharjah. Situated along Emirates Road, Sharjah Tilal City connects efficiently to Sharjah, Dubai, and Ajman. Residents can commute between emirates without navigating inner-city congestion. This accessibility makes Tilal City Sharjah appealing to professionals who work in Dubai but prefer quieter suburban surroundings. The road network allows families to balance affordability and connectivity.

Proximity to Sharjah International Airport enhances the area’s appeal for business owners and frequent travelers. University City also lies within convenient reach, attracting academics, students, and staff who value short travel times. These nearby institutions and transport links support steady housing demand. When communities offer practical access to employment hubs and educational centers, property values tend to remain resilient.

Government commitment to sustainable urban expansion further strengthens Tilal City Sharjah. Infrastructure projects continue to support road improvements, utilities, and public services in the surrounding region. Long-term development plans signal that Sharjah Tilal City will remain a priority growth corridor. Investors often evaluate not only current amenities but also future infrastructure commitments. In this case, continued government backing reinforces confidence in the area’s trajectory.

I will start with the most problematic part first, I am married. So if you don't want to do this, you shouldn't have to waste any more time. 

Well, this one is a bit unconventional, and I have never done this before. 

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks. Sounds simple, doesn't it ? 

But it isn't. I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. Someone who could help me apartment hunting for a longer trip next time?

All this may sound like a dream, or a really unrealistic situation, but I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

For starters, I am decent looking and well mannered. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is good company and a chill time. I am alone in a new city with no friends. 

I do not know what else to write? Maybe you are curious about my post and have some questions on your mind ? Feel free to reach out and I will try to answer them honestly.

So after that I should mention that she’s a VERY rich person, like filthy rich and would literally excessively buy groceries for both of us unasked, I would of course bring WHATEVER I could afford, pantries, spices, cheese, biscuits, anything I can afford really. But she goes overtop with grocery shopping and she would insist on me eating from what she cooks and while I didn’t use to cook everyday because my dorm provides free food she would, and wouldn’t accept me just going to the dorms restraunt, despite me saying it’s okay and she doesn’t have to multiple times, but she insisted and so i figured since I can’t pay her with money, I just proposed that I would do the dishes every single time she cooks, and we agreed on that and our first year was manageable it wasn’t perfect because I was obviously going through so much physical labour compared to her but it was meh. Fast forward to our 2nd and current year, I’m a senior now, this girl would sit her butt down all day, scrolling through reels full volume with no regard for me, never attend classes. Ever. All she does is take care of her appearance and eats and sleeps, she would leave her mess all around the room including my space, would leave food crumbs all over the counter and MY table, would leave the makeup counter looking absolutely horrendous after every. Single. Use. Would bring a shit ton of heavy winter coats that she never uses and would leave them scattered all around the room untidy, unfolded, so now after 6 hours of studying I come to my room to a view that makes me want to go right back out. This girl would leave wipes with mysterious wetness on them, her dirty panties scattered all around the laundry bin, her wet smelly socks everywhere, and the worst part are the dishes. This girl got SO comfortable with my proposal to do the dishes now every single dish in that room is somehow my responsibility, she would use my dishes and just leave them for days and days and days, she would cook something and not slightly help, keep in mind that I attend every class I could and this girl NEVER DOES so she’s free 24/7 literally free all day and all she does is sleep, I managed to ignore this because I was grateful for her spending grocery money on me but it got so heavy I started feeling like a maid instead, I wake up everyday at 6 am, attend 8am-4pm classes all while she’s still alseep, I go back to my room, automatically start picking up her clothes, cleaning the makeup table, picking up her trash from the floor, oh and I forgot to mention that she also leaves food bits on the counter AND the floor. I would start picking up empty water bottles and taking them out, would also clean the dishes SHE used for coffee etc, and by the time I get to relax it’s already 7-8 pm. Day gone. Just like that. But I was managing until- and this is the straw the broke the camels back- she started having her friend over, and by over i mean overnight stays, they would cook together, and I would clean the dishes because both of them are playing oblivious, and now with her friend around, DOUBLE THE MESS AND GIVE IT TO ME. It got so so so bad to the point where I literally couldn’t walk around the room without stumbling on some kind of trash anymore. Fast forward I sat my roomate down and talked to her about the situation. I said the friend is not welcome anymore when I’m around, if she wants to have her over it should be when I leave, and the mess they create together is their responsibility not mine, and she took it so badly, she got defensive and accused me of exaggerating and overreacting because according to her "" my friend does help clean! She cleaned this one time where you were out blah blah blah "" I made my boundary clear and just told her to take care of her shit. After that I stopped eating with her, started eating alone and doing everything alone and when she includes me in groceries I would just let it rot, didn’t do her dishes anymore and instead of doing them herself she would just wash whatever she needs at the time. her friend stopped coming over when I’m in the room but would sleep over when I’m for example at home, last weekend I went to my room after they slept over together and my room looked ATROCIOUS to say the less, food on the floor is all I’m gonna say. So of course like the maid I’m playing I had to clean it up myself because you can never compete with a filthy person because filth is THEIR ELEMENT. After that I found a shit ton of dishes they had used to make dinner the previous night and I had to wash some of them to make my own food but now all of this is making me feel so small. And before you suggest me talking to her about it this girl would never listen, she literally doesn’t go home to avoid helping her mom clean so that tells you what kind of person she is 🤷🏻‍♀️. Sorry for how lonw this is but what would Y’all do in a situation like this?

1qy95p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qy95p8/how_to_tell_stories_that_make_people_obsessed/,# How to Tell Stories That Make People OBSESSED With You (The Psychology That Actually Works),"I used to think charisma was something you're just born with. Turns out that's complete bullshit. After diving into communication research, storytelling frameworks, and studying how the most magnetic people actually operate, I realized the ""naturally charming"" people are just following patterns most of us never learned. They're not winging it, they've figured out the code.

This isn't about becoming fake or manipulative. It's about understanding what actually makes human brains light up during conversation. Because here's the thing: most people tell stories that sound like police reports. Dry facts, chronological order, zero emotional payoff. Then they wonder why nobody remembers them at parties.

**The Hook Principle.** Start with the weirdest, most unexpected moment. Not the boring setup. Research from the Heath brothers shows our brains are wired to pay attention to things that violate expectations. So instead of ""Last summer I went to Japan and it was really cool,"" try ""I accidentally joined a Buddhist ceremony in Kyoto because I thought they were handing out free food."" You've got about 8 seconds before someone's attention drifts to their phone. Use them wisely.

**Never Divorce Facts From Feelings, Matthew Dicks** wrote this book called [Storyworthy](https://a.co/d/0fAzWlET) that legitimately changed how I communicate. He's a 55 time Moth storytelling champion, and his main thesis is simple but brutal: nobody cares about what happened, they care about how it changed you. The book teaches you to identify ""five second moments"" where your perspective shifted, even slightly. That's your actual story. Everything else is just scenery. This is insanely good for anyone who rambles or loses people mid story. Dicks breaks down why most stories fail (you're telling the movie, not the moment) and gives you a framework that actually works. **Best storytelling book I've ever read, hands down.**

**Use Specific Sensory Details Strategically.** Neuroscience shows vivid sensory language activates the same brain regions as actually experiencing something. But here's the key: be selective. One perfect detail beats five generic ones. Don't say ""the coffee shop was nice,"" say ""the espresso machine kept hissing like it was personally offended."" The brain remembers texture, not adjectives.

**Master The Strategic Pause.** This sounds stupidly simple but most people are terrified of silence in conversation. They rush through stories like they're being chased. Pausing right before your punchline or revelation builds anticipation. It signals ""pay attention, this matters."" Watch any late night host interview, they all do this. Conan especially. The pause is doing work for you.

**Build Stakes Early, Reduce Them Late.** Stories need tension, but here's what amateur storytellers miss: you also need to release it. Start by establishing why this moment mattered or what could go wrong. Then as you near the end, bring the energy down slightly before your final beat. It creates satisfaction. Think of it like a song that resolves to the root note. Your listener's brain is literally craving that resolution.

**The Vulnerability Window.** Brené Brown's research on connection shows vulnerability creates trust, but only when it's proportional to your relationship depth. Sharing something mildly embarrassing or self aware makes you relatable. Trauma dumping on a first date does not. The sweet spot is showing you don't take yourself too seriously without making things heavy. ""I confidently walked into the wrong apartment because all the doors look identical"" works. ""My therapist says I have abandonment issues from childhood"" does not.

If you want to go deeper on these storytelling frameworks but don't have time to read through dozens of books and research papers, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from high quality sources like Storyworthy, communication research, expert interviews, and turns them into personalized audio lessons. You can set a goal like ""become a better storyteller in social settings"" and it'll build a learning plan specifically for that, pulling insights from the best books and research on the topic. You can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this sarcastic narrator style that makes dense psychology content way more engaging. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content is fact checked and science based.

**Edit Ruthlessly In Real Time.** Your story should have a spine. One clear narrative thread. If you catch yourself saying ""Oh wait, I forgot to mention,"" you've already lost some people. This takes practice but try the [Ash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ash-ai-for-mental-health/id6474862947) app for building this awareness. It's technically for relationship communication but the exercises on reading social cues and adjusting your communication style in the moment are gold for storytelling too.

**Create Callbacks.** Reference something you or they mentioned earlier in the conversation. It shows you're actually listening and creates a feeling of shared language. ""Kind of like that thing you said about your chaotic roommate"" makes people feel seen and keeps them engaged in your story because it's connected to theirs.

**End Strong, Then Stop Talking.** No ""yeah so that was crazy"" or ""anyway that's my story."" Land your final line and let it breathe. The aftermath is where people process and react. If you keep talking, you're smothering the impact. Think of comedians, they deliver the punchline and go silent. The laugh fills the space. Your story's emotional payoff needs that same room.

The reality is that storytelling isn't some mystical gift. It's a skill you can study and improve. Most people just never do because they assume they're either good at it or they're not. But communication patterns are habits, and habits can change with awareness and practice. You're not rewiring your entire personality, you're just learning to frame your experiences in ways that human brains are already designed to receive. That's not manipulation, that's just meeting people where they are.",3,1770455249.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False
1qy951p,https://www.reddit.com/r/founder/comments/1qy951p/my_dads_been_a_care_home_manager_in_london_for_12/,My dad's been a care home manager in London for 12 years - watching him work is genuinely breaking my heart,"Had dinner with my dad yesterday. He turned up an hour late, apologising, still on his phone dealing with work stuff. He looked exhausted.

He's managed a care home in London for over a decade and I've watched him give everything to it. But lately it feels like the job is just endless admin and firefighting. He barely sleeps properly. He was answering emails at 11pm on a Tuesday. Over Christmas he worked most days.

When I asked if he's okay, he just said ""everyone's like this"" and changed the subject.

You're probably thinking, why don't you just ask your dad what his biggest problem is? I did. He said he hates spending time on boring admin and trivial tasks. Rotas, incident reports, that sort of thing. But I feel like there's more to it than that. Like maybe he's so deep in it he can't even see what could be different anymore.

I'm not in healthcare. I work in tech, so maybe I just don't understand. But from the outside, it looks like managers and clinical leads are drowning in work that isn't actually care. Paperwork, systems that don't talk to each other, constant last-minute chaos.

And I want to help him. But I don't want to be another tech person who rocks up with some ""solution"" that solves nothing because I don't actually understand the problem.

So I'm genuinely asking to speak with people who are living this every day. If you're a care manager, hospital nurse, private clinic manager, care home owner or director, clinical lead, NHS worker, senior services worker, anyone working in this industry, I'd really love to sit down and talk with you. Even just 20 or 30 minutes over a coffee or a quick call.

What's actually the hardest part of your job? Not the stuff you sign up for like tough decisions or patient care. I mean the stuff that just shouldn't be this hard. The things that eat your evenings and weekends. The frustrations you deal with that nobody outside healthcare seems to understand.

I'm not selling anything. Not pitching a product. I just genuinely want to listen and understand what the real problems are. What makes your job harder than it needs to be. What you wish someone would actually fix instead of just talking about.

If you're open to having a chat, please DM me or drop a comment. I'm happy to meet wherever works for you, work around your schedule, grab you a coffee, whatever makes it easiest. I just really want to understand what people in this industry are going through.

Because right now, watching my dad, it looks unsustainable. But I don't know if that's just how healthcare is, or if there are real problems that people have just accepted as normal when they shouldn't have to.

I made the mistake of turning on ""Easy Apply.""

By the next morning, I had over 400 applications.

I tried to do it the ""right"" way at first. I sat down with a coffee and started reading PDFs. After about 45 minutes, I had only gone through 20 resumes, and my brain was fried. The quality was all over the place—people applying from completely different time zones, people with zero relevant experience, etc.

I realized I was spending $100/hour of my own time doing $15/hour work.

**The Fix:** I decided to test a tool called **Arbeo** to handle the initial filter. instead of reading the resumes myself, I uploaded the job description and the resume pile.

The software scored every candidate against my specific requirements (e.g., ""Must have Agile experience"").

* **Total Applicants:** 412
* **Qualified (Over 85% Match):** 28

I archived the other 384 applicants without reading a single word. I only interviewed from that top 28. We hired a candidate three days later.

If you are a small business owner drowning in spam applications, stop trying to be a hero. You need an automated filter.

1qy9319,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy9319,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770454971.0,repcitykickz,1,1.0,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

She mentioned offhand that she missed the ""excitement"" from when we first started dating.

I spent a week planning a custom scavenger hunt around our city. Each clue led to a place that was meaningful to us - the coffee shop where we had our first date, the bookstore where we bumped into each other ""by accident"" (I totally planned it), the park bench where I first held her hand.

The final clue led to the rooftop bar where we had our first kiss, where I had a picnic setup waiting.

What I didn't expect: It wasn't just romantic - it completely changed how we communicate. She loved that I'd been paying attention to all these little details about our relationship. The hunt gave us this natural way to reminisce and laugh about our early dating stories without it feeling forced.

Three weeks later, she planned one for my birthday using inside jokes and obscure references from conversations I didn't even realize she'd remembered. 

We've been doing these every few months now. Sometimes elaborate, sometimes just 3-4 clues around the apartment. It's become our ""thing.""

For anyone looking to break out of a routine: the actual activity matters less than showing you've been paying attention. The scavenger hunt format just made it fun and gave structure to all those small moments that actually matter.

1qy9119,https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1qy9119/the_american_buddha/,The American Buddha,"I’ve been thinking about how this sub (and Western Buddhism more broadly) often filters Buddhism through a distinctly American lens. I know there are people here from all over-UK, Asia, Latin America, etc, but I can feel the predominantly-American flair.

I want to suggest that there’s a threefold tendency at work in the Americanization of anything— what I call the self-help-competitive-connoisseur. It’s not uniquely American, but it feels supercharged here because of our cultural DNA: individualism, optimization culture, consumerism, and a subtle but constant ranking instinct.

Let me illustrate with something lighter: yerba mate tea.

In much of South America, mate is inexpensive, social, shared. It’s passed around. It’s ritual, but casual ritual. It’s communal and ordinary.

In America?

First reaction: “Whoa. This is way cleaner than coffee. I should replace all coffee with this.” (Self-help)

Second reaction: “Oh… you’re using smoked mate? What about PCHs? You buy that brand? Have you even been to Argentina? Look at my aesthetic setup.” (Competitive)

Third reaction: “I have a full mate station, imported gourds, curated bombillas, specialty blends. I’m a mate person now.” (Connoisseur)

We don’t just enjoy things. We optimize them, rank them, and then build identity around them.

I see a similar pattern in how we approach Buddhism.

1. The Self-Helping Phase

Many of us encounter Buddhism as relief.

“Here’s the secret that was missing from our anxious, achievement-driven, morally anxious culture. This is the antidote.”

We dive in hard. Retreats, podcasts, maps, jhanas, awakening checklists. We consume it as the solution. We frame it as psychological liberation technology. We evangelize: “You can be saved too.”

Buddhism becomes Self-improvement 2.0.

2. The Competitive Phase

But we’re still American. And America is quietly competitive in everything.

So the conversation shifts:

Whose awakening is legit?

Which lineage is superior?

Whose teacher is compromised?

Who has attained stream entry for real?

Which practice is “actually” Theravāda?

Are heritage Buddhists “cultural” while we are “serious practitioners”?

We start ranking traditions like power tools.

And suddenly the Dhamma becomes discourse warfare

3. The Connoisseur Phase

Finally, we go all in.

Retreat after retreat.

Teacher training.

Perfect cushions.

Audiobook libraries.

High-end sanghas.

Biohacked meditation schedules.

A fully optimized spiritual lifestyle.

Buddhism becomes a curated identity. We don’t just practice; we become “Buddhist people.” And not just that — discerning Buddhists. Serious ones. The ones who know. At this point, the Buddha we’ve produced looks suspiciously American: optimized, engorged, defined by oneupmanship.

I’m not saying practice is bad. Depth isn’t bad. Retreats aren’t bad. Studying deeply isn’t bad. I’m pointing at a pattern.

We take something that emerged in communal, renunciant, monastic, devotional, and culturally embedded contexts — and we filter it through: self-help psychology, achievement metrics, individual attainment, consumer choice, and identity performance.

The result isn’t traditional Buddhism. It isn’t Asian Buddhism. It isn’t even necessarily secular Buddhism. It’s American Buddhism — shaped by our nervous system.

The irony is that a tradition aimed at reducing grasping can become another arena for grasping. A tradition that critiques ego becomes fuel for a subtler ego.

Maybe that’s inevitable. Maybe it’s just what cultures do.

But it’s worth noticing.",4,1770454778.0,streamentry,2,0.75,False

so i went out for a coffee with a friend (outsider) kanina sa noval side then uuwi na rin sana kami but na-ccr kasi siya so we decided na magcr na lang muna sa mcdo but  closed kasi yung 2nd floor ng mcdo noval kanina so i told her na sa ust na lang since magccr din ako.

so we went sa noval gate and i immediately told the guard na outsider yung friend ko and asked the guard: “kuya pwede po ba siya mag enter? diyan lang po kami sa side ng church, magccr lang po kami.” binigay ko na rin yung id ng friend ko and sinabi ko na rin na magsign na lang siya sa logbook. then sabi ba naman nung guard: “pano kung ayoko? paano kung bawal ma’am?” na medyo nang aasar, which caught me off guard kasi kuya ikaw ba si rector or si st thomas aquinas himself? pero nagsabi ulit ako na magllog naman and naccr lang talaga kami both (which is totoo naman huhu) 

then pinalapit niya yung isa pang guard (idk if guard ba to since nakacivillian siya) so ako naman inexplain ko ulit and sabi ko pa: “galing po kami ng mcdo noval kanina and sarado po yung 2nd floor nila so baka pwede po na magcr lang po kami sa diyan sa side ng court”. THE WHOLE TIME magalang ako and maayos makipagusap pero etong isang guard sabi ba naman: “ha? sarado? kilala ko yang manager diyan sa mcdo tawagan ko nga kung sarado talaga.” then nilabas niya phone niya and kunwari may kausap then tumatawa tawa na sila niyan nung isa pang guard so my friend asked me to go na lang since nakakahiya na

idk why sobrang strict nila eh magssign naman sa logbook and mag iiwan friend ko ng id. and if bawal naman talaga, why cant they tell it nang maayos diba? maayos naman ako nakipagusap, but parang pinipilosopo pa nila kami. nahiya friend ko but mas sobrang nahiya ako for my school kasi ang rude ng guards",31,1770454554.0,Tomasino,1,0.94,False

Another problem is that she's frequently out sick. But posts being out with friends. Now as a boss, I understand it's not my business what she does at her free time. In one of the talks I asked if there was anything the company could do to better her health. She said no.

1qy8tpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qy8tpc/the_crimson_ribbon_murders_its_almost_valentines/,"The Crimson Ribbon Murders, It's Almost Valentine's Day Again.","The story starts back in 1970, with this milkman spotting something odd on Manningham Lane around three in the morning on Valentines Day. He sees Geoffrey and Margaret Hollis, these textile workers, sitting there against the wall of Drummond Mill. 

Their hands are holding this card, postmarked for 1971, which seems off since they died that night. The pathologist said their lips were sewn up neatly with silk thread, and there was no blood anywhere, like it got drained after. 

A ribbon tied their wrists, traced back to some mill batch from 1969. DS Whittaker wrote in his journal about Margaret's eye having these weird rings, like she looked at a bright light, and Geoff's watch stopped right before midnight. Both had these smile lines, which makes you wonder why they would smile if someone was killing them. It feels like that detail sticks out, maybe hinting at something not totally straightforward.

Then it jumps to 1978, this music teacher and her boyfriend found in the old Rex Cinema. Their mouths sewn with piano wire, and get this, their vocal cords cut out and stitched into each others throats. Impossible, right? The ribbon had hair from earlier victims woven in. I think that connects them all, like a pattern starting to show.

By 1985, two students in a rowboat on the Bradford Canal, under the viaduct. They are sitting up straight, but their lungs full of cherry blossom petals. Weird image. The photo they held showed them laughing in the boat, but the reflection in the water has this third person in a 1970s cop uniform. That part gets a bit confusing, like is it real or some trick.

In 1992, an antique dealer and his wife in the ruined Odeon, facing a broken mirror. Their faces swapped, her on his skull with glue, his beard on her. The ribbon from shredded photos of past victims. It seems like the killer is building on what came before, getting more personal maybe.

2001 brings horologists in the Sunwin factory, chests open, hearts swapped for pocket watches synced and stopped at 11:59 PM on February 13, 1970. Ribbon from clock springs and nerve tissue. That date keeps coming back, like its the start of everything.

Fast forward to 2010, software engineers in the newspaper building, set up by a monitor with slides of old crime scenes. Fingers stuck to the keyboard, typing this loop code about love and kill. The ribbon had ethernet with DNA from previous ones, up to 15 victims now. Technology mixed in, but still that old ribbon thing.

2020, during the pandemic, a doctor and nurse in the empty hospital ward. Their suits stuffed with rose thorns, stethoscopes through ribcages, ends swapped for aged photos of themselves. Ribbon from glove shreds with poison in it. Kind of fits the time, but eerie how it ties back.

Now 2024, DI Mara Siddiq figures she is next. Her coffee tastes like some victims favorite tea, her watch says her heart stopped for almost a minute at midnight, and her reflection has this old police hat. She checks out this cafe on the 13th, cameras pick up a cold spot like an old coat, high pitched whispers of victim names, her ring floating where the first bodies were.

She goes in at 11:59, and the killer is there, face patched from all the victims parts, smile from Margaret, nose from the teacher, eyes from the doctor. Coat sewn from their clothes. He offers a hand, ribbons come out with bones on them, saying she has always been in the pattern. Drops a photo of her as a kid by the mill in 1970, holding a red ribbon. That twist, I am not totally sure how it fits, but it changes everything.

Next day, 33 bodies in City Park, 32 in a circle, Mara in the middle bound with ribbon from case files. Pathologist notes the ribbon is from a future batch, 2025, and her eyes like she saw darkness, no damage. At the station, the old file opens at 3:33 AM, Polaroid of the milkman finding the first bodies, but stamped 2070. And he retired way back in 1992. The whole thing loops, I guess, or maybe its endless. This part feels messy, like it does not quite wrap up.",2,1770453987.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The worst part is I'll look at my receipt and it'll be like $87 for what feels like nothing?

So long story short, we broke up like almost a month ago for a week and got back together again, hoping everything will be better now. Why we ""broke up"" - because I didn't take as much initiative on things and she expected me to lead or just overall be more ""manly"".

We are currently almost 4 years together, we live together for over a year and own two cats. Recently, over this week she keeps having these breakdowns and I do not know how to help her or act. Important to note, that she is not psichologically healthy (depression and most likely bpd) she knows this herself and so do I. I encourage her to get professional help all the time, but she just refuses to go because as she says - she is scared. 

1st breakdown: I remember when she used to tell me, that we always sat at home and didn't do anything on our off days. So I took the initiative one day and offered her to go out to the city or just drive around the city, get food, coffee, etc. Just go outside, hang out, get some sun and always keeping a very calm tone. Welp, she then loudly said no and kept saying how it's cold and so on. I then thought of the solutions and how she can get some sun without feeling cold and said them to her, but she cut me off, started screaming - why are you doing this to me, I will not go outside. Ran to the bathroom and slammed the door. I walked to her after a few minutes to try to calm her down, but she screamed at me and kicked me hard in legs forcing me out. 

2nd breakdown (conflict): this happened today morning. We get up at the same time for work most of the times. Today I had the opportunity to sleep in a little, since I stayed at work for an extra hour yesterday. When she woke up (I also woke up with her), she was mad at me that I was not the first one to get out of bed and that because of that she had a shitty and a hard morning. Which lead me to lose sleep and go to work early anyways. I also couldn't fall asleep normally, because she just kept waking me up insisting that she fell asleep first (even though I was super tired and needed sleep and she was just on her phone all evening). 

Everytime I'm the one left apologizing, if I don't - she keeps on being mad and distant. I seriously do not know what to do anymore and if really I am the problem. Could you guys please give me some advice?

Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

I have bunch of them few from brands and few from custom builders. Anyways the product is Engin-Ear AMC (Acoustic Memory Cleanser). Well isn't it mouthful. Well read on its not that difficult once we get accustomed to & once you start listening to it. You will understand why it is named so. Well origin story here is, few months back I was surfing on Instagram and a post by Engin-ear came in my feed as I have been following them for sometime. It was about a new product launch and its they were looking for people to review it. I had chance to listen to their earlier product L300 and was genuinely interested in their unique planar buds the Plaheads which for some personal reasons at the time of launch I couldn't get them. So my curiosity was in high gear mode. I replied to that post and well to my surprise they replied back. One thing led to another and in Month of January 2026 I finally got in my hands The AMC buds. Now to present day, I present to you my attempt to review these unique earbuds. Please read till end to find out what I feel about them.   

A massive thank you to Engin-ear for providing prototype for review without that this review wouldn't be possible.

I was neither paid to do this review nor received any kind of compensation towards it. All thoughts and opinions expressed are mine. Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged. Let's get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Since I have gotten final prototype. It will be similar to retail product. The shells are 3D printed and feel solid in hand. Stems are designed in way to help improve fit. The shell has gel to seal off the stems and to dissolve vibrations. There is passive Radiator inside the shell. What these features have impact you will see in my review. Since this was MMCX version of the bud. I had no cable. Cables used were mine. I used both copper and SPC cables to test it. Sponge covers used were provided by brand.   

Technical Specifications :

15.4 mm dynamic Driver. Pu+ Beryllium diaphragm. Impedance rating is 30 Ohms and sensitivity is 115 dB

Sources :

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

These earbuds are very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive these earbuds with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So these earbuds are scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze + Shanling M1 Plus > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

 Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

Sound impressions :

Bass / Low end

Bass is here quality over quantity type. Bass is audiophile level. It has mid bass over sub bass. As with any earbuds sub bass lacks its element. Here it is similar but not a con as all earbuds suffer from it. Mid bass has thump but lacks physicality due to being quick and fast. Since it doesn't linger you don't get that physical feel of it. When music calls for mid bass this set delivers. Due to its tuning nature bass doesn't color mids. Drums, kick drums and bass guitars sound good on this set. 

Few dB's of mid bass and bit less speed would have made it perfect for me. Again please note that this set is designed to be reference set and in that aspect the bass is perfect. So take my opinion as my bias towards more hard hitting bass in to consideration while reading this section. 

 

Overall Bass /  Low end 4.5/5  

Mids

Vocals are great. They are clean and without any coloration. They sound natural. Vocal reverberations are on point. Be it male vocals or female vocals both are equally good. One thing to note that female vocals don't get intense so Yay! Vocals are neither recessed nor forward. They are balanced well. For me Vocals are perfect. 

Mids also carry alot of instruments. Here they are emphasized correctly . No artificial or off timbre. The instruments don't smear or congest. There is ample space between them. Some who like mid centric tuning might feel mids bit bland but for most it will be as what I have described. 

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble 

 Treble here feels bit forward compared to other aspects of tuning. Treble is smooth no weird peaks or off timbre. It has that open headphones feeling that we all love in the earbuds. All macro and micro details are present. You won't miss them. It highlights them without becoming too over bearing. Soundstage is wide and tall. You get holographic stage. All instruments have enough space and none feel congested. Positional ques are on point. If you like headphones for their openness you will find it here. Treble has enough extension to give that feeling.

Overall Treble 5/5

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

1. Angel by Massive Attack

There is constant sub bass droning in this song and you can hear it but you will miss rumble of it here. Again its expected for any earbud. Mid bass thump is good just for my personal liking bit low. But you will enjoy the drums and kick drums here. Guitars were great. Vocals sound natural. There is no smearing or congestion. This song is taxing on sets if they have muddy bloated bass and bit of dark treble. No such thing here. It does excellently. Overall good reproduction.

Ego Death (feat. Steve Vai) by Polyphia

This song is speed check for driver aka resolving capability. Here this set passes with flying colors. Drums, kick drums, bass guitars sound good just lack physical rumble of sub bass. Cymbals sound good. Guitars can get bit intense in some instances but not harsh. Overall good reproduction of this song.

 

My Heart will Go On by Celine Dion

This song is one of my favorite female vocal songs. Here Celine sounds so divine. On this set somehow Celine's vocals sound bit muted. It maybe due to tuning choices? Her voice fails to evoke emotions. Mostly female vocals shine on this set. Rest the flutes sound great. Other instruments sound natural. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Shape of you by Ed Sheeran

Bass beats are on point. Ed sounds great. Charm of his voice is preserved. Tuning of this set makes the song enjoyable. Feels like the set was meant for it. I felt that most modern pop songs  sound great on this set. There are multitude  of different instruments playing in chorus. Yet no smearing or congestion was felt. Overall great reproduction.

Please do understand that as reviewer I have to be critical about each and every aspect. As to present clear picture of the set.  So what I have mentioned may not be your experience.  

  

Final Conclusion :

Engin-ear has always been interesting brand for me. They are constantly pushing boundaries. They have their own designed shell and don't use generic shells. Earlier they had created planar earbuds called Platheads. It was limited run I couldn't get one at that time. That buds were truly risky move on their part. Irrespective of market reception I think this brand is ready for risk taking and doesn't shy away from it. They are spending time and money on R&D. 

In line with this AMC was launched the topic of this review. AMC has unique features such a

dampening gel in stem and passive radiator. These do work in my opinion. On first listen you won't feel it but upon repeated usage you will spot effect of these. I find AMC to be refined product. Its tuned to be reference grade if I am not wrong. The bass mids and vocals their tuning shows it. Bass here is no means less or anemic just it is quality over quantity and my preference for more mid bass that I have graded it less. Other wise this bass tuning is adequate for reference grade set. Vocals are well balanced with respect to bass and treble. So it never feels recessed. It's balanced. Treble is USP of this set. Its tuned to be smooth and bit forward. It covers all macro and micro details. Makes it very detailed set. Still not harsh or bright set. You will get all the details. Soundstage is really nice gives that open wide spacious feeling. In complex songs you will like this tuning as it shines in such situations.  

 

So I think this is reference bud meant to enjoy music casually and at the same time for technical analysis or to dissect music. It will fit like glove in all situations. It is truly as per its name Acoustic Memory Cleanser.It helps you to reset your ears. It is really a reset for ears after listening to colored sets. Its like fresh perspective. Just remember bassheads this is not set for you. Neutral lovers rejoice and trebleheads would also appreciate this set. I am so impressed that I can easily recommend this set . I wish Engin-ear all the best for future endeavors and I will keep my eyes open for any new release from them.

 

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab cup of coffee and let's get high on the safe high i.e. Music.

Is Engin-ear AMC An Acoustic Memory Cleanser? Yes 100%

1qy8ill,https://i.redd.it/j5og6ev791ig1.jpeg,It only has half a title. Anyone know where to read?,"""Congrats, Archer! One at home, one on the side!""

I froze.

I was booking a recovery suite for my baby when those words shattered everything.

The man who knelt and swore I was his only one? He was in there. Cradling a baby that wasn't ours.

His kid. With her.

For three years, I played the perfect wife. Trusting. Devoted. Blind.

Turns out, I was the city's favorite punchline.

He thought the baby in my belly was his insurance—his way to keep me locked down forever.

Wrong.

It became my ticket out.

I'm taking my child and walking straight into the life we actually deserve.

As for Archer? 

Poor bastard still doesn't know his precious mistress's baby? 

Yeah. NOT HIS.

\---

Three years after remarrying Archer Kingsley, Helena Vaughan found out she was pregnant.

She rubbed her belly, doing everything in her power to avoid another blow-up fight with him.

If he came home late, she didn't ask questions.

If he stumbled in drunk, she simply had the housekeeper whip up some aspirin and black coffee.

If he was buried in work, she gave him space.

Even when she found a tube of lipstick on his passenger seat, she thoughtfully slid it right back where she found it.

It wasn't until she went to book a suite at the Luxury Postpartum Retreat and caught him cheating again that she realized the burning hatred was gone—replaced by a cold, dead numbness.

""Ms. Vaughan, look at this! This is our VIP Diamond Suite, running about twenty grand a month! A 'Mrs. Kingsley' is staying here right now—checked in less than four days after popping out a baby boy!""

""Her husband is here 24/7, squad in tow, living the dream! Though, gotta say... the hubby has quite the appetite. She just gave birth and they're already going at it like rabbits—terrible for recovery. You really gotta watch out for that, Ms. Vaughan!""

The sales associate kept chirping in her ear, but Helena tuned out every single word.

She stared into the room at the man cradling a newborn, shooting the breeze with his frat brothers, and felt a hot sting in her eyes.

""Congrats, Archer! Another heir to the throne!""

""If Helena pops out a boy too, that makes two sons for the dynasty, huh?""

""Man, Archer is a legend. One at home, one on the side. Three whole years, and I bet Helena doesn't have a clue, does she?""

Hearing this, Archer's expression hardened. ""Of course she doesn't know, and don't you idiots dare let it slip! She's in her third trimester, she can't handle the stress.""

""We get it, bro, we get it! We've covered for you for three years, but Archer, when are you gonna drop the bomb on Helena?""

Archer paused for a second before speaking with absolute certainty, ""I'll wait until after the delivery. Once the baby is here, Helena won't have the heart to leave me.""

""Am I making things hard for you?"" The woman in bed cooed softly. ""Archer, I never wanted to be a burden. After Caleb died, just being by your side and giving you a child is enough for me. I don't need anything else.""

He reached out, pulling her into a gentle embrace. ""Cecily, I promised I'd take care of you, and I keep my promises. I just hate that you've had to live in the shadows with me for three years.""

Through the crack in the door, Helena watched the man—usually so cold and composed—looking utterly tender, and a mocking smirk twisted her lips.

Three years ago, Helena had seen with her own eyes how Archer hooked up with his dead best friend's wife.

She screamed for a divorce, Cecily Quinn threatened suicide.

Between the two of them, Archer chose Cecily.

Not long after the divorce, Archer scoured the earth to find Helena.

When he finally tracked her down, he got on his knees and swore she was the only woman he had ever loved.

He claimed the divorce was forced, that he was terrified Cecily would actually kill herself, and he couldn't bear to fail his late best friend.

To put her mind at ease, he even shipped Cecily straight overseas.

He even held a press conference, promising the entire world he would never betray her again.

Ten years of knowing him, five years of loving him.

Helena couldn't just turn off her feelings, so she caved and agreed to remarry him.

After the wedding, Archer went overboard trying to make it up to her.

She liked fireworks, so for her birthday, he bought out the city's entire supply and lit up the skyline all night long.

If she eyed a piece of jewelry, no matter the astronomical price tag, he'd win the auction and have it on her vanity the next day.

Afraid she felt insecure, he'd share his location proactively, no matter where he went.

Even on business trips, he'd call three or four times a day just to check in.

But ever since the incident, she couldn't stop picturing him cheating.

To save the marriage, she tried to change, giving him freedom within reason.

But she never in a million years imagined that the man who swore he sent Cecily away had been tangled up with her for three whole years.

And she certainly never expected him to have a child with her.

It wasn't until this moment that Helena realized just how incredibly played she had been.

Even if she gave him trust, and he gave her love, a shattered mirror could never truly be fixed.

The kicker was, Helena knew every single person in that room—no exceptions.

If Archer hadn't suddenly announced a month-long business trip, leaving her bored enough to check out this retreat alone, she never would have stumbled onto this circus.

She would have been kept in the dark like a damn fool for the rest of her life!

What a massive, elaborate con Archer had pulled!

How could he lie to her three years ago, and then have the nerve to do it all over again?!

Perhaps sensing Helena's rage, the baby in her belly suddenly kicked—hard.

She clutched her stomach, doubling over in pain. ""Ah! That hurts.""

It wasn't just her belly, it was her heart.

The sales girl noticed something was off and nervously grabbed her arm. ""Ms. Vaughan? You okay? Is something wrong?""

""Who's out there?""

Hearing the commotion, everyone inside snapped their heads toward the door in unison.

When he saw Helena, Archer completely panicked.

He hurriedly dumped the baby back into the crib and speed-walked toward the door.

""Helena... what the hell are you doing here?""

When the others saw Helena, the color drained from their faces.

""Oh shit... Helena's here?""

""Helena, listen, let us explain! We knew Cecily was having a baby so we came to visit. As for Archer? Total coincidence. We just bumped into him on the street and dragged him along.""

""Yeah, Helena, please don't get it twisted.""

Even now, Archer's 'bros' were still covering for him.

Hearing them call her ""Helena"" so casually, acting like nothing was wrong, made her want to vomit.

She slowly lifted her eyes to Archer, her voice deadly calm. ""And you, Archer? What's your excuse?""

""Helena, baby, don't get upset... it's like they said, just a random coincidence.""

""We are standing right here, and you're still lying to my face!""

Her heart felt like it had been soaking in ice water for so long it was numb.

But in this moment, his lies finally broke her. She raised her hand and—crack!—slapped him across the face with everything she had.

""Archer, did you forget? One hour ago you sent me a voice note saying you were overseas! What? Can you fly now? You flew back in an hour?""

Archer didn't get angry, he just nervously grabbed her hands. ""I'm sorry, Helena, please calm down, think of the baby—""

""It's all my fault! Ms. Vaughan, please, don't hit Archer anymore.""

Cecily, holding her baby, fell to her knees in front of Helena. ""Archer just pities me, that's why he's helping! Ms. Vaughan, I don't want anything else. I'm just a widow looking for a man to take care of me, just wanting a child to live for! I swear I'm not trying to steal your husband!""

""Shut your mouth! You have a child with my husband and you have the nerve to say you aren't stealing him?""

Helena raised her hand to strike, but her wrist was instantly seized by Archer in a death grip.

""Helena, hit me if you want, but don't touch Cecily. She just gave birth, she's weak.""

""She's weak?""

Seeing him defend another woman, Helena let out a scornful laugh. ""Weak, but strong enough to sleep with you? Archer, you said you were on a business trip for a month just so you could shack up in this retreat and play house with her? How can you be this shameless!""

Helena ripped her arm away from him and raised her hand to strike again.

Suddenly, Cecily scrambled up from the floor, clutching the baby, and threw herself in front of Archer.

Seeing her charge forward using the baby as a shield, Helena couldn't stop her momentum, and her hand grazed the child.

""Waaaaah!""

The baby instantly tumbled from her arms, hitting the floor.

Everyone in the room panicked.

""My baby! My sweet baby!""

Cecily screamed, rushing to scoop up the infant. ""Ms. Vaughan, why?! My baby is only four days old! You're a mother too, how can your heart be so cruel?""

The others rushed over, immediately turning on Helena.

""Helena, how could you? The kid is tiny! I don't care how mad you are, you don't take it out on a baby!""

""A fall like that could be serious. Archer, man, we gotta get him to the ER now!""

Archer exploded with rage, snapping his head around to glare at Helena. ""Helena, I know I screwed up today! But that is my son! My own flesh and blood!""

""Is that so?""

Helena looked at him, tears streaming down her face. ""Then what the hell is this inside me?""

""Baby? Why aren't you crying? Baby! Archer, our baby is dying!""

Cecily screamed, clutching the child, and Archer panicked. ""Cecily, let's go! We're going to the hospital right now!""

Helena stood in the doorway, stone-faced. ""Let them take him! Archer, I am giving you one last chance.""

""Me and Cecily. My child and Cecily's child. You can only choose one! Who is it going to be?""

Archer frowned, looking torn. ""Helena...""

""Archer, I'll take the baby and disappear! You won't have to worry about us ever again! If we die, it's not your problem! We aren't married anyway, the baby will just be a mocked as a bastard! I might as well just end it all!""

Cecily, clutching the baby, made a move toward the window to jump, but Archer tackled her in a tight embrace.

""Cecily, I won't let you die! I promised Caleb I would take care of you!""

He whipped his head around to look at Helena. ""Helena, you're making me choose right now? You are absolutely insane!""

""Cecily just gave birth to my son! I won't stand here and watch him die! You want a divorce? Fine! I've had enough of this shit for three years too!""

Archer scooped the woman into his arms and rushed out, not even realizing he had slammed into Helena on his way.

Helena was heavy with pregnancy, the impact threw her off balance. She stumbled back a few steps before crashing hard onto the floor.

A sharp pain made her vision go black. She tried to get up, but her body wouldn't obey.

He's had enough?

So had she!

The others saw her fall, but not a single one moved to help her. Instead, they started blaming her.

""Man, women get so jealous, it's crazy.""

""If we knew she was like this, Archer shouldn't have begged her to come back three years ago.""

""Hmph, you think Archer regrets it now? Too late to dump her though, she's knocked up. Eight months pregnant—what's she gonna do, go to the clinic and get rid of it?""

Everyone followed Cecily to the hospital.

The room, once full of noise, was now empty, leaving Helena all alone.

Severe pain radiated from her abdomen, so she had to ask the retreat staff to rush her to the ER.

The doctor examined her, frowning deeply. ""You're eight months pregnant, you need to be careful. How did you manage to fall like that?""

Helena blinked, staring up at the ceiling in silence.

She didn't fall by accident. Archer pushed her.

""Where is Mr. Kingsley? He didn't come with you? Usually, he's here for every checkup.""

The doctor wiped the gel off her belly and asked softly, ""Do you want me to give him a call?""

Helena didn't stop him, and the doctor quickly dialed the number.

""Hello, Mr. Kingsley? Mrs. Kingsley just arrived at the hospital. She had an accidental fall, and the baby—""

""Dr. Miller, did my wife put you up to this? Cecily's baby is in the ER right now, and she's trying to use our unborn child to get attention? You tell her to stop the drama! If anything happens to Cecily's son, I'll make her pay with her own!""

The phone clicked off. The doctor stood there, stunned, not understanding what had just happened.

Helena still said nothing. She just silently climbed off the bed.

""Dr. Miller... if I wanted to terminate the pregnancy now...""

""Mrs. Kingsley, I don't know what's going on between you and your husband, but the fetus is eight months old. It's almost time for delivery. Inducing labor now to terminate... not only is it dangerous for you, but you'd be killing an innocent life.""

Helena nodded. ""I understand. Thank you, Doctor.""

The doctor was right. The baby was innocent.

This child was hers. From now on, it would have absolutely nothing to do with Archer.

She was going to divorce Archer!

She would raise this child on her own.",3,1770452822.0,romancenovels,5,1.0,False

​Chapter 43: The Cake

​Earth Time: March 12, 2677.

​Location: The outer arm of the Milky Way, the very fringes of our galaxy.

​“Here we are,” Navigator Masato muttered, pointing a finger at the holographic map before taking a heavy swig of coffee.

​“Holy shit... and we crossed all that in just over a year thanks to the Pathfinder? Masato, how many light-years is that, exactly?”

​Masato scratched his head absentmindedly.

​“We aren’t traveling in a straight line, but ‘at a glance,’ if you measured it with a ruler, it’s about forty-five, maybe fifty thousand light-years. The Galaxy itself is a hundred thousand in diameter, after all. I’m talking about our Earth light-years, mind you, not the universal ones.”

​“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Lyra replied, narrowing her eyes as she studied the projection. “I can see it on the map. It’s a hell of a long way.”

​“Our long-range recon fleet is still the closest,” Masato continued. “The other Pathfinders and their fleets headed for the far side of the Galaxy. They couldn't cut through the center. During the halts between the sequential creation, scanning, and expansion of quantum tunnels, you have to transition back into normal space, and there... there the radiation is so lethal that not even our probes found a single Crustacean in the core. Life simply cannot exist there.”

​“Damn it, Masato,” Lyra snapped. “Why are they hauling ass the long way around, sticking only to the galactic plane? Space is three-dimensional; they could just ‘jump’ over or under it.”

​Masato gave a thin, pale smile and set down his empty mug.

​“You’re forgetting the point of this trip. We’re here to warn other civilizations and establish contact with new races and potential allies. We won’t do that by flying through the intergalactic void, where your only company is dark matter and your own thoughts. We have to stay where the life is.”

​“Fair point,” Lyra admitted.

​Masato slid his hand across her hip and then lower, digging his fingers into her buttock. Beneath his skin, an unnatural, heavy desire pulsed.

​“Are you in the mood for...?”

​Lyra smiled, though a coldness lurked in her eyes. She took him by the wrist, removing his hand with almost clinical precision.

​“Let go. Keep your hands off for now,” she hissed quietly. “Jimmy is here. Ever since we stopped sleeping together, he’s become morbidly jealous of every touch. He feels every vibration of my tissues through those cursed receptors of theirs.”

​Masato let out a short, dry laugh that sounded more like a cough.

​“Christ, why doesn't he just change husks? I understand the trauma of a 'real' death, a technical error, whatever... but he’s still rotting in that alien reptilian filth.”

​Lyra’s face hardened, turning into a mask of frozen wax.

​“I’m trying to understand him. He simply doesn't want to die again. He’s already felt the light go out once—felt his synapses frying in agony. He doesn't intend to go through that hell again until he’s forced to.”

​She took a step toward the hologram, her movements strangely stiff, as if her joints were fighting her.

​“His current body... that Taharagch... it has no nanites. It ages slowly, following the rhythm of a reptile’s life. But I’ll see him in a human body again once he dies of old age.” She looked down at her hands. “My body is original. It’s over seven hundred years old. That’s seven centuries of being held together solely by microscopic machines that patch my DNA faster than it can fray.”

​She turned abruptly, locking eyes with Masato.

​“I have to ask you something. You start your leave in a week. Are you really going to do it? Inject yourself with that chemical death sentence just so this husk can die? You’ll let your lungs stop pumping oxygen, let your brain turn to mush, just so an updated copy of your consciousness can wake up in new meat on the beaches of L’thaarr? And then, a week later, you’ll do it again? You’ll kill your ‘vacation self’ just to return here as another duplicate?”

​Masato shrugged. It was the gesture of a man who had long ago accepted the fact that he was merely data recorded on a protein matrix.

​“I didn't have the luck you or Jimmy had,” he replied emotionlessly. “During the Crustacean counterattack on Earth, I was just cannon fodder in the mass levy. An infantryman whose only job was to plug holes in the front with his own corpse. I died dozens of times, Lyra. Torn apart, burned, crushed. For me, death is just a procedure. Like a journey where you go to sleep in one place and wake up in another. Pure logistics.”

​Lyra sighed, the sound like the hiss of escaping air.

​“I admire you, Masato. But you’re the exception. Most of us still feel that primal, human fear of death. We’re afraid that during one of these ‘jumps,’ the thing that actually makes us human will simply evaporate. That’s why the rest prefer to rot in their cabins rather than treat themselves to that luxury ritual of suicide.”

​Jimmy stood in the deepest shadows of the war room, almost merging with the wall. His reptilian eyes, devoid of human expression, recorded every detail with inhuman sharpness. He saw Masato’s warm, soft hand tightening on Lyra’s hip. He saw her skin yield under that touch—a touch that for Jimmy was now only a hazy memory from another life.

​He turned away sharply. His movement wasn't human; it was too fluid, too efficient, underpinned by the predatory instinct of a body he loathed. He walked out, the click of his claws against the metal deck sounding in his ears like a sentence.

​On the way to his cabin, every step was an ordeal. Jimmy felt the weight of his tail, a useless ballast dragging behind him like the shadow of an old sin. Beneath the thick, keratinized scales, blood throbbed—cold, thick, devoid of the heat that once defined him as a man, as a mammal.

​“Decades...” he thought, and his tongue flicked out involuntarily, tasting the chemical composition of the air. He smelled dust, grease, and... fear. His own fear.

​For decades, he hadn't felt the touch of another skin. His tactile receptors were calibrated for combat and survival, not tenderness. Every attempt to get close to Lyra ended the same way—he saw the flash of disgust in her eyes that she couldn't hide.

​He was a prisoner in a body crafted by natural evolution and genetics to kill. His hands, tipped with black talons, could rip through the armor of a Crustacean or a G.S.F. soldier alike, but they couldn't embrace a woman without the risk of wounding her. When he tried to speak of love, only a rasping, low growl emerged from his throat.

​He stopped before the bulkhead of his cabin. He looked into the smooth, polished surface of the metal. A monster stared back—a Taharagch with yellow, vertical pupils. This wasn't a disguise. This wasn't a husk that could be removed after duty. This was his only “now.”

​“I don’t blame her,” the thought drifted through his mind, and he felt a phantom heartache in his chest. “Who could love a monster? Who would want to go to bed with a butcher like this?”

​He was a prisoner of the meat, a consciousness shoved into a reptilian form, condemned to observe a happiness in which he could no longer take part.

​He slipped into his dark cabin, the only sound accompanying him being the rhythmic hum of the life-support systems, ensuring his nightmare continued.

​He woke in dense darkness, feeling a burning, wet pain on his chest. Looming over him, pinning him to the berth with a weight he couldn't throw off, was Mo’hirra. Her talons were slowly, with almost surgical precision, carving deep, bloody furrows into his scales.

​“Jimmy... you are the only male of my species on this ship,” she rasped, her voice a vibration, a growl devoid of tenderness. “And I have my needs.”

​She was a brilliant xenobiologist, a mind capable of analyzing the most intricate structures of life, but in this moment, her intellect served only primal lust. She knew everything about the mistake that had trapped a human consciousness in this reptilian husk. She knew the name “Jimmy” was just the shadow of a man who had long ago ceased to exist in the material world. But she didn't care. To her, in this stifling darkness, all that mattered was the satisfaction of a biological imperative—the blind, merciless instinct of the cloaca that recognized no compromise.

​Jimmy was paralyzed by pure, animal fear. He remembered the medical reports he had once read with safe detachment, and Kael’s memories. He saw the furrows on his friend’s body and the scars left before the nanites could regenerate and repair them. Macabre evidence of encounters where the nanites could barely keep up with the regeneration of torn tissue. What was an act of intimacy for humans was a brutal struggle for the Taharagch.

​He realized with horror that theory had just become his new, bloody reality. He was no longer an observer, nor Lyra’s husband longing for a touch. He had become biological material. Now, he was the one being processed.

​The scheduled ""morning"" in the cramped cabin turned out to be the most bearable Jimmy had felt in decades. The brutal, almost animalistic act the Taharagch female had forced upon him had, paradoxically, become the only cure for the broken heart rotting inside him. “Lyra is probably fucking that navigator right now,” he thought with cold, bitter satisfaction. “At least I’m not alone in this grave anymore.”

​He looked at his chest. The Taharagch possessed no nanites; their bodies knew nothing of the sterile magic of Swarm technology, but their biology was powerful and primal. The wounds inflicted by Mo’hirra were already closing; the blood had dried into dark scabs, and the edges of the torn scales were smoothing out in the process of natural regeneration.

​Mo’hirra lay beside him. Her tail—a hard, muscular coil of cold tissue—was still wrapped around his leg, as if even in sleep she had no intention of letting her prize go. When she opened her eyes, her vertical pupils narrowed, assessing his reaction.

​“Thanks,” she rasped, a hint of predatory appreciation in her voice. “For a first time, you didn't do too badly.”

​“Aren't you staying for coffee?” Jimmy asked, and then, feeling the weight of his own alien throat, added: “Or harakt? I can prepare that, at least.”

​Mo’hirra jerked her head up, her nostrils quivering.

​“Don’t tell me you have harakt?”

​“I do. I’ve grown fond of the stuff. In this body, it hits the nerves better than anything else,” Jimmy replied. “As a G.S.F. colonel and a soldier who always knew how to stay on the good side of logistics, I know how to get supplies others can only dream of. I can arrange—”

​He didn't finish. Mo’hirra lunged at him, pinning him to the berth once more, her mass and the scent of musk filling the cabin.

​“Fine,” she hissed straight into his face. “I’ll stay. Brew the draught, soldier.”

​The mess hall during the afternoon meal was filled with the metallic clatter of cutlery and the heavy smell of synthetic proteins. Lyra sat alone, picking at her plate, her gaze involuntarily drifting toward Jimmy. Over the last few decades, their relationship had resembled a slow necrosis—a marriage that, after he lost his human husk, had shattered into microscopic, jagged pieces. Usually, she would remain silent for days, sometimes weeks, feeding him only coldness.

​It was always Jimmy who reached out. He was the one who would scratch at her cabin bulkhead, begging for even a shred of human closeness, a shadow of their old life.

​“What’s going on?” the thought flashed through her mind, and she tasted the bitter gall in her mouth. “It’s been a week. Seven cycles during which he hasn't shown up at my door once.”

​She knew sex was impossible—her seven-hundred-year-old, fragile body wouldn't survive the brutality of a Taharagch, and besides, she didn't even want to try; the very thought disgusted her—but his presence had been a constant, almost intrusive part of her existence. She remembered how she used to scold Jimmy for judging Kael’s marriage to a Ta'hirim. She had called him a closet racist, lectured him on tolerance and the beauty of interspecies bonds. Even though he had only been joking about Kael and the Ta'hirim and their successful relationship. Yet when fate played its joke and shoved her husband’s consciousness into a scaly, predatory carcass, she was the one who turned out to be the xenophobe. She couldn't stand the smell of his skin, the glow of his vertical yellow pupils, or the weight of his presence. She was repulsed by him.

​Suddenly, her gaze froze. She saw Mo’hirra, the xenobiologist, walking past Jimmy’s table with predatory grace. She noticed Jimmy lift his head, and a smile spread across his reptilian face—wide, sincere, terrifying in its saurian nature, yet carrying a rare glow of satisfaction. Mo’hirra answered him with a barely perceptible twitch of her tail.

​In that same instant, Lyra felt a sharp stab in her chest. It wasn't a nanite software glitch or the twitch of a tired heart. It was a sharp, physical thrust of jealousy that tore into her seven-hundred-year-old tissue like a rusted knife.

​The days dripped down the ship’s bulkheads like thick grease. Two weeks passed. On a Sparta-class ship, despite its titanic proportions, avoiding someone for that long required almost military strategy. Jimmy stopped asking, stopped whimpering at her door, stopped being the background noise of her existence. And that hurt the most.

​“God damn it, he’s definitely with her,” she thought, clenching her fists so hard her nails dug into her palms. “Mo’hirra.” The only native Taharagch female in this sea of human meat. That reptilian, lizard bitch knew exactly who she was sleeping with. She knew Jimmy was Lyra’s husband, that their history went back centuries, that they were bound by a vow that death and a change of husks shouldn't invalidate. What right did she have to touch him? What right did she have to seize something that belonged to Lyra?

​A wave of burning hypocrisy hit her, one she didn't want to name. Masato was just ""hygiene"" for her, a soulless ritual to drown out the void. It was “just fun,” a safe way to satisfy needs in a world where her real husband had become a monster. But the other side? That raw, reptilian strength Mo’hirra emanated had clearly ripped Jimmy out of his orbit of suffering.

​She was disgusted by Jimmy; she couldn't stand his scales and his cold breath, yet now that he had stopped being her faithful, rejected dog, she felt rage. She wanted to have her cake and eat it too—she wanted to despise her lizard-husband while simultaneously having him at her beck and call as a guarantor of her past and future. Mo’hirra hadn't just “stolen” her husband. She had exposed the fact that Lyra was no longer his only choice.

​Lyra approached Jimmy’s table with a mug of steaming coffee in her hands, trying to force her face into an expression of casual, almost domestic kindness. She looked like a shadow of her former self, trying to recreate the rituals from a time when their lives weren't yet a ruin.

​“What are you up to this evening?” she asked, her voice soft but sounding unnatural in the stifling atmosphere of the mess hall. “Maybe... you’d like to watch a movie with me? Like we used to?”

​Jimmy raised his head. His vertical pupils narrowed, scanning her form with inhuman calm. There was no trace of the old anticipation in him, no tremor of muscle that would betray joy at her interest. He answered her in the calm, gravelly voice of a Taharagch, which seemed to vibrate in the very metal of the floor.

​“No,” he cut her off, the sound dry and final. “I have other plans.”

​Lyra froze, her mug halfway to her lips, disbelief mixed with rising irritation flashing in her eyes. She wasn't used to being refused by her “monster.”

​“Other plans?” she repeated, struggling for composure, though she was shaking inside with jealousy over Mo’hirra.

​“Watch something with Masato,” Jimmy continued, fixing her with a dispassionate stare. “He’s back from leave today, after all. They’re ‘printing’ him right now; he’ll probably step out of the vat as a new, fresh copy any minute. He’s the one you spend your time with, Lyra. Don’t waste it on me.”

​He stood up and turned away, leaving her alone with her steaming coffee and a striking truth she didn't want to accept. This, in all likelihood, was the end of their marriage.

Another week another review. Today's product is close to my heart category. The good old Earbuds or flatheads as we like to call them today due to TWS stealing their name. I have bunch of them few from brands and few from custom builders. Anyways the product is Engin-Ear AMC (Acoustic Memory Cleanser). Well isn't it mouthful. Well read on its not that difficult once we get accustomed to & once you start listening to it. You will understand why it is named so. Well origin story here is, few months back I was surfing on Instagram and a post by Engin-ear came in my feed as I have been following them for sometime. It was about a new product launch and its they were looking for people to review it. I had chance to listen to their earlier product L300 and was genuinely interested in their unique planar buds the Plaheads which for some personal reasons at the time of launch I couldn't get them. So my curiosity was in high gear mode. I replied to that post and well to my surprise they replied back. One thing led to another and in Month of January 2026 I finally got in my hands The AMC buds. Now to present day, I present to you my attempt to review these unique earbuds. Please read till end to find out what I feel about them.   

A massive thank you to Engin-ear for providing prototype for review without that this review wouldn't be possible.

I was neither paid to do this review nor received any kind of compensation towards it. All thoughts and opinions expressed are mine. Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged. Let's get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Since I have gotten final prototype. It will be similar to retail product. The shells are 3D printed and feel solid in hand. Stems are designed in way to help improve fit. The shell has gel to seal off the stems and to dissolve vibrations. There is passive Radiator inside the shell. What these features have impact you will see in my review. Since this was MMCX version of the bud. I had no cable. Cables used were mine. I used both copper and SPC cables to test it. Sponge covers used were provided by brand.   

Technical Specifications :

15.4 mm dynamic Driver. Pu+ Beryllium diaphragm. Impedance rating is 30 Ohms and sensitivity is 115 dB

Sources :

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

These earbuds are very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive these earbuds with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So these earbuds are scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze + Shanling M1 Plus > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

 Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

   

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls 

Sound impressions :

Bass / Low end

Bass is here quality over quantity type. Bass is audiophile level. It has mid bass over sub bass. As with any earbuds sub bass lacks its element. Here it is similar but not a con as all earbuds suffer from it. Mid bass has thump but lacks physicality due to being quick and fast. Since it doesn't linger you don't get that physical feel of it. When music calls for mid bass this set delivers. Due to its tuning nature bass doesn't color mids. Drums, kick drums and bass guitars sound good on this set. 

Few dB's of mid bass and bit less speed would have made it perfect for me. Again please note that this set is designed to be reference set and in that aspect the bass is perfect. So take my opinion as my bias towards more hard hitting bass in to consideration while reading this section. 

 

Overall Bass /  Low end 4.5/5  

Mids

Vocals are great. They are clean and without any coloration. They sound natural. Vocal reverberations are on point. Be it male vocals or female vocals both are equally good. One thing to note that female vocals don't get intense so Yay! Vocals are neither recessed nor forward. They are balanced well. For me Vocals are perfect. 

Mids also carry alot of instruments. Here they are emphasized correctly . No artificial or off timbre. The instruments don't smear or congest. There is ample space between them. Some who like mid centric tuning might feel mids bit bland but for most it will be as what I have described. 

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble 

 Treble here feels bit forward compared to other aspects of tuning. Treble is smooth no weird peaks or off timbre. It has that open headphones feeling that we all love in the earbuds. All macro and micro details are present. You won't miss them. It highlights them without becoming too over bearing. Soundstage is wide and tall. You get holographic stage. All instruments have enough space and none feel congested. Positional ques are on point. If you like headphones for their openness you will find it here. Treble has enough extension to give that feeling.

Overall Treble 5/5

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

1. Angel by Massive Attack

There is constant sub bass droning in this song and you can hear it but you will miss rumble of it here. Again its expected for any earbud. Mid bass thump is good just for my personal liking bit low. But you will enjoy the drums and kick drums here. Guitars were great. Vocals sound natural. There is no smearing or congestion. This song is taxing on sets if they have muddy bloated bass and bit of dark treble. No such thing here. It does excellently. Overall good reproduction.

Ego Death (feat. Steve Vai) by Polyphia

This song is speed check for driver aka resolving capability. Here this set passes with flying colors. Drums, kick drums, bass guitars sound good just lack physical rumble of sub bass. Cymbals sound good. Guitars can get bit intense in some instances but not harsh. Overall good reproduction of this song.

 

My Heart will Go On by Celine Dion

This song is one of my favorite female vocal songs. Here Celine sounds so divine. On this set somehow Celine's vocals sound bit muted. It maybe due to tuning choices? Her voice fails to evoke emotions. Mostly female vocals shine on this set. Rest the flutes sound great. Other instruments sound natural. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Shape of you by Ed Sheeran

Bass beats are on point. Ed sounds great. Charm of his voice is preserved. Tuning of this set makes the song enjoyable. Feels like the set was meant for it. I felt that most modern pop songs  sound great on this set. There are multitude  of different instruments playing in chorus. Yet no smearing or congestion was felt. Overall great reproduction.

Please do understand that as reviewer I have to be critical about each and every aspect. As to present clear picture of the set.  So what I have mentioned may not be your experience.  

  

Final Conclusion :

Engin-ear has always been interesting brand for me. They are constantly pushing boundaries. They have their own designed shell and don't use generic shells. Earlier they had created planar earbuds called Platheads. It was limited run I couldn't get one at that time. That buds were truly risky move on their part. Irrespective of market reception I think this brand is ready for risk taking and doesn't shy away from it. They are spending time and money on R&D. 

In line with this AMC was launched the topic of this review. AMC has unique features such a

dampening gel in stem and passive radiator. These do work in my opinion. On first listen you won't feel it but upon repeated usage you will spot effect of these. I find AMC to be refined product. Its tuned to be reference grade if I am not wrong. The bass mids and vocals their tuning shows it. Bass here is no means less or anemic just it is quality over quantity and my preference for more mid bass that I have graded it less. Other wise this bass tuning is adequate for reference grade set. Vocals are well balanced with respect to bass and treble. So it never feels recessed. It's balanced. Treble is USP of this set. Its tuned to be smooth and bit forward. It covers all macro and micro details. Makes it very detailed set. Still not harsh or bright set. You will get all the details. Soundstage is really nice gives that open wide spacious feeling. In complex songs you will like this tuning as it shines in such situations.  

 

So I think this is reference bud meant to enjoy music casually and at the same time for technical analysis or to dissect music. It will fit like glove in all situations. It is truly as per its name Acoustic Memory Cleanser.It helps you to reset your ears. It is really a reset for ears after listening to colored sets. Its like fresh perspective. Just remember bassheads this is not set for you. Neutral lovers rejoice and trebleheads would also appreciate this set. I am so impressed that I can easily recommend this set . I wish Engin-ear all the best for future endeavors and I will keep my eyes open for any new release from them.

 

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab cup of coffee and let's get high on the safe high i.e. Music.

​Chapter 43: The Cake

​Earth Time: March 12, 2677.

​Location: The outer arm of the Milky Way, the very fringes of our galaxy.

​“Here we are,” Navigator Masato muttered, pointing a finger at the holographic map before taking a heavy swig of coffee.

​“Holy shit... and we crossed all that in just over a year thanks to the Pathfinder? Masato, how many light-years is that, exactly?”

​Masato scratched his head absentmindedly.

​“We aren’t traveling in a straight line, but ‘at a glance,’ if you measured it with a ruler, it’s about forty-five, maybe fifty thousand light-years. The Galaxy itself is a hundred thousand in diameter, after all. I’m talking about our Earth light-years, mind you, not the universal ones.”

​“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Lyra replied, narrowing her eyes as she studied the projection. “I can see it on the map. It’s a hell of a long way.”

​“Our long-range recon fleet is still the closest,” Masato continued. “The other Pathfinders and their fleets headed for the far side of the Galaxy. They couldn't cut through the center. During the halts between the sequential creation, scanning, and expansion of quantum tunnels, you have to transition back into normal space, and there... there the radiation is so lethal that not even our probes found a single Crustacean in the core. Life simply cannot exist there.”

​“Damn it, Masato,” Lyra snapped. “Why are they hauling ass the long way around, sticking only to the galactic plane? Space is three-dimensional; they could just ‘jump’ over or under it.”

​Masato gave a thin, pale smile and set down his empty mug.

​“You’re forgetting the point of this trip. We’re here to warn other civilizations and establish contact with new races and potential allies. We won’t do that by flying through the intergalactic void, where your only company is dark matter and your own thoughts. We have to stay where the life is.”

​“Fair point,” Lyra admitted.

​Masato slid his hand across her hip and then lower, digging his fingers into her buttock. Beneath his skin, an unnatural, heavy desire pulsed.

​“Are you in the mood for...?”

​Lyra smiled, though a coldness lurked in her eyes. She took him by the wrist, removing his hand with almost clinical precision.

​“Let go. Keep your hands off for now,” she hissed quietly. “Jimmy is here. Ever since we stopped sleeping together, he’s become morbidly jealous of every touch. He feels every vibration of my tissues through those cursed receptors of theirs.”

​Masato let out a short, dry laugh that sounded more like a cough.

​“Christ, why doesn't he just change husks? I understand the trauma of a 'real' death, a technical error, whatever... but he’s still rotting in that alien reptilian filth.”

​Lyra’s face hardened, turning into a mask of frozen wax.

​“I’m trying to understand him. He simply doesn't want to die again. He’s already felt the light go out once—felt his synapses frying in agony. He doesn't intend to go through that hell again until he’s forced to.”

​She took a step toward the hologram, her movements strangely stiff, as if her joints were fighting her.

​“His current body... that Taharagch... it has no nanites. It ages slowly, following the rhythm of a reptile’s life. But I’ll see him in a human body again once he dies of old age.” She looked down at her hands. “My body is original. It’s over seven hundred years old. That’s seven centuries of being held together solely by microscopic machines that patch my DNA faster than it can fray.”

​She turned abruptly, locking eyes with Masato.

​“I have to ask you something. You start your leave in a week. Are you really going to do it? Inject yourself with that chemical death sentence just so this husk can die? You’ll let your lungs stop pumping oxygen, let your brain turn to mush, just so an updated copy of your consciousness can wake up in new meat on the beaches of L’thaarr? And then, a week later, you’ll do it again? You’ll kill your ‘vacation self’ just to return here as another duplicate?”

​Masato shrugged. It was the gesture of a man who had long ago accepted the fact that he was merely data recorded on a protein matrix.

​“I didn't have the luck you or Jimmy had,” he replied emotionlessly. “During the Crustacean counterattack on Earth, I was just cannon fodder in the mass levy. An infantryman whose only job was to plug holes in the front with his own corpse. I died dozens of times, Lyra. Torn apart, burned, crushed. For me, death is just a procedure. Like a journey where you go to sleep in one place and wake up in another. Pure logistics.”

​Lyra sighed, the sound like the hiss of escaping air.

​“I admire you, Masato. But you’re the exception. Most of us still feel that primal, human fear of death. We’re afraid that during one of these ‘jumps,’ the thing that actually makes us human will simply evaporate. That’s why the rest prefer to rot in their cabins rather than treat themselves to that luxury ritual of suicide.”

​Jimmy stood in the deepest shadows of the war room, almost merging with the wall. His reptilian eyes, devoid of human expression, recorded every detail with inhuman sharpness. He saw Masato’s warm, soft hand tightening on Lyra’s hip. He saw her skin yield under that touch—a touch that for Jimmy was now only a hazy memory from another life.

​He turned away sharply. His movement wasn't human; it was too fluid, too efficient, underpinned by the predatory instinct of a body he loathed. He walked out, the click of his claws against the metal deck sounding in his ears like a sentence.

​On the way to his cabin, every step was an ordeal. Jimmy felt the weight of his tail, a useless ballast dragging behind him like the shadow of an old sin. Beneath the thick, keratinized scales, blood throbbed—cold, thick, devoid of the heat that once defined him as a man, as a mammal.

​“Decades...” he thought, and his tongue flicked out involuntarily, tasting the chemical composition of the air. He smelled dust, grease, and... fear. His own fear.

​For decades, he hadn't felt the touch of another skin. His tactile receptors were calibrated for combat and survival, not tenderness. Every attempt to get close to Lyra ended the same way—he saw the flash of disgust in her eyes that she couldn't hide.

​He was a prisoner in a body crafted by natural evolution and genetics to kill. His hands, tipped with black talons, could rip through the armor of a Crustacean or a G.S.F. soldier alike, but they couldn't embrace a woman without the risk of wounding her. When he tried to speak of love, only a rasping, low growl emerged from his throat.

​He stopped before the bulkhead of his cabin. He looked into the smooth, polished surface of the metal. A monster stared back—a Taharagch with yellow, vertical pupils. This wasn't a disguise. This wasn't a husk that could be removed after duty. This was his only “now.”

​“I don’t blame her,” the thought drifted through his mind, and he felt a phantom heartache in his chest. “Who could love a monster? Who would want to go to bed with a butcher like this?”

​He was a prisoner of the meat, a consciousness shoved into a reptilian form, condemned to observe a happiness in which he could no longer take part.

​He slipped into his dark cabin, the only sound accompanying him being the rhythmic hum of the life-support systems, ensuring his nightmare continued.

​He woke in dense darkness, feeling a burning, wet pain on his chest. Looming over him, pinning him to the berth with a weight he couldn't throw off, was Mo’hirra. Her talons were slowly, with almost surgical precision, carving deep, bloody furrows into his scales.

​“Jimmy... you are the only male of my species on this ship,” she rasped, her voice a vibration, a growl devoid of tenderness. “And I have my needs.”

​She was a brilliant xenobiologist, a mind capable of analyzing the most intricate structures of life, but in this moment, her intellect served only primal lust. She knew everything about the mistake that had trapped a human consciousness in this reptilian husk. She knew the name “Jimmy” was just the shadow of a man who had long ago ceased to exist in the material world. But she didn't care. To her, in this stifling darkness, all that mattered was the satisfaction of a biological imperative—the blind, merciless instinct of the cloaca that recognized no compromise.

​Jimmy was paralyzed by pure, animal fear. He remembered the medical reports he had once read with safe detachment, and Kael’s memories. He saw the furrows on his friend’s body and the scars left before the nanites could regenerate and repair them. Macabre evidence of encounters where the nanites could barely keep up with the regeneration of torn tissue. What was an act of intimacy for humans was a brutal struggle for the Taharagch.

​He realized with horror that theory had just become his new, bloody reality. He was no longer an observer, nor Lyra’s husband longing for a touch. He had become biological material. Now, he was the one being processed.

​The scheduled ""morning"" in the cramped cabin turned out to be the most bearable Jimmy had felt in decades. The brutal, almost animalistic act the Taharagch female had forced upon him had, paradoxically, become the only cure for the broken heart rotting inside him. “Lyra is probably fucking that navigator right now,” he thought with cold, bitter satisfaction. “At least I’m not alone in this grave anymore.”

​He looked at his chest. The Taharagch possessed no nanites; their bodies knew nothing of the sterile magic of Swarm technology, but their biology was powerful and primal. The wounds inflicted by Mo’hirra were already closing; the blood had dried into dark scabs, and the edges of the torn scales were smoothing out in the process of natural regeneration.

​Mo’hirra lay beside him. Her tail—a hard, muscular coil of cold tissue—was still wrapped around his leg, as if even in sleep she had no intention of letting her prize go. When she opened her eyes, her vertical pupils narrowed, assessing his reaction.

​“Thanks,” she rasped, a hint of predatory appreciation in her voice. “For a first time, you didn't do too badly.”

​“Aren't you staying for coffee?” Jimmy asked, and then, feeling the weight of his own alien throat, added: “Or harakt? I can prepare that, at least.”

​Mo’hirra jerked her head up, her nostrils quivering.

​“Don’t tell me you have harakt?”

​“I do. I’ve grown fond of the stuff. In this body, it hits the nerves better than anything else,” Jimmy replied. “As a G.S.F. colonel and a soldier who always knew how to stay on the good side of logistics, I know how to get supplies others can only dream of. I can arrange—”

​He didn't finish. Mo’hirra lunged at him, pinning him to the berth once more, her mass and the scent of musk filling the cabin.

​“Fine,” she hissed straight into his face. “I’ll stay. Brew the draught, soldier.”

​The mess hall during the afternoon meal was filled with the metallic clatter of cutlery and the heavy smell of synthetic proteins. Lyra sat alone, picking at her plate, her gaze involuntarily drifting toward Jimmy. Over the last few decades, their relationship had resembled a slow necrosis—a marriage that, after he lost his human husk, had shattered into microscopic, jagged pieces. Usually, she would remain silent for days, sometimes weeks, feeding him only coldness.

​It was always Jimmy who reached out. He was the one who would scratch at her cabin bulkhead, begging for even a shred of human closeness, a shadow of their old life.

​“What’s going on?” the thought flashed through her mind, and she tasted the bitter gall in her mouth. “It’s been a week. Seven cycles during which he hasn't shown up at my door once.”

​She knew sex was impossible—her seven-hundred-year-old, fragile body wouldn't survive the brutality of a Taharagch, and besides, she didn't even want to try; the very thought disgusted her—but his presence had been a constant, almost intrusive part of her existence. She remembered how she used to scold Jimmy for judging Kael’s marriage to a Ta'hirim. She had called him a closet racist, lectured him on tolerance and the beauty of interspecies bonds. Even though he had only been joking about Kael and the Ta'hirim and their successful relationship. Yet when fate played its joke and shoved her husband’s consciousness into a scaly, predatory carcass, she was the one who turned out to be the xenophobe. She couldn't stand the smell of his skin, the glow of his vertical yellow pupils, or the weight of his presence. She was repulsed by him.

​Suddenly, her gaze froze. She saw Mo’hirra, the xenobiologist, walking past Jimmy’s table with predatory grace. She noticed Jimmy lift his head, and a smile spread across his reptilian face—wide, sincere, terrifying in its saurian nature, yet carrying a rare glow of satisfaction. Mo’hirra answered him with a barely perceptible twitch of her tail.

​In that same instant, Lyra felt a sharp stab in her chest. It wasn't a nanite software glitch or the twitch of a tired heart. It was a sharp, physical thrust of jealousy that tore into her seven-hundred-year-old tissue like a rusted knife.

​The days dripped down the ship’s bulkheads like thick grease. Two weeks passed. On a Sparta-class ship, despite its titanic proportions, avoiding someone for that long required almost military strategy. Jimmy stopped asking, stopped whimpering at her door, stopped being the background noise of her existence. And that hurt the most.

​“God damn it, he’s definitely with her,” she thought, clenching her fists so hard her nails dug into her palms. “Mo’hirra.” The only native Taharagch female in this sea of human meat. That reptilian, lizard bitch knew exactly who she was sleeping with. She knew Jimmy was Lyra’s husband, that their history went back centuries, that they were bound by a vow that death and a change of husks shouldn't invalidate. What right did she have to touch him? What right did she have to seize something that belonged to Lyra?

​A wave of burning hypocrisy hit her, one she didn't want to name. Masato was just ""hygiene"" for her, a soulless ritual to drown out the void. It was “just fun,” a safe way to satisfy needs in a world where her real husband had become a monster. But the other side? That raw, reptilian strength Mo’hirra emanated had clearly ripped Jimmy out of his orbit of suffering.

​She was disgusted by Jimmy; she couldn't stand his scales and his cold breath, yet now that he had stopped being her faithful, rejected dog, she felt rage. She wanted to have her cake and eat it too—she wanted to despise her lizard-husband while simultaneously having him at her beck and call as a guarantor of her past and future. Mo’hirra hadn't just “stolen” her husband. She had exposed the fact that Lyra was no longer his only choice.

​Lyra approached Jimmy’s table with a mug of steaming coffee in her hands, trying to force her face into an expression of casual, almost domestic kindness. She looked like a shadow of her former self, trying to recreate the rituals from a time when their lives weren't yet a ruin.

​“What are you up to this evening?” she asked, her voice soft but sounding unnatural in the stifling atmosphere of the mess hall. “Maybe... you’d like to watch a movie with me? Like we used to?”

​Jimmy raised his head. His vertical pupils narrowed, scanning her form with inhuman calm. There was no trace of the old anticipation in him, no tremor of muscle that would betray joy at her interest. He answered her in the calm, gravelly voice of a Taharagch, which seemed to vibrate in the very metal of the floor.

​“No,” he cut her off, the sound dry and final. “I have other plans.”

​Lyra froze, her mug halfway to her lips, disbelief mixed with rising irritation flashing in her eyes. She wasn't used to being refused by her “monster.”

​“Other plans?” she repeated, struggling for composure, though she was shaking inside with jealousy over Mo’hirra.

​“Watch something with Masato,” Jimmy continued, fixing her with a dispassionate stare. “He’s back from leave today, after all. They’re ‘printing’ him right now; he’ll probably step out of the vat as a new, fresh copy any minute. He’s the one you spend your time with, Lyra. Don’t waste it on me.”

​He stood up and turned away, leaving her alone with her steaming coffee and a striking truth she didn't want to accept. This, in all likelihood, was the end of their marriage.

I am from Southern Europe and there are so many things that I miss. My weekends all look the same, with barely no plans just playing final fantasy VII at home lol

Don't get me wrong I have a great group of friends, but I find doing new things and meeting new people so hard. I'm supposed to be doing the right thing, I do sports and get to meet some people, but all of them seem to have a strong divide between a hobby and their personal life. Back home when I was training the same thing, it took only some days to go for beers with the people I trained with. 

I'm not a hypocrite, I moved here to get a job and that is the reason why I stayed. But I feel now there's so much more to life than that. Some friends have left already, and although they might deal with shit at work I don't have to, they seem overall happier with their lives. 

I feel my options here during free time are limited, everything is so planned well in advance, you even need a booking sometimes to get a coffee which makes me go crazy. In my opinion the lack of cultural activities is also very disappointing. 

On the other hand I feel that people from Munich like it like that, to have a quiet city where you can easily go to work, form a family, and be relaxed. 

I feel that the lack of spontaneity is also killing my motivation and affecting my mood. Back home the weekend comes, I text two friends and we might be out all day doing stuff. Here people agree to go for a coffee or dinner weeks in advance. Although I have many good friends I feel I will never fit into this society. 

Does anyone else feel the same way or am I the only one? Feel free to send me a pm too if you want to meet someone new. ",25,1770452675.0,munichsocialclub,13,0.9,False

Another week another review. Today's product is close to my heart category. The good old Earbuds or flatheads as we like to call them today due to TWS stealing their name. I have bunch of them few from brands and few from custom builders. Anyways the product is Engin-Ear AMC (Acoustic Memory Cleanser). Well isn't it mouthful. Well read on its not that difficult once we get accustomed to & once you start listening to it. You will understand why it is named so. Well origin story here is, few months back I was surfing on Instagram and a post by Engin-ear came in my feed as I have been following them for sometime. It was about a new product launch and its they were looking for people to review it. I had chance to listen to their earlier product L300 and was genuinely interested in their unique planar buds the Plaheads which for some personal reasons at the time of launch I couldn't get them. So my curiosity was in high gear mode. I replied to that post and well to my surprise they replied back. One thing led to another and in Month of January 2026 I finally got in my hands The AMC buds. Now to present day, I present to you my attempt to review these unique earbuds. Please read till end to find out what I feel about them.   

A massive thank you to Engin-ear for providing prototype for review without that this review wouldn't be possible.

I was neither paid to do this review nor received any kind of compensation towards it. All thoughts and opinions expressed are mine. Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged. Let's get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Since I have gotten final prototype. It will be similar to retail product. The shells are 3D printed and feel solid in hand. Stems are designed in way to help improve fit. The shell has gel to seal off the stems and to dissolve vibrations. There is passive Radiator inside the shell. What these features have impact you will see in my review. Since this was MMCX version of the bud. I had no cable. Cables used were mine. I used both copper and SPC cables to test it. Sponge covers used were provided by brand.   

Technical Specifications :

15.4 mm dynamic Driver. Pu+ Beryllium diaphragm. Impedance rating is 30 Ohms and sensitivity is 115 dB

Sources :

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

These earbuds are very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive these earbuds with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So these earbuds are scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze + Shanling M1 Plus > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

 Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

   

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls 

Sound impressions :

Bass / Low end

Bass is here quality over quantity type. Bass is audiophile level. It has mid bass over sub bass. As with any earbuds sub bass lacks its element. Here it is similar but not a con as all earbuds suffer from it. Mid bass has thump but lacks physicality due to being quick and fast. Since it doesn't linger you don't get that physical feel of it. When music calls for mid bass this set delivers. Due to its tuning nature bass doesn't color mids. Drums, kick drums and bass guitars sound good on this set. 

Few dB's of mid bass and bit less speed would have made it perfect for me. Again please note that this set is designed to be reference set and in that aspect the bass is perfect. So take my opinion as my bias towards more hard hitting bass in to consideration while reading this section. 

 

Overall Bass /  Low end 4.5/5  

Mids

Vocals are great. They are clean and without any coloration. They sound natural. Vocal reverberations are on point. Be it male vocals or female vocals both are equally good. One thing to note that female vocals don't get intense so Yay! Vocals are neither recessed nor forward. They are balanced well. For me Vocals are perfect. 

Mids also carry alot of instruments. Here they are emphasized correctly . No artificial or off timbre. The instruments don't smear or congest. There is ample space between them. Some who like mid centric tuning might feel mids bit bland but for most it will be as what I have described. 

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble 

 Treble here feels bit forward compared to other aspects of tuning. Treble is smooth no weird peaks or off timbre. It has that open headphones feeling that we all love in the earbuds. All macro and micro details are present. You won't miss them. It highlights them without becoming too over bearing. Soundstage is wide and tall. You get holographic stage. All instruments have enough space and none feel congested. Positional ques are on point. If you like headphones for their openness you will find it here. Treble has enough extension to give that feeling.

Overall Treble 5/5

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

1. Angel by Massive Attack

There is constant sub bass droning in this song and you can hear it but you will miss rumble of it here. Again its expected for any earbud. Mid bass thump is good just for my personal liking bit low. But you will enjoy the drums and kick drums here. Guitars were great. Vocals sound natural. There is no smearing or congestion. This song is taxing on sets if they have muddy bloated bass and bit of dark treble. No such thing here. It does excellently. Overall good reproduction.

Ego Death (feat. Steve Vai) by Polyphia

This song is speed check for driver aka resolving capability. Here this set passes with flying colors. Drums, kick drums, bass guitars sound good just lack physical rumble of sub bass. Cymbals sound good. Guitars can get bit intense in some instances but not harsh. Overall good reproduction of this song.

 

My Heart will Go On by Celine Dion

This song is one of my favorite female vocal songs. Here Celine sounds so divine. On this set somehow Celine's vocals sound bit muted. It maybe due to tuning choices? Her voice fails to evoke emotions. Mostly female vocals shine on this set. Rest the flutes sound great. Other instruments sound natural. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Shape of you by Ed Sheeran

Bass beats are on point. Ed sounds great. Charm of his voice is preserved. Tuning of this set makes the song enjoyable. Feels like the set was meant for it. I felt that most modern pop songs  sound great on this set. There are multitude  of different instruments playing in chorus. Yet no smearing or congestion was felt. Overall great reproduction.

Please do understand that as reviewer I have to be critical about each and every aspect. As to present clear picture of the set.  So what I have mentioned may not be your experience.  

  

Final Conclusion :

Engin-ear has always been interesting brand for me. They are constantly pushing boundaries. They have their own designed shell and don't use generic shells. Earlier they had created planar earbuds called Platheads. It was limited run I couldn't get one at that time. That buds were truly risky move on their part. Irrespective of market reception I think this brand is ready for risk taking and doesn't shy away from it. They are spending time and money on R&D. 

In line with this AMC was launched the topic of this review. AMC has unique features such a

dampening gel in stem and passive radiator. These do work in my opinion. On first listen you won't feel it but upon repeated usage you will spot effect of these. I find AMC to be refined product. Its tuned to be reference grade if I am not wrong. The bass mids and vocals their tuning shows it. Bass here is no means less or anemic just it is quality over quantity and my preference for more mid bass that I have graded it less. Other wise this bass tuning is adequate for reference grade set. Vocals are well balanced with respect to bass and treble. So it never feels recessed. It's balanced. Treble is USP of this set. Its tuned to be smooth and bit forward. It covers all macro and micro details. Makes it very detailed set. Still not harsh or bright set. You will get all the details. Soundstage is really nice gives that open wide spacious feeling. In complex songs you will like this tuning as it shines in such situations.  

 

So I think this is reference bud meant to enjoy music casually and at the same time for technical analysis or to dissect music. It will fit like glove in all situations. It is truly as per its name Acoustic Memory Cleanser.It helps you to reset your ears. It is really a reset for ears after listening to colored sets. Its like fresh perspective. Just remember bassheads this is not set for you. Neutral lovers rejoice and trebleheads would also appreciate this set. I am so impressed that I can easily recommend this set . I wish Engin-ear all the best for future endeavors and I will keep my eyes open for any new release from them.

 

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab cup of coffee and let's get high on the safe high i.e. Music.

1qy8fka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qy8fka/22_years_old_extremely_controlling_parents_no/,"22 years old, extremely controlling parents, no independence, and I feel like marriage is my only escape. I’m exhausted and scared.","I don’t even know where to start. I guess I just need to get this out somewhere because I feel like I’m suffocating and I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this.

I’m 22 years old and my parents control every single aspect of my life. And I don’t mean “they’re strict” in a casual way. I mean what I eat, what I study, where I go, who I talk to, how I look, and what I’m allowed to want for myself.

For the past one full year, I have not left the house for anything except university. That’s it. No coffee with friends. No birthdays. No casual hangouts. Nothing. My friends still invite me to things like parties, dinners, simple get-togethers and every single time I have to say no. I know they’re disappointment in me. Some of them don’t even bother asking anymore, and that hurts more than I want to admit.

For context: I’m Muslim. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I don’t do drugs. I don’t party. I’ve never had a boyfriend and I don’t plan to. I’ve done everything “right.” And yet, my parents still don’t trust me at all. It feels like no matter how careful or obedient I am, it’s never enough.

Recently, I wanted to dye my hair. Nothing wild. Nothing inappropriate. I just wanted to do something for myself for once. My mom immediately said no. End of discussion. And that’s how it always goes. Any time I want to do something that brings me even a little joy or autonomy, I’m told:

“You can do all that after you get married.”

I cannot explain how hopeless that makes me feel.

At this point, I catch myself thinking, maybe I should just get married already. Not because I want to, but because it feels like the only door out of this life. And that thought terrifies me. I don’t want to marry just to escape. I’m scared that the man I end up with will control me the same way my parents do, and then I’ll be trapped all over again just in a different house.

I can’t move out because I can’t afford it. I’m not allowed to work a proper job. I do a little freelance social media work for small companies, but the income is tiny and nowhere near enough to support myself. I’m not allowed to take public transport. I’m not allowed to drive even though I have a license. I’m not allowed to work anywhere unless someone physically takes me and no one will.

So I’m stuck. Completely dependent. Completely monitored. Completely powerless.

Sometimes it feels like my life is on pause while everyone else is moving forward making memories, learning who they are. Meanwhile, I’m just waiting. Waiting to be “allowed” to live. Waiting for marriage to magically unlock basic freedom, which feels so deeply unfair and wrong.

What makes this even harder is that my parents are now pushing for marriage soon. Arranged marriage. They want it to happen ASAP. And I am so scared. I lowkey don’t want to get married yet. I don’t feel ready. I don’t even know who I am outside of their control. But I also don’t see any other way out, and that thought makes me feel desperate in a way I’ve never felt before.

I don’t hate my parents. I know they think they’re protecting me. But I feel trapped, infantilized, and invisible. I feel like I’m slowly disappearing as a person.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to ask for freedom when every attempt is shut down. I don’t know how to become independent when I’m blocked at every step. I don’t know if waiting is the answer, or if waiting will just break me.

If anyone has been through something like this especially with strict or controlling families, I would really appreciate any advice, perspective, or even just reassurance that I’m not alone.

And if nothing else… thank you for letting me vent. I really needed to say this somewhere.",1,1770452516.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Sound impressions :

Bass / Low end

Bass is here quality over quantity type. Bass is audiophile level. It has mid bass over sub bass. As with any earbuds sub bass lacks its element. Here it is similar but not a con as all earbuds suffer from it. Mid bass has thump but lacks physicality due to being quick and fast. Since it doesn't linger you don't get that physical feel of it. When music calls for mid bass this set delivers. Due to its tuning nature bass doesn't color mids. Drums, kick drums and bass guitars sound good on this set. 

Few dB's of mid bass and bit less speed would have made it perfect for me. Again please note that this set is designed to be reference set and in that aspect the bass is perfect. So take my opinion as my bias towards more hard hitting bass in to consideration while reading this section. 

 

Overall Bass /  Low end 4.5/5  

Mids

Vocals are great. They are clean and without any coloration. They sound natural. Vocal reverberations are on point. Be it male vocals or female vocals both are equally good. One thing to note that female vocals don't get intense so Yay! Vocals are neither recessed nor forward. They are balanced well. For me Vocals are perfect. 

Mids also carry alot of instruments. Here they are emphasized correctly . No artificial or off timbre. The instruments don't smear or congest. There is ample space between them. Some who like mid centric tuning might feel mids bit bland but for most it will be as what I have described. 

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble 

 Treble here feels bit forward compared to other aspects of tuning. Treble is smooth no weird peaks or off timbre. It has that open headphones feeling that we all love in the earbuds. All macro and micro details are present. You won't miss them. It highlights them without becoming too over bearing. Soundstage is wide and tall. You get holographic stage. All instruments have enough space and none feel congested. Positional ques are on point. If you like headphones for their openness you will find it here. Treble has enough extension to give that feeling.

Overall Treble 5/5

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

1. Angel by Massive Attack

There is constant sub bass droning in this song and you can hear it but you will miss rumble of it here. Again its expected for any earbud. Mid bass thump is good just for my personal liking bit low. But you will enjoy the drums and kick drums here. Guitars were great. Vocals sound natural. There is no smearing or congestion. This song is taxing on sets if they have muddy bloated bass and bit of dark treble. No such thing here. It does excellently. Overall good reproduction.

Ego Death (feat. Steve Vai) by Polyphia

This song is speed check for driver aka resolving capability. Here this set passes with flying colors. Drums, kick drums, bass guitars sound good just lack physical rumble of sub bass. Cymbals sound good. Guitars can get bit intense in some instances but not harsh. Overall good reproduction of this song.

 

My Heart will Go On by Celine Dion

This song is one of my favorite female vocal songs. Here Celine sounds so divine. On this set somehow Celine's vocals sound bit muted. It maybe due to tuning choices? Her voice fails to evoke emotions. Mostly female vocals shine on this set. Rest the flutes sound great. Other instruments sound natural. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Shape of you by Ed Sheeran

Bass beats are on point. Ed sounds great. Charm of his voice is preserved. Tuning of this set makes the song enjoyable. Feels like the set was meant for it. I felt that most modern pop songs  sound great on this set. There are multitude  of different instruments playing in chorus. Yet no smearing or congestion was felt. Overall great reproduction.

Please do understand that as reviewer I have to be critical about each and every aspect. As to present clear picture of the set.  So what I have mentioned may not be your experience.  

  

Final Conclusion :

Engin-ear has always been interesting brand for me. They are constantly pushing boundaries. They have their own designed shell and don't use generic shells. Earlier they had created planar earbuds called Platheads. It was limited run I couldn't get one at that time. That buds were truly risky move on their part. Irrespective of market reception I think this brand is ready for risk taking and doesn't shy away from it. They are spending time and money on R&D. 

In line with this AMC was launched the topic of this review. AMC has unique features such a

dampening gel in stem and passive radiator. These do work in my opinion. On first listen you won't feel it but upon repeated usage you will spot effect of these. I find AMC to be refined product. Its tuned to be reference grade if I am not wrong. The bass mids and vocals their tuning shows it. Bass here is no means less or anemic just it is quality over quantity and my preference for more mid bass that I have graded it less. Other wise this bass tuning is adequate for reference grade set. Vocals are well balanced with respect to bass and treble. So it never feels recessed. It's balanced. Treble is USP of this set. Its tuned to be smooth and bit forward. It covers all macro and micro details. Makes it very detailed set. Still not harsh or bright set. You will get all the details. Soundstage is really nice gives that open wide spacious feeling. In complex songs you will like this tuning as it shines in such situations.  

 

So I think this is reference bud meant to enjoy music casually and at the same time for technical analysis or to dissect music. It will fit like glove in all situations. It is truly as per its name Acoustic Memory Cleanser.It helps you to reset your ears. It is really a reset for ears after listening to colored sets. Its like fresh perspective. Just remember bassheads this is not set for you. Neutral lovers rejoice and trebleheads would also appreciate this set. I am so impressed that I can easily recommend this set . I wish Engin-ear all the best for future endeavors and I will keep my eyes open for any new release from them.

 

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab cup of coffee and let's get high on the safe high i.e. Music.

Another week another review. Today's product is close to my heart category. The good old Earbuds or flatheads as we like to call them today due to TWS stealing their name. I have bunch of them few from brands and few from custom builders. Anyways the product is Engin-Ear AMC (Acoustic Memory Cleanser). Well isn't it mouthful. Well read on its not that difficult once we get accustomed to & once you start listening to it. You will understand why it is named so. Well origin story here is, few months back I was surfing on Instagram and a post by Engin-ear came in my feed as I have been following them for sometime. It was about a new product launch and its they were looking for people to review it. I had chance to listen to their earlier product L300 and was genuinely interested in their unique planar buds the Plaheads which for some personal reasons at the time of launch I couldn't get them. So my curiosity was in high gear mode. I replied to that post and well to my surprise they replied back. One thing led to another and in Month of January 2026 I finally got in my hands The AMC buds. Now to present day, I present to you my attempt to review these unique earbuds. Please read till end to find out what I feel about them.   

A massive thank you to Engin-ear for providing prototype for review without that this review wouldn't be possible.

I was neither paid to do this review nor received any kind of compensation towards it. All thoughts and opinions expressed are mine. Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged. Let's get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Since I have gotten final prototype. It will be similar to retail product. The shells are 3D printed and feel solid in hand. Stems are designed in way to help improve fit. The shell has gel to seal off the stems and to dissolve vibrations. There is passive Radiator inside the shell. What these features have impact you will see in my review. Since this was MMCX version of the bud. I had no cable. Cables used were mine. I used both copper and SPC cables to test it. Sponge covers used were provided by brand.   

Technical Specifications :

15.4 mm dynamic Driver. Pu+ Beryllium diaphragm. Impedance rating is 30 Ohms and sensitivity is 115 dB

Sources :

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

These earbuds are very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive these earbuds with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So these earbuds are scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze + Shanling M1 Plus > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources.

1qy8eqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1qy8eqa/msc_nonalcoholic_beverage_packs/,MSC Non-Alcoholic Beverage Packs,"Hi everyone! I'd like to share some of MSC Cruises' policies we've observed that are truly appalling.



First of all, they don't allow you to book a cruise with an alcohol-free package. They force you to choose either a basic drinks package or a premium drinks package. When you go to book, either online or by phone, there is NO option other than ""ALCOHOL PACKAGE OR NOTHING."" What does this mean? It means that if you want bottled water, soft drinks, etc., they offer you the alcoholic option, and then you're expected to not use it. Why should I pay for alcoholic drinks if I'm not going to drink? Exactly. There's also the option of going without a package and having tap water, that awful brewed coffee, and seasonal juices with 90% sugar that are disgusting. Once on board, they let you buy an alcohol-free package for €30 per person per day—yes, €30 per person per day. About a year ago, MSC decided to reduce the unlimited drinks package to 15 per person per day, presenting it as a measure to encourage moderate consumption. This is clearly a marketing ploy, as choosing a non-alcoholic option is incredibly difficult. I also know from fellow cruisers that if you gamble a lot of money in the casino, they give you free alcohol. I'll leave it at that. MSC strikes me as a company with a deplorable policy and a shameful double standard. Best regards to all.",0,1770452430.0,MSCCruises,6,0.5,False

I brew for only filter coffee and use light roasts. I’ve heard great things about both the A2 and Ode 2, so those are my top choices.

If I go for the A2, I can buy it right now, but if I decide to get the Ode 2, then I’ll just have to save for it over a few paychecks.

I’m in Canada - the A2 is around $110 CAD, and the Ode 2 is $500, I think I’ve seen it as low as $399 around Black Friday, so I’ll probably wait for another sale if I go for the ode.

So, should I pull the trigger on the A2, or wait a bit for the ode?

Just a side note, I don’t mind hand grinders at all. So a kingrinder k6 or something from 1zpresso would work as well and I’d kinda like the external adjustment that comes with it.

Thanks!",2,1770452311.0,pourover,5,1.0,False
