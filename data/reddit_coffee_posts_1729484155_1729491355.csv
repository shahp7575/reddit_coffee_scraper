1g8j2b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1g8j2b9/how_much_of_this_is_genetics/,How much of this is genetics,"I have an almost 4 year old dachshund. He is a perfect boy honestly. We have tons of guests over all the time, he loves people, he has big and small doggie friends. he isn‚Äôt reactive toward people at all and i‚Äôm honestly so grateful because my heart goes out to those who‚Äôs pups struggle with people AND dog reactivity. but my dog is only really reactive *around me*. after all my research i‚Äôve come to the conclusion it may be a form of resource guarding (?) however he doesn‚Äôt guard me around the home like i‚Äôve seen some ppl share online. this behavior is typical in velcro dogs especially dachshunds. my dog doesn‚Äôt care if for example im sitting with my partner. this behavior is mainly around other dogs.
i have multiple examples but here are a few:

1. he isn‚Äôt reactive when anyone else watches him. when my friends dog sit- they take him out, walk by other dogs, go to the store. he‚Äôs completely neutral. one time my friend sent me a video of MY DOG SNIFFING A CAT WHO WAS ON A WALK ON A LEASH HE WAS LITERALLY SNIFFING HER with neutral body language and then continued on his walk. do you know how much that sucks. when i walk him and see cats- he wants to eat them 
2. when i leave for work my partner says he hardly barks. but when im home he‚Äôs always checking the windows and being a typical dachshund (loud)
3. Since he was a newborn i have taken him to work with me. he hardly goes now. even before he ever started showing signs of reactivity- he used to see dogs coming in (to my work) and he didn‚Äôt care! i‚Äôve chalked this up to him possibly thinking this is his territory as he‚Äôs gotten older? and he‚Äôs guarding it? 



I started seeing changes in him pretty suddenly and randomly one day (around 2 years old) we were at the farmers market (full of dogs obviously but we used to go every weekend). and out of no where he went crazy barking at a golden retriever. i was literally shocked and gutted because he had never shown any signs of this type of behavior before. not to mention embarrassing. i was on a date :))))))) and the person was like ü§®woah he‚Äôs fiestyüòûüòûüòû (awful) 

i used to take him to work, coffee shops, you name it. i worked so hard to socialize him, avoid bad situations, and tried to do everything right. i always had a voice in my head telling me ‚Äúwhat if he becomes reactive‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if you don‚Äôt train him right‚Äù and it‚Äôs actually crazy this has become my reality. my friends thought i was insane when he was a puppy bc i was a ‚Äúhelicopter mom‚Äù and would binge training videos and i was constantly trying to do the right thing for him. i did everything you‚Äôre supposed to do. he is so obedient, knows tons of tricks, was crate trained in one week and potty trained in 2 months (and that‚Äôs impressive for a dachshund ) etc etc.

Alls this to say - i struggle so much with the mental toll this takes on me. he used to be a coffee shop dog and do tons of errands with me. he has a huge yard, we go on tons of walks plus he has ‚Äúsafe‚Äù dog friends whom he grew up with and gets to hang with. everyone tells me he is the most spoiled dog. and he is! but he‚Äôs so young and i feel terrible that his life looks different now. i struggle to accept the changes and when new friends ask for dog playdates i can‚Äôt accept because im so afraid of an introduction going badly. people at work ask me why he doesn‚Äôt come in anymore. my partner wants our dog to be able to get along with his family dog. their first introduction didn‚Äôt go (no one got hurt because i noticed signs immediately) but im terrified to try again and the family keeps asking when they will get to play together. i SWEARRRR if i wasn‚Äôt event there and my partner did the introduction between the two dogs it probably would‚Äôve gone great. 

if you read all this your a real one. if anyone‚Äôs experienced anything similar i‚Äôd love to hear how you deal with the changes. it‚Äôs so embarrassing and i know it shouldn‚Äôt be. i‚Äôve been wanting to hire a trainer/behaviorist it‚Äôs just so expensive.

1g8j05e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g8j05e/how_to_style_your_home_with_statement_furniture/,How to Style Your Home with Statement Furniture Pieces,"When it comes to interior design, nothing makes an impact quite like statement furniture. These bold, eye-catching pieces can transform your home by adding character, depth, and a touch of elegance. Whether you‚Äôre looking to refresh your living room or elevate your dining area, styling your home with statement [furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) is a great way to showcase your personal taste and make your space stand out.

**1. Choose a Focal Point**

When styling with statement furniture, the key is to pick one or two bold pieces that will serve as the focal point of the room. It could be a luxurious armchair, an intricately designed coffee table, or a unique sofa. Once you choose your focal piece, make sure the rest of the room complements it without overwhelming the space.

For instance, if you choose a vibrant, patterned sofa as your statement piece, balance it with neutral or solid-colored rugs, cushions, and wall decor. This helps the statement piece shine while ensuring the room feels cohesive.

**2. Mix and Match Styles**

Incorporating statement pieces allows for creativity and playfulness in mixing different styles. You don‚Äôt have to stick to one design aesthetic. A modern living room can be elevated with a vintage coffee table, or a minimalist bedroom can get a twist with a sculptural armchair. The trick is to blend styles in a way that feels natural and thoughtful. When shopping at your favorite [furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with different textures, materials, and finishes.

**3. Use Bold Colors and Patterns**

Color is a powerful tool in styling your home with statement furniture. Opt for pieces in bold colors like deep blues, rich greens, or warm mustard tones. These vibrant colors instantly catch the eye and add warmth to any room. If you're more into patterns, consider a statement ottoman or side table with a striking design.

Make sure to balance bold colors with more subtle tones in the room. A bright sofa will stand out beautifully against neutral walls and wooden flooring. This helps the room feel both stylish and harmonious.

**4. Embrace Texture and Material**

The texture and material of a piece can also make it a statement. Whether it‚Äôs a rattan armchair, a velvet sofa, or a marble coffee table, the material can significantly influence the feel of the room. Textured pieces like a tufted leather couch or a wooden dining table bring an organic and tactile quality to the space.

When choosing materials, consider the overall mood you want to create. For a cozy, intimate space, fabrics like velvet or wool can make a dramatic statement. For a sleek, modern look, opt for pieces made of metal, glass, or stone.

**5. Keep Scale in Mind**

When styling with statement furniture, size matters. Larger pieces such as oversized sofas or large dining tables demand attention and can define the layout of the entire room. However, it's important to keep the scale in mind, especially in smaller spaces. Avoid cluttering the room with too many oversized pieces‚Äîone or two statement items are enough to create a striking effect.

Smaller rooms benefit from compact yet bold items, such as a stylish side table or a striking armchair. Look for pieces that are versatile yet impactful.

**6. Make Your Furniture Functional and Stylish**

While statement pieces are meant to be visually striking, they should also be functional. A chic console table that doubles as a storage unit or a bold dining table that comfortably seats your family adds value beyond aesthetics. When browsing [home furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), think about how each piece will contribute to the functionality of your space.

**Conclusion**

Styling your home with statement furniture pieces is an exciting way to infuse personality and style into your space. By focusing on a few standout items, you can create an inviting, well-balanced atmosphere. Whether you're exploring new furniture stores or refreshing your current decor, remember that the key to successfully incorporating statement furniture is balance. Let your bold pieces shine while ensuring the rest of the room complements their style.

So, the next time you're ready to elevate your home decor, embrace the power of statement furniture. Not only will it make your space uniquely yours, but it will also leave a lasting impression on anyone who steps inside!",1,1729490878.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Due to unfortunate set of events I became a single mom with an infant. I moved out from my partner, I take care of my child and go to work. My ex-partner is not very much interested in spending a lot of time with the child. 
My life is different now from my friends with no kids, and it is different from my friends who have kids in full classic families. I am mostly on my own with my little one who I love dearly. 
So in the end I start dreading my weekends, as I feel rather isolated and lonely. My kid is too small to go to playgrounds, so I mostly go to stroll around a park with him several times a day, occasional shopping and coffee with friends who are available.  
I wonder if there are any ideas for single moms like me on what to do in Singapore? Not necessarily a club or a group, but I would be definitely keen to do something with a group of ladies in a similar situation. ",1,1729490780.0,askSingapore,0,1.0,False

1g8iyy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g8iyy1/really_struggling_to_move_on_from_a_weird/,Really struggling to move on from a weird situationship ,"Hi. So I‚Äôm having a really hard time moving on. I feel like I‚Äôve accepted the situation for what it was and I know I deserve better and it is a huge lesson learned for me. After the ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù I‚Äôve been no contact with this person. I‚Äôm just struggling to piece the pieces together and understand what happened and most important how exactly I move on from it if I don‚Äôt even fully understand the nature of the relationship. 

I met this boy let‚Äôs call him B. B and I met in college as we had a few classes together. B was really charming very attractive and took an interest in me right away. We locked eyes from across the room and immediately hit it off. We went on a couple dates and talked everyday for about three months. It was fun, but B was often really busy and our communication, though we talked everyday, was mostly small talk. Whenever I would try to get more vulnerable or have deeper conversations he would not reciprocate and would normally try to change the subject. In person he seemed really into me but outside of that it was confusing and hard for him to communicate feelings. He would send me songs that had cute lyrics, but I never really knew if he was sending them to me to relate to them or just because he thought they were cool. I felt I put a lot of effort into a relationship but he never really reciprocated it, so I just let it fizzle out. I expressed how I felt and he told me he understood but that was it. Never offered solutions or put any interest in wanting to be on the same page. I ended up ending things to which he showed no reaction to. It was like everything was completely fine and it was no big deal to him. It hurt for a bit but I figured there was never any care from his part so I figured I should just stop caring as well. I sent a text asking about his day and I never got a reply so I just moved on with my life. 

After a few months of not talking, B reaches out to me asking me to go to a concert with him. I tell him that it‚Äôs a bit weird that he‚Äôs reaching out, especially given how it ended. once again, zero emotion or explanation. He tells me ‚ÄúI suppose so, I understand if you‚Äôre not wanting to go‚Äù with no further details or information. I tell him I would like to discuss what happened first, he agrees to it and promises to call. We talk for a couple days and he never ends up calling, we just text about nothing for a couple days. I remind him about the call, and he doesn‚Äôt really answer just says he will call. It frustrates me that he can‚Äôt set aside time to just give a simple call, so I ghost him. I admit it probably wasn‚Äôt right to do, but I really had no idea what to do. I felt like he would just leave me in a perpetual limbo unsure of when he will call. 

Another few months swing by, and we see each other in person as we both ended up at the same place at the same time somehow. The same instant rush, lock eyes, giggle and whatever cute stuff people do. We end up talking and we talk a bit about random stuff. It was like nothing ever happened. He completely avoids talking about anything that happened. He asks to walk me to my car and asks if he can contact me again. I agree to it and say I would like that, and make it clear that I would like to discuss what happened. He ends up calling me and asks to spend the day with me. I agree. We go to his house (I had already been there a couple times) and I try to bring up what happened but again, he just dodged the conversation. fine. im not going to force him. We end up having a pretty good time and this time, we talk all summer. 

The same issue with never being vulnerable or an item gets brought up. He repeatedly dodged those conversations. I brought up once how this makes me feel and how I think he could benefit from being more vulnerable. He tells me he never thought that of himself but understands now why I think that. The conversation ends there. It is like talking to a wall. 

We continue doing coupley things throughout these 4ish months, he comes over about once a week. We were always intimate with each other, but it hurt my feelings when I noticed a pattern of him leaving right after. It made me feel used and cheap, especially since he was never taking me on dates or doing really anything to make me feel special. I would bake him things, cook him breakfast, gift give and none of that was ever returned. 

I can only really remember all the hurt and confusion. He would insinuate we were a couple, talking about getting married and telling me he cares about me, but never asked me to be his girlfriend or anything. I asked him if he was looking for a friends with benefits situation and he said ‚ÄúI suppose so‚Ä¶‚Äù and quickly changed the subject. Refused to talk about it further. 

I didn‚Äôt push for it and let myself decide if I was okay with that. I decided why not try it out, which I really regret because it was not what I wanted at all and I think I hurt myself even more because of this decision. 


We never set boundaries or talked about it further. it seemed like he did not want anything to progress past what we were already doing, but I did not like that he never hugged or cuddled me after being intimate and would often just leave. Finally I broke down and told him it hurt my feelings deeply and made me feel super used. I apologized for being emotional and told him maybe a fwb is not beneficial for me and I don‚Äôt think I can do that. He told me he understood and never wanted to hurt me and would love to hug and cuddle me afterwards. He expressed that he was sorry for completely ignoring my needs and we talked about it and he promised to change.

Well he kinda did but didn‚Äôt. After realizing I shouldn‚Äôt really have to ask or beg someone to stay with me after and cuddle/ hug me, I kind of no longer wanted to be intimate. I felt like if I didn‚Äôt want to be intimate he wouldn‚Äôt want me in his life anymore, and I guess I just really liked him. I know now that I should never sacrifice my needs and wants for someone else but I guess I was really dumb this summer lol. The times we were intimate he would roll over and phrase his question ‚Äúso um‚Ä¶ do you need me to like hug you or something?‚Äù and that somehow made it even worse.

Another small thing is he would never do anything for me for the entire four months we were talking. He was always late to our scheduled hang outs, which were just him coming over for an hour or two and saying he had somewhere to go right after. I never wanted to intrude on his space so I never asked him to stay longer because he made it clear he wanted / needed to go. He was always about an hour or two late, he wouldn‚Äôt apologize either. I would just spend my morning waiting on him, which was really pathetic but it was once a week I would see him and for so short a time so I would just be excited and didn‚Äôt wanna turn the moment into something sour by questioning why he was so late.

One time, this lateness really did hurt my feelings but it was because I had spent all morning baking him a pie. He knew about the pie, and we agreed on a time for him to come over and watch a movie and eat some pie. I knew he was a busy guy so I didn‚Äôt want to expect much from him either. Well I spent my morning going to the farmers market to get special apples, and making everything from scratch even the crust dough. I made it specially for him and I was really excited. 

He tells me he will be late but doesn‚Äôt exactly apologize for it. it‚Äôs more a statement. I get sad about it, and when he gets to my place he doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his lateness. I tell him ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ pies gone cold‚Äù and he changes the subject and doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge it. I serve it for him and he tells me he actually has to run somewhere, and asks if he can take it home. 

I told him no and that it really hurt my feelings that I spent all morning doing this for him and he doesn‚Äôt even want to eat it with me. He apologizes and says that he really has to go and it‚Äôs not under his control but that he appreciates what I‚Äôve done. He ends up eating a slice and going home.

All these moments pile up, and I realize I‚Äôm miserable and stressing every day because I don‚Äôt know what I even am to this guy. I‚Äôm having a rough night as it is and I just want someone to talk to. I call him and no answer. He had just been texting me and stopped the second I asked if we could talk about something important over the phone. So i know I was being ignored. 

I end up sending him a few texts in a very angerful moment. I‚Äôm not exactly mean to him, just evidently frustrated in the texts. I tell him ‚Äúyou‚Äôve honestly confused me so much I deserve better I would rather be alone then with someone who constantly makes me feel ignored and unimportant‚Äù. Another big issue (another one is so funny because this guy really just played in my face lol) was me asking for flowers and him promising repeatedly to get me some but he never did. I‚Äôm a girly girl and have a flower obsession. He‚Äôs even commented on it a lot because my apartment is decorated this way and I wear a lot of florals etc. Anyways, I had asked for them a couple times in a more passive way. Not ‚Äúget me flowers‚Äù more like ‚Äúi would love to get some flowers‚Äù. He told me he was going to get me some but he never did, the whole four months. One time, he even came over and made it a point to tell me he had been in line for flowers before coming, but the line was too long so he left. Hurt like a mf. 

Anyways, he took a picture of a nature spot he was at that had flowers. he texted saying ‚Äúgonna pick a few for you‚Äù I was so excited. Hand picked flowers are the best and I love them. I told him I would actually really love that and he told me he would. he comes to my house and, of course, no flowers. He never mentions it or cares to bring it up. 

So I just get fed up with this and that‚Äôs when I send all the texts and tell him about how what Im asking for truly is not that much, just flowers and some time and care. He sends me a long paragraph admitting fault and apologizing profusely for his behavior. He tells me ultimately I deserve whatever I want and if that is being by myself he will respect that. He apologizes and tells me he really cares about me and does want to do these things for me. 

I ignore the message and later in the day, he drops off a basket full of gifts and flowers and a letter. I text him asking to talk this over in person to which he agrees but says he is busy the next couple days so it will have to wait. Fine. We talk and I tell him I no longer want a friends with benefits and that it does not work for me as I want a relationship and nothing less than that. He tells me that I am everything he would want in a partner but since he is moving a relationship won‚Äôt work. I respect his decision and tell him moving forward it is best if we keep limited contact. He had asked me to meet his friends a few days prior to all this, so I tell him that is crossing a boundary and I don‚Äôt want to meet the friends of someone I am not in a committed relationship with.

He leaves, and a week later he reaches out asking me to get coffee with him if it is something I am comfortable with, he says he has something to tell me. I agree and we get coffee, but he never really seems to get to what he may have intended to tell me. He leaves in a rush without saying by, and informs me that he is moving the next day. lol. 

He texts me and asks me to help him pack. I agree and go to his parents house to help him. (I had already met his parents multiple times?? which is weird for a situationship, they loved me and talked to me and hugged me and even fed me a few times they‚Äôre wonderful people! I had gone over once and he asked me to spend the night but I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable since his mom wouldn‚Äôt have known and I didn‚Äôt want to disrespect her decision to let me stay) Anyways. I go over and I help him pack and we are having a wonderful time (i think that‚Äôs why I stayed, he was a really fun guy to be around and the way we talked with each other and our playful banter was really nice) He informs me that his friends are coming to say bye, which I feel a bit taken a back since I had told him that I didn‚Äôt want to meet his friends if we were not going to be in a committed relationship. I end up meeting all his friends and a few extended family members and chat with them for a bit. 

It‚Äôs getting late and I don‚Äôt want to overstay my welcome so I tell him I am heading home. He helps me get my stuff and moments before I am about to leave he tells me that he thinks a relationship with me would work. I tell him i agree. He smiles and hugs me and I leave. But there‚Äôs so much left to be said since he is leaving and we didn‚Äôt even have time to discuss details especially since he was moving 8 hours away in a few hours lol. Just so weird and confusing to why he would say that. We text a couple days and I expect him to bring it up but he doesn‚Äôt. I tell him I‚Äôm confused and it‚Äôs best we don‚Äôt talk in that case. He sends me a meme lol. 

I don‚Äôt reply to said meme OBVIOUSLY. about a month later he texts me to tell me something completely random about his day. He literally just sends me a picture of his food and tells me it‚Äôs good. Lol. what do i even say to that. I tell him I hoped he enjoyed his food and I kid you not this guy starts telling me what was in the food and gives it ‚Äúa solid 6, no apple pie tho sadly‚Äù I decide to tell him that I‚Äôm still hurt by everything, and that I do not want to just be friends but that I wish him the best. 

he replies ‚Äúi feel you; and I wish you the best too I just wanted to tell you about the food I ate that‚Äôs all‚Äù 

üòÉüòÉüòÉ

so I say ‚ÄúI know, but i honestly don‚Äôt want to hear from you. so that‚Äôs all.‚Äù then i put ‚Äúgood luck, babe!‚Äù which i admit was a little petty (if you know what song that references) but to be fair I was just at my wits end with this.

I blocked him and have not reached out since. it sucks because I really loved his family and the way he was in person, and we had so so much in common. he was like the male version of me in a lot of ways. he would also tell me things like how he really thought i was something super special and idk maybe i took that too serious. I know I deserve better and I know I will find it one day, but most guys are just really boring to talk to or I don‚Äôt feel like I click with them. I don‚Äôt want to date anyone else except him, so I guess i‚Äôm not really going to move on soon. I also have thus hope or feeling he will eventually reach out to talk about things, since it has to have confused him too? or maybe i‚Äôm delusional. Part of me just wants closure from what happened but if i reach out I know it‚Äôll be pointless. What is he gonna do? send a meme? lol. 

So it‚Äôs just really confusing and I don‚Äôt even really know what happened or if he ever even really cared about me. I wonder if it bothers him just the same but from the way it ended it didn‚Äôt even really seem like he cared. I don‚Äôt know. His family treated me like I was special and referred to me as his girlfriend and his friends even asked if I was his girlfriend, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs not vuneravle with anyone in his life and it hurts me to think that‚Äôs how he feels. I wish I could help him with whatever he is suffering from but he‚Äôs hurt me too much and I can‚Äôt fix everyone especially if it‚Äôs hurting me a lot to deal with. 

I know I made the right decision and I know I deserve better. I think i‚Äôm a really sweet girl and I try to be and that‚Äôs why I did not crash out on him or ever be mean to him because maybe I‚Äôm delusional but I see good in him regardless. I think his heart is in the right place but he just doesn‚Äôt know how to express himself or anything. But I can‚Äôt be there for him because talking to him hurts me more and he makes me feel completely not special. I see my friends in relationships and they get treated so well and I‚Äôve always desired that. But I want to be treated that way by him not anyone else. 

I‚Äôve done everything I can to get over it. I don‚Äôt have social media except reddit so I‚Äôm not tempted to look at his instagram. I admit I did once or twice but seeing the girls he followed ultimately just hurt me more so I decided not to do that. I saw he posted a few pictures from his summer and he posted a drawing I did for him which I thought was a bit weird, since it was after we stopped talking. He was never active on it when we were talking, but started using it and posting/ following people when we stopped. I decided just to focus on my school work and my job as well as my hobbies, but every song reminds me of him and it just sucks. I just want advice on how to move forward that isn‚Äôt no contact or stop stalking cause I have done all of that already, the feeling that he will come back just stays and I know I look super pathetic.

Now, I have months of positive third-party reports documenting my parenting skills.

And how did she respond to those good reports? By escalating to new accusations‚Äîlike claiming the foods I feed our child cause gastric distress or that my detailed emails about our daughter are evidence of a hypomanic state. All of this, in her mind, is justified because I‚Äôm ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù and apparently a threat to her and our daughter. For the record, I‚Äôm not. I even got evaluated when her gaslighting started, and none of her accusations hold any weight.

So, what happens when reality hits people like this in the face? Have any of you dealt with the same? How did your exes react when their narrative started to fall apart? Does she take accountability when a third party and judge rule against her? Does she lash out in anger? What happens?

I have a court date in the next few weeks, and I‚Äôm definitely concerned. For context, she left me, took our daughter without my knowledge, and withheld her from me for 45 days before the state mandated she return home. No infidelity, abuse, or major fights ever occurred between us. We had a child 7 months ago, and I don‚Äôt recognize the woman I married‚Äîlet alone the one who‚Äôs now divorcing me and trying to destroy my life.",2,1729490526.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1g8iw4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g8iw4m/am_i_being_gaslighted/,Am I being Gaslighted?!,"So I (24M) have started to date my now Gf (28F), 2.5 months ago, everything is going so well, we spend the whole weekends together and we go out and enjoy our time, However, 2 weeks ago, she barely spoke with me or texted me, I asked her if there is anything wrong multiple time, but she always said no, so I thought its just because of work, on the weekend I went to play some cards with my coworkers, and instead of being at her house at 8 PM, (I finish work at 6PM) I was going to be there at 9 PM, so she called me when I was on my way, she got angry and she told me to not message her, call her and speak to her again, I asked are you sure? she told me yes and close the phone, I didnt call her or text her, because she got angry and said some words that should not be said for no reason, She texted me 3 hours later saying, ""did you get upset?"" I said yes, she invited me to talk and we talked and all good.

Now fast forward to this weekend, she had an appointment, I offered to drop her and go with her so we can spend time together, I also took friday off so I can be there, I spent 7 hours with her on her appointment, took her to a restaurant after her appointment that is 30 minutes away ( she shit in my mouth for picking a 30 mins away restaurant), After that I suggest that since we are already here, there is a sweets shop that is only 5 minutes away, she refused and wanted to go home, I was like ffs we are already here lets go, she agreed.

There she didnt like the menu ( she was checking the menu from her phone ) I took it and started suggested her some, like ""look this cookie with fruits looks tasty etc"" she said no, I suggest another one, any ways all of a sudden she explodes at me, and starts saying "" Stop manipulating me I said NO! "" I said ok my bad, then she said, why the fuck are you using my phone use yours, I gave her phone back, used mine, ordered for myself, then she asked me if I was upset, I said yes, she didnt ask why, but she said, ""If you want to be upset, be upset in your place tonight, I will leave with a taxi"" I was like wooow, okay, she didnt order a taxi, she stayed, anyways, I finished, drop her home, and went back to my place, 

When we met to talk about it the next day, she started telling me that I am manipulating her into thinking that she wants sweets when she doesnt, and that I didnt even offer to order her a coffee or an extra spoon etc..,   
That I am being sensitive and acting as a little princess, she told me that she was tired and cold because of  her appointment and just wanted to go home (Even thought I was also with her the whole time, and Gave her my jacket because she was cold) so literally, I feel that I was wrong and that I am the shittiest person, and yeah I feel like a little princess,  
  
How should I behave in such scenario, and what should my next move be? What am I supposed to say? We are all good now I suppose, but I just need to know if I am overreacting, I am not used to be treated like shit and for people to make fun of me, I mean I can make fun of her as well but it would just hurt her, I really dont know what to do.

I'm scared of what happens when my mom passes,"So. I've been thinking about this alot. My brother 31M has been living within my mom since birth. He has had some stints living independently with partners but ultimately comes back to living with my mom. We are on drastically different career paths. I have been in my career for 13 years now and very established. For him, he has worked nothing but dead end jobs with the most prestigious being a chef.

Hes a fantastic cook and loves food, but right now he's working volunteer for youth and serving coffee. I really worry about him because I honestly don't know what's going to happen when my mom dies. She's 56. Not necessarily young, but not super old either. But old enough to where I have to think about it.

I have tried to convince him to get a real job or a career and he's just not having it. He's type 2 diabetic and drinks alot. However, very functional.  Though I don't agree with this behavior and how he's treating his health. I appreciate he's under control, for the most part. But I do draw concern when his grandfather passed due to alcohol abuse. It seems to run straight through him.

We have different dad's, I have suffered from substance abuse however I got out of it and it never affected my career. Though I do drink a bit, not near as him.

The thing I'm worried about is what happens when my mom dies? He's type 2 so his life will be too expensive for him to afford Healthcare without a job and Idk if I can really take him under my roof. Maybe temporarily but certainly not long term. I feel like me watching over him as kids when my mom was working 3 jobs has done him a disservice as he's always felt someone would take care of him.

I really don't know how the reality will hit when it does and I don't know how I can prepare him for it or even get him out of this rut. Sure alcoholics anonymous is a thought. But people have to want to change. And I'm that I don't think he wants to change.",2,1729490192.0,self,1,1.0,False

My husband (33m) and I (30f) have been married for just over a year, together for 8 years, and were best friends for years before that. Our relationship hasn‚Äôt always been perfect, but we‚Äôve made it through. We have a young child together, and both work full time, so the story goes. We‚Äôre at a point now where I feel like there‚Äôs a fork in the road of our relationship- on one side we can start working on things, communicating more, etc. the other is that we just give up. I don‚Äôt want to
Give up. He doesn‚Äôt want to give up. But I don‚Äôt think he is going to put in the work. 
The majority of household chores and parenting falls on me. I will communicate when I am overwhelmed, and let him know when and what I need help with. However, if I ask him to do something (I.e. load the dishwasher), there‚Äôs a 75% chance he isn‚Äôt going to do it and is going to give me whatever today‚Äôs excuse is for not doing it. When he does do something for me (or like, for our house that he also lives in lol) it‚Äôs completely half assed. Look, I haven‚Äôt been perfect. I‚Äôve struggled with alcoholism, and 19 months ago he gave me a wake up call and I got sober. Ive looked for attention from other men before to spite him during tough times. It‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt done in a long time, because I‚Äôve grown, but it‚Äôs important to me that my faults have been established. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 4 years consistently, dealing with a lot of complex childhood trauma. I tend to self blame for just about everything, which stems from being the family scapegoat and sprinkle in some religious trauma. I‚Äôm always looking for how I can better myself before pointing fingers. 
All of that being said.. I really think the ball is entirely in his court right now. I‚Äôve been pulling away emotionally for a few weeks. It started when we started having a bad ant problem in our living room. I asked him to move the couch and sweep and mop behind it, then spray something for the ants. It took 3-4 days of me telling him it needed to be done before he finally did something, but of course it was less than half assed. I‚Äôve been exhausted from working evenings and during the day being the main person taking care of the house and our daughter. And honestly, I haven‚Äôt put a lot of effort into keeping the house clean in a couple of years. He doesn‚Äôt care, why should I? Like, a lot of people say ‚Äúoh just stop picking up after him and he‚Äôll see!‚Äù But no. That didn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt work for him. He genuinely would see no problem living in a literal pig sty, and right now we almost do. It drives me insane. I‚Äôve begged for years for him to see that my anxiety is directly correlated to a messy house. When I first started therapy 4 years ago, I expected a 100% clean home all the time. I‚Äôve learned to fall back on that some for my own sanity. But as the years go on, the more I‚Äôm letting slide. My anxiety is always through the roof because I‚Äôm sitting in constant clutter and dirt and mess. It‚Äôs embarrassing and it‚Äôs gross. 
So on top of all of the cleanliness issues, he also spends the majority of his time at home in the office on his PC playing games with friends. I truly do not believe he has a video game addiction, before anyone throws that out there. I think he has severely undiagnosed ADD/anxiety and depression. He has also admitted to me many times that he games a lot as a release from all that. And I get that! I‚Äôm ADHD and have had to learn over the last couple years how to executively function. But I did that. I did the work. I‚Äôm done with this excuse from him though. I refuse to do any work for him, because I‚Äôm not his mommy. I also was orphaned young and have been on my own for most of my life, with little to no help from anyone, so I just genuinely can‚Äôt see why a grown adult needs someone to call the doctor‚Äôs office for him. He tells me he‚Äôs anxious/depressed, and I tell him he needs to see someone. I‚Äôve even asked him to talk to me, but he refuses. He says whatever he has going on ‚Äúcan‚Äôt compare‚Äù to my trauma and he doesn‚Äôt want to burden me. Of course I‚Äôve always told him that I don‚Äôt feel that way, and that his feelings and thoughts are completely valid and deserve to be felt and heard. But after I got tired of begging him to talk to me and I flat out told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your wife, not your therapist, I can‚Äôt help you with this. I‚Äôll be here when you need me to lean on, but I‚Äôm not the person to be working through your shit with.‚Äù He took that really hard at the time, and was really upset with me that I‚Äôd be so insensitive. But now? Jeez I don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt talk anymore. We work, he plays games, I play games or watch tv, whatever. We‚Äôre roommates, not partners. I can‚Äôt remember the last time he did anything romantic for me. We haven‚Äôt hung out kid free in a couple of years now. Sex is basically non existent, partly because of the Prozac I take, but mostly because we‚Äôre both exhausted. Lately he‚Äôs sensed me pulling away so
He‚Äôs been a little more touchy with me, but I feel disgusted when he tries to touch me. We have amazing sex, always have and still do. But a fire builds in my gut when he tries to initiate sex with me. I feel so angry, and I guess resentful. Why would I want to be intimate with you when you have given no indication lately that you give a shit about me at all? 
So, sorry this is all over the place. Again I just really needed to cathartically write this out to get it out of my head. I know we need to communicate. I wish he would talk to me. He sensed me pulling away, and instead of talking to me about it, I found him looking through my phone the other day. I don‚Äôt have anything to hide, he can look at it whenever he wants. But I‚Äôm hurt that he decided it was more worth it to invade my privacy than to have a conversation with me. He saw some texts between me and my best friend where i told her a lot of what I‚Äôve already said here. I actually told her about a plan I had to let one of his family members keep our daughter for a couple weeks, because I was scared my mental health was getting ready to send me to the psych ward, and I really don‚Äôt think he can handle being the only parent for longer than a day. He can‚Äôt get our kid to school on time (the handful of times he actually brings her and lets me sleep in), he doesn‚Äôt cook, literally doesn‚Äôt know how to work the dryer, and of course knows nothing about her school life, extracurriculars, doctors appointments, etc. I think the part that stung him the most was when I told my friend in our texts that ‚ÄúI would be a much better parent if I was a single parent.‚Äù I only know he went through my phone because I heard him slam it into the coffee table before leaving the house and slamming the door. Y‚Äôall this was almost 4 days ago, and he still hasn‚Äôt brought it up to me. I told him a couple nights ago ‚Äúhey, I think we really need to talk don‚Äôt we?‚Äù And he just said ‚Äúyeah.‚Äù He asked if I still want to do this thing with him. I was like, isn‚Äôt that obvious? I wouldn‚Äôt be stressing like this if I didn‚Äôt want it to work. And I really don‚Äôt think I could marry anyone else, or co-parent with anyone else. If the worst happens and we split, I wouldn‚Äôt pursue anything serious until our daughter is out of high school. It‚Äôs too effing complicated to do all that imo lol. 

So yeah. That‚Äôs it I guess. I see my therapist in a couple days and plan to dive into all of this. Him and I have discussed him going to therapy, or us going together, and he‚Äôs all but refused. Despite never seeing anything close to a counselor or therapist in his life, he somehow already knows it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot going to help.‚Äù Which I‚Äôll even be fair and say that therapy isn‚Äôt for everyone. But holy shit you gotta try SOMETHING. He once said he felt like he could clear his head if he went on a solo hiking/camping trip for a week or two and I have always supported that idea. Every now and then I‚Äôll mention ‚Äúhey, this would be a good weekend for you to go on your camping trip,‚Äù and have tried to help him find the time and money to do it. But he‚Äôll always just be in front of that damn computer.  

I‚Äôve tried writing to him a few times, because that‚Äôs the easiest way for me to deep talk without being overwhelmed with emotions and reacting instead of processing. But every time I start writing, I throw it away. For one because it feels so redundant. None of what I‚Äôve said here is new territory. We‚Äôve been here many times. A couple years ago I did leave him for a few weeks, and came back when he finally promised we‚Äôd try a couple therapy sessions together. Obviously that never happened. I‚Äôm pretty scared that this time I‚Äôm going to have to leave to wake him up, and I‚Äôm scared he will still choose to emotionally shut down rather than do the work. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm not worth his effort (or that he doesn‚Äôt think I am). I feel like a piece of furniture in the background of his life. I feel like I‚Äôm setting a terrible example for our daughter by still letting all of this happen. I‚Äôm scared that I have to leave, and I think this might be it. I guess I don‚Äôt know how to tell him that either. Where would we go? We rent a home, I have no family other than my 90 year old grandmother, who would take my daughter and me in with no problem. I guess I don‚Äôt want to bother her with it. His family is my only support, and I know that if it comes down to us splitting, his family will toss me aside and make me the bad guy. Most of the men in his family have a very complicated relationship with their first wives, and alll of the family members talk shit about all of those women constantly. I know I‚Äôll be in the same boat. But that‚Äôs all fine. I‚Äôve been on my own before, and I will again. I can handle grown ups acting like children, considering I was raised in a house like that lol. Oh and not to mention the work I‚Äôve done on myself in therapy! Unlearning so much toxic thought processes and behaviors has been fucking hard. Doing it sober has been fucking hard. Lately I‚Äôve been thinking about the bottle again, but I don‚Äôt want that. I know myself, and I know I want to drink to spite him. I want to say ‚Äúlook what you made me do!‚Äù But, that‚Äôs not an option, because I‚Äôm not a child lol. It‚Äôs also not worth me potentially spiraling and not being there for our daughter, who ultimately will suffer the most out of this entire scenario.

**Buckle up, paragraphed review incoming:**

**A quick look at the venue**\
The Deli is probably the most recognizable area since it's visible from the street, but other than the deli, there are pocket areas where you can have private areas (makit-an nis ilang socmed):\

Wine Cellar/pic (2): naa dinhi ilang wines\
Bistro/no pic: naa dinhi ilang whiskey bar\
Cigar room/no pic: enclosed, good for 8-10 daw, sa ubos ni sa Beat Bar\
The Beat Bar: naa dinhi ilang cocktails (dinhi sad naka focus ang review)/pics (3) to (6)\
Function room/pic (7): mao ni ang overlooking sa street nga naa sa 2nd floor\

Ang wine room and beat bar ang pinaka instagrammable. Sa Beat Bar sad ko nagpa-reserve kay fully booked na ang wine cellar, when I called; this was ~5 days before the dinner night. Ask lang if naa'y consumables on the day that you're going since if Thursday (???)-Saturdays daw, naa'y consumable ang beat bar of ‚Ç±2,500.

If you want to have the place to yourself for pictures, better go sa beat bar early, mga 6PM (opening time). The place would have aesthetic lighting without people so you'd feel like it was a private place. By ~8PM, people start arriving real fast.

**The Menu**\
Please refer to pics (8) to (9). Kindly note that naa pa ni service charge nga add on. Then for the menu ""Fresh off the Grill"", naa ni sila side order and 1 sauce daan.

What we had:\
Crispy Pork Belly with BBQ sauce (pic 10): crispy ang skin, very melt in your mouth ang fat, but ang unod kay inconsistent\
Tiger Prawns with crying tiger butter sauce (pic 11): ok ra, nice ang texture but it does not knock it out of the park\
Atlantic Salmon with lemon butter sauce (pic 12): wa ko katilaw but my father finished 2 cups of rice so siguro lami siya\
Half Roasted Tuscan Chicken with chimichurri sauce (pic 13): skin is nicely charred, flesh is not very juicy\
Europe Burger (pic 14): lami ra man daw, daghan sad ang sagbot. For its price, though, I was expecting something a bit bigger.\
Tequila Sunrise (pic 15): i-mix og tarong para lami\
Tequila Sunset (pic 16): lami ra\
Calamansi Mint ade (pic 16): usually, ades are just flavoring+sprite (looking at you, Cafe Elim), but this does not seem like that; it's like carbonated calamansi juice. Tangy with a bubbly mouthfeel\ 

Thoughts: lami ra man gyud siya, but not anything mindblowing. You'd probably find similar dishes in other establishments. Portion is also quite smaller in proportion to the price (see: salmon and burger). You'd probably enjoy eating them, but won't be enough to keep you coming back. Also, puro grilled ang mains, so there‚Äôs not much variety.\

**Services**\
Parking pa lang daan naa‚Äôy mutabang sa pag park.

Responsive ang mga waiters, friendly ang barista. They help you out and they know (most of) the menu. Katong kami pa ang naabot, automatic ning hatag ang waiter ug fork katong kadungog sila nga naa‚Äôy natagak.\

Side note: sigeg katagak ang fork. Seriously. The utensils are heavy and the plates aren‚Äôt big enough to hold them so they keep on falling off.\

Also, they join in singing when there‚Äôs a birthday. However, once daghan na ang taw, mutaas na ang waiting time (understandably so).

I really am hoping to find a childfree partner in my area and I thought I would try my luck here.

* myself :

I am 32yo, tall (6‚Äô1‚Äù), ~170lbs (average build), handsome black male. I have dark brown eyes. My hair is black and so is my beard. I normally keep my hair pretty short. I am happy to exchange photos early on to ensure there is a mutual attraction. I am college educated and I work as a software engineer. 

I consider myself to be kind, caring, and communicative. I have a pretty easy going and go with the flow kind of personality.

My interests are mostly of the nerdy variety; video games, computers, new technology, Marvel/DC stuff, pop culture stuff in general, etc. When it comes to video games I am mostly a pc gamer. I play a lot of Overwatch 2 with friends, but I mostly like single player games. I have been playing Final Fantasy 16 recently and I am also playing Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Some of my favorite games are Zelda (pretty much all of them), Fallout (NV, 3), The Witcher 3, Transistor, Bastion, Final Fantasy 7, Hollow Knight, and much more.

If I‚Äôm not playing games I‚Äôm usually steaming something to watch. Community, Parks and Recreation, Futurama, and Avatar: TLA are among my favorite shows. I am currently watching the new DC Penguin show on max. I like anime as well, but I don‚Äôt watch it as much as I use to. I have been watching Dan Da Dan and I‚Äôm enjoying it so far.

On weekends I like to go out with friends. Usually to a chill bar/brewery. I‚Äôm not a super outdoorsy person, but I don‚Äôt mind a hike or going on a day trip somewhere. I love the rain, so I will go for a walk when it is raining some times. I love to travel, but who doesn‚Äôt? My favorite travel destination so far has been Japan. There are many other places I want to visit, like South Korea, the UK, the Netherlands, and many more. 

I don‚Äôt think I have to say this, but just in case I do NOT want kids and I have known it for a very long time. I do plan to get vasectomy at some point. I am non-religious and I left-wing politically.

I am currently located in Seattle near downtown and I live on my own. I do not smoke, or do drugs. I socially drink and I usually keep it to the weekends with friends.

* What I am looking for:

I am hoping to find a nice girl (cis-female) around my age (but preferably younger than myself). Someone that is kind/sweet, open minded, easy going, and communicative. 

I want there to be a mutual attraction and it is important to me, so if you don‚Äôt feel attracted to me for some reason I just ask that you be honest about it. I will give you the same courtesy in return. I would say appearance-wise I prefer women with longer hair. I also tend to prefer women that are White or Asian. It‚Äôs not necessarily a deal breaker though.

Video games is one of my biggest hobbies and while it would be nice to have that in comment with my partner it is not a requirement. If you aren‚Äôt into video games I just ask you aren‚Äôt opposed to me playing them. 

Please be drug and disease free. Alcohol and weed are both ok. I don‚Äôt like cigarettes, so no cig smokers please. 

This is where I might lose some of you, but that‚Äôs okay. I want us to be able to discuss our sexual preferences/interests. I don‚Äôt want it to be a guessing game. Sex is a huge part of an intimate relationship, and it would be great if we could have an honest conversation about it at some point. If we aren‚Äôt a match in that area then we can both move on. Without being too graphic I would say I am NOT vanilla in this regard.

I would like someone I can see face to face. I in no way want a long distance relationship or a pen pal. If you are not in greater Seattle area then please do not reach out. 

If you closely fit what I am looking for, please reach out and send me a chat. I would love to exchange photos and chat a bit. If things seem like a good fit I would love to meet for a casual coffee date somewhere in the city. 

I appreciate you reading my post and I hope to hear from you. If you made it this far and feel we aren‚Äôt a match then best of luck in your search. ",0,1729487418.0,cf4cf,0,0.5,False

I'm 29 (f) and I've always sorta had crushes or obsessions in my life. They usually were for fictional characters which never was a problem. When I was in a relationship though those crushes all subsided.

Shortly after the breakup a male coworker I am friendly with comforted me on the topic of the breakup. On the evening of it happening he called me and talked me through the chaotic emotions I was dealing with. I thought he was just being nice because l've helped him with some emotional struggles before, too.

Now my brain kind of attached itself to him and I have an unrealistic crush. His behavior has been flirty towards me and he asked me out for coffee several times now. I've always declined and I thought it was inside joke between us because one thing of my future dating plans is to play hard to get before dating anybody again, because otherwise I give too much too soon. And I thought him asking me out was a joke and me declining was me practicing hard to get.

I asked him about it because as it turned out it wasn't a joke for him. He said I put him in the friendzone and that he was comfortable there, but he was interested in getting to know me, called me an empathetic and emotionally intelligent woman whose red flags he needed to experience and find for himself ‚Äûto get more clarity on his feelings"".

So now I am utterly confused with what he's been saying and my brain likes the attention. Instead of a crush on someone fictional I crushed on him - which is super annoying for me because my breakup was like, two weeks ago and I was looking forward to my new found freedom and me-time.

Guess what I want to know: Does anybody have any advice on how to let that crush go? Or what to make of the situation?",2,1729487115.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Try for only 15 minutes a day if that's all you can muster, to declutter a space. I decided my daughter & I would tackle the playroom:

Day 1 - easy to go through and sort out big stuff with daughter. Did move Harold & The Purple Crayon to my bookshelf instead of the donate pile. 15 min 

Day 2 - Another round, got into some smaller pieces. Didn't feel like as big a dent as the day before. 15 min 

Day 3 - This day was a bust. I had a bunch of errands to run after work and fell asleep when I finally grabbed some dinner & sat on the couch when I got home. Oof. 0 min. 

Day 4 - organized toys by categories to make it easier for daughter to decide what stays or goes. Ended up with a surprisingly large collection of wands (Princess, fairy, magic, etc) lol. 35-40 min. 

Day 5 - daughter sorted through the categories I had put together. She's been ruthless & pragmatic about getting rid of a lot. 15 min 

Day 6 - I had a little more rounding up to do, and daughter kept working on stay or go as we moved through piles. 15 min 

Day 7 - Last Day! There was a bucket of assorted plastic bits & bobs. Daughter powered on & got through it all. 25 min.

Immediate aftermath - This is where it kind of looked worse before it got better. I knew I really needed a different system, so started searching online, ended up finding some stuff from a big box European furniture brand known for their DIY assembly. Also took awhile to get all the rejected stuff out. After school child care took some. Been posting to Buy Nothing, which is a chore, but got a lot of the dolls & art stuff out that way. Sorted through the rest to figure out what was good enough to donate, and the rest went in the trash. The Buy Nothing postings, furniture purchase, assembly, & toy reorganization all happened this weekend. The old stacking baskets I was using are going to a coworker (they were awesome when kiddo was little and her toys were simpler). A friend may be taking the storage trunk coffee table that's been replaced by a toy box with a sliding drawer.

A 7 day challenge turned into a 14 day challenge since it took some extra time to get stuff out, and more useful furniture in, but it's done! Gonna borrow my brother's label maker tomorrow & go to town on the sliding drawers on the new shelf.",4,1729486960.0,declutter,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm coming to this community to say I met someone amazing. My GF (25), is smart, kind, compassionate, funny and supportive. We‚Äôve been dating for a few months and she has shown me a profound love I‚Äôve never felt before with anyone else. 

Shes confided in me that she struggles with her weight due to her eating disorder. She‚Äôs 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 105 lbs. I can see her spine and her ribs. She doesn‚Äôt eat very often, and when she does she is very selective of her meals. She only eats chicken on low carb wraps, with maybe a side of potatoes. She drinks coffee almost all day. She avoids dairy products and any heavy carbohydrate altogether. She will almost never tell me she is hungry, and then get upset with me when I don‚Äôt eat, because if I don‚Äôt eat, she won‚Äôt either. No sweets. No fruits. No vegetables. Incredibly picky. She drinks alcohol on occasion and smokes marijuana regularly. 

She has also had bulimic tendencies, where I have caught her stashing junk food in her cabinet. It disappeared one day and she confessed she ate it all and then threw it up. She is afraid to meet my family because she fears they will say she is too skinny. She asks me repeatedly if I still find her attractive. She gets cold very easily. She loses a significant amount of hair when she brushes it, and avoids seeing her friends and family (I believe because of this disorder). She always talks about getting back to a ‚Äúhealthy weight‚Äù and she is very aware she has a problem. She also insists that this is ‚Äúher thing‚Äù and I shouldn‚Äôt ask about it because it‚Äôs something she feels she needs to overcome on her own. My best guess is she won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a sensitive topic when I bring it up.

I don‚Äôt want to walk away from her. I care about her deeply and want to help her. She is an incredible girl with so much to offer and so much potential. I‚Äôm coming here to see what steps I can take to try and help her. Does she need medical help? Can I encourage her enough to eat on her own? How can I get to the root of the problem? I can‚Äôt stand to see her continue to do this to herself.

He's almost 40 inches tall and has learned to climb over or ipen any baby gate we have and can break apart the door handle covers so keeping him contained is basically impossible. This morning I found him making ""coffee"" (an entire bottle of cumin and peanut butter in the coffee grinder) in the kitchen, so I took away his stool. I didn't know he was up because he didn't come and get me and we have a 3 month old who sleeps in our room so we have a sound machine on and I can't really hear anything. Then tonight he woke me up at 11:45 and I thought he just needed help to go back to bed; nope, his dad came to me and said the kitchen was covered in water and the kid had eaten 3 small boxes of raisins and 4 pouches. When I asked what he'd been doing, my toddler replied, ""I got breakfast."" I am pretty terrified that he's going to start a fire in the kitchen or hurt himself with a knife or something. This is brand new; he used to stand at his gate and call for me when he woke up, but as of today I guess that's out the window?

My first kid is 4 and she was never this destructive. Sure, she colored on the walls and made messes, but she was smaller and couldn't get over the gates till this year (they're basically the same size). She also doesn't have a one-track mind like he does. No matter what I do or how many times I tell him no or try to redirect, he does what he is going to do anyway. Hes always been like that, even as an infant. He climbs on whatever he wants, can break the door handle covers on the back door and open it, likes to play with plugs in outlets (we have safety outlets thankfully), he can reach most things on the counters (and does; he's emptied an entire box of baking soda on the floor and dumped olive oil in my collagen powder). I don't know if this is normal for a toddler or if it's not. I don't know how to channel the energy. He can be really helpful; he'll unload the dishwasher and do laundry and vacuum with me, but if I try to do it consistently he loses interest and won't do it anymore.

Idk I'm not sure how to deal with this, and I feel like a god-awful parent with all the stuff he does that is just unsafe but I can't stop him/have never had any success (literally he's been pulling plugs and trying to put them back in since he was 1 and he still plays with them). I know some of this is reaction to new baby but like some of it is just how it's always been. I just literally don't know what to do or how to handle him and direct his chaos.

1g8hx3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1g8hx3o/whats_the_best_way_to_deal_with_this_situation/,What‚Äôs the best way to deal with this situation?,"Last year my daughter started school and made friends with a kid in her class, and her mother subsequently befriended me. Her mother is a very popular person with a large friend group of ladies who do fun things together and help out with each other‚Äôs kids. A ‚Äúvillage‚Äù, like you see on TV or read about online. I have zero local friends, and I guess she took pity on me. She started inviting me to things and I started getting to know these ladies. Our families would go out to dinner as a large group. I helped one of them out with school pickup. We did trivia together sometimes. I never hung out with any of them without the original woman who befriended me, but I felt like I was starting to be part of the group. 

Then the invites stopped. My friend will still invite me out for coffee with just her, but the group invites stopped. They are big on social media so I know they are still doing a lot together, just without me. All the ladies except one are still nice to me when I see them at school, but one of them started avoiding me and pretending not to see me if I was the only mother there at pickup time. If I bump into her randomly she will say hi, but it feels weird and forced. I let it go for months, because my experience has been that people prefer to ignore issues rather than discuss and resolve them.

A few days ago the loneliness got too much and I asked my friend about it and told her I‚Äôm feeling excluded. Not just me, but my daughter has been feeling it too as the kids tell her at school what they all did together on the weekend that we weren‚Äôt invited to. My friend wasn‚Äôt surprised and acknowledged that one of the women (the one who had started being weird to me) had decided she didn‚Äôt want new people in her life and since she was the main event planner I was just no longer getting invited. She also said she had done this to others. Upon pushing for more info, my friend only knew of one occasion that something I‚Äôd said had upset this woman and acknowledged that it was a silly misunderstanding on her part where she was projecting her own stuff onto me and I‚Äôd actually said nothing wrong. 

My friend wants me to reach out to this woman to try to fix things with her so I might get invited to their group things again. I think it‚Äôs a bad idea because 1. I no longer feel safe with this person as she could turn on me again at any time and I‚Äôd always be worried about saying the wrong thing and offending her, and 2. Why should it be on me? This whole situation was caused by her. And again, people don‚Äôt tend to like it when I talk about the elephant in the room so what if I make it worse? 

I feel (possibly irrationally) angry at my friend for not having my back and going along with this woman‚Äôs decision to exclude me from their social events, and she continues to post about their fun times on socials which feels insensitive, like she is rubbing my nose in it. But I can‚Äôt tell her because then I risk losing the only friend I have. And if I don‚Äôt play nice with this ringleader then my daughter continues to miss out on invites to things her friends are all going to and I continue to feel lonely and rejected seeing these ladies every day until my kid finishes school.

My husband says I need to just be fake for our daughter‚Äôs sake, act like everything is fine and be super nice in the hopes things will get back to how they were. I don‚Äôt know if I can do that. Faking doesn‚Äôt come easy to me. This whole thing feels like high school bullshit and I don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt all just discuss issues with the view to resolving them like adults. What‚Äôs the social expectation with stuff like this? Am I supposed to just pretend it‚Äôs not happening like the rest of the women are? I already have self-esteem and rejection issues from a lifetime of unexplained rejection (even by several of my own family members who stopped talking to me and won‚Äôt tell me why), so this whole situation is impacting me more than it probably should.

However I started to notice how swift, harsh and coordinated anti-NIMBY messaging seems on social media. 

It's confusing because this split is not along traditional Democrat versus Republican lines. For example in District 1 the YIMBY candidate (Marjun) is supported by the Democratic Party, while the slow-growth candidate (Connie) is supported by many Democratic institutions including Pelosi and Schiff. In the mayoral race the two frontrunners are both hardcore YIMBYs backed by different sets of real estate / billionaires. Surprisingly, the SF Chronicle has endorsed Lurie (who seems somewhere between them and Peskin, and as a compromise will be my 1st choice, Peskin being my 2nd and only other choice).

Even for maximal urbanists Prop K is a bizarre sham playing to gullible young voters. The headline implies a public park but the text itself basically just shuts down one of our few North-South arteries. The text of Prop K doesn't really say anything about improving transit or building a new park. It says emergency vehicles will still have access. But where do the people go if Heaven forbid there's a major disaster in the area? Day to day, think of all the congestion, the idling that will occur on Chain of Lakes, Sunset, Crossover, 19th Ave. What about the stressed out, working drivers navigating streams of bikes and pedestrians - in the Avenues whose density will exponentially increase if upzoning happens as planned? What about the meals that won't get cooked and the creative pursuits that fall by the wayside as people struggle to get where they need to go? By the way this also affects many of our neighbors to the North who commute from Marin.

It seems obvious that Prop K is a land grab once you learn that,
- It was generated by Scott Weiner via Sacramento along with ~300 other upzoning laws and mandates. In the past Weiner has attempted to take the SF coastline out of the coastal commission. (And I infer he or his backers were behind closing the Cliff House and other historic gems along the road, against the proprietors' wishes.)
- The city deficit is in the billions and it's not about to start a major new public works project aka turning Great Highway into a park. (We just closed 13 schools.)  More likely it'd become part of a privatized resort that'd restrict, not increase, access to the beach.
- The sand dunes would still need to be cleared.
- Removing most of the traffic would make the properties along it far more valuable, while driving traffic inland.

Personally having lived in a couple of places that have been either urbanized or become tourist traps (though I've been here nearly 25 years) - I'd say both are about to happen to SF. Helloooo service industry, hey at least we have plenty of dispensaries. Both the aforementioned places lost their souls as cities - the residents I know who remain do tend to feel that way. Genuine coffee shop and bookstore hangouts closed down because a thriving artsy scene isn't favored by the elite. Speaking of, Jobs' widow / Kamala's bestie just bought the most expensive house in SF. So no they won't be urbanizing Pac Heights or Sea Cliffs. 

I went to a Neighborhoods United (link: https://www.neighborhoodsunitedsf.org) townhall and learned (and verified) - at 19,000 people per sq mile we're already among the densest cities in the West. And continue to make progress on affordable housing.

Turns out my impression of online YIMBYs isn't wrong. Those who sound like they're stumping  for billionaires (whether they know it or not) - have another name and that is WIMBYs - Wall St. in my back yard. Reference:

https://www.laprogressive.com/los-angeles-2/wimby

And yeah I spoke with someone after the town hall and she basically said the billionaires are speculating and we're a darling portfolio item right now. This election is our chance to show Sacramento that San Francisco is not for sale.

Regardless of how drastically you may want to upzone,

NO ON K is our chance to *not* become the laughing stock of the nation when the tech economy booms and we have (hopefully not) landlocked and sequestered ourselves away from the good jobs.

Prop K is by and for the WIMBYs.",0,1729485886.0,sanfrancisco,10,0.21,False

I‚Äôm just going to be honest about this without exaggeration or self pity- I‚Äôve been somewhat incompetent for my entire life.

Maybe it just resulted from not trying enough or having a poor work ethic and being lazy, but reflecting on how incompetent I was in most of the jobs and internships I was a part of, fills me with self contempt. 

I was actually let go from one internship in college because I couldn‚Äôt complete the graphic design work to their standards and didn‚Äôt spend enough time on it.

My first part time job was one I got working at my mother‚Äôs place of work as a receptionist at age 17, and I couldn‚Äôt follow operation procedures well. Apparently there were complaints from customers that I was too slow in processing transactions and doing the job adequately. 

My second part time job was at a coffee shop at my undergrad and I couldn‚Äôt even process transactions fast enough.

My third part time job was during graduate school; a seasonal role at a retail store and reflecting on it, I didn‚Äôt try hard enough to do an admirable job.

I completed an internship in 2022 in a local politician‚Äôs office and my supervisor had to pull me aside one day and remind me how I wasn‚Äôt following instructions on something as simple as typing emails and inputting data so she couldn‚Äôt give me more responsibility. After the internship came to a close, she said she couldn‚Äôt give me an adequate recommendation 

Last fall I took an internship with a firm and needed careful guidance on creating an appealing final presentation. I went over 40 minutes on the final presentation, despite being informed by my supervisor of my 25 minute time limit, partially because the audience kept asking questions and discussing my points and I lost track of time.

During graduate school, I worked on a number of group projects where I completed work but I clearly didn‚Äôt go above and beyond in lending a hand for our responsibilities and my peers took the lead, and I couldn‚Äôt even do work to a satisfactory level or needed repeated guidance from group member‚Äôs on answering basic questions. I recall a group project I did last fall where our group leader assigned me a subject that was ‚Äúeasily comprehensible‚Äù because I asked repeated questions.

Now here I am a master‚Äôs graduate who is seeking his first full time job in the professional world and I have doubts I will be able to cut it because time and time again i haven‚Äôt been able to- even in something as simple as a receptionist role. 

I include several of my past internship/ job supervisors as references on job applications but I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt give me an admirable reference so it‚Äôs just lying basically. 

How can I ever move beyond my repeated demonstrations of laziness and incompetence? How can any one forgive me?

They are sisters and live a few hours from me and the rest of our family, which is quite spread out.

I am quite a bit younger than most of my cousins, and know that Tammy and Stella have had a very up and down relationship with our other cousins (who are another set of siblings I'll call T, L, and K), as well as some of our aunts and uncles.

I've always tried to stay out of it, and get along with both sets of siblings. I've heard bits and pieces over the years, and it sounds like each side blames the other for the feud, and feels that the other side made no effort to be friends. (Most of them live closer to each other than to me.)

Stella and Tammy's mother regularly brought them to my hometown to visit our grandparents when I was young, and I always enjoyed seeing them. We also talked on the phone and got on quite well when I was a child. My parents took me and my grandmother (my grandfather passed years before I was born.) to see them once or twice a year when I was a child. Fun was had by all, and often, our T and L would come for a visit, along with other aunts and uncles. No tension was apparent from what I could see, but I was young and unaware of their feuds at the time.

When I got older, Stella and Tammy ceased coming with their mother when she came to visit. The phone calls and emails become less frequent, and this is when I found out that they'd been feuding. I always had the impression that they'd been close, as they used to talk on the phone and even visit each other from time to time, and also discovered that their mother, my aunt I'll call A, had a beef with both her nieces and some of her siblings. In spite of this, she always visited her mother when she could, and I had a close relationship with her.

I only heard from S and T sporadically through my teenage years, although they did attend our grandmother's funeral when she passed, and everything was civil. My aunt A continued to come visit, though less often, but we remained very close. I didn't hear from T and S much, but we were FB friends and they did comment on important events in my life and wish me a happy birthday.

A few years later, my aunt A got sick and passed. My family and I travelled to attend the funeral. While they were welcoming to my parents and I, they largely ignored the rest of the family, including their mother's own siblings. We were not invited to the burial, which took place later that day

Since their mother's death, S and T have largely cut me out of their lives. While we remain connected on social media, they no longer wish me a happy birthday, or even like my posts, including those about major milestones. I now live closer to them, and did once reach out to invite them out for a coffee should they be in the area, but got no response. I'm not one to count FB likes or birthday wishes, but the timing here is probably not a coincidence. The way I see it, they were either angry that I associated with family members that they were feuding with at the funeral (and perhaps blame me for their presence, even though I'm not even the one who told them about it.), or they had decided a while back that I wasn't worth their time, but made a semblance of an effort for the sake of their mother, and no longer feel the need to do that now that she's gone.

I'm quite hurt by the shunning, since I always liked them and even looked up to them as a child, and their mother was a mother figure to me, but it doesn't look like anything will change.

It's been a few years, and many of my family members are ageing and having health problems. There could be a few deaths in the family in the next few years, and while I of course don't wish for it, it looks likely.

Should I bother reaching out to them to inform them of their relatives' deaths? One relative is terminally ill, and I know they're unaware, and not certain they'd care to know. (They haven't spoken in over a decade, but used to be friends.)  I don't think it's my place to inform them, so I'm not going to. My own parents are in decent health and will probably be with us for the foreseeable future, but I do intend to inform T and S when they pass, out of respect for my aunt A's memory (My parents always got along with her.) Trouble is, if I do this, they might be angry that I didn't inform them of the deaths of the other family members who may already have left us by that point. Perhaps they want to make things right with them, and will be angry that they'll have lost the chance?

What to do? Should I not inform them of anything and let it stay between them and God?",3,1729485731.0,LifeAdvice,3,1.0,False
1g8hr3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1g8hr3s/workplace_intentionality_ignored_safety_concerns/,"Workplace intentionality ignored safety concerns, got injured as a result and sent to the ER. Can I sue?","I work part time at a major Canadian coffee chain, and while sitting on break, a 35pound box fell from a nearby shelf and struck me in the head and back, resulting in unconscious and led to 10hours at the ER. After x-rays and a ct-scan luckily I was only diagnosed with a critical concussion and nausea.

This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened at my location, as last month a similar incident happened while someone else was on break, where a heavy box was left on a high shelf and fell on top of them.

As the managers at my location neglected and refused to improve the safety conditions of the break area after the first incident, letting it repeat again, do I have the grounds to sue?

If I do, which organizations could I find a lawyer through (preferably one that is student-budget friendly)?

1g8hqlx,https://i.redd.it/jyxbqp7pg1wd1.jpeg,Confused after test rides ,"Long time sport bike rider debating another bike‚Ä¶

Previous bikes include:
02‚Äô GSXR 1k -my first bike, put 40k mi on her
06‚Äô CBR600 - dedicated track bike 
15‚Äô 1299Panigale - street bike 
18‚Äô Triumph Thruxton R - street bike 

Now bike-less but have the itch with winter (traffic disaster) approaching in Miami. I hate traffic, this will also be a bike to grab a cup of coffee on, and take my wife on an occasional date. 

Office is 5 miles away, plan on taking it a few times a week. 

I am open to other bikes, but have it narrowed down between 2-3 bikes:

New Hypermotard
Used Thruxton R
Possibly New 900 Monster

Hypermotard is super playful, cost effective, great riding position for street, nimble as can be. Crap as a date night bike and a bit of a one trick pony‚Ä¶but it pulls off a very very good trick.

Thruxton R - great aesthetics, nice for dates, and coffee, etc. reliable, low seat is a comfy set up. No temptation to mess around - no wheelies etc. cons are used, not as fun/playful as the others to ride, or as responsive.

Monster - above average everywhere‚Ä¶looks, performance, comfort‚Ä¶really not a bad thing to say about it, except it doesn‚Äôt blow me away anywhere. Good engine, but not incredible. Good looks, but not the best looking - almost pedestrian (I‚Äôd do a double take at the hyper and Thruxton before the monster)‚Ä¶and the temptation to ride fast is there, which is a bit of a negative for me. 

I digress, but would love to hear some spins on this‚Ä¶as I‚Äôve been away for a few years. 

Really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of these, but as you can see, I‚Äôm struggling to pick one, because they are all great for different reasons. I‚Äôm open to other bike suggestions as well! ",15,1729485622.0,Ducati,7,1.0,False

I spent an hour on the conversation, getting more and more irritated. Now I'm so worked up that I know I won't be able to get anything done until I calm down. But if I don't get enough done, the boss will think I'm too slow and not good at my job and not smart enough. 

It's so stupid. I'm angry at him for getting in the way of my job, because I'm scared of being judged by him. I don't even care about his opinion in particular, I'm just sensitive to the hypothetical criticism because it's echoing my insecurities, and I'm worried it's true.

I explained to my mum how stressed this was making me, and she used my full name. 

The boss had used my full name in the most recent message. He usually abbreviates it. 

When my roommate decided she didn't want to speak to me anymore let alone talk to me, she sent an email using my full name. She usually abbreviated it to a cutesy nickname, despite me repeatedly telling her not to. The last thing she'd said to me before sending that email is that she really did love me. The last thing I said to her was to invite her for coffee in a month's time once we'd cooled down, but apparently that would have been too much fucking effort.

A year later, the only friend who I thought understood what I was going through decided our relationship has ""become toxic."" He ""couldn't accept"" that I was upset for him breaking a promise that I really cared about, because from his perspective it wasn't important. My explaining why it was important was a ""wall of text"" so I guess that was too much effort too. He used my full name in the last message he sent me too. 

People only use my full name when they decide they hate me, or that I'm not worth their time.

I'm not depressed at the moment, or hypomanic. But all the negative thought patterns are still there, and I still fall and trip into them unexpectedly.

Like a chain of bad memories, all linked by innocuous similarities, so tugging on anyone of them yanks the collar tight around my neck.

 I just want them to go away. 

I've finished typing now, and I feel a little better. I don't suppose anyone has practical tips for breaking the spirals when they happen?",1,1729485369.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

Maybe it just resulted from not trying enough or having a poor work ethic and being lazy, but reflecting on how incompetent I was in most of the jobs and internships I was a part of, fills me with self contempt. 

I was actually let go from one internship in college because I couldn‚Äôt complete the graphic design work to their standards and didn‚Äôt spend enough time on it.

My first part time job was one I got working at my mother‚Äôs place of work as a receptionist at age 17-20, and I couldn‚Äôt follow operation procedures well. Apparently there were complaints from customers that I was too slow in processing transactions and doing the job adequately. 

My second part time job was at a coffee shop at my undergrad and I couldn‚Äôt even process transactions fast enough.

My third part time job was during graduate school; a seasonal role at a retail store and reflecting on it, I didn‚Äôt try hard enough to do an admirable job.

I completed an internship in 2022 in a local politician‚Äôs office and my supervisor had to pull me aside one day and remind me how I wasn‚Äôt following instructions on something as simple as typing emails and inputting data so she couldn‚Äôt give me more responsibility. After the internship came to a close, she said she couldn‚Äôt give me an adequate recommendation 

Last fall I took an internship with a firm and needed careful guidance on creating an appealing final presentation. I went over 40 minutes on the final presentation, despite being informed by my supervisor of my 25 minute time limit, partially because the audience kept asking questions and discussing my points and I lost track of time.

During graduate school, I worked on a number of group projects where I completed work but I clearly didn‚Äôt go above and beyond in lending a hand for our responsibilities and my peers took the lead, and I couldn‚Äôt even do work to a satisfactory level or needed repeated guidance from group member‚Äôs on answering basic questions. I recall a group project I did last fall where our group leader assigned me a subject that was ‚Äúeasily comprehensible‚Äù because I asked repeated questions.

Now here I am a master‚Äôs graduate who is seeking his first full time job in the professional world and I have doubts I will be able to cut it because time and time again i haven‚Äôt been able to- even in something as simple as a receptionist role. 

I include several of my past internship/ job supervisors as references on job applications but I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt give me an admirable reference so it‚Äôs just lying basically. 

How can I ever move beyond my repeated demonstrations of laziness and incompetence? How can any one forgive me?

1g8hi9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g8hi9y/aitah_for_choosing_a_new_man_over_my_best_friend/,AITAH for choosing a new man over my best friend?,"The title sounds terrible and it is. I don't like anything about the situation and honestly, I'm probably in the wrong. I'd really appreciate some honest unbiased insight. 

There's a lot of back story so bare with me. I, 29f, moved to my hometown a year and a half ago. I left my ex fiance after a decade. At some point over the years, he had become emotionally abusive and I realized he was never going to change. 

I had to start over completely in a tiny basement in a city I left at 17. I had no money. My ADHD and autism become disabling when my stress is high so I had been struggling to work more than part time. I could only bring what I could fit in a friend's car and my ex kept the dogs which broke my heart more than anything else. So yeah, it was a lot. 

I was lonely and lost when I arrived. 

I decided to focus on connecting with people after years of an isolating life. I decided to reach out to a couple old friends from highschool, one of which was ""Alex"" 29m.

Alex and I first met in our 4th grade class but didn't become close until grade 11. Back then I always thought he was the smartest person I ever met. He was really creative with a crazy memory. He always gave the best gifts and never forgot an occasion. 

But he often had an attitude. He was judgy and looked down on people. He could also be needy, but he was my friend and I gave him a lot of patience. I let a lot go. His home life was very toxic, and he was also the only openly trans kid in our school, so he didn't really have it easy. 

After high school we kept in touch but about 7ish years ago I had to cut contact. I won't get into specifics, but he had done something manipulative and toxic when he was in a dark place and by that point I was getting a stronger backbone. It was definitely for the best at the time. 

Anyways, I know I've grown a lot in 7 years, so I figured maybe Alex also had. I decided to reach out and we met up for coffee. 

Honestly, it went great. He really seemed to have chilled out and made his own found family in his roommates. He seemed the happiest I'd seen him. Despite multiple life changing permanent disabilities, he found peace. He still struggled with alcohol addiction, but this was the best I'd seen his life. 

We then started hanging out on a regular basis. We were connecting well and building trust. 

Around this time, I ended up checking myself into the hospital because my mental health was getting really bad after losing the life I've known for a decade. Depression had become impending doom so I was in there voluntarily for 5 days, and then got a whole hell of a lot of therapy after. I can say, it all helped tremendously. 

Alex has been in that same ward about 5 times (not in the last 5 or so years apparently) so I definitely leaned on him a lot during the whole process. It definitely made it less scary.

After I was out and doing better, I got to know his friends. They gave me kitchen stuff so I wouldnt have to eat off paper plates. Extra pillows. Alex let me borrow some craft supplies and switch games. Bought me groceries some time when I was struggling. I did my best to spoil my good friend back when I could, but I was just so touched at all of their kindness during a hard time. 

There was only one issue really. He really didn't like that I was dating soon after my breakup. 

I know it sounds like that's because he's into me, I really don't think so. He now identifies as asexual and says he has no interest in romantic partners. It wasn't always the case, but I don't think he'd like about his sexuality. I'll say he has a history of intense limerence. 

Anyways, I wasn't looking for a long term partner so soon after my break up. But I definitely wanted to date, have fun, connect with people. If love lands in my lap, whatever. But definitely wasn't looking for it. After years of an unkind partner, I was excited to enjoy being single. 

He would word it like he was concerned I was dating while he still thought I was vulnerable. That would've been a totally valid and appreciated concern. Not his call to make for me, but valid. But he started getting snippy about it. Made judgy expressions when I talked about the new friends I was making (when he was the one who asked). He would, in a joking tone, call me a relationship addict on a regular basis. I honestly laughed most of it off. At the time I thought he was being overprotective. In every other way, he was an amazing friend. 

Then, 4 months after I moved, I reconnected with ""Gerard"" 30m. We met 6 years earlier when I was still living with my ex. He was a truly amazing person, but my ex didn't like me being friends with guys so our friendship faded long before. I never forgot him though. I'm a very sensitive, quirky person, and meeting others like me are few and far between. When we started seeing eachother again, it didn't take long before my heart felt at home like it never had before. I was truly amazed by this man every single day. As someone with a lot of trauma and anxiety, I felt safe with him in ways I couldn't with others. So, it got serious. 

And Alex started getting possessive of my time. At this point I had a part time job, more friends than when I first arrived, and had a new guy in my life who lived an hour away.

He would send me late night messages (while drinking) making me feel like a crappy friend after all he had done to help me. One message said he knew that if I had one weekend free in a month, he's worried that now I'll choose to spend it with Gerard instead of someone I've known all my life. I tried my best to balance my friendship and my life, but this was so guilt trippy. 

I had already started communicating more and more firmly about boundaries, so when he said that, I told him he's important to me, but he's not the only thing in my life and that he's starting to push me away. He profusely apologized. 

But he kept making these little jabs at me. When he wasnt doing well, I checked in. Asked if he needed anything. He said something like, ""no that's okay, checking in is already better treatment than I'm used to :)"". 

I'll say, I'm not the only friend he treats like this. I noticed his childhood best friend really kept him at arm's length these days, but Alex almost seemed in denial about it. He said he just needs to wait until he grinds at work for a few more years and then he'll have more time for him. He sees him maybe once a year. 

So, I started retreating honestly. I truly was choosing to spend more days with Gerard over Alex. I felt really bad about abandoning someone with abandonment issues, but I started getting uncomfortable. The more distant I got, the more more he got upset about it. I tried to communicate it wasn't about Gerard - it was about how he was acting. I tried to reassure him as well, that I cared about him. Maybe I wasn't communicating that enough. We still hung out but not as much and it just wasn't the same. 

Gerard never said anything bad about him. He let me rant, and offered gentle advice. No pushing or judging. He genuinely hoped Alex could put his insecurities aside. But hanging out with him got less and less fun with his moods and jabs. After 2 months of seeing Gerard, hanging out with Alex trickled to once every few weeks. 

Then, a few months later, I had to move out of my friends basement. They were a growing family, so totally understandable. That's when Gerard invited me to live with him. I wouldn't have moved in with anyone else after 6 months, lol. Our timeline was after 1 to 1.5 years. But honestly, we were ready when the timing presented itself. And I don't drive so he was driving me an hour to and from his place a lot of the time. So I happily accepted.

Since then, he has been happy to take me back to my hometown regularly, however I didn't ever have the energy to see Alex. Honestly I started ghosting him quite a bit. I felt guilty to do that to a friend who helped me so much. But at the same time, a lot of what he did to help me almost feels like a weird friendship version of being love bombed.

I'll be honest, I still had a few things of his I needed to return and was still avoiding his messages. 

Then one night this past July, 3 months after I moved, I recieved a wall of drunken angry texts. Very aggressive and accusatory. I read up until he called me explaining my feelings ""weaponized therapy speak"" and I stopped reading. 

This is where I'm probably in the wrong. 

I sent a message that just said: ""address?"" Then one that said something like ""your things will be in the mail by Monday"" and then blocked him off everything. 

And I did. Rounded up all of the things he loaned me, packed them up and shipped them back. The whole situation made me feel so icky in the moment I rounded up the gifts he gave me over the years and threw them in the dumpster. 

It's three months later, and the whole thing just doesn't sit right. I don't really feel bad anymore that the friendship ended, but I really feel like I handled it like crap. Should I reach back out to offer closure if he wants to know why I'm not in his life? If I do, how do I set boundaries so he isn't just nasty about it? Should I apologize for ghosting instead of trying harder to communicate my feelings (even though honestly they were never really heard)? I appreciate your time and advice. 

(Little side note for those who want to know, Gerard and I are a year in now and life is truly beautiful. We just got back from our dream-witchy-roadtrip vacation!)

Tldr: my best friend drove me out of his life for a second time, and instead of communicating I avoided him and spent more time with my new partner instead. ",2,1729484720.0,AITAH,7,0.75,False
