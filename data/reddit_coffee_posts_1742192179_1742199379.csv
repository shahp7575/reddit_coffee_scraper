1jd7nem,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1jd7nem/creatista_plus_doesnt_start/,Creatista Plus - doesn’t start,"Hey all,

I purchased this Creatista Plus, used, around 18 months ago. 

It was working fine until 3 days ago when I did my coffee extraction just fine, and went on to steam / heat the milk. I use standard full fat milk, which was right out of the fridge. 

The steam wand made a strange whistling sound and then the machine just died out on me. After many repeated plugging out, changing the input socket, and waiting out for ~ 2 days plus, it doesn’t turn on. 

When plugged in, and after pressing the on/off button, the led panel just lights up - in black - for ~ 2-3 seconds, and dies after. 

The country I’m in, doesn’t have an official Nespresso service Centre as of now. The older one didn’t renew the contract or something. So I’m stuck at taking it out to private repair shops - which are notorious here for swapping out working parts or giving the “shady mechanic” treatment. 

Anyone faced this issue and knows what could be wrong? My best guess is water leakage inside which has triggered some auto shutdown, but it’s pure speculation at my part. 

Any help would be appreciated!",1,1742199116.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Tessa takes a sip of her morning coffee while looking at Malevelon Creek from orbit.

""Where do you reckon we should drop, Officer?""

The democracy officer replies: ""Let's go for this airfield, just north of us""

Tessa replies: ""Good, now let's start scrapping""

Just then, a bot walks into the command centre. Sitting at 7'5 stands ""J5"" or ""Jess"" for short. Tessa had saved (and converted) this bot way back in 2185 (a year after the 2nd Galactic War was announced)

""Greetings, boss""

Tessa replies back, with enthusiasm in her voice: ""Howdy, J! Ready to drop on Malevelon again?""

Jess replies, with slight concern, but still confident: ""Let's just get this operation over with, we don't want to stay here for too long don't we?""

ChatGPT says it's likely spam. I've never seen a prepaid card named ""Cash"" as the brand. The card site looks fishy and a number of other things are red flags. $3800 is also a weird amount to give for a card (I would think a round number like $1000 or $3000 would be appropriate).

But the email itself is detailed and seems legit.

It's been a month and I am single, I don't have friends na nakakachat ko regularly, I have a cat naman, anyway this is not a post about self pity. I am opening up because I feel so guilty, so mahigit 1 month na ako dito, since feb 10, lahat ng tao dito sa apartment mabait, admin and the guards.

So pagarrive nya she left her I.D. sa guard then nagovernight na nga, kinabukasan sinita ako ng guard sa harap nya the other guard na to, yung kapalitan, sabi bawal magovernight ganern tapos inaask ko ano mangyayare (like may penalty ba) so ayun medyo nagkainitan kami, then yung classmate ko na ilang yrs bago ko nakita ulit, sorry sya ng sorry sakin kasi she felt like she imposed too much, ako naman very emotional kasi ngayon lang nagkainteraction after 1 month, literal na less than 5 words lang ang nababanggit ko kada araw during those times tapos tatlo pa dun ""pspspsps"".

1jd77mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1jd77mz/the_day_i_stopped_stalking_ctos_on_linkedin_and/,The day I stopped stalking CTOs on LinkedIn (and started booking demos),"Remember that feeling when you hit ""send"" on a cold email you spent an hour crafting... only to be met with deafening silence?

Three months ago, I was sitting in my apartment, surrounded by empty coffee cups, staring at a spreadsheet of potential leads for my HRMS software. I had exactly zero demos booked that week, despite spending 20+ hours researching prospects.

I remember thinking, ""I didn't become a developer to spend my life doing *this*.""

That night, I made a decision that changed everything: What if I could engineer my way out of this problem?

# The experiment

I'm a technical founder, not a sales person. So I approached outreach like I would approach a coding problem:

1. I identified the pattern: Most ""personalized"" cold emails aren't actually personal - they're just mail-merged flattery
2. I built a system to truly understand prospect contexts: their tech stack, recent challenges, team structure
3. I created an AI model that could learn how *I* write when I'm genuinely interested in someone's work

The first message I sent using this system got a response in 7 minutes. Not an auto-reply—an actual conversation.

# The results

Within a month, I booked 7 demos without writing a single outreach message from scratch. The prospects didn't just reply—they were *prepared* for the calls. One CTO even said, ""This is the first cold email I've responded to in years.""

The difference wasn't ""growth hacking"" or ""sales techniques"" - it was simply making each interaction genuinely relevant to that specific person.

# Why I'm sharing this:

I've built this system into a tool called [SalesNode](https://salesnode.tech/) \- specifically for technical founders who'd rather be building products than crafting ""the perfect cold email.""

But here's where I need your input. Before I go deeper into development, I want to know:

1. Is this a ""shut up and take my money"" solution or just another ""AI toy"" in your eyes?
2. What's the most soul-crushing part of your sales process right now?
3. If you could automate one aspect of customer outreach, what would it be?

I'm not here to pitch—I'm here to build something that actually solves a problem for people like us. If this resonates with you, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

And if it doesn't? Well, my IDE is always waiting for me.

**EDIT:**  
As everyone wants to see sample, I am adding an email generated by my system,

Below email I generated for CTO who uses magento in their tech stack.

I switched on the story telling mode for below example, you might get lost in story lol...(Yes, there will be modes which will help generate different tune emails, story telling is my favourite.)

**Cold Email to CTO Using Magento**  
**Subject: That moment when your Magento site crashes during peak sales...**

Dear \[CTO Name\],

Remember that feeling when your site slows to a crawl during a flash sale? Your team frantically refreshing admin panels, customers abandoning carts, and that knot forming in your stomach as revenue opportunities slip away.

Three years ago, I witnessed a CTO just like you sitting in a conference room, describing how their Magento implementation was draining both resources and patience. Their exact words: ""It felt like we were stuck with a Ferrari engine inside a decades-old tractor.""

What if I told you many companies are transforming their Magento experience from frustration to freedom?

I'd love to share how we helped companies like yours overcome the common Magento hurdles of performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and scaling challenges.

Could we schedule a quick 15-minute call this week?

Like to me a 50mg increase shouldn’t cause this much depression if anything if the meds were working it should fix it ",1,1742196552.0,lamictal,0,1.0,False

2. It resets on occasion but sometimes i wonder if it keeps resetting or eventually wont reset. I feel like doing some rash stuf just going and running off. Got a therapist appt about it in a month so that is ok but I feel like I'm spiraling worse and worse daily??? Probs the coffee,, i feel like I should just check myself in somewhere somehow but my familly would find out and i dont need that. 

3.  everything is getting worse im just trying to tell myself not to run off with no plan (plus i need to help care for a declining family member) I feel the need to just go with no plan, take my backpack and a change of clothes and my cash savings. Just need to. Ive felt like that occasionally for years and years though, just told myself id do it when it would be more convenient (it never has been and now i realize maybe i was wrong to consider it to begin with). Oh also im still in college so no degree yet.

4. currently I'm getting a bunch of unwanted thoughts. Need to talk to a mental help practicioner about it. Kinda just got enveloped into spiritualty in 2024 and it never fully let up for more than a couple days(just went into the background sometimes). When it was just once or twice it was whatever but now its more frequent this week? I feel like some entity is telling me I should do something great and ik thats a weird thought ti shouldnt have and it keeps coming up in my brain and i cant seem to stop trying to communicate with spiritual stuff and everything in my life is spiraling slowly to some unknown endpoint. I want to run out and away get a buss ticket and leave. (In the US. Can't actually do anything cause said familly member is declining rapidly). im spiraling between its fine and yikes not fine at all and hey maybe I actually am called to some destiny and could bring about world peace or something. (yeah ik how that sounds).

My sleep has bee sh-t I genunely mightve triggered some hypomania or mania or something but it doesnt feel like im that overactive mentally? Its 3:23 the drink i drank/made for myself was really strong idk what happened. only have had a cup of coffee today but i end up spiraling more in the evening. Maybe its the sugar? I used to be. kinda paranoid the sugar had drugs in it (or the coffee) for a long while then it stopped.

Getting signs and reasons why hey im wrong and maybe i do have some sort of calling. lil occurances here and there and some conversations weirdly revolving around that idea out of nowhere.

Then maybe I'm meant to just go somewhere in order to fulfil that. Like thats going to have disastrous consequenes and ill probs realize i was wrong or something the moment I go anywhere if i go(but i keep feeling like going and any paranoia ive had is shooting out the roof rn).",1,1742196539.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

Seen some discussions on Cardio/heart health in here and wanted to ask this question for the longest time. 

I've been wearing a smartwatch for the past 3-4 years, 24/7. So I've been tracking my BPM for a while now too. What I've noticed is that the BPM is pretty low during rest. Sitting behind the desk at work it can dip as low as 45 during the day(even with coffee). During the nights when I'm well rested (1-2 days without a workout) it can dip even lower. I've had some nights where I dip towards 31. Most nights are around 35-34. 

Last night for example was a dip of 38, even though my daughter woke me at 3:30am and I've worked out yesterday and the day before. So you'd say I'm recovering and my BPM should be higher. 

Of course a little history would be nice. I played high level Badminton when I was young (7-16). After that I began my fitness journey. I've been in the gym for about 11 years now. Started with 7 days a week trying to build mass. Now since 2 years doing Powerlifting and going for 4 days. Always try to stay as active as possible, at least 10k steps a day etc. etc. 

I'm 1.95m tall (6'5ish) - 114kg's, (251lbs). Around 23% bodyfat(estimation).

1jd6vwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jd6vwd/how_much_can_resting_open_up_a_coffee/,How much can resting open up a coffee?,"Hi,

For the first time I'm venturing to order coffee outside my country. I'm used to go to roasters where I'm living or visiting. I have looked at a few roasters in Europe and ended with Tim Wendelboe, seemed the closest to what I prefer, an opportunity to finally try a nordic roast and the affordable kilo test batch spoke to my budget conscious mind.

I tried to brew a few coffees today: Finca El vikingo, Los pririmeos pacamara honey process, march the 5th test batch, and the Colombian anaerobic coffee from La fabricà sold at my local roaster

I tired them with a few different recipes with my v-60 and T-90 filter papers:

My water mineral composition :
Calcium (Ca2+)	11,5
Magnesium (Mg2+)	8
Sodium (Na+)	11,6
Potassium (K+)	6,2
Sulfates (SO42−)	8,1
Bicarbonates (HCO3−)	71
Nitrates (NO3−)	6,3
Chlorides13,5
Silica 31,7

Recipe 1, Light roast 1/17 (1/15 for processed):
-60 sec bloom at 96°C.
-First pour at 96°C
-Second pour at 96°C
-Third pour at 93°C
Total draw down after bloom 2min-2min20

Recipe 2, Samo bloom with high extraction 1/17 (1/15 for processed):
-90 sec bloom at 65°C.
-First pour at 98°C
-Second pour at 96°C
-Third pour at 94°C
-Fourth pour at 92°C
Total draw down after bloom 2min 30~40

Recpie 3, Medium light roast 1/16 (1/15 for processed):
-30 sec bloom at 93°C.
-First pour at 93°C
-Second pour at 91°C
Total draw down after bloom 1min50 to 2min


What I found across the board, that only with the samo bloom did I really get the fruity characters and acidity out the TWs coffees. Otherwise it was still decent coffee but quite faint in flavor, a bit bland and I had to really focus to distinguish notes. Whereas with my local roaster, apart form the muted profile on the medium light profile, it packed a punch with cherry, cocoa and blueberry with a funk.

I drove myself mad that I could extract properly TWs coffees, but when I tried my local roaster, I had the idea to go and smell the bags, and TWs were a fourth as fragrant as my local roasters. 

As roast levels ended up on par (color ground/ crush test/ hardness of rotating hand grinder) the only difference I can see is TWs are 11 days old and the bag from my local roaster is a bit more than month old. So I wondered, how much resting can open up a coffee? Because TWs is about 60% more expensive and I found the coffee a fourth as flavorful.

I was willing to pay extra, diminish my coffee consumption and try all the great European roasters. But I wounder now, is it worth it? 
I now my water is not the best but it's the most affordable and I has made me great coffees so far, is that what's holding me back, on those coffees?",3,1742195486.0,pourover,3,1.0,False
1jd6vsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1jd6vsp/express_oracle_jet/,Express >>>> Oracle Jet,"Rant 

We had the Barista Express for 5 years, and we loved it. It worked great. We upgraded to the Oracle jet, which looks pretty and cool, but it was a mistake. It looks cool to show off to guests, but it doesn’t deliver the espresso we want. 

First, the ground coffee is too much, like 24g. That is way too much for espresso. And to adjust that, you have to fiddle with a screw. If I paid 500 for the machine, I understand. But the damn thing is 2k! On the express, you can adjust the amount of powder very easily. 

Second, the “guide” is pretty useless. The ratio/yield is completely off, and the machine is telling me you have a balanced espresso. How?? Let’s ignore the yield, it tasted sour! I can do a better job with a simple scale on the Express. 

Third, I tried the automatic steam wand and I couldn’t figure it out. The milk was so runny and just full of foam. Who cares about the foam? The milk has to have some texture, otherwise, it feels like you are drinking hot milk with some coffee, not a latte. 

There are some pros, but the cons make it not worth 2k.

I think if you want to make an actual espresso drink, just go for the simple machine like the Express or Pro. Maybe the dual boiler if you want more features. 

That is based on my experience, maybe others feel differently.

* They have a long make-up out session in a closet.

You are expelled. All of your classmates are going to be better without you” those were the words of my high school principal after expelling me. 

I had been in that school since I was 5. I am from a small city in Mexico. This was supposed to be an Elite private school: catholic and just for boys. My family had wealth in the past, but it was all gone by the time I was 2 due to an economic crisis that made my grandfather business go to bankruptcy. However, all my parents social cycle was “elite”. 

I was put in that school since elementary school. We were almost the same 23 people in the group all elementary and middle school. During that time, I received bullying from almost all the group, starting when I was five. It lasted all the way until I was 16. 

During that time, my parents were more focused on their own narrative of having his son in an “elite” school instead of focusing on my own well being. I was not excelling at school; had just one or two friends; had nicknames; physical and verbal abuse. 

In my house, if I tried to fight back, I was severely punished; their advice was to “tell the teachers”. If I tried to say that I wanted to change school they said: “you are the in the best school in town”, “if you change you are not going to do anything with your life”, “we are doing a lot of effort to have you there”. Likewise, I had constant comparisons, in particular from my father, who said: “when I was young, I was friend of everybody, why can’t you do the same?”, “why you cannot have good grades as John Smith?”  Basically, I was told to trust the school to take care of my problems; try to be a people pleaser and seek validation to be “a friend of everybody”; and feeling guilt of trying to change school because  “I was in the best”. I was in pain both in school and at my house, dealing with the frustration, and strong character of my father at the time for over 10 years.

My father had a very good year back in 2007, so he decided to send me to a boarding school in the US, that was ultra elite, and from the same school brand I was in. We were around 200 men living in the suburbs of a very small town. We did everything there: take classes, sleep, do sports, etc.

That was my first change of context that I had in my whole life. At the time, I thought about myself as a problematic child, who was bullied. So I acted that way in the boarding school as well: so I was bullied there too. However, there was a minuscule difference: back in Mexico I was always picked last while choosing teams in sport, but, in the boarding school I was picked in the middle. That small thing made me question my entire statu quo: why here am I not picked last? Would it be that all my classmates are not correct in their judgements? 

In the boarding school we had an astrobiology class, and it was given by a former NASA employee. He always wrote in the board: ad astra per aspera, which means: to the stars through hardships. That became my life’s lemma, and my motivation giver. 

My first step in motivation was to go to the Gym there. I became strong, and gain more respect. I did not became popular, just became more respected, marginally. The bullying stopped for a bit, or reduced drastically. I was in the boarding school for a year.

Back in Mexico, I kept going to the gym. I gained a little more respect from my classmates. However, I still lacked the social skills, and was perturbed from 10+ non stop bullying and problems in my house. Eventually, the bullying came back again. However, I was stronger, so I started fighting back. 

People in the school, including teachers always thought that I was problematic: since elementary schoolI was always having discipline problems. Now, after coming back, the school principal decided that she had enough and decided to spell me with the words I quoted in the beginning. 

So there I was: a problematic, bullied guy with no friends, extremely angry with life, bad humor and no extracurricular activities. The only place that I was able to get in another “elite” school where the principal was friend of an uncle. When I got there since day 1, the news about my background were already spread: so I was bullied once again. In the first month I was in the orientation office at least 6 times; there was moment that the discipline teacher said when I was entering into her office “not again!”.


This was a mixed school, so there were both girls and boys there. I fell in love with a woman which I was starting to date, but she rejected me once the bullying started in this new school after just one month of moving in. I felt hopeless. So I decided to look in the internet: “how to get your girlfriend back”. Then I found a book called “how to be an alpha male”. Even if this book is no written properly, is amateurish, and the author is not know, it changed my life forever with a simple idea that I had never thought of before: you can change your own destiny by changing your habits.

I started approaching girls without feel of rejection, since all my life I got plenty of it. I started putting into test all the principles of the book. Likewise, I decided to reinvent myself and learn from nothing all social skills I lacked.

I remember starting going out to nightclubs alone (yes in Mexico you can get into nightclubs at 16-17) to approach random people and learn new facts about people. I wrote everything in a notebook. My motivation was that every failure took me closer to the truth (my own truth). This made me a self/thought philosopher; a creator of my own way of living and with my own set of principles.

When I was in my sophomore year. My father started having severe economic crisis. He did not gave me much money to go out. He gave me for the week and equivalent of $7-8. With that, I had to use it for anything that I wanted to consume in parties and to figure out how to go back home by (1 am). This lead me into a situation of feeling poor: I could not spend much, and had to depend on other people to go back home. If I was not able to do it by 1 am, my father would get very mad.

I made very good friends during this time, who helped me deal with my father’s severity and strong character. However, we loved getting wasted, and picking up girls: that became our way of living. We got drunk, and had sex with as many girls as possible. Since the first book I had to change my identity was about getting as many girls I wanted, it is natural that my ideal was to become a Casanova, although, right now it is not by the way.

I spoke to thousands of girls, and was rejected by too many of them. I was so much rejected that I became inmune to it. To deal with social a dirty and shyness, I desired to sing in front of all the school and without being a singer in a talent show “with me, by sum 41”.

At this moment, bullying suddenly stopped in my high school. Now my identity was that of trying to be a party boy with a lot of girls. I did not care about school; I did not do homework or have extracurricular activities: I just went home to read books from Robert Greene to keep building up my social skills, and improving my interpersonal and essentialist intelligence. 

In my high school, people still did not like me due to the reputation I build from my first year as bullied. Also, even though the bullying stopped and I was more social, I was socially awkward and not calibrated. Outside school, I only had fiends who shared the same hedonistic was of thinking; I was not liked by girls as a friend because they all said that I was “weird” from trying to pick up all the time. However, this was the best social life I got so far in my now 19 years old at the time.

By that time, my father’s financial situation was getting worst. I had to start working in my afternoons putting groceries in people’s bags in the supermarket; and as a bar tender in a mediocre bar during my vacations: just with that I can had a little money to spend on party and with my new friends.

I have a little sister, who is 4 years younger than me. My father had some mommy issues with my grandmother, since my grandparents were divorce after my grandmother and her lover crashed while being drunker  and killed somebody. So he was very inclined for giving everything to my sister so he could relief his sense of abandonment from his mother. This translated into unequal treatment between her and a younger brother and I. Basically, she was given everything with no effort, while he had to “solve our own problems”. For example, I was forced to use the public transportation since I had to “solve” my own things; while he always picked her and drive her anywhere she wanted whenever she wanted. She also had a new blackberry at the time, while I had a sonic Erickson cybershot with a keyboard that fell (and I had to guess the keys) during my whole high school.

After this, in my senior year, my parent told me that he had no money to pay for my tuition. That I had to earn a scholarship or pay my university. However, my GPA was around 2.9: so no scholarships would be available to me. I decided to take a shot and apply to CIDE, which is the best economic school in Mexico. They asked for a minimum 3.0 GPA. So I decided to apply: they had a 20% or less acceptance rate. Admission at the time depended on 4 filters: 1) 1300 SAT, with 700 in math minimum 2) a strong math and Spanish exams 3) an interview, and 4) an intensive 1 month with 3 exams that needed to be passed. So I put energy into my last semester of my senior year and pushed my GPA to be 3.3

For some reason, I passed the first 3 filters. The first SAT I did I got 1292, so they let me do it again; I miraculously got 1300. I guessed that it was luck. But when I was in the last one, all the luck faded and the very strong math kicked in: all the math that I did not studied ever before started to affect me: I did not understand anything at first. We had to do around 200 exercises daily: I made all. However, I flopped the first two exams with 1/10 and 2/10 scores: even with a final 8.3/10, I did not hit the minimum passing score.

My backup plan was to study in Anahuac University, a private university with “good reputation”. I got a 30% scholarship and 30% credit. My parents did not accepted and wanted me to go into a mediocre university and pay it myself by working in the afternoon. I decided to do not take that advice and try again for the next year to go into CIDE. 

For that year, a friend of my mother worked in admissions of an engineering school in my town. So I was allowed to go to engineering math classes twice a week to prepare for  CIDE admissions. However, I discovered that the pace was very slow, and that in the first midterm of Calculus 1, I got a 93/100, while the second highest grade was around 62/100. There I discovered that I had the capability of being in a top tier school and I did not wanted to be in a mediocre college.

Then I did my SAT again and got 1493 points, with 795 in math. I was shocked. My 200 math problems a day were paying off. That year, the 4th filter was removed. So I had just to pass the heavy math exam and the interview, which I did. So I was able to get into the finest economic school in Mexico by studying so hard for 6 months. The other 6 months before getting into college I worked with a friend of my mom that was the Ministry of economics department of the state where I was living. Basically I gave him coffee, received guests, and went to many events.

When I started college, it felt like an elementary school: we were only one small group of people studying economics, and the classes schedules were fixed for us. We were around 60 people, and it was the largest group ever in the story of the institution. I was surrounded by people that I considered “nerds”, which in the end reminded me of my bullied years. I had an identity of “party man” and “womanizer”. So I rejected them, and they rejected me back: the story was repeating itself. While I was not bullied, I felt rejected and out of place: I was always trying to meet beautiful women that were in a rich people university that was just across the street. I also had fobia of staying too much in a classroom, and wanted to avoid starting too much inside the school, it was a natural response, since I never felt secure inside a classroom, or academic institution.


Even though I perfected my skills of approaching and meeting girls, I was rejected after just a few messages or dates, since I did not had enough money. By that time, I won a 75% scholarship to attend CIDE, which was given to me for my financial situation. I was also given a $300 budget by the school for my own expenses. With that money I paid half my rent and all my expenses for the month: food, groceries, school expenses, party, transportation, etc. 

CIDE was located in a highway which was in front of a cliff. I was renting a place just across the school in a kind of students house that very cheap. It looked like a poor property of a stereotype Mexican village. How we, I was in a place that the sunlight never reached: it was called “the cave” by the students. 

The university was extremely hard. I was studying all day. The grades were lot inflated so they tended to be very low, and we needed to have at least a 2.7 GPA per semester, else we were not allowed to continue studying. This kind of stress led me to develop addiction to cigarettes: I was smoking at least 20 cigarettes a day of a very cheap brand. I was 20 at the time.

By the time I was in my sophomore year, almost half of the 60 people we were in the school were already out: most of them for not having the minimum 2.7 GPA. I had around 3.5 at the time. I was basically studying all day except Thursdays to Saturdays. In Thursday I always went to pick up girls in the school next door; on Friday I hanged out with one of my high school friends who shared the same hedonistic life. He was studying in another university nearby which was consider as well a rich university. So we always hanged out with his friends.

When I finished my sophomore year. Something tragic happened: my mom decided to left my father because she encountered an old boyfriend of her. She was my emotional support during my whole childhood: she defended me from my father and listened to me when I felt bad about the bullying. So this was felt as a betrayal and almost broke me. From that day, I started having a closer relationship with my dad: we both shared the goal of deciphering what went wrong. 

I stopped speaking to my mother for at least 3 months. I was completely broken hearted. My father as well. If he was in a bad economic situation, this broke him and made him start to make very stupid decisions. For example, we had our own house (from better times). He decided to sell it and invested bad the money. One of those investments was to pay Anahuac university to my sister: I had a better average and conditions to get into it, and, under better conditions I was rejected from it, while she had the privilege of doing so. Also, she was given a costly apartment that was in one of the most expensive places in town so she could be “close to university”, while I was in “the cave”.

Instead of this situations breaking me. I desired to push further. When I was at half of my junior year, I was given the opportunity, due to my grades, of going to Ireland as an exchange. I got a credit, and, with it, I paid my plane tickets and my first month of rent. My father supported me with rent payments, and with my 
$300 budget I had to survive there: doing sightseeing, travel, pay my food and school materials.

There I met some Spanish friends. They became the first mixed group (females and males) I had. I felt very good: while back in Mexico with my friends we were always competing who kissed more women, I did not felt that competition, and I even did not want to actively be seeking women: I discovered that what I really wanted were deep connections. I was able to get first class honors without a lot of effort.

Those times in Ireland were of the most joy for me. There was one time when I said to myself: If I die today, it would not matter, since I am happy. This year let me be away of a very tough and small school, focus on having a normal university life and create deep connections. When the semester was over and I had to go back to Mexico, I decided to stay a little longer and travel around Europe. To do so, I got a job in a hotel, whose owner was the Mexican consulate in that city. My job was hard: destroying bottles that were meant to recycle, clean tables, map the floors, and I was even a construction worker for a couple of days. With it, I was able to travel around Europe, with my own money, and pay my ticket back home.

Back in Mexico, I discovered that all my best friends while I was not there became addicted to Weed. Two of them even drop out school because of their addiction. I remained without smoking it for my first semester of my senior year. However, at the end of the semester, I decided to quit smoking cold turkey after hearing a classmate say: as generation purpose we should make Me stop smoking. There I took my first programming class: I asked for a computer to him so I could take this class; but instead, he bought one for my sister, who in fact did not need it because she was studying “international studies”. So I had to learn how to code using my notebook, and then test everything out using the university’s library computers.

So I grabbed my last cigarette I ever smoked in January first 2018. I was felling really bad after it; I could not sleep. My father always told me about his “magic pill” that made him sleep after 
My mom left us. So I really wanted that magical pill: we went to see a doctor who prescribed it to me: it was clonazepam. I instantly became addicted to it. That thing also made me lower my standards and begin smoking weed regularly. This made my grades go down; I stopped going to classes; arrived late; I was uninterested in them, and I was delayed in my thesis. In the end, my grades went down to a have a 7.6/10; just the minimal for not getting expelled in my last semester. 

I was able to graduate with a 8.5/100. Which was good, but was a heavy downgrade of my previous average. I was very depressed and in addition. While I was in Ireland, my father moved from my childhood home (that I lived from 1 to 23 years old) to another that was in the same neighborhood. Right after graduation, I did not looked for a job, I was just interested in smoking weed, and seeing my hedonistic friends. 

I broke me that my childhood home was tired apart, and I was able to see it from the new house, which we were renting instead of owning. That was my safe place from bullying, and what I felt (and I still fell that is) my home. In my new home, I was sleeping in an old mattress with coil springs that hurtes me, since we do not have money for paying for a base or a new mattress.

Living in that house was a living hell: my father was depressed, my sister loss her scholarship due to bad grades and stopped living in her department. I began to date a sugar momma who was 40 years old, who gave me money monthly for teaching his son math: dating her was my way of going to parties and continue with my hedonistic behavior. With the money she gave me I bought Weed, and twice I tried LSD.

One night, after getting drunk, with clonazepam and weed, my sister woke my father up because “I had the light of the kitchen on” and she could not sleep. So my father came down to complain. To put into context, anytime that I asked my father for help when I had an issue with my sister he said: “solve the problems between each other”, but when my sister had an issue with me or my brother he always without exception defended her. Now, in that context, when he approach to complain, I started hitting him repeatedly saying: “stop spoiling her”! My sister was trying to call the police, I noticed what happened and decided to go to my mother’s place.

That moment, I investigated about the effects of clonazepam (I had taken it daily for 10 months). So so decided in a couple of weeks after that to stop it cold turkey. It was the worst feeling that I have very had: I had hallucinations, insomnia, shakes, paranoia, and extreme anxiety. Luckily, I was not working at the moment. By that time I decided as well to have to stop using Weed. That was by December 2018. Since then, I have not used Clonazepam or weed. 

I remember the extreme cravings, the sleepless nights that I thought that were never going to end. Staying up all night in my mattress in the floor just counting the minutes for the night to come and hopefully be the lucky night I could sleep. However, I remained strong: I went all day to the park to calm down and be in contact with nature. 

By that time, I was contacted by a professor of mine, that happened to be my school advisor. He had a phd from Cornell, and was famous of having one of the toughest classes, where I got an A. He contacted me with a portfolio manger from one of the top three insurance companies in the world who was looking for an economist for his team (for Mexico office). He interviewed me and was impressed by the way I draw and paint (I developed this habilite because that was the way I dealt with my complex emotions before). So he decided to give me a chance.

So this was me, getting my first formal job at 25. In the first 6 months I was there, I was dealing still with clonazepam withdrawal. So there were times that I got to the office without sleeping for a week. For such reasons, I was never accepted by my peers at first. It was during this moment that my manager gave me the job of doing some machine learning models in R. He was impressed of my passion for coding.

My manager became my true friend: he was the older brother that I did not had. He taught me the way of doing things in a work place: he was a therapist for me, and he helped me me to  canalize my complex emotions. He and I shared passions for books: so our discussion gave me the base for feeling OK in the workplace. I also started renting on my own; I choose a cheap place near the office that also was a kind of “cave” since it had few sunlight. However, this allowed me to save and create a “university fund”.

During my time at this insurance company, I discovered that hardwork paid off. I began learning as much as I could about data science, and coding. In a couple of years I was able to automate practically all the job reports and analytics of all things we did in the team. I knew that always giving more than what is asked, taking initiatives, and innovate always paid off.

For the first time in my life, I was able to be comfortable and stop running away of places where I saw repeatedly the same people. By the same time, I started having the idea of studying a master’s degree in an Ivy League. So daily without exception I started preparing myself for the GRE: I bought Kaplan, Manhattan, and all possible guides. 

I did the GRE after 6 months preparation and I got 163 Quant. I felt it was not enough, so I started preparing myself harder. At the same time, after 6 months, I applied for Fullbright scholarship. I passed the first filter, which was having a good GRE, resume, letter of recommendations, and grades. However, the second and last filter was a 20 minute interview: I was so nervous that I did not sleep the night before. When I was in the interview, they asked me out-of-context questions that confused me and made me flop. So I was rejected from it. However, their rejection did not stopped me. I decided to apply for an online version of an Ivy League program who grants the exact same degree as on campus, has the same acceptance rate, has the exact same professor giving the exact same curriculum, and is not an “extension school” or something like that. 

For my surprise, ai was accepted, and I did not even had to do the second GRE. The only problem was: how do I pay it? I had been saving in my university fund by staying in cheap places and not spending a lot in things that are lot necessary. Also, the pandemic at that time, helped me avoiding going out and spend my money in alcohol or dates/ hotels/ etc.

I decided to move to a new job of a financial software provider that is the largest of the world. I was going to get as a consultant of the software in the credit risk side. After around 6 interviews so got the job and got a 100% paycheck increase. Also, I was second place for getting into BlackRock as a quant analyst but lost the job to an Imperial College master graduate in Financial Engineer. So I did not have up and decided to apply to the next position that opens that is similar to that. In the mean time, my job consisted of configuring the software for clients such that they can compute their credit risk. 

This job made me have a lot of new and good friends. This was the first time that I had good friends in a place where I work regularly. However, the problem was that I won their respect not for who I am, but for my abilities of conquering women in the nightclubs when we went out. By that I time I started to feel alone, lonely, and trying to find a deeper purpose; something related to what I had in Ireland. So I began to be open to have my first true relationship anytime soon.

When I started this new job, I started studying in this Ivy League program. I was taking one course at a time, such that I would be able to pay it: I could not possibly be able to stop working and committed full time to study. So I decided to study part time and work full time. This would take me 3.3 years, and it would take back 1.5 years back of my life that I lost while I was in addition and studying to get into CIDE.

I saw this opportunity of studying in Ivy League program as a way to vindicate myself: so I put every fibre of my being into my studies. This meant stop going out, working extra hard every weekend, stop social life, etc. I was able to get 4.0 in all my courses. I only had vacations of two weeks every 4 months. So this felt like a marathon. My masters was in computer science.

So I worked 1.5 years in this new company. I liked working with my new friends, but I wanted to be inside the code, not on the outside. So I asked my manger to help me with the transition. There he said: you need to have contacts, be the best, bla bla bla. Even though I was overachieving due to the grades that I was given, we was puting barriers. One month after that, a new position opened in the competition; this was to precisely what I wanted. So I applied, and, after six months and 5 interviews that asked me about programming, math, and finance, I was able to get the job of my dreams. This position was called: financial engineer. This company was just one month after that bought by one of the stock markets in the US. So, basically, I am working as a Quant of a Wall Street company with an Ivy League degree fully funded by myself.

I also found love and I al going to be married next year. So life gets much better if you keep trying and adopt the lemma: ad astra per aspera.

Is it just me, or has Instagram changed its vibe? Are they intentionally pushing more risqué content to keep people engaged? Or is it just the way the platform is evolving? Curious to hear if others are experiencing the same thing.

Anyway, I plumbed in my sync ii using a TDR force water bottle dispenser. The pump works great and shuts off instantly when I close an inline valve, however. When I added the accumulator, the pump ran until it filled and then slowed down and seemed to struggle to shut off until it finally did. I noticed the same thing when only the espresso machine is hooked up with no accumulator as well. I can only assume this happening due to pressure slowly increasing as the accumulator or boilers are filling, rather than pressure building and actuating the pressure switch instantly like you would have with a valve or faucet. I'm curious if anyone here has experienced this or if it's worth checking the voltage at the pump motor to verify if the pressure switch is doing its job.",1,1742195112.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But there are times after first dates when a guy still keeps chatting with me constantly even though he has no plans on asking me out again…so when do we realize it’s a lost cause and we are just being friendzoned? 

My friends and I usually drop a hint a couple of days after a first date to let the guy know he’s still interested (granted we are still talking)—“Hey, this is a great coffee shop—we should try it sometime!” etc but while some guys are enthusiastic, some really don’t follow up for a second date.

1jd6ll0,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1jd6ll0/a_world_in_focus/,A world in focus,"Because Reddit was being stupid, I have to post this as an original story, rather than in the comments of the post it was for.

And for those of you waiting for the next part of the Echo Seven Salvage storyline, I'm working on it. That will release soon enough.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The office sat in a small corner of the Ecumenopolis, so long as you could say a planet sized city had any. It's faded facade and grimy windows one could hardly look through looked like customers hadn't visited in some time.

Aaron squinted in the fading sun. He could barely make out a pair of loops connected by a beam in the middle. He had heard of such places, though wasn't sure if they still existed. It was far easier to find a hospital and get some surgery or have a biopsion fix your eyes. Easier, yes. But expensive.

He headed towards what looked like the entrance and put his hand where the door handle should be. Sure enough, his hand met a curve of metal. A bell tinkled overhead as he entered what he was pretty sure was an empty room.

""Um... You're not from these parts are you?"" A voice sounded from what looked like a wide open space.

He squinted, trying to see if someone was there.

""Well... I live up the street, and I heard this place was somehow still open."" He said, hopefully looking in their direction.

""Wait... are you..."" The voice paused, ""How many fingers am I holding up?""

He squinted his eyes further, unsure where he was looking.

""Over here by the desk."" The voice called, ""I guess you are pretty blind. Alright, I'll let the doctor know you're here. An actual patient after all these years? Who'd have thought.""

Spotting some benches, he took a seat, only to find the armrest of a chair instead. Moving a little to the side, he took a seat, hoping no one had seen it.

The optometrist seemed to take forever. The only entertainment Aaron seemed to find was in the ticking clock somewhere in the room. He seemed to remember his mother talking about how she used to count ceiling tiles while she waited. He looked up, only seeing a white blur of a ceiling. 

""Um... I know you're supposed to fill out paperwork before you go in, but watching you, I don't think you'll be able to."" The voice said.

A large blur approached him. It stood about as tall as he was sitting down, and carried a distinct odor of fish.

""H'Golian, I presume?"" he asked.

""Well, yes. I suppose that should be evident, even considering your apparent lack of sight. I'd say good eye, but you don't appear to have them.""

Aaron let out a small laugh despite himself, ""yeah, I suppose not. I guess the doctor isn't in, is he?""

""Oh, she's in, yes. She'll be right with you."" The voice replied.

""Sir, right this way."" another voice called.

Despite himself, Aaron looked towards the voice, his vision still quite blurred.

The H'golian gently put her arm on his leg and guided him towards the single examination room. Aaron felt slightly confused at having to squeeze past boxes that were stacked neatly in the room.

""I'm doctor Amanda Rose."" the other voice told him, ""I take it you're here for an examination?""

""Yes. My vision has gotten worse lately, and I can't afford a biopsion, let alone the surgery required to fix them.""

""I see. You probably wish you could, so let's see what we can do without getting too expensive."" The doctor told him.

Aaron heard the clacking of keys as a computer whirred to life.

""Please read to me the smallest letters you can.""

He squinted his eyes, trying to make out anything on the projection in front of him, ""A?"" He said.

""Do you see any others?""

""It's just a blur past there.""

""Hm... well, I guess it doesn't take a genius to guess that you're quite nearsighted. I'm probably stating the obvious there, aren't I?""

""A little, yeah. But sometimes what one person thinks is obvious isn't.""

""You do have a point there. And I do have to figure out *how* nearsighted you currently are."" Aaron heard a stool hit the ground.

A short examination later found him blinking from a bright light and sitting in another room. Several sets of glasses sat on the table.

""Used to be we'd have the patients pick out frames. But since you can't see, let's see if we can find a style that looks good on you. Am I sounding too much like your girlfriend?""

""Ex, yeah. A little. We still talk. We're friends, but... I guess that's not really important, is it?""

The doctor giggled, ""I guess not. But let's at least see what we can do here.""

""Am... I allowed to ask what was with those boxes in that room?"" Aaron asked.

""Ends have to meet one way or another."" She replied.

""I probably shouldn't ask any more questions, then.""

A weight pressed down on his ears. It wasn't heavy or uncomfortable, but foreign.

""You'll get used to it. Trust me."" The doctor commented, ""Now, we do have the ability to make these in house. That's easy enough, so give me a bit, and I'll have a working one so you can pick out others, okay?""

Without another word, she dipped into another room. A short eternity later, she reappeared and placed something on his head.

His world snapped into focus. The doctor stood a head shorter than him. Her long black hair hung down to her waist. A pair of thick black glasses perched atop a small button nose. She wore a loose fitting lab coat over sky blue blouse and khaki skirt.

""It's nice to be able to see, isn't it?"" She asked.

The room around him stood covered with dust. A single mirror stood clean, though it had the appearance of looking hastily done.

""Yeah, we... don't get a ton of patients."" Amanda told him, ""Ends meet, though sometimes it's harder than others... Um... want some help... picking out a frame?""

""I... Yeah. I think I'd like that. Oh, I don't think I introduced myself. I'm Aaron. Aaron Seagrass.""

Amanda smiled, ""well, it's nice to meet you, Aaron.""

A while later found Aaron holding not one, but three new pairs of glasses.

""So, how much do I owe you?"" Aaron asked.

""Well... there's a lovely coffee shop down the road I've been dying to try."" She smiled playfully at him.

Aaron blinked, ""but...""

""It makes real coffee"" Amanda told him, ""Or claims to. Also has this old earth drink too. Not quite as common, but the ingredients are a lot harder to get. Something about Hadikins having a bad reaction to it. It's called chocolate.""

""alright. A date it is then,"" Aaron replied, a smile creeping on to his face.

The world outside, once an almost immeasurable blur that seemed defined only by touch and sound, now felt fresh and new. Leaves shook on trees as the wind blew past them. Birds flapped away, their feathers gleaming in the sunlight.

Typical carry: big water bottle and separate coffee/tea bottle, lunch, small edc kit, hat, sometimes extra layer, and the bigger tossup is a 5-8L camera bag that I only bring occasionally. No laptop/tablet for typical commute.

Also note: I bike to work everyday. Not far, but it’s definitely an “active” commute, so something with a good back panel and that’s relatively stable.

20-25L capacity, ideally 2 external bottle pockets, nice harness/back panel. Low profile, not too formal, not too technical or tactical.

I’m kinda doubtful there’s anything better than the MPL but that’s where yall come in!

How's it going? I'm Ron! That's not really my name, but my nickname i suppose? Or the nick i've chosen! anyways, i'm looking for my duo in fortnite because i'm so tired of playing it solo.

Doesn't really matter, i just wanna have someone to hang out with while we play.

Outside of fortnite i enjoy other games and things like

* Apex Legends

* Modded minecraft

*  Satisfactory

*  Core Keeper

* Movies (i have letterboxd, we can be mutuals!)

* Music (https://last.fm/user/zauron)

* Being inside

* Drinking coffee

* Horror in general

I have a ton of games on steam and EGS. But mostly looking for fortnite i guess? Would be down for apex too, but less so. And if we hit it off i would be down to do a bunch of other games, and also watching movies/shows/anime

I've been dating a lovely lady for just over a year, things have been going well. We are at a stage where we are talking about moving in together.

A couple of months ago we were talking about our past relationships. She says that 6 months before she met me she got pregnant in a summer-long situationship where the man didn't want to commit. From her description it sounded to me like he was using her for sex, although at the time she was open to a serious relationship with him. She ended up having an abortion, and the day after this man blocked her everywhere, no contact.

Until last week, \~18 months later. He's messaged her and they've spoken on the phone. Apparently he was drunk, flirty and made it clear that **he wanted to hook up that night**. She said that they could meet for a coffee the following weekend, but not at night. She didn't say that she had a boyfriend, but she told him that sex wasn't going to happen.

Now she tells me that she's open to being friends with him again, and tells me that I am insecure for not being OK with this.

What am I to think of this? He abandoned her with zero support after a pretty significant event. In my mind he should be dead to her, but now he's back in the picture and she seems open to reconnect on some level, even if its just to meet for a coffee once, or now and again? Is this the huge red flag that my mind is telling me it is or am I upsetting myself over nothing?

**Why This Pick?**

The Pelicans have been rough lately, friends – they’re missing a number of players due to injury, and they really have nothing to play for anymore. New Orleans has lost 6 of their last 7 games, and despite having the home advantage, I think they’re simply outgunned vs the Pistons. That said, Detroit comes into this encounter on the tail end of a back-to-back, and only 1 of the last 6 meetings between these two squads saw more than 233 points. I’ll take the Under to cash.

1jd688f,https://i.redd.it/ws4iwoxp07pe1.jpeg,Draco teaches Hermione how to play the piano,"(I’ve had this on my mind since I finished Detraqueé a few weeks ago. I’m sorry if it’s bad, it’s my first time writing creatively. I hope you like it!) 



""You suck at this.""

He was teasing her, she knew this, but she was getting irritated nonetheless. He made it seem so *effortless* when he played; like it just bled out of him—his fingers intrinsically knowing where to go next, dancing smoothly across the ivory keys, creating the most beautiful melody.

""Draco, seriously. It's not funny! I don't know how you do it. Maybe I'm just not fit for this."" She let out a frustrated breath and her shoulders slumped a little. She felt... childlike.

For a second, he just stared at her. Then he smiled sweetly, and her worry and embarrassment eased a little.

""In the three years I've had the extraordinary honor of being yours, have I ever told you how beautiful you look when you're not irritatingly good at something right away? Seriously, Granger, it's darling."" In a swift motion, he lifted her head gently and pecked the tip of her nose. She could see his smirk from that angle.

Well, fuck. She could feel the heat tinting her cheeks and neck a rosy color. She pushed him away anyway—she was not about to be swooned by pretty words.

""Of course you haven't, because in these three years, that has never happened before!"" She huffed and lifted her chin defiantly as she concentrated back on the piano. So very delicately, she placed her fingertips on the keys, hoping that maybe she could summon the skills to play, even if by mere proximity to the man standing behind her.

His features softened, as if he could see right through her attempt at putting up a front. As he sat next to her, he reached the keys with his right hand slowly, touching hers. His hand was soft. So, *so* soft. ""You'll get it right soon enough. You just have to practice more, that's all."" As he spoke, he began playing softly. ""This is only your third week of playing. You'll master it in no time."" The music was delicate and graceful. It wasn't clumsy and broken like hers had been. She recognized the tune—he played it often. This particular piece always seemed to calm something within him. She liked it, too. It sounded like peace. Like the rays of warming sunlight, and the smell of old parchment. Like a spoon of honey for a sore throat. Like a slept-in Sunday morning, and a comforting book. Like a full heart, and a body well loved. Like being known and understood. *Like love if she ever knew it.*

Suddenly she felt overcome with emotion. She used to hate how sensitive she was, up until he had told her how much he loved this part of her. How in awe he was of her ability to be vulnerable in front of him—he was used to so much coldness growing up.

""I know it's stupid. I just feel this pressure to be good at everything, you know? Like I'm supposed to fill in her shoes.""

For a moment she thought he hadn't heard her, too focused on the intricate melody that his hands were producing. But then confusion tinted his expression. ""...her shoes?""

""Hermione Granger's."" A sad smile touched her lips. She had drawn her hands from the piano altogether and was now facing him fully, her eyes searching his desperately. ""War heroine. Brightest witch of her age. Golden Girl. I just can't keep up with her.""

""This isn't about piano playing at all, is it?"" His hands were still moving, but he was looking at her. *Seeing* her. He didn't need to look down at the piano to play it perfectly. He knew it by heart.

Her eyes were glassy. He didn't need confirmation that this ran deeper than that.

""Hermione."" His eyes focused intently on her. All blue, not a spark of Occlumency. Her favorite shade. ""War Heroine, yes. Brightest witch of her age, yes. Golden Girl, yes. You are all those things, but you are *so much more*, too. You are the kind of woman who wakes up an hour earlier, just to run down for our coffee every morning. And you remember to ask the baker how his mom is doing, like he's not a total stranger behind the counter. You pack extra food in your work bag because you know Lovegood has a tendency to forget her lunch, and you pick up nice plants you think Longbottom will like. You memorized the rules of Quidditch just to feel closer to Ginny, and you never miss Fridays with Potter and Weasley, even though you see them at work every day. You are like a breath of fresh air, Hermione. You are kind, and gentle and caring. Love is all around you because you *are* love. And you also happen to be the smartest, most thought-provoking and mentally stimulating person I’ve ever met! Everyone who knows you can say as much. And I *love* you. Gods, I love *you.* Not because of the things you *certainly can* accomplish, but because of *who you are.* What better proof of the kind of woman you are if not that we are here right now, and that you love *me*?""

Had he switched the song, or was this how it ended? She couldn't remember ever hearing it come to an end. Somewhere as he spoke, the tempo had picked up. It sounded fierce. Like thunder and crashing waves. Her heartbeat was mirroring the melody.

""Draco, I—"" she stifled a sob. A few brave tears had escaped her eyes. But she wasn't crying out of sadness anymore. No, she was crying because she didn't know love could feel like *this*. ""Thank you.""

He brought the song down gently to a stop. And as he did, he angled his body toward her and smiled warmly. He cupped her face and pecked her neck, working his way up and around her face. Her jaw, her cheeks, her temple, her eyelids, her nose. He kissed each one with devotion. As if she truly was made of gold. Lastly, he took her in one last time before kissing her lips.

They stayed like that for what felt like forever, but still not enough. ""I think I've finally finished composing that song.""

Hermione's eyes were closed, her tears now dry and her heart full. ""Hmm?""

1jd67of,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jd67of/bad_timing_or_just_not_that_interested/,Bad timing or just not that interested?,"Apologies for the long post, but I need help navigating this.

I (mid-20s M) reconnected with a girl (mid-20s F) I knew from college after we both moved to a new city. We originally met through a shared interest in music—I helped her get started back then.

After moving, she invited me to a pregame at her place with friends followed by bars. We had a great time, and I realized I liked her. Later that night as I was talking to her friends, she disappeared for a bit and i I saw her leave with another guy (who I assumed was her then-boyfriend). The next day I sent a voice memo saying I had feelings and didn’t want to linger if she was in a relationship. She responded very well—said she had actually broken up with him a few weeks before but was focused on staying single, and she still wanted to be friends. 

I took her answer as her not being into me (she went home with someone from the bar after all) and gave her space, but then she started engaging more—liking my stories, swiping up on stories, and texting me more than usually. We texted for a few weeks, and then I invited her to hang out; I told her that the things I like about her exist regardless of if our connection is romantic. We spent four hours together at an art museum and coffee shops, had deep convos about relationships, and sketched terrible portraits of each other. She asked about my dating life and opened up about struggling to trust men. It wasn’t labeled a date, but it felt like one—flirty, fun, and meaningful.

Right after, she was texting enthusiastically and I was confident we both had a great time. But a few days later, she pulled away—ignoring follow-up plans, not acknowledging one of my music milestones on social media, and disengaging completely. I finally sent a message acknowledging the distance and said I’d give her space. She just replied, “Thank you for understanding.” That was a week ago, and we haven’t talked since.

I think either:
	1.	She wasn’t expecting to feel something and got scared when she did, or
	2.	She just doesn’t like me that way and realized staying friends could be messy.

I’ve accepted that the ball is in her court and I need to move on, but the emotional whiplash of that morning followed by silence and coldness hurts. Part of me hopes it’s just bad timing, part of me is frustrated she didn’t just tell me what’s going on directly, and part of me is overanalyzing if I misread everything.

What do you think happened? Any advice on how to process my emotions in a healthy way?",1,1742192416.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Lately I've been getting into flaxseeds because of high water-soluble fiber and omega 3 content. I began adding whole flaxseeds to my oatmeal (cooked them together) and I noticed it made my oatmeal super creamy. Then one morning, I had some leftover oat-flax water from cooking my oatmeal, and I went experimental and put it into my coffee and BOOM. Game-changer. It tastes very nice, like a nuttier, thicker version of oat milk.

So now, my new breakfast routine is flax oatmeal + flax oatmeal milk coffee. Almond has been dethroned :) Has anyone else experimented with flaxseed milk before? Would love to hear your experiences!",7,1742192212.0,vegan,1,0.9,False
