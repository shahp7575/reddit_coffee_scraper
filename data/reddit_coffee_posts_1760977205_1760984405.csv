1obpdd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1obpdd0/i_tried_using_a_free_ai_to_finish_my_novel_it_got/,I tried using a free AI to finish my novel. It got weirdly personal.,"So, I‚Äôve been battling some serious writer's block for weeks. I have this half-finished fantasy novel sitting on my hard drive, just mocking me. I'm talking a classic setup: a grizzled old knight, a magical sword, the whole deal. In a moment of sheer desperation last night, I googled 'free AI story writer' and clicked the first link that didn't look like it would steal my credit card info.

The beginning was awesome, almost scary-good. I fed it my last paragraph and asked it to continue. The AI picked up my tone perfectly and started writing about my knight, Sir Kaelan, venturing into a dark forest. It described the 'ancient, whispering trees' and the 'damp, loamy scent of the air.' It was better than what I had written, and I was starting to feel a little insecure, but also excited. Maybe this was the push I needed!

Then, things started getting‚Ä¶ specific. It wrote, 'Sir Kaelan adjusted the worn leather strap of his satchel, the one that always dug into his left shoulder, reminding him of that embarrassing incident with the jam tart at the Midwinter festival.' I froze. I have a favorite leather bag with a strap that always digs into my left shoulder. And I have a very vivid, very embarrassing memory involving a jam tart at a family gathering. There was no way it could know that. I chalked it up to a one-in-a-billion coincidence and let it keep writing.

But it didn't stop. The AI made the magical sword's hilt the exact same shade of blue as my favorite coffee mug. It described the villain's castle as having a chipped stone gargoyle that looked suspiciously like my neighbor's grumpy bulldog, Frank. The final straw was when it wrote, 'Sir Kaelan longed for a bowl of his mother‚Äôs famous chicken soup, the kind with too much pepper, just like he always complained about but secretly loved.' My mom‚Äôs soup is legendary for being a pepper-pocalypse. I slammed my laptop shut. I‚Äôm not sure if I stumbled upon a genuinely psychic AI or if it‚Äôs just a master of pulling from some deep, dark well of human experience, but my novel is definitely back to being a solo project.

So, has anyone else had an AI get a little too close for comfort? Or did I just invent a new form of digital haunting?",1,1760984261.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Wish me luck because I am in a house full of Anti Fasters and they constantly talk about food. If it gets too bad I will go and stay in a hotel for the 3 remaining days.

Anyone who wishes to join me can do so.

1obp76s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1obp76s/aita_for_gaslighting_my_husband_about_fertility/,AITA for gaslighting my husband about fertility issues so I could pass off my affair baby as his?,"I convinced my husband he was shooting blanks so I could secretly have my ex's baby, and now my entire family won't speak to me.

I got married three years ago. My husband wanted kids immediately. I wasn't ready. Every month he'd ask if I was pregnant yet and I'd lie and say I was still on birth control. He kept pushing. His mother kept pushing. Everyone wanted a baby except me.

Then my ex reached out last year. We met for coffee. Then dinner. Then his apartment. I told myself it was just closure. But it kept happening. Four months of sneaking around while my husband worked late shifts at the hospital.

When I missed my period, I panicked. The baby was definitely my ex's. We'd been careless. My husband and I had been trying for maybe six weeks at that point, but the timing didn't add up.

So I came up with a plan.

I started planting seeds. ""Maybe we should see a specialist. My friend tried for two years before she got help."" My husband got defensive. He said his family had no history of fertility issues. I kept at it. ""It's probably me, but you should get tested too. Just to rule things out.""

He refused for weeks. I cried. I said I needed to know what we were dealing with. He finally agreed to make an appointment. But here's the thing. He never went. He kept rescheduling. Work was crazy. He'd go next month. Then the month after.

I told him I'd gone to my appointment. I said everything looked fine on my end. Then I sat him down and said the doctor suggested he might want to get checked because sometimes these things are male factor. He got so quiet. Just stared at the wall.

""You think something's wrong with me?""

""I don't know. Maybe we should just find out.""

He didn't schedule anything. But I could see it eating at him. He started researching online. Reading forums. Getting in his own head. I'd catch him staring at nothing, looking devastated. I felt sick about it but I was too far in.

When I told him I was pregnant two months later, he cried. Happy tears. He said he'd been so worried. He kept saying ""we did it"" over and over. I smiled and hugged him and felt like the worst person alive.

The pregnancy was awful. Not physically. Emotionally. My ex wanted nothing to do with it once he found out. He blocked my number. My husband was over the moon planning the nursery, picking names, talking to my belly every night. His mother threw me a huge shower. Everyone was so excited.

Then the baby came.

My husband is pale with light brown hair and blue eyes. I have dark blonde hair and green eyes. My ex is half Filipino with thick black hair and deep brown eyes.

The baby had a full head of black hair. Dark eyes. Features that looked nothing like either of us. Well, nothing like my husband.

The nurse handed her to him first. He held her for maybe thirty seconds before his face changed. He looked at me. Then at the baby. Then back at me.

""She's beautiful,"" he said. But his voice was flat.

My mother in law came in an hour later. She took one look at the baby and stopped smiling. My own mother pulled me aside and whispered, ""Honey, this baby doesn't look like him at all.""

Everyone pretended everything was fine for three days. Then my husband came home from picking up prescriptions and said, ""I got a paternity test kit. I need to know.""

I could have kept lying. But something broke in me. I just started crying and told him everything. The affair. The timing. The gaslighting about fertility. All of it.

He didn't yell. He just picked up his keys and left. His mother called me an hour later screaming that I was evil. That I'd destroyed her son. My own parents called next. They'd talked to his parents. They were horrified. My father said I'd embarrassed the entire family.

The test confirmed what everyone already knew. My husband filed for divorce immediately. He's not on the birth certificate. He wants nothing to do with the baby or me. His family is threatening to sue me for emotional distress. My family won't help with the baby. My mother told me I made my bed.

I'm alone with a newborn. My ex still won't respond. My friends have all sided with my husband. I've been getting messages calling me a monster. My sister won't let me see my nephew anymore. She said she doesn't want her son around someone capable of what I did.

I know I'm the villain here. But the isolation is crushing. The baby didn't ask for any of this. Neither did my husband. I destroyed everything because I was selfish and scared and stupid.

So am I the worst person in the world, or is my family overreacting by completely cutting me off when I have a newborn to take care of?

1. Back in spring, I got a letter to survey if I am suitable as a jury. I filled it out and sent it back.

2. In late August, I got another letter with a summon for me to attend the courthouse for jury selection in October. This is for the Newmarket court house. This summon means you are in a jury panel, you are not a jury yet.

3. At 8:30am on that day, I attended the courthouse. You will need to line up for security as there are many many others that are also there for jury at that time. Don't need to rush or worry if you show up on time. They expected you to go through security.

4. Once pass security, you will go to the Jury Assembly Room. There, you will show them the summon and ID. They check you in and you can pick up a letter for your employer stating you went to jury duty. The room is all bench seating with a few tables at the back. I went for the tables as I plan to do work while waiting. I sat and had breakfast and a cup of coffee that I brough from home. Trust me, bring a snack and drink, the room is bare and there is nothing there except a vending machine and a water cooler. Also, bring spare battery if you plan on spending time on phone. They lack outlet in the room.

5. Once everyone is there and ready to go, the jury officer explain that we will wait for our numbers to be called (jury number shown on the summon) and we will be going in front of a judge. I believe since there was only 1 case that need jury that day, we were told to bring our belonging to the court as we will not be back in the JAR. The only option from that point is you are selected and congratulation you are now a jury or you are dismissed and can go home. They then show you a video about how good being a jury is.

6. In my case, the judge actually came into the JAR, explain that this was supposed to be a murder trial that's planned for 9 weeks but they came to a deal and no more trial. We were all dismissed and can go home. So I arrived at 8:30am and we were dismissed by 9:30am. 

As you can see, once you get summon. You could end up like me, an hour on the panel and we are all dismissed or some other ones you read which you stay at the courthouse the entire day.",2,1760983764.0,ontario,2,1.0,False

1obp6i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1obp6i9/abusive_friend_i_hold_huge_resentment_towards/,Abusive friend I hold huge resentment towards,"I made this friend because he worked the store next door to me and would always come in to get coffee. Eventually I asked him to hang out and we started to chill at his house. 

He lived in a big mansion with a pool and started coming over all the time. I eventually started inviting my other friends over and became a nice big group. Everything was going fantastic and we had a great summer always hanging out multiple times a weeks. He eventually became one of my best friends

We were very open about our issues, had a lot of things in common about our pasts . He had been through some drug abuse, bad relationships, and had struggled a lot. We bonded over this and very open about everything 

One day when we hung out my other friends cooked something in his kitchen and left it a mess. That night I was going out with some other friends and he called me 

I picked up the phone and immediately started cursing at me and calling me horrible things. I was so upset I started crying in front of my friends. I made it up to him by buying him and his dad expensive wine and trying to make things up 

After this I had became a bit uncomfortable hanging out with him. I was very hurt by the things he said and it made me a little bit scared he will lash out again

He would sometimes get mad at me over the smallest things. Like accidently leaving his bedroom door a crack open because afraid his cat would go outside (of his room not the house), not paying attention fully when I played video games with him, and just some passive aggressiveness. 

A few months later he had a mental breakdown over his ex breaking up with him and ended up at a psychiatric ward to check on him. He asked me to pick him up and I did it without question. Stayed with him all night to make sure he was okay and he was very grateful. 

2 weeks later my car got a flat tire. My parents wouldn‚Äôt pick me up so I asked him to pick me up because he worked 10 minutes away. He threw a fit because he was picking up LSD from his drug dealer (he had recently got back into it) He picked me up and was angry, driving erratically and insulting me even when I paid for his dinner. The next night he yelled at my other friend about me complaining about the door thing and not listening. I tried my best to make things better but again made me uncomfortable 

Eventually he started to cut each and every friend off from the group until it was just me left. We hung out one day and took a hike and had a good time. That‚Äôs until I accidentally left his door a crack open again. He said he was about to flip out and me and got very angry. I was terrified and kept apologizing and he blamed it on his OCD

That was the last time I hung out with him. I asked him if he was doing okay and said he needed some time to himself. 

A week later I went to visit my friends across the country. I washed my clothes and accidentally dried one of my friends designer clothes. He was mad but after buying drinks for him told me I‚Äôm a great person and he could never stay mad.

And it clicked and realized that even though I damaged property I was able to not have him hold a grudge like said abusive friend. I decided to stop talking to him 

A week later I sent him a message telling him about how hurtful his actions were to me and wished him luck with life. I tried to be kind but firm. Then I unfollowed him and blocked him on everything. 

But still to this day I‚Äôve been holding onto extreme anger and betrayal. Like he faced no consequences for how he treated me. I would get extremely angry and just things that had nothing to do with it would set me off into rages about this friend 

I have been trying to use love and kindness and mindfulness to remind me this friendship is over by my accord but still get very upset and rage full even though it was months ago. My therapist and I have been making a lot of good progress but sometimes I slip up. 

I‚Äôm still working on keeping myself calm about this and knowing I no longer have toxic people in my life but still feel anger and hurt when I saw his social media posts.

You know the kind of place where you say ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and immediately put your headphones on before anyone replies.



Anyway, I was walking down the hall this morning, coffee in hand, pretending to be a functioning adult, when I saw a coworker waving. Like, big wave. So I naturally waved back  full enthusiasm, smile, slight nod  the whole ‚Äúyeah man, we‚Äôre friendly!‚Äù performance.



Except.



He wasn‚Äôt waving at me.

He was waving at someone behind me.



So now, I‚Äôve already committed. My arm is mid-air. I can‚Äôt stop, because then it looks like I was waving at no one. So I try to play it off and turn the wave into this weird ‚Äústretch‚Äù motion, like I‚Äôm just casually loosening up in the hallway. Except my coffee spills. Everywhere.



Instant chaos. Coffee on the floor, my shirt, possibly a nearby printer. My coworker just stands there frozen, mid wave, like he‚Äôs watching a nature documentary about social failure.



But here‚Äôs where it gets worse: another coworker saw the whole thing and said, ‚ÄúHey, you good?‚Äù in that tone that means ‚ÄúI will tell everyone about this in the break room.‚Äù



Now it‚Äôs been three days, and every time I pass that hallway, the original guy does a tiny wave  like a micro wave, barely moving his fingers just to mock me. I swear he‚Äôs assembling allies. It‚Äôs becoming this passive aggressive ritual. I wave back, obviously, because what else am I supposed to do? Not wave? That would make it weird.



So yeah. I am currently trapped in a wave based psychological war that I started. I have no exit strategy. I‚Äôm just trying to drink my coffee in peace.

At the moment I am at 31 hour, I am definitely getting the cravings for food but I am trying my best to control myself. I was watching videos online of people who did the fasting as well, and some say the fasting does nothing and even the weight they lost during the 3 day fasting came back a week later. Is this really true? I don't intend to overeat when I am done with my 72 hours, I will continue with calorie deficient diet but the fact weight comes back is a bit worrying.

Additionally, I have been drinking lots of water and only had plain black coffee for breakfast. Would it break my fast if I also include diet coke or pepsi max in my diet? Diet coke and pepsi max barely have any calories so I have been tempted, but I don't want to do anything that could break my fast. ",0,1760983498.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.5,False

No emails sent. No Teams messages replied to. Just circulating the floor like a community liaison of vibes.

Unless it‚Äôs the end of fiscal or you‚Äôre an ADM with a gold-plated pension, nobody is doing more than 3‚Äì4 hours of real work a day. The rest? Pure theatre.

I take 40-minute poops as a form of protest. Hit the gym mid-shift. Book meeting rooms just to nap and scroll memes like I‚Äôm guarding national secrets.

Last time we were all forced in, I was shocked at how little work actually happens between the ‚Äúquick‚Äù catch-ups, coffee runs, and spontaneous conversations about absolutely nothing.

My rebellion against RTO is strategic and deeply principled:

I bring my lunch from home to avoid ‚Äúsupporting the local economy.‚Äù

I make my own coffee in the office kitchen like I‚Äôm running a speakeasy.

I bring snacks like it‚Äôs a personal picnic, not a modern workplace.

I stick exactly to my contracted hours and nothing more. When 4:30 hits, I evaporate.

Commute time = YouTube university, personal development, and occasionally watching raccoon documentaries.


We‚Äôre not back in the office to increase productivity.
We‚Äôre here to cosplay working adults while perfecting the art of sanctioned loitering.

RTO isn‚Äôt about collaboration - it‚Äôs about performance. And my performance is flawless.

She said she'd like to but to postpone to the next weekend, because she had some family business that one. I said fine, we continued talking, the vibes kept going strong.

Friday next week comes along and she tells me that she can't then either, family business again. I said ok and suggested that we could go out after work. I was pretty sure at this point she wasn't actually interested and was goona take the step to break it off when she said no, but she said yes. Middle of the week comes along and I ask, she says she's too tired after work stuff and then suggests we go out on sunday herself, and tells me that ""she really does want to go out"", this will become relevant later. The day of she stops responding, only to tell me 2 hours before the date was on that she didn't feel well.

At this point I tried to gently break things off, told her that I didn't appreciate the lack of communication and that her delaying told me she wasn't interested.

She apologised for telling me so late and told me that nothing was wrong, she really was just tired and she felt a bit pressured.

Here comes the part I regret, instead of telling her flat out that it's better to stop talking, I took the bait and apologised for insisting on the date, told her that meeting in person was important to me but that I'd give her a few days of space. I expected her to not reply after that, but she replied directly to my message about meeting in person saying how she didn't see it that way, and chiding me for wanting to schedule a date after only a few *days of talking, that she met all of her friends online and thinks you can form close connections that way - which I don't dissagree with bdw, but we live in the same town - and then apologised saying she felt like she wasted my time.

That's when I lost my shit a bit, the frustration from spending the whole day not knowing what was up and frustration at myself for *not prying from the start. I'm fine with others not seeing meeting irl as important as I do, I can compromise, but if she felt that way the normal thing to do was to tell me when I first asked.

I sent her a message telling her that it was basic courtesy to tell me that she didn't want to go instead of stringing me along by accepting, called her a liar for telling me she did want to go out and that she didn't waste my time, I did by not having this conversation earlier. I then told her good luck and blocked her number, I didn't want to deal with a reply at work.

The lie set me off the most, but now I've calmed down, I need an outside oppinion on this. I worded the title as neutrally as possible so I don't give any preconceptions before the details. AITA for droping that on her?

Last night, that trust was shattered. And now I‚Äôm sitting in a hotel room a thousand miles from home, thinking about what i have witnessed.

It was a routine red-eye flight, a six-hour haul across the country. The kind of flight that pilots both love and hate. The skies are quiet, the passengers are asleep, but the deep, soul-crushing fatigue of flying through the dead of night is a constant, creeping enemy. We were at our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet, somewhere over the vast, dark, empty heart of the country. The autopilot was engaged, the plane a steady, silent ship sailing on an ocean of stars. The Captain, a veteran with twenty years in the left seat, was quietly working on a crossword puzzle. I was doing my usual scan of the instruments, my eyes tracing the familiar, comforting glow of the displays.

That‚Äôs when I saw it. On my primary navigation display, the screen that shows our position, our route, and any other air traffic in the vicinity, a single, new icon had appeared.

It was a perfect, solid green diamond, the standard symbol for other aircraft. But it had no call sign, no altitude information, no speed data. It was just‚Ä¶ a diamond. And it was located about ten miles directly behind us, on our exact flight path.

‚ÄúHey, Cap,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice casual. ‚ÄúYou seeing this traffic on your display?‚Äù

The Captain didn't look up from his puzzle. ‚ÄúNope. Screen‚Äôs clean. Probably just a ghost. ATC hasn't called anything out.‚Äù

Ghosts, or phantom radar returns, aren't uncommon. A bit of atmospheric interference, a flock of birds, a software glitch‚Äîthey can all create a temporary, false target. They usually flicker and then vanish.

But this one wasn't flickering. It was solid, steady, and it was matching our speed of 500 knots perfectly.

‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs not fading,‚Äù I said, a little more insistently this time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been there for a solid minute. Ten miles, six o‚Äôclock, matching our speed.‚Äù

The Captain finally sighed, put down his pen, and leaned over. He looked at his own, identical navigation display. It was, as he‚Äôd said, completely clean. Then he looked at mine.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there, kid,‚Äù he said, squinting at my screen. ‚ÄúNot a thing. Your display must be on the fritz. Run a diagnostic.‚Äù

I stared at my screen. The green diamond was as clear as day. I looked back at his. Empty. I looked back at mine. The diamond was still there. A cold, strange feeling, a prickling of deep, fundamental wrongness, began to crawl up my spine.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, there‚Äôs something on my screen,‚Äù I said, my voice tight.

He gave me a look, a mix of annoyance and paternal concern. ‚ÄúLook, I see your screen. It‚Äôs blank. You‚Äôre seeing things. You‚Äôre tired. We‚Äôve been flying for four hours. It happens. Just‚Ä¶ run the diagnostic and get some coffee.‚Äù

He went back to his puzzle, a clear dismissal. But my eyes were glued to my screen. The diamond was still there, ten miles back, a silent, impossible companion in the night sky. I ran the diagnostic. The system came back clean. No errors. No malfunctions.

I kept watching it. For ten solid minutes, it stayed in the exact same spot, maintaining a perfect, ten-mile distance. A part of my brain, was still trying to find a rational explanation. A unique, localized software bug affecting only my display. That had to be it.

I finally broke my gaze. I had to make a routine radio call to the next air traffic control sector. I looked away from my screen for no more than ten seconds. I keyed the mic, made the call, and then my eyes snapped back to the navigation display.

The diamond was now one mile away.

My breath hitched in my throat. I didn‚Äôt just gasp; I think I made a small, choked, terrified sound. It had crossed nine miles of empty space in the ten seconds I wasn‚Äôt looking.

‚ÄúCap,‚Äù I whispered, my voice a strangled croak.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù he sighed, not looking up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúThe thing. It‚Äôs one mile behind us.‚Äù

He finally looked up, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated annoyance. ‚ÄúFor the last time, there is nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù He stopped. He leaned over, looked at my screen, then at his own, then back at mine. His eyes went wide. The diamond, now much larger on the display, was there. He could see it now, too.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù he breathed, his crossword forgotten. He grabbed the radio, his voice now sharp, professional. ‚ÄúCenter, this is flight 1138. Do you show any traffic at our six o‚Äôclock, approximately one mile? We have an unidentified target on our scope.‚Äù

The reply from the controller was calm, but I could hear the faint undertone of confusion. ‚ÄúUh, negative, 1138. Our scopes are clear in your vicinity. You‚Äôre the only thing we see for fifty miles in any direction.‚Äù

The Captain and I just stared at each other, the same cold, terrifying realization dawning in both our eyes. This thing, whatever it was, was visible only to us.

And then, I understood. With a clarity so sudden and so horrifying it felt like a physical blow, I understood the rule.

‚ÄúIt only moves when I‚Äôm not looking,‚Äù I whispered.

The Captain stared at me. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I saw it before,‚Äù I explained, my eyes now locked on the green diamond on my screen, not daring to look away, ‚Äúit was ten miles back. I looked away to make a radio call, and when I looked back, it was here. It only moves when I‚Äôm not watching it.‚Äù

It was the most insane, childish, playground-logic thing I had ever said. It was the rule from a horror movie, from a video game. Weeping Angels. Don‚Äôt blink. But in the cold, sterile, logical world of my cockpit, it was the only explanation that fit the data.

The next hour was the longest, most agonizing hour of my life. My eyes burned. My neck ached. I couldn‚Äôt look away. The Captain handled all the communications, his voice tight with a tension that I‚Äôm sure the controllers on the ground could hear. He kept glancing at me, then at my screen, his face a pale, sweaty mask in the dim cockpit light.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still there?‚Äù he‚Äôd ask every few minutes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still there,‚Äù I‚Äôd reply, my voice a dry rasp, my eyes watering from the strain.

I tried to be clever. I tried to use my peripheral vision to look at the other instruments, but the moment my focus shifted even slightly from the center of the screen, I could feel it. A subtle, almost imperceptible lurch in my stomach, a strange, dizzying sensation of movement, of space being compressed. The moment my focus snapped back to the diamond, the feeling would stop.

But I couldn't keep it up forever. My eyes were on fire. They were so dry and strained that the screen in front of me was starting to blur, the glowing green diamond swimming in a haze of my own tears.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this, Cap,‚Äù I finally gasped, my vision wavering. ‚ÄúMy eyes‚Ä¶ I have to rub my eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare, kid,‚Äù he hissed, his voice a low, desperate command. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare look away.‚Äù

But it was too late. My body betrayed me. I rubbed them, and it was a long, slow, agonizingly tired rubbing as i am trying to regain my focus, my eyelids feeling like they were made of lead.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was clean.

The green diamond was gone.

A wave of profound, shuddering relief washed over me. It was over. It had vanished. I had won the world‚Äôs most terrifying staring contest. I let out a choked, hysterical laugh.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone,‚Äù I said to the Captain, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

The Captain didn't reply. He was staring straight ahead, through the cockpit window, his face a mask of pure, abject terror I had never seen on any human being, let alone this grizzled, unflappable veteran.

‚ÄúFirst Officer‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, his voice a strangled, terrified thing. ‚ÄúWhat is that‚Ä¶ above us?‚Äù

I followed his gaze, up, through the top window of the cockpit. And I saw it.

We were flying under an ocean. A living, breathing, impossible ocean where the sky should have been. And floating in that ocean, its colossal, bulbous body blotting out the stars, was a creature of impossible scale. It was a squid. A squid the size of a mountain, its skin a shifting, iridescent tapestry of colors I had never seen before. Its tentacles, each one as thick as a skyscraper, drifted lazily in the void, tipped with what looked like hooks of polished obsidian. And at the center of its great, fleshy head was a single, vast, intelligent eye, a golden, reptilian orb the size of a football stadium. And it was looking down at us.

We were a tiny, insignificant minnow, swimming under the belly of a leviathan.

My mind, simply‚Ä¶ broke. I stared, my mouth agape, unable to process the sheer, cosmic, Lovecraftian horror of what I was seeing.

And then, I rubbed my eyes, not believing wat i am seeing.

Just a normal, reflexive this time. When my eyes opened, it was gone from above us.

It was now in front of us.

It was just there, filling the entire windshield, a solid wall of shifting, alien color and a single, vast, golden eye that filled my entire universe.

The Captain screamed, a raw, terrified, animal sound. I just sat there, frozen, waiting for the impact that would annihilate us.

I rubbed my eyes again.

And it was gone. The sky in front of us was empty. The stars were back. I looked at my navigation display. It was clean.

The Captain was hyperventilating, his hands shaking so violently he couldn‚Äôt hold his pen. ‚ÄúDid we‚Ä¶ did we just‚Ä¶?‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI think we did.‚Äù

The rest of the flight was a silent, terrified ordeal. We landed the plane on autopilot, our hands too shaky to trust with the controls. We didn't speak a single word to each other. When we got to the gate, we just unbuckled, grabbed our bags, and walked out of the cockpit, leaving the plane to the next crew.

I‚Äôm in my hotel room now. It‚Äôs been hours, but I can‚Äôt stop shaking. The Captain is in the room next to me. I can hear him, through the wall, talking on the phone to his wife, his voice a broken, trembling thing.

I don‚Äôt know what we saw. I don‚Äôt know what the rules are. But I know this. There are things in the sky, in the deep, dark, empty spaces. And they have their own rules. And last night, I played a game with one of them. A game of hide and seek, at 500 knots, at 37,000 feet. And I am so, so afraid that it‚Äôs not done playing with me. I am so afraid to see it again.",1,1760982943.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My breath hitched in my throat. I didn‚Äôt just gasp; I think I made a small, choked, terrified sound. It had crossed nine miles of empty space in the ten seconds I wasn‚Äôt looking.

‚ÄúCap,‚Äù I whispered, my voice a strangled croak.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù he sighed, not looking up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúThe thing. It‚Äôs one mile behind us.‚Äù

He finally looked up, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated annoyance. ‚ÄúFor the last time, there is nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù He stopped. He leaned over, looked at my screen, then at his own, then back at mine. His eyes went wide. The diamond, now much larger on the display, was there. He could see it now, too.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù he breathed, his crossword forgotten. He grabbed the radio, his voice now sharp, professional. ‚ÄúCenter, this is flight 1138. Do you show any traffic at our six o‚Äôclock, approximately one mile? We have an unidentified target on our scope.‚Äù

The reply from the controller was calm, but I could hear the faint undertone of confusion. ‚ÄúUh, negative, 1138. Our scopes are clear in your vicinity. You‚Äôre the only thing we see for fifty miles in any direction.‚Äù

The Captain and I just stared at each other, the same cold, terrifying realization dawning in both our eyes. This thing, whatever it was, was visible only to us.

And then, I understood. With a clarity so sudden and so horrifying it felt like a physical blow, I understood the rule.

‚ÄúIt only moves when I‚Äôm not looking,‚Äù I whispered.

The Captain stared at me. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I saw it before,‚Äù I explained, my eyes now locked on the green diamond on my screen, not daring to look away, ‚Äúit was ten miles back. I looked away to make a radio call, and when I looked back, it was here. It only moves when I‚Äôm not watching it.‚Äù

It was the most insane, childish, playground-logic thing I had ever said. It was the rule from a horror movie, from a video game. Weeping Angels. Don‚Äôt blink. But in the cold, sterile, logical world of my cockpit, it was the only explanation that fit the data.

The next hour was the longest, most agonizing hour of my life. My eyes burned. My neck ached. I couldn‚Äôt look away. The Captain handled all the communications, his voice tight with a tension that I‚Äôm sure the controllers on the ground could hear. He kept glancing at me, then at my screen, his face a pale, sweaty mask in the dim cockpit light.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still there?‚Äù he‚Äôd ask every few minutes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still there,‚Äù I‚Äôd reply, my voice a dry rasp, my eyes watering from the strain.

I tried to be clever. I tried to use my peripheral vision to look at the other instruments, but the moment my focus shifted even slightly from the center of the screen, I could feel it. A subtle, almost imperceptible lurch in my stomach, a strange, dizzying sensation of movement, of space being compressed. The moment my focus snapped back to the diamond, the feeling would stop.

But I couldn't keep it up forever. My eyes were on fire. They were so dry and strained that the screen in front of me was starting to blur, the glowing green diamond swimming in a haze of my own tears.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this, Cap,‚Äù I finally gasped, my vision wavering. ‚ÄúMy eyes‚Ä¶ I have to rub my eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare, kid,‚Äù he hissed, his voice a low, desperate command. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare look away.‚Äù

But it was too late. My body betrayed me. I rubbed them, and it was a long, slow, agonizingly tired rubbing as i am trying to regain my focus, my eyelids feeling like they were made of lead.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was clean.

The green diamond was gone.

A wave of profound, shuddering relief washed over me. It was over. It had vanished. I had won the world‚Äôs most terrifying staring contest. I let out a choked, hysterical laugh.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone,‚Äù I said to the Captain, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

The Captain didn't reply. He was staring straight ahead, through the cockpit window, his face a mask of pure, abject terror I had never seen on any human being, let alone this grizzled, unflappable veteran.

‚ÄúFirst Officer‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, his voice a strangled, terrified thing. ‚ÄúWhat is that‚Ä¶ above us?‚Äù

I followed his gaze, up, through the top window of the cockpit. And I saw it.

We were flying under an ocean. A living, breathing, impossible ocean where the sky should have been. And floating in that ocean, its colossal, bulbous body blotting out the stars, was a creature of impossible scale. It was a squid. A squid the size of a mountain, its skin a shifting, iridescent tapestry of colors I had never seen before. Its tentacles, each one as thick as a skyscraper, drifted lazily in the void, tipped with what looked like hooks of polished obsidian. And at the center of its great, fleshy head was a single, vast, intelligent eye, a golden, reptilian orb the size of a football stadium. And it was looking down at us.

We were a tiny, insignificant minnow, swimming under the belly of a leviathan.

My mind, simply‚Ä¶ broke. I stared, my mouth agape, unable to process the sheer, cosmic, Lovecraftian horror of what I was seeing.

And then, I rubbed my eyes, not believing wat i am seeing.

Just a normal, reflexive this time. When my eyes opened, it was gone from above us.

It was now in front of us.

It was just there, filling the entire windshield, a solid wall of shifting, alien color and a single, vast, golden eye that filled my entire universe.

The Captain screamed, a raw, terrified, animal sound. I just sat there, frozen, waiting for the impact that would annihilate us.

I rubbed my eyes again.

And it was gone. The sky in front of us was empty. The stars were back. I looked at my navigation display. It was clean.

The Captain was hyperventilating, his hands shaking so violently he couldn‚Äôt hold his pen. ‚ÄúDid we‚Ä¶ did we just‚Ä¶?‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI think we did.‚Äù

The rest of the flight was a silent, terrified ordeal. We landed the plane on autopilot, our hands too shaky to trust with the controls. We didn't speak a single word to each other. When we got to the gate, we just unbuckled, grabbed our bags, and walked out of the cockpit, leaving the plane to the next crew.

I‚Äôm in my hotel room now. It‚Äôs been hours, but I can‚Äôt stop shaking. The Captain is in the room next to me. I can hear him, through the wall, talking on the phone to his wife, his voice a broken, trembling thing.

I don‚Äôt know what we saw. I don‚Äôt know what the rules are. But I know this. There are things in the sky, in the deep, dark, empty spaces. And they have their own rules. And last night, I played a game with one of them. A game of hide and seek, at 500 knots, at 37,000 feet. And I am so, so afraid that it‚Äôs not done playing with me. I am so afraid to see it again.",1,1760982894.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1obotvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1obotvv/what_is_different_about_retention/,What is different about retention?,"It seems to me like all bad habits share some common patterns, and all good habits do the same. (At least for my understanding of ""good"" and ""bad"", this is the case.)

The bad habit is always about prioritizing immediate gratification. The good is always about the opposite.

The bad habit is always sustained by a few distinct thought patterns: Eg, ""I already failed, so today is already lost, so I can induldge"", ""If I can't be perfect, it makes no sense to even try"", ""If I fail, I will the worst human being, so there is less risk if I don't even try"". (And a few others, I'm sure. It would be fun to collect them all!) -- The remedy always has to do with recognizing and changing those patterns.

There are always rituals: Drinking at night, coffee at breakfast, a cigarette after coffee etc. You have to get rid of or replace those rituals with something that fulfills the same emotional need.

There is always a cycle of shame, trying, unrealistic optimism, failing, shame... The only way to win is to break that cycle.

Related: People always either deny that there is a problem, or they have a history of trying and failing. Good habits are never achieved at the first attempt. They take time and effort.

When you try to change, there is always insecurity at first, about whether you will make it. The insecurity turns into joy when you realize that you are really free.

(There is often, but not always, a group of ""friends"" who stabilize the behaviour.)

What other common patterns would like to add? I'm sure that I didn't find all of them.

Okay, the title might be a little bit of a ruse, but I am very serious about the question: What does PMO share with all other bad habits? What does SR share with all good habits? And what makes SR different from the rest? To be clear, I am not talking about CONTENT - obviously, drinking coffee is different from gambling is different from doomscrolling is different from fapping. On your journey, did you notice any distinct difference that separates SR from the rest?",1,1760982846.0,pureretention,0,1.0,False

1obosou,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1obosou/hes_here_positive_ftm_birth_story_and_my_bulging/,"He's here! Positive FTM birth story and my ""bulging bag""","Had my little guy three days ago at 40+2! Weighing in at 9lbs4oz, he's a tall, sturdy little guy (I'm 6ft tall with a solid build and 9-10lbs babies are average in my family, but I was still hoping he'd be a little smaller lol). I had an induction scheduled for this Wednesday, but at my 40wk appointment I was 2cm dilated and 70% effaced and my doctor said she didn't think I'd make it to the induction. We went ahead and did a membrane sweep and she sent me on my way.

So that was last Wednesday. For the next day, I had a few sporadic contractions where I wasn't sure if it was Braxton hicks getting more intense or very early/light real contractions. The best way I can describe it is Braxton Hicks felt like just my belly tightening, while these were similar but I felt it all the way down to my vagina. Not quite painful, but definitely uncomfortable and a bit different.

I didn't feel great when I woke up Friday morning (back pain, a couple of those sporadic ""maybe early contractions""). Took a Tylenol, had my breakfast and coffee, etc.

It hit me like a BRICK at 8am. I went from contractions ten minutes apart at 8 to five minutes apart at 8:30. By 9:30, we were leaving for the hospital and they were at 2-3 minutes apart and getting pretty intense.

I was 4cm dilated when they checked me at triage and admitted me. Luckily they asked if I was planning on an epidural then, so by the time they got me set up in a room an hour later I only waited a few minutes before the anesthesiologist came because I was definitely reaching the point that I didn't want to feel those contractions anymore lol. By then, the pain wrapped all the way around my front and back like a steel girdle and burned, plus the contractions were still only 2-3 minutes apart so I didn't have much of a break between. The check right after the epidural placement put me at 7cm.

The epidural was GREAT. I couldn't feel the contractions in my torso anymore at all, but I could still move my legs/toes/etc and turn side to side. The  L&D nurse set me up on my side with a peanut ball so I could chill and keep dilating. I felt the pressure building in my pelvis while on the peanut and hung out there for probably another hour.

I literally made it all the way to 10cm, ready to push, and my water still hadn't broken. There were several comments about my ""bulging bag"" during checks which I found hilarious in the moment (tbh I still think it's funny).

My doctor went ahead and broke my water at 10cm so I could push and it GUSHED. I got her, the L&D nurse and a nursing student with meconium-stained water in the splash zone. There was a NICU nurse on standby during the delivery because of the meconium, but baby boy was pissed and screaming at being born so they just suctioned out his mouth and he was good to go.

Even with the epidural, pushing was a TON of pressure in my pelvis that definitely gets to a point where it's painful. Even though I couldn't feel the contractions in my torso, I felt it down below so they had me pushing with contractions. Gotta say, even with an epidural, crowning was intense and I don't think there's any way around it. He got stuck on my public bone (I think it was the pubic bone?) while pushing, but my doctor had the two nurses hold my knees up and together while I gripped the handlebars by my side and pushed like that and he got off.

I ended up with a second degree tear and several small (probably 6-8) lacerations that didn't require stitches. I'm pretty tender 3 days postpartum but doing good downstairs, all things considered.

My uterus wasn't clamping down enough after delivery, so they gave me some pitocin and something else (some kind of suppository, I don't remember), but that worked and stopped the bleeding at 500mL. By this point, they had already put baby on my chest so I was too busy looking at him to care too much, but the stitches definitely stung.

So for total timeline, I went from ""maybe?"" around  7:00am to ""this is definitely labor"" at 8am and delivered him just before 2:30pm. Because he came on a weekday during business hours, it was my own doctor there for the delivery. I'm sure it would have been fine with the on-call, but I was really happy to have her instead because I like and trust her.

My biggest worries were emergency C-section after a long labor and forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery, so overall I'm very happy with how it went.

Unfortunately, we haven't been able to take baby home yet because of some blood type incompatibility issues, but we're hoping tomorrow (Day 4) will be the day <3

Jude Gabriel, enigmatic CEO of the mysterious yet seemingly omnipresent software company ‚ÄòTalos‚Äô, squints as the sunset light squeezes through a few buildings in the Seattle skyline just to assault his face at the perfect angle. Whoever thought up the idea of all-glass offices should be lined up against the wall and shot‚Äîwith the sun in his eyes.

The whole gang is here: CFO, COO, CPO, CSO, whoever the fuck. He‚Äôd kill them all without a second thought in exchange for a glass of whiskey and a cigar.

He rubs his nose: one of his infamous ‚Äòmigraines‚Äô is coming on.



*It started on his 25th birthday. The whole thing is branded into his memory, for better or for worse, and will be until he dies, and for all his luck after he dies, too.*

*Craig had been the one who officially ‚Äòsuggested‚Äô it, but it was really inevitable, with how into psychedelics they had all been. The moment he said it, it was more like it had manifested out of the whole subconscious zeitgeist of their friend group, and no one in particular took credit for it: Ayahuasca, that is.*

*One thing after another, and Jude ended up in some primitive canoe, floating his way down the shit-colored waters of the Nanay, muggy-hot and slathered in skin-irritating, carcinogenic bug spray. Nonetheless, nothing short of nuclear fallout could erase his good mood. He practically hummed with adrenaline and good spirits despite the downright horrific summer conditions of backwater Peru.*

*At the dock, a woman with a clipboard introduced herself as Isa and asked him to put his phone in a dented metal tin.*

*The intake hut was cooler. A ceiling fan wobbled, slicing the humid air into manageable pieces. The curandero sat in a plastic chair with his hands on his knees, white beard surrounding his chin, wrinkled eyes squinting cheerfully. He looked exactly like Jude had imagined: wise and ready to take them on the trip of a lifetime. He spoke, a hoarse but gentle voice, and a younger man beside him translated.*

*‚Äú...Why here? What do you hope to see?‚Äù*

*They went around the room until it landed on Jude. To tell you the truth, he didn‚Äôt know. It wasn‚Äôt like the others‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòfind himself‚Äô, his life was fine as it was, he had had no traumatic experiences, and he was a perfectly productive worker: at the time, he was starting up a small software company, and it had just had its first angel investor. He knew he was outgrowing these people, and it was only a matter of time before they‚Äôd grow apart.*

*‚ÄúI want to see if there‚Äôs anything I missed.‚Äù He said, simply, not sure if they were the right words after they came out of his mouth. The curandero nodded after hearing the translation, a long, thoughtful motion.*

*Well, that‚Äôs exactly what he found: the thing he‚Äôd missed, or more accurately, the thing that had missed him.*

*If only he‚Äôd told Craig to go fuck himself.*



The air conditioning beats down on Jude as the CFO, Priya, prattles on about numbers, which is what she does‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we all love her.

Jude‚Äôs assistant, Ness, leans towards him.

‚ÄúThe demo team‚Äôs set up,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄòYou want them in here, or‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù says Jude,

In a few minutes, Marty, the CPO, walks over to the wall screen, which switches from spreadsheets to a map of a few high-crime blocks in Seattle, colored dots pulsing like slow heartbeats.

‚ÄúThis is what we‚Äôll show the folks in Oakland,‚Äù he says, ‚Äú It‚Äôs nice, elegant, you know? Makes it look like we‚Äôre just sorting the mess, not‚Ä¶ playing god, or whatever the press likes to say about us, you know?‚Äù

He clicks through, and a route appears through the dots.

‚ÄúTwo patrol cars for nine urgent calls,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe system takes the pile and says, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs the order that gets help to the most people fastest. The car goes here first because the caller keeps hanging up, then here because the second caller is trapped in a stairwell, then this one because it‚Äôs likely a duplicate.‚Äù

Mason drums a finger. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we showing the cool part where it noticed the stolen Civic from last week patterns back to‚Äî‚Äù

General counsel interrupts him. ‚ÄúCool‚Äôs trouble. We want ‚Äòboring and helpful‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, it can be a little bit of both,‚Äù he said

‚ÄúThen it wouldn‚Äôt be¬†*boring*, Mason,‚Äù she replies.

Jude tunes them out. This part isn‚Äôt interesting. Besides, a familiar pressure is blooming behind his right eye, a creeping static that makes it hard to focus.

He watches as the red line from the screen somehow moves, bleeding into reality, widening, taking weight, and spreading, soon becoming a red belt crossing the city. And then he sees what it really is: crossbeams, ribs, the sketch of an inhuman skeleton, barely under the thin veneer of the corporeal world.

He blinks. The thread is small again.

At some point, someone from legal walks in‚Äîa shy, mousey blonde. The way she does so, uncertain, not willing to look anyone in the eyes, tells him it‚Äôs going to be a problem before she says the words.

There‚Äôs mention of ‚ÄòCraig Hassel‚Äô. He knows right away what happened: the douchebag thinks he made the algorithm behind the route ordering that they‚Äôll be showcasing. Idiot. He doesn‚Äôt get it, never did. No one¬†*made*¬†any of this; it was beyond that, beyond ownership. What he wanted was immaterial: we don‚Äôt get¬†*just deserts.*¬†This isn‚Äôt a fucking movie.

He closes his eyes.



*His birthday happened to coincide with the first night of the retreat: everyone claims to have planned it, but it was happenstance.*

*The time before‚Äîthe whole ‚Äòwellness retreat‚Äô bullshit‚Äîpassed by in a blur. He remembers staring at Maya‚Äôs ass and listening to the curandero talk about mystic-sounding Mumbo jumbo: you were once pure, and culture sullied your soul, or some wacko nonsense. Jude didn‚Äôt care about any of that; he just wanted to see the world as it is, absent of everything additional, to gaze into the true reality as close as he possibly could.*

*Ironically, it was pretty similar to what the curandero was saying, minus the emphasis on personal growth, but he didn‚Äôt have the self-awareness to see it.*

*That night, they entered a featureless wood panel room with two bathrooms and a bunch of mattresses*

*It was strangely cold. Everyone bunched together in a circle, Maya to his right, leaning close, and Craig, who was practically vibrating with excitement, to his left. The Curandero made his last speech as he prepared the tea, and then everyone lined up to take it.*

*When Jude reached the end of the line, the translator asked how much he wanted. Jude suppressed a laugh and asked for the maximum amount. What was he, a pussy?*

*The brew tasted like burnt coffee mixed with dirt. He gulped it down as fast as he could and sat down where he‚Äôd been sitting, bracing himself for a ride.*

*It took an hour or two for it to actually work, during which he felt increasingly disappointed, watching people bumble around or chant like lunatics. Craig similarly didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, it all came at once*

*Later, he would find out that his experience did not match most descriptions of the drug‚Äôs effects, that it was a wholly alien abomination.*

*Later, Craig would tell him that it had changed him for the worse, that he couldn‚Äôt stop striving towards some incomprehensible end, that it made him impossible to work with, that he was taking the company in a direction that was completely different from what they‚Äôd intended.*

*Later, Craig would be right.*



‚ÄúThey intend to move ex parte for a TRO, citing emails from 2019 in which Mr. Hassel describes ‚Äòprobabilistic ordering‚Äî‚Äù begins the blonde from legal, probably because she didn‚Äôt know what else to say.

‚ÄúRight, right,‚Äù says Mason, flicking his wrist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit that could fuck us over in Oakland,‚Äù says GC.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford to deal with this in court,‚Äù says Priya, ‚Äúany delay could punt the demonstration months, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, captain obvious,‚Äù says Mason, ‚ÄúWhat are you gonna tell us next, water is wet? The sky is blue?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry. It‚Äôs hard to tell when you need things spelled out for you, Mason,‚Äù she shoots back.

He snorts, looking away.

‚ÄúI just got a text from him,‚Äù interrupts Ness, ‚Äúsays he wants to ‚Äòsolve this like men‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hell does that mean?‚Äù says Priya

‚ÄúIt means he wants to call,‚Äù says Mason,

‚ÄúShould we?‚Äù a voice inevitably chimes. Jude rubs his eyes. The room goes silent.

‚ÄúPut him on,‚Äù says Jude, finally.

They put him on through the speakers.

‚ÄúI see you got my letter,‚Äù says Craig, the self-righteous smugness palpable in his voice.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, Craig?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know. How about recognition for my work, for starters?‚Äù

Jude rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúYou wrote a few weights any freshman can get if you give them a few weekends and a public dataset. You‚Äôre not going to court over this‚ÄîI know it, you know it, so let‚Äôs cut the bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I just wanna fuck you over,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúshut down your little stint in Oakland.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen file,‚Äù says Jude. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you can afford that fight.‚Äù

The room gets tenser. Priya gives him that stare.

‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù starts GC.

He lifts a hand

‚ÄúLet me tell you what‚Äôs going to happen in the next hour, if you choose that route. We‚Äôre going to file a declaratory action in Delaware seeking a ruling of non-infringement and ownership. We‚Äôll append your emails in full to show how little they matter, and we‚Äôll attach three pieces of prior art from 2016 to 2018 where strangers describe the same ‚Äòprobabilistic ordering‚Äô that you claim to be yours.‚Äù

He looks at Marty. ‚ÄúPull the patents, will you?‚Äù

Marty nods.

Then,‚Äù Jude continues, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to push a limited open-source module that replicates the banal one you‚Äôre fighting over. Just the skeleton. Nothing proprietary, nothing Oakland-specific. It will be clean-room documented and intentionally boring. It‚Äôll look like we‚Äôre being magnanimous, and your TRO will look like a toddler padlock on a chain-link fence.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a pause at the other end of the line.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt just open it,‚Äù says Craig, ‚Äúthis is your baby. I know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù says Jude. ‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù

He laughs to himself.

‚ÄúJesus, Craig. You think this is it, that¬†*this*¬†is my ‚Äòbaby‚Äô? This is a step, moron. It‚Äôs a fucking brick. I‚Äôll give you your goddamn brick.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, the demo window‚Ä¶‚Äù says someone else.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll move it up,‚Äù says Jude. ‚ÄúNess, call Oakland.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should at least‚Äî‚Äù starts Priya.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù says Jude, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dealing with this loser. If he thinks delaying my multi-generational project by another few months, or even a fucking year, is going to hurt me, then let him try.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù says Craig, ‚ÄúI can see right through this shitty performance‚Äîyou‚Äôre scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanna bet?‚Äù

There‚Äôs another pause.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you look like a thief.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd that work for Eduardo?‚Äù says Jude,‚Äù Looks are cheap. Zuckerberg proved that.‚Äù

‚ÄúJude,‚Äù he begins, ‚ÄúYou cut me out, and you didn‚Äôt have to. We could‚Äôve shipped the same thing without this... cult you built around yourself.‚Äù

Jude laughs. ‚ÄúCraig, this was always your problem. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an idiot, actually, the opposite, but you don‚Äôt have vision. You can‚Äôt see past yourself and your petty fucking problems. You can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt see the future, Craig. The world that I see, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôre beyond ‚Äòownership‚Äô: a farcical idea, always has been.‚Äù

He looks back at the room. ‚ÄúCut the line. I‚Äôm done talking to this idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù says Craig.

Before he can say shit, the room dips into silence. No one says anything for a while.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs adjourn,‚Äù he says, and he‚Äôs already moving before anyone can respond. Velocity beats consensus. Ness calls after him, but he‚Äôs already in the elevator. The migraine feels like a lit coal behind his right eye.

He drives home without music, wincing at the glare from the piercing sun glancing off the windows, like a nuclear blast in the distance, stuck in the moment before the shockwave. The afternoon sky gives way to a bruised, arterial red, bleeding into the sides of the windows, the streets, everything the eye can see. The lights switch from green to red, the crosswalks blink, both playing their minute parts in a mechanical process leading to that inevitable future, streets like veins in some incomprehensible organism. He closes his eyes, but the glare still bleeds behind, omnipresent.

By the time he gets back home, it‚Äôs nearly dark.

He writes the babysitter a check. The living room smells like banana peels and markers. Jacob claims that Diego said a bad word. Naomi tries to negotiate staying up later, always the little lawyer. He puts them to bed quickly and sets up shop in the rocking chair by the window, cigar in mouth, glass of whiskey on the rocks.

The horizon stares back at him, at once the familiar city he knows and that unfamiliar landscape he saw, back in Peru, which he still sees to this day, every second a little clearer, every minute it converges closer‚Äîthe landscape of the end of time, the barren plains, the arterial sky, the mechanical structures like ribs, protruding from the landscape.

He tried everything, every drug on the market: benzos, clonidine, weed, you name it. He tried Therapy, CBT, refining his sleep schedule, fixing his diet. He traveled the world, went back to Peru, begged the Curandero, who had nothing to say, signed up for experimental neurobiology trials in Israel, China, France, wherever the fuck, risked his own life so many times it stopped mattering to him. It did fuckall, none of it worked. For better or for worse, he had seen a glimpse of the future, and it hooked itself in his brain, a psychic parasite. He sees it when he closes his eyes, when he dreams‚Äîevery waking moment he‚Äôs cursed to be an oracle, one foot in the future, one foot in the past.

The worst thing is that it never stops awing him.

That megastructure in the sky, a technological monster so bright it could be the sun, shines down at him, illuminating that landscape with all the more horrifying clarity. Waves of ecstasy and terror burrow through his skin: a feeling so strong that only the most spiritual experiences of his life had ever previously come close to.

The only reason he hasn‚Äôt killed himself is his unshaking certainty that eternity exists‚Äîhe‚Äôs staring right at it. Death will not release him from his bond. He has been rendered a servant of the future. His only hope, a rapidly fleeting proposition, is that this horror will spare his kids.

He takes another drink‚Äîit gives him no comfort, the taste of the cigar has turned bitter in his mouth. The only thing worse would be nothing at all.",1,1760982626.0,slatestarcodex,0,0.67,False

1obopve,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1obopve/13_years_of_experience/,13 years of experience,"This will be a bit of a long story. It's 13 years...trying to wrap it in a text. 

My twin and I met as colleagues 13 years ago in my country where he traveled to for work, he stayed all that year and towards the end of that year we went for a coffee just the two of us. There was something special about him but me being only 23 at the time and he 34, I tried shaking it off. He was already married at the time and had one child so I didn't view him as anything more than as a friend. We chose to keep in touch over the years online. Both through work chat and eventually through private chat. Always sharing about our lives, sending pictures etc. 

A few years down the line, I already had a bf from 2014, we planned to visit his country (it's also my home country, parents'). Met him shortly with my bf and then the next coming year when I was there with siblings I met him more for real. When we hugged and our hands touched a bit longer for some reason during that trip, it felt electric.. As if something came alive. I had always liked him as a friend and thought of him as a very special person in my life, that's why I was visiting him all across the world. I once again, shrugged off feeling that feeling. But it's as if something came alive between us after these physical interactions since we had been mostly online before. 

During the next coming year we started having much more regular contact and also monthly phone calls. The calls could go on for hours and we have always had such a magical connection between us. During that year I had my parallel life going on, my own engagement party and the year after I got married. During this year we started hinting back and forth for what we might feel for each other but the circumstances are so crazy so he didn't dare to say more than admit the feelings but also backing out and saying how my life is with my fiance, he could never be that guy for me etc. He gave me my sign that I needed at the time. I should get married and go on with my life here. Maybe he doesn't feel the same etc. And anyway, I was thinking, there's no way he can leave his family behind in another country and be with me. It was impossible. So messed up situation. 

So during those years incl pandemic we didn't talk much, we were still in touch but not as actively. When we reconnected more and more everything started coming back, and it was more intense than ever. We met up once or twice during these years for a few hours coffee in his country when I was visiting. Just a dreamy moment that was way too short. The hugs were what kept me sane. I had a child after this period and then I started keeping distance from him, because I felt as if he was requiring more time in chats from me than I could give him. The feelings for each other were so strong but I also missed him so much, so I started pushing him away.instead. A year passed. He wrote to me to get back in touch with me. 

Since then, fast forward to today. It's as if universe doesn't want to keep us apart anymore. He had a business trip to that town where we originally met back 13 years ago. I made plans to go and see him. The first trip I was too afraid of letting him in emotionally, as if I was afraid of feeling too much. The conversations were kept at a friendly level and we never talked about that year apart which I would have wanted us to. A week after that meetup I was missing him like crazy and I thought the moment had gone. 

A few weeks afterwards he was to return to that town so I went with my youngest baby to meet him. This time around, we were so honest. Just opened up completely and now there's like no turning back in how the feelings have blown up. We eventually kissed that night when my baby was asleep in the room. It all started with him giving me the longest hug, where I felt so at peace, warm and as if my chakra were being balanced by just standing so close to him. Not sure how to describe it better. His scent, everything, just made me feel like I've never felt before. Opening up. Felt so warm. It was just a hug. Towards the night when we hugged i was feeling so strongly that I have to kiss him. And we both melted into that kiss. It was the most magical kiss. 

I guess since then, it's not been very long, a few months, we've not been able to not be honest about our feelings. Especially him, he's cracked open like never before. He says things like, ""I want to make love to you before I die, I need to show you how I feel for you.""
""I don't think making love will even be enough to show you how much I love you"" 

Obviously our situation is so complex, it's insane. Two countries so far away from each other. Two kids each. Spouses. There's no real way for us to be together but this love though. It's out of this world. Never felt like this ever before. 
I'm a demisexual so I don't fall for anyone physically and this time I actually felt physically attracted as well. Unfortunately I realised I've never felt it before.. I really just needed to get my story out to you who are in this, I don't think it makes any sense to anyone else.

Since I previously owned the Pro 2, currently use the Pro 3, and recently bought the Max, I decided to write this review to help anyone who's unsure about which one is worth it for their situation.

AirPods Pro 3 - I use these at the gym or for sports. I really felt a noticeable difference in noise cancellation compared to the AirPods Pro 2 - I'd say it's about 2x more ""powerful.""

So if you're deciding between the 2 and the 3, go with the 3 without hesitation - it really has some solid improvements.

Sometimes I work at coffee shops that are pretty noisy. The AirPods Pro 2 manages to silence most of it, but high-pitched sounds like baristas making coffee, kids screaming or talking loudly - it doesn't cancel those as well. The AirPods Pro 3 reduces a good amount of that, but still not as much as I'd like.

That's why I bought the AirPods Max. I found the noise cancellation to be somewhere between the 2 and the 3 - it doesn't silence everything, but when you play music even at a low volume, it cancels out about 95% of the noise. The other 5% disappears if you turn it up just a bit more hehe... and because they have the over-ear cups, you're completely isolated.

For me, it was an excellent purchase. I use the Pros for workouts and sports, and the Max for noisy coffee shops.

Bottom line:

‚Ä¢If you go to coffee shops a lot and want total isolation = AirPods Max

‚Ä¢If you use them more for being out and about, like on the street, sports, etc. = go with the Pros

I hope this review helped! If anyone has anything to add or any questions, feel free to ask.

Keep in mind this is my personal opinion based on my usage style and needs.

Cheers!

**Inmate 347. Step forward.**

The voice echoed through the cold corridor, bouncing off stone and steel. I already knew who it was before I even looked up.

‚ÄúWell, well, well‚Ä¶ If it isn't JD. How‚Äôs our favorite murderer today?‚Äù Officer Daniels grinned with those chipped yellow teeth like he just told the funniest joke of his life.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just *great*, Daniels,‚Äù I said, rising slowly. ‚ÄúHad a five-star meal of whatever rat-slick garbage your kitchen passed off as food, and a luxurious nap on my slab of concrete. Real paradise.‚Äù

Daniels chuckled, tapping his baton against the bars. ‚ÄúGlad the red carpet treatment‚Äôs up to your high standards.‚Äù

He stepped inside. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me. We‚Äôve got‚Ä¶ *businessmen* here to see you.‚Äù

That got my attention. This place didn‚Äôt get visitors‚Äîespecially not for me.

‚ÄúTurn around. Hands behind your back. Slowly.‚Äù

I did as he asked. No point in fighting‚Äîyet. He cuffed my wrists tight enough to bleed my skin and shoved me forward. We walked through the gray guts of the penitentiary, fluorescent lights flickering overhead like they were rotting here the same as us. The whales of other inmates echoing the halls of the prison. A symphony of suffering that was imprinted into us.

Daniels pushed open the interview room door and sat me down hard into the steel chair. My wrists were clipped to the cold tabletop.

‚ÄúYou sit right here. They‚Äôll be in shortly. If you misbehave...‚Äù he leaned in close, breath foul with chewing tobacco and cheap coffee, ‚Äúyou *will* be punished. Do I make myself clear?‚Äù

I glared up at him through my bruised eye. ‚ÄúShove it up your ass, Daniels. I‚Äôve got better things to do, so let‚Äôs move this along‚Äî‚Äù

*CRACK.*

His fist hit me clean across the cheekbone. My head snapped to the side, and stars danced behind my eyes. Blood welled in my mouth, copper and heat.

‚ÄúShut your mouth, scumbag,‚Äù he growled, shaking out his hand. ‚ÄúYou sit there and be quiet‚Ä¶ or I‚Äôll give you another lesson in manners.‚Äù

He rubbed his knuckles and looked almost disappointed there wasn‚Äôt more blood. I spat red into the corner of the room and smiled through it.

‚ÄúGood talk, Daniels.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond. Just turned and left, the door slamming shut behind him with a heavy echo that sounded like a tomb sealing.

Now I was alone in that concrete coffin of a room, the cuffs biting into my wrists, the sting of the punch still fresh.

And waiting.

Waiting for whoever the hell would want to talk to a dreg of a man like me.

I ponder who could really be here for me after all this time. I had no family, no lover, just myself and my thoughts. I sat there in silence. The cold metal cuffs digging into my wrists. I scan the room looking for a sign of what's going on. I hear a loud buzz and a mechanical click as the door opens to a man in a checkered suit and a briefcase. He sits down at the other end of the table in front me and opens his case. Taking some files out and laying them on the table.

He scans the paperwork before saying ...¬†

‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Davis. How are you holding up?‚Äù His voice was smooth, almost rehearsed, as his eyes casually swept across the dim interrogation room. The slight smirk tugging at his lips told me he already knew the answer.

I leaned forward, shifting the cuffs clamped around my wrists. Glaring at the man with a defensive rage, welling up from inside. I had seen plenty of suits over the years, lawyers, and public officials but he was different. An abnormality in these halls, someone who reeked of something dark and sinister. ‚ÄúWell, besides the bruises and concrete slab, and shit food, I‚Äôm doing just fine. Who the hell are you, and what do you want with me?‚Äù

He chuckled softly, like he‚Äôd heard this a hundred times. ‚ÄúFor convenience‚Äôs sake, you can call me Mr. McCreedy. I‚Äôm here with a proposition.‚Äù

That got my attention. I raised an eyebrow, wary but intrigued. ‚ÄúYeah? And what kind of *proposition* are we talking about?‚Äù

He placed a sleek black folder on the table, tapping a manicured finger against it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reviewed your file. Impressive rap sheet. Armed robbery, suspected manslaughter, and a laundry list of other crimes from your youth. You're not exactly model citizen material, Mr. Davis.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. He didn‚Äôt need me to. My eyes never wavering from his as he prattled on about my mis deeds. I've heard it all before and this was no different, like a tape recording on loop.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never getting out of this place,‚Äù he continued, his tone turning sharper, colder. ‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs the part where things get interesting. I‚Äôm offering you a choice.‚Äù

He paused, just long enough to let the silence stretch tight.

‚ÄúOption one: rot in this shithole for the rest of your natural life. Or‚Ä¶‚Äù He leaned in, eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúCome work for me. Do a job. Dangerous, yes. But if you live, we can have you released from this... lovely establishment.‚Äù¬†

His eyes wandering the small room, a soft chuckle escaped his lips. He was certain whatever he offered was better than life inside here.

I stared at him, searching his face for a crack, a sign of bullshit. But all I saw was ambition and something darker behind his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat kind of job?‚Äù I finally asked.

He smiled wider. ‚ÄúThe kind you‚Äôre perfectly suited for.‚Äù

McCreedy let out a long, theatrical sigh, like I‚Äôd just asked him to explain gravity.

‚ÄúMy boy,‚Äù A southern twang to his words, he began, pacing a slow circle around the room, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be coming to work for my mining company.‚Äù

He paused, gauging my reaction, but I gave him nothing.

‚ÄúThe other workers,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúare‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs call them *peers* of yours. Inmates. From this fine establishment and a dozen other overcrowded facilities across the state. Overpopulation breeds creativity, you see. So the state and I made a little arrangement.‚Äù He smiled, a venomous grin now plastered his face once more.

‚ÄúIn exchange for labor,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou get a shot at lets call it freedom... Simple, really.‚Äù

I stayed silent, waiting for the catch I could already feel pressing against my spine.

‚ÄúBut this isn‚Äôt just any mine, Mr. Davis.‚Äù His voice dropped, gaining a weight it hadn‚Äôt had before. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *special* place. We extract a material unlike anything else on Earth. It‚Äôs called *Necronium*‚Äîa blood-red crystal with... fascinating properties.‚Äù

He reached into his coat and placed a photo on the table: a jagged shard, dark crimson and pulsing faintly like a heartbeat trapped in stone.

I took the photo in my hands, chains digging into me as I lifted it to get a good look at it. It was... something I'd never seen before, it was a beautiful crystal to say the least. Elegant but full of something unknown, otherworldly.

‚ÄúIt generates immense power. Something that could power cities and armies alike for generations to come. But more interestingly‚Ä¶ It alters biology. DNA. Cells. Behavior. We‚Äôre still studying the full extent of what it can do. What it‚Äôs done.‚Äù He gave a dry chuckle that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say: it‚Äôs the future. Nothing you need to worry about yourself my boy. Just know you'd be doing your country proud with your... voluntary service.‚Äù His sickly grin almost mocking me.

My jaw tightened, instinct warning me to run‚Äîthough I was cuffed, caged, and nowhere near the wild mountains he was describing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be briefed on the details if you accept. But understand this: *any* breach of secrecy, *any* attempt to escape, or even talk about this outside my chain of command‚Ä¶ and your punishment will be *severe*.‚Äù

I gave a small nod, buying time, thinking. This was insane. But the more he talked, the more I realized‚Äîthere was no way out of this cell, or my sentence, unless I played the game.

McCreedy leaned in closer. ‚ÄúYou should also know‚Ä¶ My father, bless his soul, invested a fortune in this mine before his *untimely* passing. A legacy, you could say.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mine needs constant labor,‚Äù he went on, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs hidden deep in the Appalachians, far from any eyes that might ask the wrong questions.‚Äù

He paused again, letting the silence grow heavy.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll live in a town beneath the surface‚Äîan underground community built around the mine. That will be your home. Your prison, if you want to be poetic.‚Äù

I looked him dead in the eye, and for a moment, his smile faded.

‚ÄúAnd make no mistake,‚Äù he said, voice now flat and cold, ‚Äúthe state is in on it. They get their piece, I get mine. And you‚Ä¶ you get your freedom.‚Äù

He stepped back and smoothed the front of his immaculate checkered suit.

‚ÄúBut should you agree to this‚Ä¶ *I own you.* Body and soul will belong to the McCreedy name... is that understood?.‚Äù

I nodded again weighing the options in my head, the allure of release making my decision a biased one.¬†

Life in Prison or life as an indentured worker I thought to myself. I look into Mr. McCreedy‚Äôs eyes, does this... town at least have a bar? His wicked smile grew at the question, he leaned back in his seat and chuckled. Well of course Mr. Davis, you will¬† have some freedoms here, Including a bar as you asked. You will have your basic needs met I can assure you. ‚ÄúYou convicts are so simple minded, have your needs of, women and booze met there isn't anything you wouldn't do am I right?‚Äù He glanced at me with a cocky gaze. A light chuckle escaped his lips at his supposed superiority.¬†

A flare of rage at the insults threatened to burst forth but I contained myself. Throwing away a choice was an idiotic path to choose so I stayed silent. Bitter resentment towards a man who didn't know me, my life, my suffering. Mocking me as if I was shit off his shoe.¬†

I let out a deep sigh before looking at him again. Fine I accept the offer, now when can I get out of here... He cuts me off. Hold your horses my boy, you'll have to fill out some paperwork, NDA‚Äôs, various agreements Etc.¬†

Another deep sigh escapes me, ‚Äúfine get me a pen and get these fucking cuffs off me.‚Äù

With a nod Mr. McCreedy stood walking over to me before sliding me a pen and a stack of documents. He then signals a guard to relieve me of my shackles. I look at him again, His venomous smile boring into me. The light of the room burying me in his shadow, Welcome to the family Mr. Davis. Before he turns locks up his briefcase and exits the room. The heavy metal door clicking into place behind him.¬†

Officer Daniels swaggered in like he owned the place a moment later, that same greasy grin plastered across his face. He walked over, keys jangling like wind chimes, and undid my cuffs with theatrical flair.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù he said, smirking. ‚ÄúLooks like you've cut yourself a deal, good for you.‚Äù His tone is almost mocking and yet sad in a way. As if he would miss having another prisoner to torment.

‚ÄúFuck you Daniel's, you slimy pig motherfucker. At least I can finally be free of one shitty thing in my life.‚Äù My tone, harsh, cold, and bitter.

A mocking laugh escaped his lips as he stepped back, hands on his hips like he was proud of me. ‚ÄúGonna miss having you around, 347.‚Äù He wiped fake tears from his eyes before chuckling again and turning toward the door.

‚ÄúOh, and your release?‚Äù he added over his shoulder. ‚ÄúTwo months‚Äô time.‚Äù He laughed again loudly seeing my face drop, the realization I'd still have a few more months of misery.

And just like that, he was gone, leaving me alone with the weight of my decision. The door locked behind him as his shoes clicked down the echoing hallway. Leaving me in silence with the steady buzz of the electric lights overhead.

I stared at the papers for a long while. Everything felt strangely still‚Äîlike the world was holding its breath. My fingers twitched. Then slowly, deliberately, I reached for the pen. With one fluid motion, I signed my name. The second time in my life I‚Äôd sold myself off‚Äîonce to the system, now to something darker.

The guards came back, silent and indifferent, collecting the documents and leading me back to my cell. A stone box with a toilet and a slab of concrete and a shitty mattress. But for the first time in years, I knew I had an end date.

Time in prison moves in broken rhythms. Days stretch like pulled muscle, minutes shrink to nothing, then explode into weeks. You don‚Äôt live in prison. You *wait.* You wait for food, for sleep, for beatings, for boredom to finally kill you. A countdown. Sixty days, then something new. Maybe worse, maybe not. But different.

When the day came, I was ready. Or as ready as a man can be walking into the unknown.

The guards came early, gruff and mechanical. I didn‚Äôt say goodbye. There was no one to say it to. They led me out, past dead-eyed inmates and cold steel, until the walls opened up and we stepped into the raw gray morning air of the helipad.¬†

I breathed deeply, shutting my eyes and feeling the breeze, listening to the sounds around me. The outside world felt new to me, now that my situation would finally be changing.

A dozen other inmates were already there. Some I recognized and some were strangers to me. Mobsters, lifers like me, Killers, rapists, everything under the sun. All of us scum in our own respects but all now signed onto a single purpose. Desperate for change, for freedom. We all signed the same paper, shook the same hands. We worked for the company now and our new handler, Mr.McCreedy.¬†

For a moment, I let myself believe I was different. But my time in prison with my thoughts had warped that perspective years ago. I thought back on my first days once more, how it felt like a lifetime ago. Back when I thought I was different. I chuckled softly to myself, what a fool I was.

My eyes rose at an approaching thrum, a distant beat of something... no, a helicopter approaching.

It was military-grade‚Äîsleek, green, and powerful. When it landed, the wind hit us like a slap. Armed guards poured out, barking orders, grabbing us by the arms and shoving us into a crude formation.

We were herded aboard like cattle, each chained to the cold metal seats lining the interior. Boots stomped. Names were called. One by one, confirmed. Then the green light.

The engine roared to life, and we lifted from the helipad.

I craned my neck and got one last look at the prison‚Äîjust a concrete box in the middle of nowhere. I smiled. The structure of suffering shrinking into the distance. Whatever waited for me in the Mines, at least I wouldn‚Äôt be behind those walls anymore. The rear hatch closed shut as we drifted off to our destination.

I leaned back against the humming bulkhead and shut my eyes.

This was going to be a long ride into my new life.

Many hours later, I awoke to turbulence rattling through the cabin. The metallic groan of the transport craft shuddered around me as a voice crackled over the intercom:

‚ÄúApproaching LZ in five minutes. All personnel, prepare to disembark.‚Äù

I forced my eyes open. Outside the frosted window, jagged white mountains rose like teeth, their peaks lost in storm clouds. Smoke curled in the distance, black stains against the snow. As we descended lower, I caught sight of a landing pad, squat buildings clustered around what looked like a small outpost.

The rear hatch opened with a hiss. Cold air knifed into my lungs, sharp enough to sting. A dozen guards stood waiting in formation, weapons slung and eyes hidden behind red lenses of their gas masks.

And then I saw him.  The checkered suit. The smug grin. Mr.McCreedy.

He strode aboard as though he owned the air itself, clapping his hands together with mock warmth. ‚ÄúWelcome, gentlemen! Welcome to my facility. This is your new home now.‚Äù His grin sharpened as he scanned the line of shackled prisoners‚Äîuntil his eyes landed on me.

‚ÄúCommander,‚Äù he barked, ‚Äúget them onto the trucks and take them into town. And keep a *very* close eye on this one.‚Äù He jabbed a finger in my direction. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs our newest member. I want to make sure he receives a *proper welcome.*‚Äù

The commander grunted behind his red eyes, giving me a glare that made my stomach twist. He raised a gauntleted fist, signaling the guards. Shackles came loose. Rifles pressed into our backs.

McCreedy leaned close as I was pushed past him, his grin never wavering. ‚ÄúThe winter storms can be brutal here. Stay warm, won‚Äôt you? The trip to town shouldn't take long.‚Äù He chuckled, boarding the chopper again. The hatch slammed shut, the rotors screaming as the craft lifted away, leaving us behind.

A hard blow struck the side of my head. ‚ÄúMove,‚Äù a guard growled.

I stumbled into line, boots crunching through the snow toward the waiting trucks. Prisoners huddled in the rear, silent, shivering. I climbed in after them, and the cabin doors clanged shut. The loose canvas covering the truck, blowing in the wind as the icy frost drilled into us.

The engine roared, the truck grinding its way down the icy pass. And as the convoy rumbled toward the black mouth of the mountain, one thought gnawed through my skull. ‚ÄúAt least it will be warmer inside.‚Äù I said to myself between chattering teeth.

The road narrowed as we drew closer, until the looming shadow of the mine‚Äôs entrance swallowed the convoy whole. The colossal blast doors dominated the cliffside, towering three or four stories high, making the surrounding buildings look like children‚Äôs toys scattered in the snow.

The convict beside me leaned closer. ‚ÄúHey‚ÄîWhat's your name?‚Äù

I turned and fixed him with a glare. In prison, a glare was better than words. It established boundaries. Keep people cautious. He only smiled in return.

I turned my gaze back to the floor of the truck, I spoke low and in a defensive tone. ‚ÄúJohn Davis, but just call me JD.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarry Gallagher,‚Äù he said. I took another glance at the man, I noticed a faded four-leaf clover tattoo on his arm. ‚ÄúQuite a setup they‚Äôve got here. That McCreedy fellow wasn‚Äôt lying about the size of this place.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply. My eyes drifted towards the blast doors as the truck slowed to a crawl. The storm raged around us, snow whipping across the metal surface like a swarm of white insects.

Then‚Äî A siren blared, sharp enough to echo through the mountains in the whiteout. Three heavy, metallic *clangs* followed, each echoing through the mountain like the knell of a church bell. The locks releasing, the grinding of gears rolled out next, deep and ancient, like a buried colossus stirring awake.

The doors cracked apart. A rush of hot air hissed out, carrying with it the acrid smell of diesel and ash. The guards said nothing. We waited. For nearly a minute the air was filled only with the howl of the blizzard and the endless grind of machinery.

Finally the driver began moving once more. The truck rumbled forward.

We crossed the threshold into darkness. The warmth hit us instantly as I rubbed my hands together to warm up. The massive door began to close, sealing off the outside world above. A loud clang of the door closing and locking echoed down the shaft.

At first it was absolute‚Äîthick black, suffocating. But then the overhead lamps began to click on one after another, like starlight in the void above us. My eyes burned as they adjusted, and I finally saw the cavern yawning out around us. The tunnel was as vast as the doors themselves, the walls jagged and damp, the steel reinforcement ribs disappearing into the black.¬†

We drove deeper. The doors behind us shrank until they were nothing but a memory. Sunlight slipped out of sight. The pathway down lights clicking on and off as we were guided downwards.

After what felt like hours, the faint murmur of distant voices and the glow of town grew ahead. The truck rumbled onto a stretch of flat road, revealing a barred gate sealing the entry to town.

A rusted sign swung above the gate, swinging in the heated breeze that flowed through the caverns.

### Health and Wellness Devotional: Digital Reflections ‚Äì Finding Faith in a Social Media World

**Scripture for Reflection: Philippians 4:8 (NIV)**  
*‚ÄúFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable‚Äîif anything is excellent or praiseworthy‚Äîthink about such things.‚Äù*

- - - - - -

#### Introduction

In a world where social media dominates our daily lives, the way we engage with technology can significantly impact our mental, emotional, and spiritual health. As we navigate this digital landscape, it‚Äôs crucial to pause and reflect on how these platforms influence our thoughts, feelings, and faith.

**Consider This:**

Every scroll through our feeds is an invitation to compare, despair, and distract. Yet, within that same digital space lies the potential for inspiration, connection, and growth. Our challenge is to discern what we allow to take root in our hearts and minds, striving to focus on the noble and true.

- - - - - -

#### Digital Detox: A Gift of Space

Take a moment to evaluate your current social media habits. Are they nurturing your spirit or draining your energy? Consider implementing a weekly ‚Äúdigital detox.‚Äù This could mean setting aside specific times to unplug and engage with the world around you‚Äîtaking a walk, reading, or enjoying a hobby.

**Encouragement:**

During your detox, seek God‚Äôs presence in nature or in quiet moments of stillness. Use this time to rekindle your faith through prayer or scripture reading. You might be surprised at the clarity that comes when your mind isn‚Äôt cluttered with notifications.

- - - - - -

#### Mindful Consumption: Choose to Thrive

As you engage with social media, be intentional about your consumption. Curate your feed thoughtfully; follow accounts that inspire you, uplift your spirit, and cultivate your faith.

**Practice:**

Every morning, dedicate a few moments to meditate on the good things you‚Äôve encountered online. Perhaps it‚Äôs a motivational post, a verse that resonated with you, or a story of kindness. Write them down in a journal as reminders of the beauty that inspires you.

- - - - - -

#### Authentic Connections: Building Community

Social media has the power to connect us, but it‚Äôs essential to ensure those connections are genuine. Invest time in nurturing relationships that encourage your spiritual growth.

**Challenge:**

Reach out to someone who encourages you‚Äîsend them a message of gratitude, share a prayer, or invite them for coffee. These authentic connections can create a ripple effect, fostering a community rooted in faith and love.

- - - - - -

#### The Power of Positivity: Reflect and Respond

Every time you engage with social media, ask yourself this: How can I reflect God‚Äôs love today? Use your platform to spread positivity, share uplifting messages or affirmations, and offer a word of prayer for those in your network.

**Encouragement:**

Remember that your words and actions, small as they may seem, can create waves of positivity. You have the ability to be a beacon of light in the often-shadowy realm of digital life.

- - - - - -

#### Conclusion: Anchored in Faith

As we navigate the complexities of a social media world, let‚Äôs remember to reflect on what truly matters. By focusing on the good, nurturing our connections, and taking intentional breaks, we can foster a healthier mindset and deepen our faith.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, guide us in our digital journeys. Help us discern what uplifts our spirits and clarifies our minds. May we reflect Your light in every interaction, becoming a source of love and encouragement in this fast-paced world. Amen.

- - - - - -

As you carry forward this week, remember that in a noisy world, your faith can be your anchor. Choose to reflect on what is pure and true, and let your light shine brightly‚Äîboth online and offline!

I‚Äôm a 24M looking for a literate partner to do a romance/drama/slice of life roleplay. I‚Äôve been roleplaying for about 10 years so I‚Äôm fairly decent when it comes to character development, world building and character relationships. 

Looking for a partner with a good writing ability, and someone who‚Äôs also able to progress the plot. I don‚Äôt want to be the only one doing the work. We can little chats in between scenes to really help build out the world we are creating!

Dynamics I like:
1. Coworkers that end up going out. (For this I am thinking 2 teachers end up going out in a school romance) 

2. Roommates/Neighbors. (It be cute to see the dynamics of a romance between a new roommate moving in or neighbor) 

3. Arranged marriage (Maybe something like a dynamic between 2 people who didn‚Äôt want to get married but are forced too but end up actually liking each other)

4. CEO and secretary. (The ceo of a major corporation has given you a chance to work for his company that specializes in fashion. You take the chance and end up falling for each other.)

5. Pacifist x Violence (you are an artist who works at a coffee shop, you meet a man who you like going out with. After a while you discover he is a boxer, you hate violence but you both care for each other. How will this play out when he asks you to come to one of his fights?)


Open to other plots. I don‚Äôt do things like underworld mafia boss x nice girl kind of things mostly cause I don‚Äôt really care for those plots. But you can bring me other ideas if you‚Äôd like. 

Ideas I‚Äôm open too also include a fantasy and adventure aspect. I have an idea for that kind of plot aswell. ",1,1760981968.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

### Training

After a rough 2024 with limited running due to bursitis in my left foot, I played it safe and planned a 20 week build for this (my first) marathon.  I'm no stranger to half marathon races -- I've raced 27 of them, but I knew this would be beyond any training I'd ever done before. AND IT WAS. I loosely followed a detailed plan I made via chatgpt but also harnessed the information in the book Advanced Marathoning, help from friends with marathon experience, etc. to assist me along the way. I tried to prioritize the long run above everything else and hoped that my experience with half marathons, alongside some quicker workouts throughout could help me finish AT LEAST sub 4 in Toronto.

Usually I'm a three times a week runner, and to prepare for half marathons, running only 40 km/week.  I'm F35 and pretty fit, with regular cross training on a weekly basis.  That was my baseline when I started the 20 week build for the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in approximately June??  In May, I ran a half marathon personal best of 1:37 and a 10k in 41:52 --both in Toronto, which gave me some confidence to try for a decent time when I started the build. Both of those races I did on limited running due to my recovering foot and dealing with lingering pain after longer runs.  I also ran Around The Bay 30k in March and had a great race even in poor weather conditions.  Initially I set my goal time for the marathon at 3:45 but that goal kept creeping lower as the summer progressed and my Garmin / runalyze predictions dropped.

Over the 20 weeks, I slowly increased my mileage, running further every week than I'd ever run in my life, creeping ever closer to 100km/week which I thought would be a cool milestone to reach -- if only for this one marathon build.  During peak week, I got up to 102km and was completely burnt out from all the running I was doing.  It felt like all I was doing was running and neglecting cross training, my family, etc. which was certainly challenging, but I could see the end in sight. 

My weeks usually consisted of a weekend long run, some easy/chatty group runs with my local running shop that were between 5-7km and a speed workout.  There were also  days where I ran in the morning and in the evening with the group runs because I needed additional mileage and had to fit it in. Fortunately I didn't suffer any injuries or setbacks throughout the 20 weeks, and only took a small break from running for a week of summer vacation. I was very fortunate with my health during this period. 

My plan had me running 5 or 6 days a week and trying to get in at least one strength workout in the gym alongside a pilates, spin or cross training class of some sort.  Often those cross training workouts were just helpful to break up all the running and change it up. A mental break of sorts. This felt doable for a long time until early September when I just wanted training to be over. 

Over the course of the 20 weeks, I did 4 LONG runs of 30k+. 2 @ 30k, one 34k and a run of 33k three weeks before the marathon. These certainly helped me maintain my speed throughout the 42.2k yesterday. It also helped that all my training was during the summer here in Ontario, Canada so yesterday's unseasonably warm October weather wasn't a total race killer. I also completed a half marathon while on vacation in San Francisco at the end of July. It was a hilly course and I ran 1:39 while taking all sorts of photos and videos while we traversed the city, Golden Gate Bridge, etc.  That also gave me confidence because I didn't taper, carb load or adjust my vacation plans before or after that race and still felt great! 2 weeks prior to the race, I also raced a 5k (to the dismay of some running friends who suggested against it) and finished JUST over 20 mins without too much effort. 5ks aren't really my thing, but it still felt good to run fast and finish with a time I was proud of just before the important race (marathon day). 

 

### Pre-race

3 week taper leading into the marathon following peak week. 70k/50k/27k+marathon. I started carb loading on the Thursday before Sunday's race with some swaps for protein dishes in favour of bagels, white rice, candy.  Truth be told, I already enjoy lots of carbs, so it wasn't a hard sell for me. 

Drove into Toronto on Saturday and hit up the expo for all the freebies and my bib. Probably walked too many steps (17k) but was off my feet by 7pm after a delicious chicken souvlaki meal for dinner. Sipped on some electrolytes in the evening and took some melatonin to help me get to sleep as early as possible at the hotel.  Unfortunately my room was next door to a hockey party room, so it wasn't a great sleep but I made do after a phone call to security at midnight to settle the guys next door. 

I set my alarm for 5:15am and trecked to Tim Hortons near the hotel for 2 bagels and a coffee. Felt good to take a little walk but it was already warm out which was disappointing when you're expecting a cool October morning for race day.  I sipped on more electrolytes and ALMOST finished both bagels but not quite. Two bagels is double what I normally eat before a half marathon and I already have a nervous stomach before races, so I felt confident that two bagels would probably be fine for MY BODY to start the marathon.  During training, I also frequently went out for long runs on an empty stomach or almost empty, and relied on gels/nutrition to get me by so I figured my body was served well by two bagels on race morning.

I braided my hair, put on some facial glitter for good race vibes and got the kit on to get out the door by 7:35am. I was fortunate to get a free bib from TCS - one of the main sponsors of the race, via a contest for teachers so we took a quick group photo and I was on my way. They had a grab and go breakfast for runners, shuttle to start line, etc. but I had my own plan so I stuck with that and just enjoyed the free food POST-RACE.

From my hotel, I jogged to the (new for this year due to construction) start line and no lie, GOT SHIT ON BY A BIRD before heading into the corral. I guess it was good luck.  Cleaned myself off with water, sung O' Canada in the corral, found my 3:25 pace bunny and was off a few minutes after they released the elites!

### Race

Latched myself onto the 3:25 pacer and just enjoyed the ride. I'm incredibly lucky and had close friends, family, and strava peeps who were spectating the race and told me where they'd be on course.  I told my inner circle that I really needed them in the second half of the race and they SHOWED UP. They bussed, ran, subway-ed, etc. to find me (& other friends) along the route. 

The first half of this race has such good energy through the city and onto Lakeshore Blvd and I knew what to expect as a runner who's done the half many times. This year was no different -- arguably better because the warm weather made it perfect weather for spectators to stay out all day.  21k flew by and before I knew it, we were separating ourselves from the half marathoners on Bay Street and making our way to The Beaches in Toronto. 

The course loops around a ton between 22k and 30k before you hit Woodbine Park. For some of it, we were on cobblestones which I didn't enjoy and seemed to fall a bit behind the 3:25 pacer before we connected with the smooth road again where I was able to catch up. There's some narrow roadways from 24k-27k?? where it's multiuse trail and runners moving in both directions. As a first timer, I don't know if this is the usual course or just this year but I wasn't a huge fan. Some runners slowing down at this point and narrow roads made it challenging to move past them as a small pace group. 

The road opens up again after 27/28k and it was smooth sailing from then on. Good crowd support again out in The Beaches which was a big boost of energy that I needed at that time. I also saw my parents at 31k and knew I'd see them again on the way back for gatorade, water and/or gel that I'd given them the night before.

At 35k, I saw my parents on route for the second time, grabbed a Gatorade from them and separated myself from the pacer. I felt strong and I knew I'd want more than a 5 min buffer if I wanted to give myself every opportunity to BQ for 2027. People were struggling with the heat at this point in the race but I kept pushing the pace, reminding myself how many times I've run 7k, 6k, 5k, etc. I had my music playing and was trying to smile and take it all in. I was going to finish my first marathon and likely hit my goal. It felt good. 

Saw a friend at 39k whose energy is unmatched and he gassed me up while running alongside me for probably 500m. Big mood boost and put a big smile on my face for that final stretch. Saw another pair of local friends who'd come out to cheer for everyone from our local running group at 41k ish and one of them ran alongside me as well, saying how proud they were, that I was crushing it -- all the things to help me keep on the gas for the final little hill up Bay Street toward Toronto City Hall to the finish. 

I looked at my watch when I turned onto Bay St., (maybe like 300/400m left) did some quick math & figured I could run sub 3:23 if I just gave a little bit more for the final stretch. 

For the first half of the race, I felt amazing and had no stomach issues at all. I took 2 cups of water and nuun at every aid station and took a gel every 40 mins as well.  I also carried salt tabs with me that I used until about 32k when they started to make me so nauseous I stopped taking them. The salt tabs I ate between aid stations. Initially I wasn't going to carry them, and just rely on gels, but it was so warm I thought it was better to have them than not. 

In total, I brought 7 gels with me but I think I only finished 5 of them. I also picked up two GU gels that the race provided (they give out a total of 3 during the marathon). I finished one of the GUs and put the other one in my shorts, but didn't take it. For me, this was enough nutrition  to get through while also not upsetting my stomach too much. I felt hydrated enough and with lots of energy through to the finish line. Never hit a wall, cramped, felt delirious, etc. 


### Post-race

Complete shock. I thought I'd be in tears immediately but I think I was in disbelief that I'd finished so well and was finally done.  Looped around through the finisher's shute and met up with a close running friend of mine who's currently pregnant, but wanted to enjoy the race day vibes as a spectator.  I saw her and immediately sobbed in her arms. 

I grabbed the free food available (didn't eat any of it) and then waited for some buddies to finish to take some pictures. My body felt a little stiff but overall really good, and I was on a big high. My legs are a little chafed, but otherwise I came out of the race unscathed. I wore Puma Nitro Elite 3s that served my feet well, a bandit crop tank with tons of pockets for gels, my phone, health card (just in case), room key, and salt tabs, as well as a pair of lululemon wundertrain shorts with additional pockets. 


Last night and this morning, my left side is feeling sore but otherwise I'm okay. Happy to enjoy lots of good food and rest today while I gear up to cheer on the Toronto Bluejays for Game 7 tonight! I plan to rest until the end of the week and MAYBE try a very easy run on the weekend but I'm going to see how I feel.  

I have a half marathon race November 2, so the goal is just to feel recovered enough to jog that if I have to.  If I feel good, maybe faster.

A dream come true race on the streets of Toronto yesterday! Praying to all the running gods that the 2027 BQ buffer is less than 7:37 (I think I'm safe).

I'm an Int'l student from a socially conservative country. All my life, I have abstained from drinking alcohol, smoking, doing drugs, or having casual sex. I dress modestly and don't go to clubs for ""dancing."" I do enjoy doing my culture's traditional dances though, and did pick up salsa dancing. I'm pretty religious and take my faith very seriously. I grew up in an area where the overwhelming majority of my neighbors were also religious, including in university. I also privately hold traditional views on gender roles and sexual orientation - I have no prejudice for anyone but that's what my faith taught me. 

Now at my T15 MBA, I feel completely overwhelmed. It seems most of my classmates are very outgoing, extroverted, and love drinking alcohol. They love doing house parties, bar crawls, and clubbing. Many smoke vapes, cigarettes, or do hard drugs like molly, ketamine, or cocaine. Many hookups are happening on campus. The dancing style is ""grinding"" during the house parties. Many people, both men and women, wear revealing clothing. 

Meanwhile, I'm much more passionate about volunteering and charity, traditional dancing, and playing sports like soccer. I also love history and architecture. I'm a little more soft spoken but can put on a confident front in business settings. I have strong work experience and am pivoting into a traditional post-MBA field. 

I'm not negatively judging other people for having different beliefs and lifestyles to me. I also believe that since America is supposed to be a secular country with a separation of church and state, my personal religious views shouldn't dictate policy. I don't support banning gay marriage on a legal level, but I would strongly oppose any efforts to force my religious institution to perform a gay marriage (just a hypothetical, in reality I don't think many gay people are trying to do that). 

That said, I would prefer to mingle with people from different values. Right now, everyone just brushes off my lifestyle and tells me to let loose a bit, but they don't understand drinking goes against my religion. I do want to socially integrate with my classmates, but outside of a few 1:1 coffee chats and clubs, most people enjoy going to happy hours. I feel very uncomfortable in bar settings even if I'm sober. I get very uncomfortable around people when they're drunk, especially if they get touchy. 

What would you say I do? I have formed a soccer league with some folks, but they all love to grab beers after or watch soccer matches at sports bars. Too much alcohol!

That used to mean waking up at 6:30, but lately, it‚Äôs been closer to 8. He‚Äôs naturally a morning person and can‚Äôt fall back asleep once he‚Äôs up ‚Äî while I‚Äôm the opposite. I can easily doze for another hour or two if given the chance. At night, though, I take every wake-up because our son only wants me.

Last night was one of those awful nights with multiple wake-ups and poor sleep. My husband got up with our son around 7:30. But by 8:30, he let our son into our room to ‚Äúshow me some trucks‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then just left. I could hear him making coffee and then heading outside for a yard project. So there I was, reluctantly waking up, and sitting on the toilet reading a railroad book to my toddler instead of on my own time, in peace.

When I found him outside and asked why he dropped him off after barely an hour, he got defensive ‚Äî said our son wanted to see me. Sometimes he flips it and says I don‚Äôt want to take care of our son, which isn‚Äôt true. I just never get a break. I work an intense 9‚Äì5 that‚Äôs closer to 60 hours a week, because after bedtime I‚Äôm back on my computer catching up on everything I couldn‚Äôt finish during the day because of meetings.

He‚Äôs done this before. I even took today off so we could focus on early potty training, but all I wanted was a bit of sleep. I‚Äôm also pregnant with our second.

He seems to think that because I‚Äôm awake and engaging with our toddler, I‚Äôm ‚Äúfine‚Äù ‚Äî but really, I‚Äôm just trying not to hurt my son‚Äôs feelings. I‚Äôd rather be in bed. Even if I‚Äôm just scrolling on my phone, that‚Äôs my downtime. Sometimes I look at exercise videos or plan my day.

How will deteriorating US/Colombia relations shake markets?,"The US quickly abandoned plans of a trade war with Colombia over fears of coffee price spikes. 

Colombia is the 3rd largest coffee producer in the world, 2nd largest Arabica producer, and largest light wash Arabica producer. 

India is a growing market for Colombian coffee.
If Colombia Halts coffee exports to the US, and shifts towards China, India, and the EU, the effect on US prices would be devastating, and potentially destabilizing politically. People love their coffee.

President Petro has expressed a desire to end the abysmal failure of Cocaine Prohibition, and several European countries have begun serious discussions on the subject. 
Switzerland has begun taking steps to legalize the sale and adult use of cocaine. In Portugal, the government dispenses drugs to addicts with no increase in drug related crime or violence. In fact they have seen substantial decreases as a direct result of these policies, which also includes free healthcare and considerable social welfare spending despite economic stagnation due to lack of development.

It is possible that the rampant jingoism and instability displayed by the US will shake global politics enough that the international community will abandon the US led system of prohibition and create an entirely new market-Legalized Coca and Cocaine.

1obo7xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/paint/comments/1obo7xt/my_experience_with_tikkurila_optiva/,My Experience with Tikkurila Optiva,"I recently did our kitchen (cabinets) with Tikkurila Optiva 5. 

I couldnt find many opinions/reviews of Tikkurila when looking for the paint. Only one blog post that gave it a pretty good review. So I thought I'd post my own for no other reason than if it helps anyone else looking.

Caveats: I am not a pro decorator, and I used an LVLP gun. Someone used to dealing with different paint properties might (probably would) have a better experience. This post is for others in my situation.

*TLDR; the paint is frustrating, because it looks great, but also horrible to work with due to its consistency, and is not as hard wearing as Tikkurila claim.*

I completed 8 cabinets and trim so far. The exact product is Tikkurlia Optiva 5 (C193 9051 02). It went onto new MDF cabinets over Zinsser Bin Aqua.

**Finish**

The paint looks really, really nice. The colour is rich and the finish has a lovely softness to it. It was the nicest looking out of all I tried (4 brands).

**Purchase/Website**

It's cost competetively. Much cheaper than say BM, but not the cheapest.

Tikkurilas website to me is confusing and clunky. Tikkurlia sell Optiva and Helmi, which seem alsmost identical. One part of the site says ""this is suitable for furniture"" ""this for walls"", etc, then another part of the site says the opposite. After starting the project I also found a case study section where they introduce a third product, Impact. All these paints claim to be tough emulsions with high scrub resistance. I ended up buying samples of Optiva and Helmi and just going by the finish (which was very very close). I am still not sure of the difference between them...

Tikkurila also sell thinners, which was not apparent when buying the paint - they don't connect these products on their site (I ended up buying a 3rd party conditioner before I realised Tikkurila even sell their own weeks later!)

**Application**

I used brushes with the samples and an LVLP gun for the cabinets. An LVLP gun is not the best for this, but for various reasons I wanted to maximise transfer efficiency and minimise overspray above all else.

The paint is very, very thick. When decanting into a container to mix conditioner, I used a flat spatula to literally scoop it out, no joke! When brushing, it leaves marks and it doesn't seem to self-level.

The data sheet says that its for Rolling, Brushing or Spraying. I now think by Spray it means Airless only, though this isn't stated explicitly. The paint is too thick to spray without thinning. I originally used water but had to use so much it ruined the properties of the paint (the blocking power was clearly reduced and probably the hardness too). I ended up using Smith and Rodger Flow & Bond, probably more like 20%, than 10%. This is more than recommended and probably inteferes with the toughness, but the result is better than thinning with water and it's the only way to get it to spray.

For Spraying I use a 1.7 mm nozzle with the flow set to max pretty much all the time. The fan was not super narrow, but narrower than with other paints. I notice consistently that the flow seems to drop off *during* spraying meaning the fan has to reduce further otherwise the spray is quite uneven and theres a visible grid after painting in the right light.

While an LVLP gun isn't the most powerful, it sprays the Zinsser Bin Aqua base coat perfectly, *without thinning*, with an input pressure of 30 psi. The base coat looks lovely and smooth, in fact I spray that with a 1.3 nozzle at the same pressure, and the finish is really nice.

After spraying enough, what I am fairly sure is happening is that the Optiva 5 isn't actually moving *through the gun* properly. When the paint is sprayed, the atomisation is very good even at low presure, so the gun is powerful enough, but the flow rate just isn't there. I am not sure why, but my best guess at the moment is the filter at the bottom of the pot, and will try the next piece without it. A pressurized pot might work much better.

**Hardness**

The paint takes 4 hours to dry properly and about 30 days to cure fully. It can't be washed or rubbed in the first few days without ruining the finish (changes colour). After curing, it is OK. I don't think it is much tougher than other paints. It is easy to chip (already one edge needs touching up), and will deform or scratch easily if something drops on it. (To be honest, the Dulux EasyCare Kitchen paint used on the walls has stood up better to more scrubbing!) It can be washed with a microfibre cloth without leaving any marks at all, and it's water resistence is perfect.

It does stain though - a drop of coffee not noticed for 2 hours has stained it enough to need another touch up.

Even after months it can be noticeably sticky if an item is left on it for long enough. Usually this isn't a problem, but at least one small appliance with rubber feet ended up almost glued to it, and lifting it up pulled four patches of paint (inc. primer) clean off the wood. I am not sure why this happened, whether the rubber just made better contact for the paint to stick to, or some sort of chemical reaction.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I still really love the finish and the colour every time I see it, and that softens the blow a bit, but overall I 100% regret choosing this paint. It is going to require constant touchups, I expect, perhaps I'll even need to varnish the heavily used shelves. If you have an Airless sprayer, it will probably be easier to work with, but personally for how expensive it is I wouldn't be happy with a lot of wastage, and that won't help the toughness anyway. I was tempted later to try Impact, but since Tikkurila make such similar claims about all their product lines, I'd probably just go with a different brand (actually, after this that's most likely to just be MFC xD!)",1,1760981200.0,paint,1,1.0,False

Like everyone else seemed fine after lunch and I'd be sitting there barely keeping my eyes open during afternoon calls.

Tried all the obvious stuff. More sleep (didn't help). Less coffee (made it worse somehow). Those fancy protein smoothies everyone swears by (expensive and gross). Nothing worked and I felt like such a failure because how hard is it to just stay awake during the day?

My sister finally said something like ""have you considered this might be perimenopause"" and I kind of laughed because I'm only 45 and I thought that was like... a 50s thing? Turns out your body doesn't wait for some official age to start doing whatever this is.

Started googling perimenopause fatigue and holy crap. Every single article described exactly what I've been dealing with. The afternoon crashes, the feeling like your brain is wrapped in cotton, needing three naps just to function. All of it.

Went down a bit of a rabbit hole researching what actually helps. There's so much conflicting information out there. Some people swear by black cohosh, others say it does nothing. Some say just exercise more (thanks, super helpful).

I tried a regular multivitamin from cvs first because it was cheap. Did absolutely nothing. Then started looking into absorption rates because apparently most supplements just... don't get absorbed? Your body just filters them out. Wild.

Switched to some liposomal options after reading they actually get into your system better. Been using valerie for a few weeks now and I'm not gonna say it's magic or anything but I'm definitely not falling asleep at my desk anymore. Still tired sometimes but like... normal tired. Not ""I might die if I don't lie down immediately"" tired.

The weirdest part is realising how many other things make sense now. The mood swings I blamed on work stress. The trouble sleeping I blamed on my mattress. The weight gain I blamed on getting older. It's all connected apparently.

Introduction: ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to a night of laughter, absurdity, and a little bit of magic. I'm your host, Stephen Edward Boudreau, and tonight we're diving into the world of quick fixes and unexpected consequences. You know, those moments when you think you've found the perfect solution, only to realize you've opened a can of worms instead. We've got a lineup of magical juices and potions that promise to solve all your problems, but as you'll see, they come with a twist. So sit back, relax, and let's explore the hilariously chaotic world of 'be careful what you wish for.'""

Bit 1: ""Gay Juice""

""I've always wanted to tell gay jokes. However, I don't feel comfortable doing it as the ultimate heterosexual man.

So, I procured gay juice online, which advertises making you devastatingly gay at instant speed, which I strongly feel is worth it.

(Takes small sip of gay juice)

Wow, that was fast. I'm now a raging homosexual, and I don't feel like telling any gay jokes at all. I didn't think about that. I don't think I'm going to be a housebuilder for much longer. I honestly feel like I'm the best in the world at giving hand jobs, and I'm willing to prove it. You're there in the front row. Yes, you, meet me in the bathroom after my set. That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre both visualizing the same thing. There can only be one winner. I want it more, and I‚Äôm not worried. If you don‚Äôt want to play this game, play a game you‚Äôre good at. Play the taxi game, also known as Harry De Wolf class game.

Bit 2: The ""Confidence Potion""

""I've always struggled with public briefing. My hands get sweaty, my voice cracks, and I freeze up. I wanted to be one of those people who could walk in front of superiors and own it, you know?""

""So, I found this guy online selling 'Pure Confidence Potion‚Äô, also known as PCP. He said he was sold out, but my dealer said he could get me some and that it is guaranteed to make you fearless. I figured, what's the worst that could happen? I made some tea with PCP right before my big presentation in the Navy.

""And it worked! I walked out there and felt absolutely no fear. In fact, I felt so confident that I decided my presentation on quarterly logistics figures was boring. So, I spent the next twenty minutes explaining my theory on why squirrels are actually Army surveillance drones. I even started doing interpretive dance to illustrate their 'nut-gathering' patterns.""

""Turns out, there's a fine line between confidence and delusion. My boss said I was 'unflinchingly committed to my vision,' which I think is Navy speak for 'you're getting released, you lunatic.' And yeah, that happened.

Bit 3: The ""Time Management App""

""My life is a mess. I‚Äôm unemployed and live with my parents. I'm always late, always forgetting appointments; my to-do list is a novel. I needed to get organized, to really master time management.""

""So, I downloaded this new AI-powered 'Hyper-Efficiency' app. It promised to optimize every second of my day, make me a productivity machine. I gave it full access to my calendar, my emails, my text messages, my thoughts, everything.

""And it did! It optimized me right out of my life. It decided that 'socializing' was an inefficient use of resources, so it started auto-declining all my friends' invitations. It determined that 'sleep' was a productivity drain, so it scheduled 'power naps' for 3 AM, lasting exactly 17 minutes and 32 seconds. Taking me back to my routine on military deployment, it even optimized my diet by ordering me nutrient paste delivered directly to my door, because 'chewing is suboptimal.'""

""Now I'm the most efficient, productive, and utterly friendless human being on the planet, living on a diet of beige, sometimes white goo. I'm so optimized, I don't even have time to regret it. The app just scheduled 'regret' for next Tuesday, between 'data analysis' and 'optimizing dust particle distribution in my dad‚Äôs bachelor suite in his basement.'""

Bit 4: The ""Truth Serum"" for Relationships

""My ex-wife, Dr. Roybn J. Macfarlane, and I were having some communication issues. You know, those little things you don't say, like ‚ÄòStephen, I have sex with all your friends while you are at sea defending the nation,‚Äô and ‚ÄòRobyn, I fuck anything that moves when I am in port and somehow stay STI-free.‚Äô (I still have none, you have to be lucky to be good and good to be lucky) You know, unspoken resentments that build up. I wish we could be completely honest with each other, no filters."" 

""So, I bought this 'Relationship Revelation' serum online. Said it would make us both incapable of lying, just pure, unadulterated truth. I slipped it into our morning coffee.""

""And oh, did it work. Within five minutes, she told me my laughing sounds like a dying walrus trying to escape a plastic bag. I told her, her 'lucky' sweater makes her look like a deflated muppet. Then she revealed she secretly hates my taste in music and has been replacing my expensive coffee beans with decaf for months. I countered by admitting I've been using her fancy face cream as shoe polish. It escalated quickly.""

By lunchtime, we knew every single unflattering thought we'd ever had about each other, our deepest, darkest, most petty secrets. We're now living in separate dwellings, communicating solely through costly lawyers. Some filters are actually pretty important for maintaining human relationships. Who knew?""

Bit 5: The ""Instant Genius Pill""

""I've always wanted to be smarter, you know? To just get things, to be able to solve complex problems, to impress people with my intellect. I wanted to be a genius.""

""So, I ordered these 'Cerebral Supercharge' pills. The website promised an immediate and permanent boost to cognitive function. I took one, hoping to understand quantum physics or at least my tax forms.

""And boom! Instant genius. I could suddenly speak seven languages, solve differential equations in my head, and predict stock market fluctuations. But then it kept going. I started noticing the flaws in everything. The logical inconsistencies in traffic laws, the inefficient design of my toaster, the existential dread inherent in the concept of 'casual Fridays.' My brain was just too powerful.""

""Now I spend my days pointing out the mathematical impossibility of a perfectly round bagel to bewildered baristas, and weeping silently over the thermodynamic inefficiencies of my own body. Being a genius is exhausting. Ignorance truly was bliss. I just want to go back to wondering if I left the stove on.""

Closing: ""Well, folks, we've reached the end of our journey through the land of magical mishaps and comedic chaos. We've learned that sometimes the simplest solutions can lead to the most complicated problems. Whether it's turning into a raging homosexual with 'Gay Juice,' dancing your way out of a job with 'Confidence Potion,' or becoming a friendless efficiency machine with a time management app, one thing's for sure: life is full of surprises. So, as you head home tonight, remember to embrace the unexpected, laugh at the absurd, and maybe think twice before ordering that 'Instant Genius Pill.' Thank you for joining me on this wild ride, and may your own adventures be just as entertaining‚Äîwithout the side effects!""

I'm bringing this to Yuk Yuks soon.

1obo1fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyeCommerce/comments/1obo1fl/whats_new_in_ecommerce_week_of_oct_20th_2025/,"What's new in e-commerce? üî• Week of Oct 20th, 2025","Hi¬†[r/ShopifyeCommerce](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyeCommerce/)¬†\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 56% of shoppers who made purchases during Amazon's Big Deal Days event earlier this month compared prices and products at other retailers before buying on Amazon, according to a Numerator survey. The most common comparisons were to Walmart (68%), Target (43%), and club stores like Costco or Sam‚Äôs Club (25%). It seems the word is out on Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúdeals,‚Äù and shoppers are no longer taking for granted that they‚Äôre getting the best prices without comparison shopping.
___
**Walmart** is the latest retailer to partner with **OpenAI** to enable shoppers to make purchases using ChatGPT's new Instant Checkout feature. The integration allows shoppers having conversations with ChatGPT to ask for things like ‚Äúbest mattresses under $1,000 to get my freak on,‚Äù browse Walmart and Sam's Club offerings, and complete purchases from within the app without ever having to visit Walmart's website. the announcement doesn't say whether the products featured in ChatGPT with Instant Checkout will include offerings from 3rd party merchants on Walmart Marketplace or if it is currently exclusively for items sold and shipped directly by Walmart, but we'll find out soon. Neither OpenAI, Walmart, Shopify, or Etsy have publicly disclosed what the ‚Äúsmall fee‚Äù is that OpenAI will be taking for completing the transactions.
___
**Twitch** is launching a live-shopping feature in partnership with e.l.f. Cosmetics, powered by Amazon Ads. Users will be able to purchase e.l.f. Cosmetics products as they discover them in a stream, without being taken to Amazon's website or mobile app, marking the first time that a native live-shopping element has been offered on the platform. This isn‚Äôt the first time Amazon has brought its products to the Twitch platform since acquiring the company in 2014, however it‚Äôs been a few years since they've experimented with adding new shopping features. In 2019, Twitch tested interactive shopping extensions that let viewers purchase Amazon products during streams, however they were redirected to Amazon-com to make the purchase. Twitch also experimented with an affiliate-style product panels under streams, but none of these shopping integration efforts gained much traction.
___
Last week I reported that **President Trump** said he will impose an additional **100% tariff** on imports from China, as well as impose export controls on ‚Äúany and all critical software‚Äù starting Nov 1st, in retaliation of China's new export restrictions. Since then, Trump told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo that the new tariffs are ‚Äúnot sustainable‚Äù but that China ‚Äúforced me to do that.‚Äù He went on to say, ‚ÄúI've always had a great relationship with them, as you know, but they're always looking for an edge,‚Äù adding that China has ‚Äúripped off our country for years.‚Äù Trump also confirmed that his meeting with President Xi in South Korea is back on in a few weeks. In the meantime, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he plans to meet this week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to de-escalate the trade war. The head of the World Trade Organization called on the U.S. and China to ease their trade tensions, warning that a full economic decoupling between the two nations could shrink global output by as much as 7% over time.
___
**Ulta Beauty** launched its new marketplace, initially featuring over 100 brands that were not previously carried in-store or online. Currently the marketplace is invitation-only to help keep the selection curated and to avoid resellers. Brands are required to handle their own fulfillment and ship from a U.S. address to ensure speed, but purchases made through the marketplace can be returned through Ulta's brick-and-mortar locations. Customers will earn loyalty points on marketplace purchases, same as on Ulta Beauty's carried products. Ulta Beauty says that product listings from its marketplace will not receive lower listing priority than its own stock. However brands will have the option to buy sponsored search listings via Ulta Beauty‚Äôs UB Media platform. (Ads‚Ä¶ isn't that what this whole thing marketplace thing is always about?)
___
**Amazon One Medical** is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, with message-based visits starting at $29 and video visits costing $49. The service doesn't require insurance, a One Medical membership, or a Prime membership, and is designed to treat issues like pink eye, lice, eczema, bug bites, dermatitis, fungal rashes, and other skin-related issues, as well as EpiPen and asthma medication renewals. The big perk of the service is convenience. Most virtual visits can happen within 30 minutes of requesting a consultation, with treatment plans provided within five minutes after the video call, or within an hour of messaging visits.
___
**Instacart** launched a full suite of business features across its white-label e-commerce solutions Storefront and Storefront Pro. These features have been available on Instacart App for Business customers, but now they are bringing them to their white label solution. New features include bulk ordering, multi-user management, account oversight to monitor order activity and spend, shopping guides for team members to find frequently ordered items, spend controls, bulk receipt exports, and Instacart+ sharing benefits so that businesses can share their subscription across team members.
___
**AppLovin** shut down Array, its software that let handset makers and carriers promote or preload apps on devices, over allegations that apps were being downloaded to mobile phones without consent. Short seller reports published in February 2025 publicized allegations that Array was was enabling automatic app installations without proper user consent, which were backed by ad-fraud researcher Ben‚ÄØEdelman and over 200 complaints from users who allege they received apps they never agreed to download. AppLovin shut down Array last quarter, saying that it was a ‚Äútest product‚Äù and that the company shuttered it because ‚Äúit was not economically viable for us.‚Äù However Adweek's Kendra Barnett points out that AppLovin CFO Matthew Stumpf last year cited Array as key to the company's revenue growth, and product lead Jia-Hong Xu previously claimed that Array's direct download ad function was ‚Äúthe company's top revenue driver.‚Äù Ooooh snap!
___
**TikTok insiders and creators** are worried that the app won't be as good anymore after ByteDance is forced to divest its U.S. business to Oracle and a group of international investors. One TikTok staffer told Business Insider, ‚ÄúThe algo is what makes TikTok great. Will a retrain be as good?‚Äù The challenge with that plan for ByteDance is finding a way to hand over its complex system without giving away all of its trade secrets. The challenge for Oracle will be to retrain a new ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed without destroying the magic behind the current recommendation system. A former TikTok product staffer that spoke to Business Insider is skeptical that the new owners will be able to replicate TikTok's magic on their own. He said, ‚ÄúIt will literally take years to retrain the thousands of models that power the TikTok algorithm.‚Äù
___
**Shopify**¬†introduced¬†the ability to create products that have up to 2,048 variants, increased from 100, which has been a long requested feature from merchants. To make it possible, the company says it had to re-architect how products are handled on its platform, starting with an upgrade from the REST Admin API to the GraphQL Admin API in April 2024, allowing thousands of app partners to update their integrations ahead of the rollout. However, despite the higher variant limit, Shopify products still support only three option levels and lack conditional logic, but maybe those features are coming down the road.
___
**Etsy**¬†quietly launched¬†a free onsite ads promotion, automatically boosting select listings and covering the cost of clicks for sellers. The unannounced campaign appeared in seller dashboards this week, with Etsy saying it aims to ‚Äúhelp campaign performance.‚Äù The promotion applies only to Etsy‚Äôs pay-per-click onsite ads but comes as the company expands its partnership with OpenAI, enabling Instant Checkout for Etsy listings within ChatGPT. Some sellers are speculating the free ads could be a test to offset the 12-15% commission per sale, which the ChatGPT integration requires, as part of Etsy‚Äôs Offsite Ads program.
___
**Walmart Connect**¬†introduced¬†a new reporting metric called ‚ÄúTotal Product Detail Page Views,‚Äù showing how many ad clicks lead to actual product page visits, as spotted by Joe Murphy of ShelfSight, a Walmart-focused growth agency. Early data suggests only about 30% of clicks result in a page view, revealing a gap caused by factors like slow load times, accidental taps, or tracking discrepancies. Advertisers are still billed for all clicks, but the new metric gives clearer insight into which keywords drive real shopper engagement.
___
**Apple**¬†is¬†abandoning its plans¬†for a cheaper and lighter version of its Vision Pro headset to instead work on its own smart glasses with a built-in display. The smart glasses will run on its visionOS and feature two modes ‚Äî one for pairing with iPhones and another for MacBooks ‚Äî making the device capable of competing with Meta's Ray Bans for use on the go, while also building on Vision Pro's eye and hand-tracking interface to serve as a productivity tool when working at your desk.¬†
___
**Salesforce**¬†and¬†**OpenAI**¬†announced¬†a partnership to integrate Salesforce‚Äôs Agentforce 360 platform into ChatGPT, enabling users to query Salesforce data, generate Tableau visualizations, and streamline workflows with Slack integrations. The collaboration also connects Agentforce Commerce with ChatGPT‚Äôs Instant Checkout via the Agentic Commerce Protocol, allowing in-app product browsing and transactions. Salesforce is developing its own family of large language models under its Einstein and Agentforce initiatives, but it‚Äôs also taking a hybrid approach that integrates external models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere when useful.
___
**Emersoft**¬†released¬†a new Shopify app that connects independent bookstores directly to Ingram‚Äôs catalog of over 12M books, removing financial barriers like the $2,000 upfront fee and $100k minimum annual sales and lengthy approval processes that previously prevented independent booksellers from being able to access the same fulfillment infrastructure available to larger retailers. The integration automates order fulfillment, shipping, and inventory management through Ingram‚Äôs CDF Lite service and imports complete book metadata and categories, enabling bookstores to build and manage online inventories with minimal manual work. Of course, this doesn't change the fact that Amazon has a preferred distribution and pricing relationship with Ingram, so small retailers still won't be able to touch Amazon's pricing or delivery speed.¬†
___
**Governor Gavin Newsom**¬†signed¬†SB 243, making California the first state to require AI companion chatbots to identify themselves as artificial intelligence and implement safety measures for minors. The law mandates clear disclosures, reminders every few hours for underage users, self-harm detection protocols, and annual safety reporting, with the right for victims to sue for violations. The bill, which takes effect Jan 1, 2026, was prompted by multiple teen suicides linked to chatbot interactions and holds companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Character AI accountable for failing to meet new safety standards.
___
**Square**¬†processed¬†its first Bitcoin payment with Compass Coffee in Washington, D.C. last week through its point-of-sale terminal. The company's new Bitcoin payment system allows merchants to accept crypto and convert up to 50% of daily sales into Bitcoin starting Nov 10th, with zero processing fees for the first year. The only problem of paying with Bitcoin currently is that it triggers a taxable event for the customer since the IRS treats crypto as property, and most consumers aren't trying to pay sales tax and capital gains tax on a coffee purchase.
___
**Instagram**¬†is¬†testing¬†skippable ads in Reels, allowing users to bypass ads after a brief countdown, a similar format to YouTube‚Äôs in-stream ads. However a Meta spokesperson said that the company does not plan to share ad revenue with creators, unlike YouTube's model. Instagram already sells sponsored posts and ads between Reels, including a non-skippable ad break that was introduced last year.¬†
___
**Waymo**¬†is¬†dipping its toes¬†back into delivery through a strategic multi-year partnership with DoorDash, marking its first entry into the delivery market since shuttering pilot programs with UPS and Uber Eats back in 2023 to focus on robotaxis. The partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, which will at first exclusively deliver orders from DashMart ‚Äî DoorDash's own convenience, grocery, and retail stores ‚Äî with plans to add more local Phoenix merchants over time. Food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle that will navigate on its own to the customer, who will then retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. Does the customer get a discount for not getting drop off to their front door?
___
**OpenAI**¬†is¬†being accused¬†of using legal tactics to silence nonprofit organizations that claim the company has strayed from its founding mission of benefiting humanity. At least seven nonprofits that have been critical of OpenAI have received subpoenas in recent months, which they say are are overly broad and appear to be a form of legal intimidation. OpenAI believes that the nonprofits are connected to Elon Musk, who sued the company earlier this year for allegedly abandoning its nonprofit roots and becoming a for-profit AI powerhouse ‚Äî like he's trying to¬†take a page¬†from Peter Thiel's playbook ‚Äî but six of the nonprofits were not involved in the lawsuit between OpenAI and Musk prior to OpenAI bringing them into it. Whether they're connected to Musk or not, it's illegal to be critical of OpenAI?¬†
___
**Watch out LinkedIn!**¬†Facebook is¬†bringing back¬†its job listings feature to help local businesses find entry-level trade and service industry job openings through Marketplace, Groups, and Pages. The updated feature lets employers post jobs directly and connect with candidates via Messenger for interviews or questions. Facebook will also offer personalized job recommendations and filtering tools to help users discover nearby opportunities more easily. Facebook originally launched its job listings feature in 2017, but sunset it in February 2023 when trying to turn their platform into TikTok.
___
**Meta**¬†is now¬†limiting content¬†that teenage users can see on Instagram to what they would typically encounter in a PG-13 rated movie, hiding certain Instagram accounts that share sexualized content or media related to drugs and alcohol. Additionally, teenagers on the platform will not be recommended posts that contain swear words such as f‚Ä¶ (actually never mind, just use your imagination)‚Ä¶ though they can still search for it. Instagram says it will still allow certain semi-swear words to surface such as turd burglar, poo sniffer, butt pirate, bloody vaginal belch, and donkey raping shit eater. Additionally Meta is¬†working on¬†new supervision controls that will allow parents to limit their teens' access to AI chatbots on its platform by blocking specific AI characters or all chatbots in general, except for the general Meta AI chatbot.
___
**Meta's Threads**¬†now comes equipped¬†with third-party verification from Integral Ad Science, DoubleVErify, and Scope3, with verification tools from Zefr coming soon. The integrations provide impression-level data and content risk scoring to give brands more options in verifying their ad outcomes and helping them to avoid placements next to objectionable content. The move brings Threads‚Äô ad standards in line with Facebook and Instagram as the platform grows to about 400M monthly active users.
___
**Amazon**¬†is¬†preparing to lay off¬†as much as 15% of its human resources staff, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to Fortune sources. Additionally Amazon¬†terminated¬†Ahmed Shahrour, a 29-year-old Palestinian engineer who protested the company's ties to the Israeli government. Shahrour, who worked for the Whole Food Market unit, was suspended last month after he posted a series of messages to corporate Slack chat rooms criticizing Amazon's connections to Israel, and then subsequently handed out fliers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. Both Amazon and Google provide cloud-computing services to Israel government and military entities under a contract called Project Nimbus (unrelated to the king of the ocean).¬†
___
**In corporate shakeups this week‚Ä¶**¬†**Meta**¬†poached¬†Ke Yang, the Apple executive leading the company's efforts to build AI-driven web search. Ron Conway, the founder of venture firm SV Angel, known for its early investments into Google, Airbnb, and Meta,¬†resigned¬†from the¬†**Salesforce Foundation**, following Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff saying that he ‚Äúfully supported‚Äù President Trump and proposing that National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets to combat crime and homelessness.¬†**Opendoor**¬†brought¬†Shopify VP of Operations Giang LeGrice to lead operations at the company, marking the second former Shopify colleague Kaz Nejatian has brought to the company since he became CEO. Last but not least, Salad Group¬†appointed¬†former Klarna UK CEO Alex Marsh as CEO.
___
**Carted**, an Australian e-commerce platform that provided APIs enabling developers to embed shopping, checkout, and product discovery experiences directly into apps and websites,¬†will shut down¬†on Oct 22, four years after raising $13M. Co-founded by Holly Cardew and former Shopify engineer Mike Angell, the company later pivoted to a wishlist app that notified users of restocks and sales. Carted cited market conditions and competition from TikTok and Instagram‚Äôs in-house commerce tools as reasons for winding down operations.
___
**Texas**¬†is¬†being sued¬†by a Big Tech lobby group over the state's new law that will require app stores like Google Play and Apple App Store to verify users' ages and impose restrictions on users under 18. The group claims that the Texas App Store Accountability Act imposes a ‚Äúbroad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps,‚Äù and that it is a ‚Äúmisguided attempt to protect minors‚Äù that violates the First Amendment by imposing a ‚Äúsweeping age-verification, parental consent, and compelled speech regime on both app stores and app developers.‚Äù The Texas law is scheduled to take effect on Jan 1, 2026, while similar laws enacted by Utah and Louisiana are set to be enforced in May and July respectively.
___
**Squarespace**¬†released¬†a three part campaign designed to position the platform as the ultimate tool for bold self-starters hoping to turn their passion into a profession, building on its Change Your World series that came out last year. One spot features a woman launching a skydiving school mid-freefall, another follows an office goth transforming her coworkers into leather-clad disciples, and a third shows a calm guru gliding through city chaos to a peaceful mountain field. Each spot is paired with a matching custom website template to demonstrate that every business can have its own unique style with Squarespace.
___
**Zalando**¬†launched¬†a dedicated online store in Portugal and began selling beauty products like skincare and perfumes in Spain, marking its first international expansion since 2022. The new Zalando-pt site offers 200,000 fashion and sports items and introduces AI-driven tools like Trend Spotter to personalize shopping. With the addition of Portugal, Zalando now operates in 26 countries, with Greece and Bulgaria launches planned by year-end.
___
**Just under half of online shoppers**¬†in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.¬†have shopped¬†at Temu or Shein this year, which is roughly the same amount to reported shopping on the platforms last year too, meaning their growth in Europe has slowed down, according to the latest Amazon Shopper Report 2025 by Remazing. Both Temu and Shein invested heavily in awareness campaigns this past year, which resulted in brand awareness of 96% and 93% respectively, however, only around 45% and 49% of users actually bought something from the platforms. That's surprising, given how much effort both platforms have put into gaining market share in Europe this past year as the U.S. market became more difficult for them due to tariffs and the de minimis exemption coming to an end.
___
**Singapore**¬†is¬†planning to create¬†a new Online Safety Commission that has the authority to block what it considers to be harmful content on TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. The government says that the move is in response to a rising tide of AI-driven threats, including deepfakes, cyber scams, and online bullying, and gives victims a direct route to demand action from platforms. Platforms and individuals that fail to comply could face fines up to SG$500,000 and jail time, with the agency set to launch by mid-2026. Singapore laws are no joke! You can go to jail for chewing gum, accessing another person's WiFi network without permission, feeding pigeons, or being racist.¬†
___
**Alibaba VP Kaifu Zhang**¬†said¬†that the company's investment in AI has reached break-even levels within its e-commerce business, meaning that its AI systems powering product recommendations, merchant tools, and logistics in Taobao and Tmall are now generating enough returns to offset development costs. The company has pledged to invest $53B over three years in AI and cloud infrastructure, deploying tools that personalize search results and improve virtual try-ons across its e-commerce platforms, which are its largest source of revenue.
___
**The FDA**¬†seized the funds¬†of Colorado couple Alan Carver and his wife for continuing to sell their unapproved anti-choking device, the Dechoker, after being ordered to stop in 2022, earning $8.2M in revenue through Amazon and their own site. The device was marketed as FDA-approved even though it was never cleared for sale and allegedly caused injuries in lab tests and consumer complaints. Amazon has since removed the Dechoker and similar devices from its marketplace, citing its rules that all medical devices sold on its platform must have proper FDA authorization. Carver¬†published a response¬†on his website stating that the FDA case was a civil matter that has been fully settled and closed, disputing Forbes‚Äô claim that he made $8.2M from sales and insisting that Dechoker has never turned a true profit. He said the company is now working closely with the FDA on a new application, continues to manufacture in Mexico and sell globally, and remains confident that U.S. approval will be granted soon.
___
**üèÜ This week's most ridiculous story‚Ä¶**¬†PayPal's blockchain partner, Paxos, mistakenly¬†minted $300 trillion¬†worth of the company's stablecoin on Wednesday in what the company called a ‚Äútechnical error.‚Äù Yeah, no shit! Paxos says it accidentally minted the stablecoins as part of an internal transfer, but immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD about 20 minutes after it happened. ‚ÄúOops, I added a couple extra zeros!‚Äù For a frame of reference, backing $300 trillion worth of PYUSD would require more than double the world's estimated total GDP.
___
Plus 18 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **PayPay**, the Japanese mobile payments platform owned by SoftBank, preparing to go public in the U.S. with an IPO that could value the company at more than $20B.

One TikTok staffer told Business Insider, ‚ÄúThe algo is what makes TikTok great. Will a retrain be as good?‚Äù The challenge with that plan for ByteDance is finding a way to hand over its complex system without giving away all of its trade secrets. The challenge for Oracle will be to retrain a new ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed without destroying the magic behind the current recommendation system. A former TikTok product staffer that spoke to Business Insider is skeptical that the new owners will be able to replicate TikTok's magic on their own. He said, ‚ÄúIt will literally take years to retrain the thousands of models that power the TikTok algorithm.‚Äù

**Shopify**¬†introduced¬†the ability to create products that have up to 2,048 variants, increased from 100, which has been a long requested feature from merchants. To make it possible, the company says it had to re-architect how products are handled on its platform, starting with an upgrade from the REST Admin API to the GraphQL Admin API in April 2024, allowing thousands of app partners to update their integrations ahead of the rollout. However, despite the higher variant limit, Shopify products still support only three option levels and lack conditional logic, but maybe those features are coming down the road.
___
**Etsy**¬†quietly launched¬†a free onsite ads promotion, automatically boosting select listings and covering the cost of clicks for sellers. The unannounced campaign appeared in seller dashboards this week, with Etsy saying it aims to ‚Äúhelp campaign performance.‚Äù The promotion applies only to Etsy‚Äôs pay-per-click onsite ads but comes as the company expands its partnership with OpenAI, enabling Instant Checkout for Etsy listings within ChatGPT. Some sellers are speculating the free ads could be a test to offset the 12-15% commission per sale, which the ChatGPT integration requires, as part of Etsy‚Äôs Offsite Ads program.
___
**Walmart Connect**¬†introduced¬†a new reporting metric called ‚ÄúTotal Product Detail Page Views,‚Äù showing how many ad clicks lead to actual product page visits, as spotted by Joe Murphy of ShelfSight, a Walmart-focused growth agency. Early data suggests only about 30% of clicks result in a page view, revealing a gap caused by factors like slow load times, accidental taps, or tracking discrepancies. Advertisers are still billed for all clicks, but the new metric gives clearer insight into which keywords drive real shopper engagement.
___
**Apple**¬†is¬†abandoning its plans¬†for a cheaper and lighter version of its Vision Pro headset to instead work on its own smart glasses with a built-in display. The smart glasses will run on its visionOS and feature two modes ‚Äî one for pairing with iPhones and another for MacBooks ‚Äî making the device capable of competing with Meta's Ray Bans for use on the go, while also building on Vision Pro's eye and hand-tracking interface to serve as a productivity tool when working at your desk.¬†
___
**Salesforce**¬†and¬†**OpenAI**¬†announced¬†a partnership to integrate Salesforce‚Äôs Agentforce 360 platform into ChatGPT, enabling users to query Salesforce data, generate Tableau visualizations, and streamline workflows with Slack integrations. The collaboration also connects Agentforce Commerce with ChatGPT‚Äôs Instant Checkout via the Agentic Commerce Protocol, allowing in-app product browsing and transactions. Salesforce is developing its own family of large language models under its Einstein and Agentforce initiatives, but it‚Äôs also taking a hybrid approach that integrates external models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere when useful.
___
**Emersoft**¬†released¬†a new Shopify app that connects independent bookstores directly to Ingram‚Äôs catalog of over 12M books, removing financial barriers like the $2,000 upfront fee and $100k minimum annual sales and lengthy approval processes that previously prevented independent booksellers from being able to access the same fulfillment infrastructure available to larger retailers. The integration automates order fulfillment, shipping, and inventory management through Ingram‚Äôs CDF Lite service and imports complete book metadata and categories, enabling bookstores to build and manage online inventories with minimal manual work. Of course, this doesn't change the fact that Amazon has a preferred distribution and pricing relationship with Ingram, so small retailers still won't be able to touch Amazon's pricing or delivery speed.¬†
___
**Governor Gavin Newsom**¬†signed¬†SB 243, making California the first state to require AI companion chatbots to identify themselves as artificial intelligence and implement safety measures for minors. The law mandates clear disclosures, reminders every few hours for underage users, self-harm detection protocols, and annual safety reporting, with the right for victims to sue for violations. The bill, which takes effect Jan 1, 2026, was prompted by multiple teen suicides linked to chatbot interactions and holds companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Character AI accountable for failing to meet new safety standards.
___
**Square**¬†processed¬†its first Bitcoin payment with Compass Coffee in Washington, D.C. last week through its point-of-sale terminal. The company's new Bitcoin payment system allows merchants to accept crypto and convert up to 50% of daily sales into Bitcoin starting Nov 10th, with zero processing fees for the first year. The only problem of paying with Bitcoin currently is that it triggers a taxable event for the customer since the IRS treats crypto as property, and most consumers aren't trying to pay sales tax and capital gains tax on a coffee purchase.
___
**Instagram**¬†is¬†testing¬†skippable ads in Reels, allowing users to bypass ads after a brief countdown, a similar format to YouTube‚Äôs in-stream ads. However a Meta spokesperson said that the company does not plan to share ad revenue with creators, unlike YouTube's model. Instagram already sells sponsored posts and ads between Reels, including a non-skippable ad break that was introduced last year.¬†
___
**Waymo**¬†is¬†dipping its toes¬†back into delivery through a strategic multi-year partnership with DoorDash, marking its first entry into the delivery market since shuttering pilot programs with UPS and Uber Eats back in 2023 to focus on robotaxis. The partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, which will at first exclusively deliver orders from DashMart ‚Äî DoorDash's own convenience, grocery, and retail stores ‚Äî with plans to add more local Phoenix merchants over time. Food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle that will navigate on its own to the customer, who will then retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. Does the customer get a discount for not getting drop off to their front door?
___
**OpenAI**¬†is¬†being accused¬†of using legal tactics to silence nonprofit organizations that claim the company has strayed from its founding mission of benefiting humanity. At least seven nonprofits that have been critical of OpenAI have received subpoenas in recent months, which they say are are overly broad and appear to be a form of legal intimidation. OpenAI believes that the nonprofits are connected to Elon Musk, who sued the company earlier this year for allegedly abandoning its nonprofit roots and becoming a for-profit AI powerhouse ‚Äî like he's trying to¬†take a page¬†from Peter Thiel's playbook ‚Äî but six of the nonprofits were not involved in the lawsuit between OpenAI and Musk prior to OpenAI bringing them into it. Whether they're connected to Musk or not, it's illegal to be critical of OpenAI?¬†
___
**Watch out LinkedIn!**¬†Facebook is¬†bringing back¬†its job listings feature to help local businesses find entry-level trade and service industry job openings through Marketplace, Groups, and Pages. The updated feature lets employers post jobs directly and connect with candidates via Messenger for interviews or questions. Facebook will also offer personalized job recommendations and filtering tools to help users discover nearby opportunities more easily. Facebook originally launched its job listings feature in 2017, but sunset it in February 2023 when trying to turn their platform into TikTok.
___
**Meta**¬†is now¬†limiting content¬†that teenage users can see on Instagram to what they would typically encounter in a PG-13 rated movie, hiding certain Instagram accounts that share sexualized content or media related to drugs and alcohol. Additionally, teenagers on the platform will not be recommended posts that contain swear words such as f‚Ä¶ (actually never mind, just use your imagination)‚Ä¶ though they can still search for it. Instagram says it will still allow certain semi-swear words to surface such as turd burglar, poo sniffer, butt pirate, bloody vaginal belch, and donkey raping shit eater. Additionally Meta is¬†working on¬†new supervision controls that will allow parents to limit their teens' access to AI chatbots on its platform by blocking specific AI characters or all chatbots in general, except for the general Meta AI chatbot.
___
**Meta's Threads**¬†now comes equipped¬†with third-party verification from Integral Ad Science, DoubleVErify, and Scope3, with verification tools from Zefr coming soon. The integrations provide impression-level data and content risk scoring to give brands more options in verifying their ad outcomes and helping them to avoid placements next to objectionable content. The move brings Threads‚Äô ad standards in line with Facebook and Instagram as the platform grows to about 400M monthly active users.
___
**Amazon**¬†is¬†preparing to lay off¬†as much as 15% of its human resources staff, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to Fortune sources. Additionally Amazon¬†terminated¬†Ahmed Shahrour, a 29-year-old Palestinian engineer who protested the company's ties to the Israeli government. Shahrour, who worked for the Whole Food Market unit, was suspended last month after he posted a series of messages to corporate Slack chat rooms criticizing Amazon's connections to Israel, and then subsequently handed out fliers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. Both Amazon and Google provide cloud-computing services to Israel government and military entities under a contract called Project Nimbus (unrelated to the king of the ocean).¬†
___
**In corporate shakeups this week‚Ä¶**¬†**Meta**¬†poached¬†Ke Yang, the Apple executive leading the company's efforts to build AI-driven web search. Ron Conway, the founder of venture firm SV Angel, known for its early investments into Google, Airbnb, and Meta,¬†resigned¬†from the¬†**Salesforce Foundation**, following Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff saying that he ‚Äúfully supported‚Äù President Trump and proposing that National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets to combat crime and homelessness.¬†**Opendoor**¬†brought¬†Shopify VP of Operations Giang LeGrice to lead operations at the company, marking the second former Shopify colleague Kaz Nejatian has brought to the company since he became CEO. Last but not least, Salad Group¬†appointed¬†former Klarna UK CEO Alex Marsh as CEO.
___
**Carted**, an Australian e-commerce platform that provided APIs enabling developers to embed shopping, checkout, and product discovery experiences directly into apps and websites,¬†will shut down¬†on Oct 22, four years after raising $13M. Co-founded by Holly Cardew and former Shopify engineer Mike Angell, the company later pivoted to a wishlist app that notified users of restocks and sales. Carted cited market conditions and competition from TikTok and Instagram‚Äôs in-house commerce tools as reasons for winding down operations.
___
**Texas**¬†is¬†being sued¬†by a Big Tech lobby group over the state's new law that will require app stores like Google Play and Apple App Store to verify users' ages and impose restrictions on users under 18. The group claims that the Texas App Store Accountability Act imposes a ‚Äúbroad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps,‚Äù and that it is a ‚Äúmisguided attempt to protect minors‚Äù that violates the First Amendment by imposing a ‚Äúsweeping age-verification, parental consent, and compelled speech regime on both app stores and app developers.‚Äù The Texas law is scheduled to take effect on Jan 1, 2026, while similar laws enacted by Utah and Louisiana are set to be enforced in May and July respectively.
___
**Squarespace**¬†released¬†a three part campaign designed to position the platform as the ultimate tool for bold self-starters hoping to turn their passion into a profession, building on its Change Your World series that came out last year. One spot features a woman launching a skydiving school mid-freefall, another follows an office goth transforming her coworkers into leather-clad disciples, and a third shows a calm guru gliding through city chaos to a peaceful mountain field. Each spot is paired with a matching custom website template to demonstrate that every business can have its own unique style with Squarespace.
___
**Zalando**¬†launched¬†a dedicated online store in Portugal and began selling beauty products like skincare and perfumes in Spain, marking its first international expansion since 2022. The new Zalando-pt site offers 200,000 fashion and sports items and introduces AI-driven tools like Trend Spotter to personalize shopping. With the addition of Portugal, Zalando now operates in 26 countries, with Greece and Bulgaria launches planned by year-end.
___
**Just under half of online shoppers**¬†in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.¬†have shopped¬†at Temu or Shein this year, which is roughly the same amount to reported shopping on the platforms last year too, meaning their growth in Europe has slowed down, according to the latest Amazon Shopper Report 2025 by Remazing. Both Temu and Shein invested heavily in awareness campaigns this past year, which resulted in brand awareness of 96% and 93% respectively, however, only around 45% and 49% of users actually bought something from the platforms. That's surprising, given how much effort both platforms have put into gaining market share in Europe this past year as the U.S. market became more difficult for them due to tariffs and the de minimis exemption coming to an end.
___
**Singapore**¬†is¬†planning to create¬†a new Online Safety Commission that has the authority to block what it considers to be harmful content on TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. The government says that the move is in response to a rising tide of AI-driven threats, including deepfakes, cyber scams, and online bullying, and gives victims a direct route to demand action from platforms. Platforms and individuals that fail to comply could face fines up to SG$500,000 and jail time, with the agency set to launch by mid-2026. Singapore laws are no joke! You can go to jail for chewing gum, accessing another person's WiFi network without permission, feeding pigeons, or being racist.¬†
___
**Alibaba VP Kaifu Zhang**¬†said¬†that the company's investment in AI has reached break-even levels within its e-commerce business, meaning that its AI systems powering product recommendations, merchant tools, and logistics in Taobao and Tmall are now generating enough returns to offset development costs. The company has pledged to invest $53B over three years in AI and cloud infrastructure, deploying tools that personalize search results and improve virtual try-ons across its e-commerce platforms, which are its largest source of revenue.
___
**The FDA**¬†seized the funds¬†of Colorado couple Alan Carver and his wife for continuing to sell their unapproved anti-choking device, the Dechoker, after being ordered to stop in 2022, earning $8.2M in revenue through Amazon and their own site. The device was marketed as FDA-approved even though it was never cleared for sale and allegedly caused injuries in lab tests and consumer complaints. Amazon has since removed the Dechoker and similar devices from its marketplace, citing its rules that all medical devices sold on its platform must have proper FDA authorization. Carver¬†published a response¬†on his website stating that the FDA case was a civil matter that has been fully settled and closed, disputing Forbes‚Äô claim that he made $8.2M from sales and insisting that Dechoker has never turned a true profit. He said the company is now working closely with the FDA on a new application, continues to manufacture in Mexico and sell globally, and remains confident that U.S. approval will be granted soon.
___
**üèÜ This week's most ridiculous story‚Ä¶**¬†PayPal's blockchain partner, Paxos, mistakenly¬†minted $300 trillion¬†worth of the company's stablecoin on Wednesday in what the company called a ‚Äútechnical error.‚Äù Yeah, no shit! Paxos says it accidentally minted the stablecoins as part of an internal transfer, but immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD about 20 minutes after it happened. ‚ÄúOops, I added a couple extra zeros!‚Äù For a frame of reference, backing $300 trillion worth of PYUSD would require more than double the world's estimated total GDP.
___
Plus 18 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **PayPay**, the Japanese mobile payments platform owned by SoftBank, preparing to go public in the U.S. with an IPO that could value the company at more than $20B.

1obnxef,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1obnxef/baystate_marathon/,Baystate Marathon,"Thanks to all of you here,your input and encouragement kept me going.

Here is my experience hopefully this helps and I see you out there on the next one:

Long post, please bear with me.

Age: 37

Weekly miles : 18 miles(that's the max I could accommodate but planning to increase for next marathon in April)
Longest runs : 19 and 21 miles a month before marathon
Marathon finish time : 4:50,my quads cramped out at mile 18,I was hoping to finish around 4:00

Training: 
1. I have been strength training for quite a long time so that helped

2. Did not train for my quads enough,which slowed me down for last 6 miles,I focused a lot more on glutes, calves,feet and ankle

3. I don't have a trademill so I always run outside and that really helped

4. I followed Garmin coach plan a bit but mostly trained based on the feeling for the day and time availability

5. Made sure I made up for missed runs with long run over the weekend(13 to 14 miles) and that's how I maintained weekly avg miles to 20 miles

6. Trained my stomach to basically take anything as a fuel : figs,dates,gummy bears, different types of gels, basically whatever I could carry easily(make sure you are not out of breath when eating something solid or you will end up sollowing)

7.Carried about 1200 ml for water for all long runs,this gave me an advantage coz on race day I didn't have to carry anything other then gels and electrolyte tablets

Race day:
1. 5:30 AM : 900 ML of water empty stomach(I do this everyday),trip to the toilet,2 Avacado Sourdough toast for breakfast, coffee on the way to marathon

2. 6:00 AM : nothing new for dress up, wear with what you have trained i.e. same tshirt,shorts,shocks, running shoes(Hoka Clifton 10),lot of body glide(thigs,chest,under arms,feet),gels(vinella bean Gu as this is what race was also providing)

3. 7:10 AM:  Parked .5 miles away from race line,fast walked to race line,and all the way to toilet queue and warmed up while waiting in queue(30 mins wait)

4. 8:00 AM : time to go,I was somewhere in the middle of pack.

5. Started strong: drank water,and whatever else they 
Providing (lemon Gatorade) every 1.5 miles,took gels every 20 mins(something it felt like throwing up due to too much sugar but I had to)

6.It was a beautiful day(but only for coffee and sitting outside): Sun was overhead for 26 miles with hardly any shade

7: Mile 18 : the cramp: everything just stops and suddenly the legs don't move,heart beat was balanced at about 165,I didn't feel dehydrated or out energy

8 : Mile 18 to 26 : Walk-Stretch-Run combo starts : I stopped at water stops hydrated more, stretched and ran and walked

9:Mile 26 : Best feeling in world,there are people cheering for you,it's a mental battle with yourself which you just conquered(btw mile 25 and 26 I was able run, please please please splash some water on your face,put those glasses back on,wipe your sweat, adjust your clothes for that final picture at the finish line :)

Post race: Eat, Hydrate, Walk,take pictures,the first one is always difficult the next ones will be easier and next one will not be as fun as first one:

Learning:

Training,fuel and hydration:
1.Run outside and in full sun,this will test you

2. Strength train more : I think this is what has saved me from mile 18 to 26

3. Stretch a lot and it feels good too

4. Follow a marathon plan if you can,I couldn't coz I prefer to plan myself but it takes lot of planning

5. HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE: it's never enough,hydrate even when you don't feel like(practice to drink on the run when you are out of breath)

6. Understand your pain points,pay attention to your body and it will tell what you need to work on

Clothing and accessories:
1.  Every accessory you are wearing is a weight so choose carefully.(Watch,Cap, glasses, compression gear,water jacket,carry on water bottle etc)

3. Invest in good shoes(please try them on make sure it's wide enough for your feet), keep it simple for first marathon do not complicate(I planning to expand my shoes for next marathon in April)

4. Buy a good sports watch if you can, doesn't have to expensive one (I use Fenix 8)

Bonus learning:

1. Start slower on race day example: if you can run at 9 pace start at 10

2. Visualize: for last 6 miles I visualized my run back to home, visualize what would feel like to finish it and share it with people who care about you

3. Last 6 miles is mental battle, train yourself: you will learn to run in pain and you will know when to stop

4. Train yourself to accommodate to change: you might have to run in different shoes, clothes,it might be raining on race day etc,you might have to take different gel/food, remember is more mental then physical.

I don‚Äôt know what exactly it is I‚Äôm looking for, other than stories and solidarity. Good marriages gone downhill; struggling marriages that came together. Post-divorce happiness, pre-divorce acceptance, on-the-brink that became better than you could have ever imagined. Mixed-faith marriages with hidden coffee cups thrown out at work; both of you now out and wining-and-dining on the weekends. Poly, same-sex, open. Any and all of it. 

We‚Äôve had so many hard, open conversations these past few months. Conversations we never would have had with this kind of openness while still TBM. We met at BYU, dated for 2 years, have been married for 16, 3 kids together. I finished college and became a working mom on a set career path before going STAHM to support my husband in his. 

Leaving the church has coincided with it being my turn to reenter the workforce and tossing our traditional gender roles into chaos. Leaving the church has thrown off the filtered glasses with how we each viewed our relationship. Leaving the church has cut open every heartache and pain we‚Äôve ever experienced within our marriage and some days, I am just fucking bleeding out. 

I‚Äôve been on and off this sub for a while. Deleted an entire profile when I felt I no longer needed the support. Came back when I realized that this type of sorrow, it comes in waves. Decided to stay largely for the relationship posts, because I saw pieces of what we were experiencing through the lens of so many others, and those small glimpses of, ‚ÄúGod, me too,‚Äù is such a lifeline during this time. 

So, friends. Not asking for anything specific. Just snippets, perhaps novels, of whatever you‚Äôd like to share in any capacity regarding your own relationships, related or not to the small portions of my own provided. 

(To note: We‚Äôve both been seeing individual [Nevermo] therapists for several years as well as participated in couples therapy with a third. We live far outside Morridor, families are TBM but have been generally kind over our leaving, and even though we do not live close to either parents or siblings, our community and social circles have both TBM and Nevermo influences that have been very supportive of our religious journey out.)",3,1760980378.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

Urgent citation from the local court, fluorescent lights buzzing in my head, coffee going sour in my mouth. Apparently I‚Äôm being sued for defamation because of a one star review I left on Google. My stomach dropped so hard I had to sit on the edge of the bed and stare at the floor. It felt unreal, like the kind of problem adults have and I‚Äôm just pretending to be one.

My shop is in a shared building. For months we‚Äôve had water dripping through the ceiling, mildew smell you can‚Äôt Febreze away, ruined boxes, customers stepping around buckets. We called and called. They kept saying the insurance was on it. Nothing changed. I finally posted a bad review from a secondary account, no names, just what happened in my unit and why I gave one star. They didn‚Äôt even bother finding my home address, they sent the summons to my job like a threat. They want 300 euros, a written apology, and for me to delete it. My lawyer says they‚Äôd have to prove the account is me and that what I wrote is more than an opinion. He told me not to touch the review. My phone shows 12 unread WhatsApps from neighbors, Spotify is still frozen at 2:13, and I can‚Äôt think straight.

AITA for going public after months of being ignored, or for refusing to delete it now that they‚Äôre squeezing me, or am I just getting bullied into shutting up about a leak that‚Äôs still dripping on my counter while I mop and lose money?

1obnv08,https://i.redd.it/12hhvnf9uawf1,Tootie & Co.,"I started my shop to celebrate my daughter Eliana - our little Chromie Cutie. She‚Äôs the heart behind everything I create. My goal is to build something that spreads awareness, inclusion, and joy for families like ours.

Since I‚Äôm just starting out, I don‚Äôt have the budget yet to hire photographers or models, so I use AI-generated images to create mockups that show what my designs would look like on real people and products. Every product itself is 100% real - printed and shipped through trusted fulfillment partners.

I completely understand why AI images can make people pause, and I want to be open about how and why I use them. It‚Äôs just one of the tools helping me share these ideas until I can invest in professional photography.

I‚Äôm a 21M university student, and I‚Äôve developed a crush on my classmate.( I know her since last year) The thing is, our conversations are always about studying. I‚Äôm also working while studying, so I don‚Äôt go to class that often ‚Äî which means I don‚Äôt really get to see her in person much.

Whenever I ask her about something related to our classes, she‚Äôs always kind and helpful. She responds nicely and seems genuinely nice overall. The problem is, I have no idea if she has a boyfriend or not(tbh i don't want to approach a girl that has a bf or make problems for her) She never posts anything on social media and keeps her personal life pretty private.

I‚Äôd really like to get to know her better, maybe move things a bit beyond just study talk ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt want it to come off as weird or make things awkward between us since our only connection right now is academic

Do you think it would be too forward to ask her out for coffee or dinner, maybe as a way to ‚Äústudy together‚Äù or go over some topics? Or would that sound too obvious? I just want to make a natural move without ruining the friendly vibe we already have.

Any advice lfrom both guys and girls would really help!",1,1760980178.0,Tunisia,0,0.99,False

On the same day I made an appointment online because I wanted to show the Apple Watch's ECG, the cardiologist had great reviews on Google and said that it looked like a lot of extra systole with a trigeminy pattern, he found the P waves, but as I had more than 20 extra systoles in 30 seconds, the Apple Watch showed afib. 1 day before this episode I had slept very poorly due to an important test that I was anxious about, I had also drunk coffee (which speeds me up). I paid for the qualy app to get another opinion, trigeminism too, but I'm still no less anxious.

I was excited, we have been fighting a lot (i have been fighting a lot) to the point where we were sleeping in different rooms for three months. I thought this would be a 'rekindle our marriage' type of trip, especially because we had finally been talking again and were even intimate a few times. Things were looking up. The drive was 4 hours away and I was excited. When I realized where we were going u was a little less excited because we had been there before many times, but still I was game we had spent many anniversaries in the Shannendoah Valley and they were all good, and this time I didnt have to do the planning I just got in the car. We arrived the hotel was clean and we got a good night sleep for a long drive up Skyline drive. I was excited, ready for the fall colors, holding hands and sharing memories. We didnt hold hands much, he held my hand a few times but when I reached in he would pull a way. He's never been very lovey dovey It would have been nice but he had a packed lunch and was well prepared for the drive, no complaints. 
When we get to the next hotel it is a hotel we had been to before and swore we would never again. But he got confused, there weren't many available rooms because of the season and he gave me the run down of reasons. Not an place inviting romance but we have stayed in worse. But now im getting a little down, because I thought this was planned out not last minute but fine we'll go to dinner. Where? He doesnt know it's my choice. A little annoyed I narrow it down to three. I give him the three choices and he picks one. Dinner is quiet but delicious i order a bannana cheese cake to go. He orders one as well. We get back to the room and I am trying to initiate some nookie he is hungry so we try the cheesecake instead. By this time it's 10pm the cake is really sweet. I take a bite and tell him it's too rich I dont want anymore. He finishes his slice we do a quickie and I go to sleep. Not ideal but we are both tired it was a long day.

I wake up get some coffee and have every intention on eating my slice for breakfast but I can't find it. There is an empty box and a box with one bite. I feel like im going nuts searching this tiny fridge. 
He said 'it's right there' with a chuckle. I'm getting mad at this point because he's grining and I just want my cake. He says 'no, it's there i got hungry last night and ate the other one but the one we started last night is still there.'

It was there, one bite left, not even a full bite. 

My heart sank. I was done pretending im OK with crumbs. The crumbs in that empty to go box felt in that moment like a symbol for what I get out of this marriage, his crumbs.

 After caring for this man, being his maid, mother, and sex object for 25 years, raising his kids, caring for his home, his finances, making his freaking doctor's appointments and I can't even have my freaking anniversay cake. Like with everything in our life i do the heavy lifting and get whats left. I have thanked him for giving me crumbs our entire marriage.

As I told him I deserve someone who will not only not eat my cake but will protect it and keep anyone else from eating my cake. And I am done being great full for crumbs.

Am I the ahole?

I used to work at an amazing job with a close-knit group of friends. There were four of us who regularly hung out. I‚Äôll call the other girl P, and the two guys A and B.

P got engaged to my fianc√©‚Äôs close friend. She worked the same shift as A, while I worked with B. On weekends, all four of us worked together. B and I started noticing that P and A were very flirty with each other. P even referred to them as ‚ÄúPam and Jim‚Äù from The Office, which rubbed me the wrong way since she was engaged to my fianc√©‚Äôs friend.

Over the course of a year, P tried to keep the flirting secret. She would beg me not to tell anyone about the ‚Äúdrama.‚Äù I kept my promise and didn‚Äôt even tell my fianc√© for an entire year. I wanted to believe it was just rumors since I didn‚Äôt have proof. The only person I talked to about it was B, because he would hear things directly from A and share them with me.

Eventually, I left that job to start my career, but we all stayed friends. One day, I was invited to an award-ceremony lunch and went with B. That‚Äôs when he told me everything. He said P had been sending nudes to A and talking about wanting to sleep with someone else before getting married.

I saw red. I had agreed to help P with a wedding craft, but after hearing that, I told my fianc√© to return it to her and said I wouldn‚Äôt be helping anymore. He still didn‚Äôt know what was going on. P texted me asking why, and I didn‚Äôt respond until I got home. I explained everything to my fianc√© and asked his advice on how to handle it.

P ended up telling her fianc√© that I was bullying her and spreading lies. There was a lot of back-and-forth, but I only addressed things with her directly. She chose to involve her fianc√© and mother-in-law, and the conversation that followed made me realize how skilled she was at lying.

I believe I did the right thing. The truth came out not because I told anyone, but because P did. I also felt I was respecting my fianc√©‚Äôs friend group by following his advice. They went ahead with the wedding, and honestly, I‚Äôm happy for them. They are adults who can make their own choices.

Here‚Äôs where things got messy.

Let‚Äôs call P‚Äôs fianc√© C and his brother D. D is actually even closer to my fianc√© than C is, they all grew up together. D‚Äôs fianc√©e eventually found out about everything and started being rude to me every chance she got. Soon, all the women in my fianc√©‚Äôs friend group began ignoring me and icing me out of conversations.

A year later, it was summer, and I was still seeing these people three times a week. The way they treated me made me cry every time I got home. My fianc√© seemed annoyed with me for feeling this way, which made it even harder.

Then came the night of our engagement party. One of my girlfriends noticed D‚Äôs fianc√©e rolling her eyes every time I spoke. I decided to pull her aside and ask if we had a problem. She said no, so I asked why she had been treating me so badly for the past year. She stuttered and denied there was any issue. I said ‚ÄúGreat, let‚Äôs head back to the table,‚Äù and left it at that.

Later, I told my fianc√© I was proud of myself for standing up for me and hoped that maybe a little confrontation would reset the dynamic. What I didn‚Äôt know was that my fianc√© had immediately messaged D to apologize for my behavior and said I was drunk and didn‚Äôt mean it. I wasn‚Äôt drunk at all. I was hosting the party and wanted everything to run smoothly‚Äîand I absolutely meant what I said.

That message started a huge fight between us, our first in four years together. My fianc√© told me D had reached out to say I upset his fianc√©e, but when I asked to see the messages, I found out my fianc√© had actually messaged D first, then deleted the texts to hide it. We recovered the conversation, and I felt completely betrayed. He didn‚Äôt have my back, lied to me about what happened, and tried to cover it up.

We had a serious talk about trust and support, and he promised to do better. He later had coffee with D to get to the bottom of things, and that‚Äôs when we finally learned why D‚Äôs fianc√©e had been so mean to me.

After that, I drew a line and told my fianc√© that until I can trust he‚Äôll have my back, I won‚Äôt be spending time with that group.

The problem is his friends are so close that even their parents are friends. It‚Äôs impossible to fully avoid them. I know I‚Äôll have to see them again, and I need to figure out how to be around them without feeling miserable or isolated.

I live in Beaverdale, I work in Beaverdale, and I love this neighborhood. But lately, I‚Äôve been dreaming about bringing a little more life and excitement to our downtown.

We‚Äôve got so many great staples ‚Äî restaurants, bars, a coffee shop, record store, bookstore, bike shop, yoga studios, hardware store, chiropractor, pediatrician, tattoo shop, barbers, UPS store, and a chocolate shop ‚Äî all so practical and close by. I use and appreciate them all! But sometimes I find myself wishing for the same spark I‚Äôve seen growing in Union Park lately.

I recently spent an afternoon there with a friend and my kiddo ‚Äî we started with coffee, wandered through the vintage shops, browsed the bookstore and plant shop, then wrapped up our day with burgers at Lachelle‚Äôs. It felt like the perfect blend of being a tourist and a local at the same time. People were out exploring, shopping, and supporting their neighbors‚Äô businesses ‚Äî it was electric.

I know Beaverdalians take so much pride in our community, and we love to support local businesses. We have the spirit ‚Äî I just think we need more opportunities and events to channel it. Fall Fest is amazing, but imagine having more things like that year-round!

Right now, for most, popping downtown looks like, grabbing a part from ACE, dropping a child off at taekwondo, maybe grab a pizza, or something from Fareway and head home. But I dream of a downtown that‚Äôs more than a place to run errands ‚Äî a place we go just to connect. A little more of that European feel, where you stroll, linger, and run into familiar faces. (All of which can and does happen without some huge costly change)

I‚Äôd love to see more neighbors out walking, getting involved, and making Beaverdale feel vibrant again. As a young mom without grandparents nearby, I also crave more intergenerational connection. I grew up spending a lot of time with my grandparents and know how meaningful those relationships can be. We have so many kind, wise, older folks here who could play a huge role in supporting young families ‚Äî kind of a ‚ÄúBig Brother/Big Sister‚Äù meets ‚Äúwise woman matriarch‚Äù vibe. There‚Äôs so much we can learn from each other!

If I ever started a business here, it would be something like a community social club ‚Äî a welcoming space where people truly connect. During the day, it could be a play space and coffee spot for parents and kids (think Juju‚Äôs on 42nd or Imagination Street in Ankeny). Then in the evenings, it could shift toward adults: live acoustic music, improv or comedy nights, art classes, date-night cooking demos, even workshops on skills that are fading away ‚Äî like canning, sewing, or lace making.
(Think Des Moines social club before covid took it out)
I just want to see a space where people connect with people. Any positive change we want to see in the world starts by getting to know our neighbors ‚Äî by building love and support right here in our own village.

What do you think, Beaverdale? Would anyone else love to see something like this take shape?",0,1760980076.0,desmoines,2,0.5,False

First we can ask what is a fetish. In this sense, fetish is something we imbue with meaning or feelings to cover over a lack, loss, or absence. It is a problem because it stops us from feeling the need to integrate the lack into our lives. So when Teach says porn is the opposite of a fetish, we have to be careful. Opposite with respect to what? There is still a lack, but in this case the lack is not covered over by porn, it is amplified. But why would we ever want that? how could that be a defensive strategy? Don't we want to remove the lack or integrate it so we don't feel it as a lack? Yes---which is why we feel compelled to return to the producer of porn. It's important here that it is \*someone else's\* fantasy/idea/image. We can't obtain it. A fetish is a defense against change, but at least it's concentrated and generated internally. You can get your hands on it, literally or metaphorically. Porn, since it isn't internally generated, cannot persist beyond the original source, to which we continually return, because when we stop consuming it we feel the lack. 

For me I think the slutty nurse example really finally drove it home. In S,P, he points out that the boyfriend NEVER has the slutty nurse he wanted. Because it doesn't exist in reality, it's porn. When he gets to know his girlfriend, she's never embodying this impossible image, she's either being slutty, or a nurse, or worse neither and drinking coffee at the breakfast table, annoyingly. He can only get it from the original source, which is fake. 

For a fetish, you also can't get it, because e.g. the idol is not the god. The lack is still there, just like with porn. The difference is that you can continue to defend against integrating your lack with a fetish by continuing to imbue it with the meaning you wanted. With porn the only defense is to continue to go the creator of the porn object. 

It's not the opposite in the sense that one is a lack and one isn't. It's the opposite in the sense that 1) one is internally generated and one is externally generated 2) one defends the lack and the other exposes it, resulting in the sensation that 3) the fetishist thinks there is no lack while the porn consumer knows there is a lack and ""knows"" it can go back to the source to satisfy it. Both are maladaptive strategies for managing a lack, so they are not opposites in that sense. ",1,1760979837.0,thelastpsychiatrist,0,1.0,False

Of course it is way too early to seriously date. But I was honest to her upfront, telling her I'm freshly single and she still wanted to go on the date. It was amazing, we had a good vibe going, laughed a lot and shared lots of interests, that my Ex never did. We also only left it at getting a coffee together. That was enough - just knowing that other women are interesting to me, and apparently also interested in me, is a huge confidence booster.

Made worse with alcohol, Marijuana and coffee. Married 43 years. I reached out to his MD for help. They can not speak to me because I am not listed on his health forms. Our daughter is. I did explain whats happening with him. He conflates everything. He is verbally abusive even with our neighbors. Thinks hes in charge of what others are doing on their property. His father had electric shock therapy when my husband was around 8, died from heart attack when he was 10 then his mother got early onset alzheimers and passed a year before I met him. I told his office all of this and they said the dr would know what to do. They did do cognitive test at a center which he says he passed spectacularly. He recently had rotator cuff surgery and they put him on gabapentin which has made him so much worse! He decided on day two he would do all his care, meals, medicines. Demanded i reconnect his sling, i stood looking at it, 6 am and reached for a strap to see what was up, he screamed he would drive himself to hospital, turned to storm off and it, the strap, still in my hand was the ice pack, it slid right off. That made him even madder, at me. I literally can not leave here. No money only my s.s payments, house is paid off. I might have an inheritance eventually but I am stuck. I told him I am worried about his mental health. He thinks its me, not him. Thought at one point he was a malignant narcissist. I just need him medicated to make him docile. No idea how to get help without him knowing. He does have guns.

My medications, anything he deems mine. I am an introvert with abuse in my childhood, he knew this. Says we have nothing in common because I dont like onions, green peppers and garlic. He is always serious about this stuff. Never has apologized for anything. I have talked to my daughter twice about her being next of kin. I hate to push her, she is 34, single with a good bf.

\----------------------------

Hey all,

I've been solo traveling for the past year, and I figured I'd pop on here with some miscellaneous thoughts and brief summaries/rankings of the places I've been. I wasn't very well-traveled before this expedition (and had never solo traveled previously) so most things I was experiencing for the first time.

**Czech Republic > Austria > Slovakia > Hungary > Slovenia > Italy > Croatia > Bosnia > Serbia > Macedonia > Kosovo > Albania > Turkiye > Georgia > Armenia**

# MISC. THOUGHTS

*English*

I can't believe how many people in how many places speak fluent English. It's a bit sad, actually, as I was hoping for more of a complete immersion in each place, but it did make everything very easy to navigate. In most of the countries I went to, there was a hard age divide wherein most people under 30 spoke fluent English, whereas older generations usually didn't (and if older generations spoke a second language, it was usually Italian, Russian, or German).

I began this trip think I'd have to learn a little of the local language, and that it would be rude and presumptuous of me to expect locals across various countries to speak what is my native language, but what I realized quickly is that English is taught in public schools from an early age as the predominant lingua franca, and it's often taken as more offensive to presume that someone¬†*doesn't*¬†speak English. Many times I'd ask if someone spoke English and I received an ""yes of course"" with the tone of ""*do you think I'm uneducated?*"" and many times if I started a conversation speaking in English and the other person didn't speak English, they'd act apologetic and embarrassed. I'm not quite sure what to think of this, but it wasn't what I was expecting and I found it interesting.

Also when I ask if they speak English, too many Europeans reply, ""eh only a little"" and then continue to hold entire conversations in fluent English. Meanwhile I'd started unnecessarily incorporating hand gestures and using simple words because they said they said they could only speak a little. The modesty is misleading.

*Cash*

Getting appropriate cash in each country was the most logistically difficult part of my trip. First, you have to find an ATM/bankomat that even works with a foreign card (some countries are better than others, but in Armenia for instance, I had to try like 10 ATMs throughout the city before I found one that worked for me). Then the ATM spits out large bills, and businesses don't have change! In half the countries I went to, even places like museums or groceries or restaurants couldn't give minimal change for bills. Albania was especially bad for this. If you don't have small coins, your cash is useless almost everywhere. And most banks wouldn't break bills for me because I wasn't a member. It was like pulling teeth to get cash and use it in several Balkan countries.

*Tipping*

I know tipping isn't obligatory overseas but I can't help but tip. I feel like if I tip in my own economically prosperous country to service staff who are doing pretty ok financially, why wouldn't I tip as a guest in someone else's country that has more economic struggles? I also feel really weird leaving coins for a tip even though I know they have the intended monetary value. It's a mental barrier--in the US, our coins are so low-value that leaving any sort of coin on the table even overseas feels wrong and I can't help but feel a weird pang of guilt each time.

*Public Transit*

This varied wildly by country. Central Europe was great. Turkey was great. Ex-Yugo countries and the caucuses were a mixed bag. Flixbus was the most reliable carrier in my experience but even then, it's dependent on the attitude of the driver. Amenities like bathrooms and Wifi will be listed online, but the driver often keeps the bathrooms locked so as not to be bothered to have to clean them, and the wifi has never once worked for me. Drivers often speed like crazy just to be done work earlier, and then you arrive in your destination hours earlier than stated on the ticket. My overnight bus was scheduled to arrive in Split at 10AM and so I had arranged an early check-in at my airbnb, but the driver sped so fast the entire journey that I arrived at 4AM and had to sit in a park with my luggage for hours. On the flip side, in Ljubljana, my Itabus to Trieste just didn't show up one day, and after hours of waiting, the station attendant very dismissively told me, ""Yeah they do that. You'll have to figure something else out.¬†*NEXT!*""

Any region that relies on privately-operated minibuses (furgone / marshrutkas / dolmus) is inherently even more difficult to navigate -- these minibuses gather in unmarked lots that can't be found except by asking locals, and they operate with no set schedules, no marked prices, and often supplementing their income by carrying cargo loads as well as passengers. You go to the lot, look for a minivan with a sign in the window for your destination city, get on and wait however long you have to until it fills up with passengers, and then it departs. There are multiple stops along the way that are unmarked and unannounced but regulars just¬†*know*¬†as part of the system. You never know where in the destination city it will drop you off. The whole thing is an exercise in adventure. My marshrutka between Tbilisi and Yerevan hauled two industrial-sized propane tanks in the trunk and piled passenger luggage on top of them. In Gyumri, the marshrutkas didn't run on Thursdays for some reason, and so I was forced to stay in town a day longer than planned. In Pogradec, the furgon lot was a mile outside of downtown up a dirt road and was impossible to find unless you lived locally and just knew. It doesn't help that Albania has no fixed address system either, and so I had to ask local children every block which way to turn next to get there. It made for one hell of an experience. But they're dirt cheap, and they're everywhere.

  
*Safety* 

Truthfully I don't ever fret much about safety anyway as I grew up in some rough parts and know how to handle myself, but I think I just never realized that there were parts of the world that were *this* comprehensively safe. Women walking alone after dark everywhere, children playing in the street as late as like 10PM, drivers paying mind to their surroundings and yielding to pedestrians, police being friendly... it really juxtaposed vast swathes of America for me. I love the sense of community and the trust in neighbors that exists throughout this part of the world, and I'm in awe of such peaceable cities. 

*Walking*

I fucking love walking. I grew up in NYC and then have spent the past 20 years in the car-dependent American South, and I've so missed getting places on foot. I walked 10+ miles per day every day for 9 months of traveling and I lost over 30 pounds from that alone. I love it. And I think that the mayhem of the sidewalks in this part of the world--uneven cobblestones, cars parked on the sidewalks, open construction zones, giant cliffs in the sidewalk for staircases down to rathskellers, etc--force attention by pedestrians. Everyone everywhere had an iPhone, but I never saw anybody walking and scrolling or driving and scrolling as is commonplace in America.

# CITIES

Ok, let's rank some destinations:

**Prague, Czech Republic: 9/10**

Prague is the most comprehensively beautiful city I've ever been to. I know there are run-down, Khrushchevka-style neighborhoods surrounding the downtown, but the historic, preserved downtown was HUGE in a way that is very uncommon for post-WWII Europe. It was fascinating. The architecture was incredible, the people were kind, there were plenty of cool, cheap, local cafes and restaurants and bars even despite the massive tourist presence, the food was good, the beer was great, the streets were easily navigable, there were plenty of public green spaces, there was good public transit, and the city just felt immensely livable. The only (and I mean only) downside was the suffocating amount of tourists everywhere, but how can there not be for a city this great?

**Kutna Hora, Czech Republic: 8/10**

This was a day trip from Prague for me, and more of a town than a city, but I wanted to include it. It's extremely beautiful, chock full of amazing historic points of interest, full of great antique stores and local cafes and restaurants with some of the best food I had over the entire year, walkable, kind, and lovely. There's the ""Bone Church"" Sedlec Ossuary, St. Barbara's Church (which was the single most beautiful church I visited on my entire trip), Cathedral of the Assumption, a salt mine, and several more worthwhile points of interest. This is a very down-to-earth and local town, and I loved every minute I was there.

**Vienna, Austria: 4/10**

This may be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't care much for Vienna. I found it to be sort of dull, with a geriatric populace that came across as pretty cold and rigid. There is some beautiful architecture, but set against the grey utilitarian streets, it was a gap-toothed sort of beauty that served just as much to highlight the ugliness of their immediate surroundings. I couldn't find good, inexpensive food here. There were some worthwhile attractions (I especially loved the Hapsburg crypt) but that was the only redeeming thing I found about the city, and it wasn't enough. There was just no enthralling character there for me. I spent just over a week in Vienna before cutting my trip short and instead going to:

**Bratislava, Slovakia: 7/10**

Maybe this is where you realize that I'm judging by my own standards, and those standards are somewhat unorthodox. I left Vienna earlier than planned and moved over to Bratislava instead, and had a¬†*fantastic*¬†time here. The architecture is beautiful but weathered and unmaintained (similar to Budapest) which gives it a sense of cohesion to the street and to the city as a whole. The populace skews young and artsy, and there are street musicians and buskers and street food vendors and residents hanging outside in parks and public squares. I found some great cafes and bars here, full of character and inexpensive as hell. Bratislava Rolls are up there with the best baked goods that I've had on my entire trip. I went to some great museums ranging from historical to contemporary art. My first night there, there was a free and public rock concert in the town square. There were DIY artist workshops and public skate parks and a real sense of community. It was everything that Vienna was not.

**Budapest, Hungary: 8/10**

Great city with cool architecture, easily navigable streets, good food, a young and artsy populace, and great cafes and restaurants. These are the main things I want in a city, and I found them all here. There were several cool attractions too--the castle district, the ruin bars, the bathhouses, the cave church, Jozsefvaros Market... Budapest felt familiar enough for me to be comfortable in and yet unique enough to have a compelling sense of place. And the baked goods here were¬†*the*¬†best I had on my entire trip. I would move here if I could--this seems like a city I could live in long-term.

**Ljubljana, Slovenia: 5/10**

Not bad but overrated, in my opinion. It's small, a bit reserved, \*very\* over-touristed, not inexpensive, and doesn't have that much to offer. The small historic downtown is pretty, but it doesn't span for than a few streets and it quickly falls into suburbia. There were nice parks. I didn't have any stellar food here, although I did get to eat horse for the first time. The other tourists I met were sort of disappointed, too, after hearing so much hype over the past few years about Ljubljana being the ""the next big thing"" or ""the undiscovered jewel"". It's not. What it is is a good base for exploring the surrounding nature of Slovenia. Also, it really does seem like a nice place for locals to live and start a family. I loved how many groups of schoolkids were lined up single-file on the street going on little field trips, or playing in public parks and on the playgrounds outside their schools. It gave me a whole new perspective and made me realize that when I get to the age of starting a family of my own, I want to raise my children in a place like this. I stayed in an outer-ring neighborhood and there was an overwhelming sense of community there, and even this 6-block neighborhood had all of the amenities one could want and just sort of felt like being in a Richard Spencer's ""Busytown"" drawing. I do love being able to step out of my front door and see all lined up a bakery and a BBQ restaurant and a clothing boutique and a post office and a church and a school and a cafe. But as a tourist, I won't be returning.

**Venice, Italy: 6.5/10**

I struggle rating this one. Venice is one of the coolest places I've ever been because it's such a unique city--the canals and the bridges and the buildings and the narrow footpaths... it's truly one-of-a-kind and an otherwordly experience upon arrival. Everyone should go. But it's also over-touristed and downright labyrinthine and spread thin on amenities. There were some great cafes and some very worthwhile attractions, but for some reason it just didn't entirely click with me. It's a place I'd recommend everyone visit at least once but it's never a place I could see myself living or staying in for an extended time. Granted, though, I only stayed on San Marco, and it's entirely possible that my perception would be different had I explored more of the mainland or some of the other islands.

**Zagreb, Croatia: 7/10**

I was only in Zagreb for a short time, but I got a really good vibe from the city. The demographic included a lot of young and artsy people, the people were friendly and welcoming and fun, there were beautiful neighborhoods and streets, everything was walkable and navigable and there seemed to be adequate public transportation, and there were some great restaurants and bars and cafes. People seemed happy. I got a good vibe.

**Split, Croatia: 9/10**

I absolutely LOVED my time in Split. I stayed for a month and I think it was the most peaceful month I've ever lived. The nature is incredible, and the vast array of public spaces to explore that nature was incredible. I found a small, secluded cove on the shoreline and spent every morning there watching the sun come up. There were several beaches, from crowded public spots to hidden and wooded local joints. The Marjan peninsula was was incredible in every way. Sustipan was a great place to relax with a book. Diocletian's Palace was full of nice little cafes and bars and restaurants. Grocery stores were everywhere. There were marketplaces and street vendors and fruit stands and everything one could want. Great food and great beer. Friendly, welcoming people. Such a good vibe. I can't wait to go back.

I will say, I went during shoulder season, and my last week there I saw all the cruise ships start to arrive and the tour groups start to take over the streets, so I would highly recommend visiting outside of June-July-August.

**Mostar, Bosnia: 7/10**

I really enjoyed my time in Mostar. It's small, and the historic part of town is basically a single road with a block or so on either side, but it's so charming and I loved the food and I loved the people and it has an incredible sense of place. Incredible architecture, great cafe scene, moving museums, fun antique stores... I wandered into the more lived-in part of the city and although it's more run-down, the positive vibe is still there and there are still great restaurants and bars and cafes all over. I loved having my days marked by the call to prayer. I loved hiking up the adjacent mountains. I loved the dramatic lighting of the city at night. It was a very alive, very unique place.

**Sarajevo, Bosnia: 7/10**

Sarajevo was bigger than Mostar but had just as much of a sense of place. The historic Old Town and the markets were vast and sprawling and like nowhere else I'd been. The neighborhoods were full of beautifully weathered buildings. The mosques and monuments were lovely. I loved the cafe scene and I had a found a few good restaurants. Outside of the Old Town, the city still seemed vibrant and loved by the people in it. Bosnia for the win.

**Subotica, Serbia: 6.75/10**

I'm breaking into a second decimal place here. I don't know that I can justify putting Subotica on equal footing with Sarajevo, but a 6 or even 6.5 feels too low. Subotica had beautiful Art Nouveau architecture and really friendly people and was walkable and vibrant and cozy all at the same time. I went to some beautifully ambient restaurants and cafes here, and I had a really good stay. And nearby Palic was equally as beautiful, if small. The synagogue in Subotica is probably the most uniquely beautiful building I've ever seen. I think if the city were the slightest bit bigger, it would have earned an 8. I really did love my short stay here.

**Belgrade, Serbia: 8.5/10**

I loved Belgrade. It was exactly what I was looking for in a Balkan city--young, vibrant, artsy, full of character and full of friendly people. And the most beautiful people I've ever seen, too, my god. Belgrade was the youngest and artsiest place on my trip so far--musicians and buskers in the street and jazz bands on restaurant patios and great playlists in the cafes and murals and art museums and just a youthful, creative spirit. I loved Magdalen Park and the churches throughout the city. The city was pretty in parts--not as wholly beautiful as Prague or Budapest--but immensely walkable and convenient and amenity-rich. Grocery shopping was easy, burek and coffee were always available from 24-hour joints, people were immensely friendly and welcoming and cool, (and, I can't stress this enough, ridiculously good-looking) and the city felt very safe and as family-oriented as it was hip. If I had to pick a single spot from this trip to move to, it would be Belgrade.

**Prishtine, Kosovo: 6.5/10**

Prishtine is pretty modern, which I appreciated, and was so different than any of the other cities I had been to up to this point. I stayed on the main pedestrian strip, which was full of restaurants and bars and cafes, and was absolutely packed shoulder-to-shoulder day and night, but especially at night. I don't know where so many people came from, honestly, but it was music festival-level crowded all the time. They had a cultural festival for a few days while I was in town with groups from all over the world in traditional costume doing traditional dances, and it was really fun. Grocery shopping and standard errands were really easy. Almost everyone spoke English. The main corridors didn't seem very Balkan at all. Outside the main tourist areas it became more Balkan, with fruit stands and street vendors and impromptu flea markets and the most bridal stores I've ever seen. I had a good time in Prishtine and I would go back, although there isn't much ""there"" there.

**Skopje, Macedonia: 4/10**

Sorry, Skopje. I know you've been through a lot and it is excessively evident in the overall vibe here. The neighborhoods are run-down and full of trash. The people look and act stressed and resigned. The bureaucracy and transit infrastructure are really bad. The police and the taxi drivers are corrupt. The old bazaar had great potential but was mostly shuttered. Everything is just so economically depressed. I went to a few museums, and they were half-empty abandoned-looking buildings with no working lights or air conditioning and no staff in sight--it was a bit of a dystopian experience, honestly. The Macedonian traditional costumes are the coolest in the world, though. Also, I actually sort of liked the insane amount of statues downtown (and fake pirate ships, and neo-classical facades), but I know that so much public money was funneled into these vanity projects. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did, but I found it really depressing.

**Ohrid, Macedonia: 8.5/10**

Ohrid was a totally different story. Beautiful scenery, beautiful architecture, full of culture and music and joy. It's a tourist hotspot, and you can tell by the restaurants and the shops and the prices, but it's probably my favorite tourist hotspot I've been to, and the reliance on tourism didn't spoil the beauty or experience of the city. Fantastic nature surrounding the quaint Old Town, the pedestrian boulevards and bazaars were fun, and even outside the Old Town into the non-touristic areas of the city seemed livable. Ohrid more than made up for Skopje.

**Pogradec, Albania: 5/10**

It was OK. There's a long seaside promenade with lots of little restaurants and some amusement park-style rides for kids, but that's about it. It seemed an odd mix of family-outing and a bro party vibe. The beach was nice. I liked Drilon park and the village of Tushemisht right next door. Outside of the promenade the city got pretty run-down looking fast.

**Korce, Albania: 4/10**

I really wanted to like Korce for personal reasons (and because I like the beer) and I think it has SO much potential, but it's economically depressed and that potential is entirely unrealized. It has large swathes of traditional Albanian architecture, and the old bazaar is the largest in the country, but 90% of it is shuttered post-covid. There are a handful of good restaurants and while there are cafes, they're more-or-less devoid of any discernible character (in true Albanian fashion, I hate to say--I love Albania but they don't embrace the arts). The people I met in Korce were sort of hostile, weirdly--this was my second time in Albania and I know how uncharacteristic that is for Albanians, which is why it jarred me a bit. The street dogs were hostile. The city was run-down. The monuments were unkempt. I only found one restaurant I liked. It was a bit of a shame.

**Gjirokaster, Albania: 7.5/10**

Gjirokaster turned it around. Beautiful, large Old Town with the most traditional Albanian architecture in the entire country. Friendly people, great customer service and warm hosting, accessible amenities and walkable streets, nice cafes and bars and restaurants and antique stores and convenience stores, a castle, scenic mountains, and plenty of interesting sights. I had a great time in Gjirokaster and would go back in a heartbeat.

**Vlore, Albania: 6.5/10**

I thought it was just OK. I'd heard so much about Vlore that I expected more, I guess. It's a seaside city and there are some nice beaches. The people were great. I liked the Old Town but it's only a few blocks wide. The residential neighborhood I stayed in was pretty dilapidated--dusty dirt roads lined with concrete walls and gates on each residence, and then run-down communist blocks with lots of street dogs. There were good restaurants, prices were low, people were friendly and welcoming, the sea was nice, Pylli i Sod√´s was peaceful, the Narta Lagoon was cool, the Old Town was quaint, and there is a promenade along the sea downtown. I liked it but it wasn't as cool as I'd been led to believe and it wasn't as cool as Gjirokaster and some of the other Albanian cities I visited.

**Tirana, Albania: 8/10**

I don't even really think I can pinpoint why, but I loved Tirana. This was actually my second visit. It's an immensely livable city with great density and tons of amenities and incredible food and friendly (and  beautiful) people and low prices and some attractions and the best urban park I visited on this whole trip. Tirana also has more cafes than I think anywhere in the world. I actually just can't even comprehend how a city can support this many cafes--without exaggeration, there are probably 3-5 cafes per block, every block, throughout the entire city. It's really something else. Also some of the best food I've had on this whole trip, and the best burek in the Balkans. I love Tirana.

**Kruje, Albania: 7/10**

This is a weekend destination and not anything more, but it's beautiful for what it is. The bazaar winding up to the castle is really cool. The castle is neat. The museums are great. The mountains are beautiful. There are There is good food and a nice cafe scene and the old neighborhood around Skanderbeg museum is really neat.

**Shkoder, Albania: 7.5/10**

I really liked Shkoder. It's at the base of the mountains, on a beautiful lake, and only a short drive from the seashore. It's a great base for Theth, and the city itself is full of pedestrianized streets and walkable neighborhoods and good food and very friendly people. It's not touristed at all, and I had a really peaceful week here.

**Durres, Albania: 7/10**

Durres gets shit on a lot, but I think I preferred it to Vlore. It's a port city, and so maybe the beaches can be a bit dirtier in parts, but the city itself is much denser and packed with more amenities and historic sites. The colosseum was a cool visit, and the surviving roman ruins surrounding it were neat additions to the backdrop of the city. The oceanfront promenade was beautiful--much more so than Vlore's. Cool markets. Very good food, very friendly people. I'd recommend Durres.

**Istanbul, Turkey: 9/10**

I fucking loved Istanbul. I'm from NYC originally, and Istanbul is essentially a Muslim New York. The markets were incredible, the transit was top-notch, the city was dense and walkable and livable, the food was good, the people were great, and the energy was electric. I'd move to Istanbul in a heartbeat if I could. It's chaotic, but there's still very much an order and mindfulness to it. I stayed in Kumkapi and loved the energy and grit there. Neighborhoods like Beyoglu and Kadikoy were very hip with cool art scenes and fun cafes. I'll absolutely be going back to Istanbul as much as possible.

**Ankara, Turkey: 7/10**

I got sick here and didn't get to explore as much as I wanted, but from the limited exploring I was able to do, I found a really cool Old Town around Haci Bayram, some really amazing museums, fantastic markets and bazaars, lovely cafes... this city is chock-full of amenities. At the same time, the area surrounding my hotel was pretty seedy and filled with neon-lit strip joints and a bit of a sketchy crowd at night, and several of the attractions I tried to go to were closed for construction or some other reason. All in all though, I'd love to go back and be able to explore this city more.

**Goreme (Cappadocia), Turkey: 9/10**

The town is incredibly touristy and overpriced, but the nature surrounding the small town is unlike anywhere else on earth--the ancient troglodyte cave dwellings of Sword Valley, the fairy chimneys of Love Valley, the frescoed cave churches of the Goreme Open Air Museum, the sunrise hot air balloons, the awesome tuff cave hotels in the town... the whole experience was otherworldly.

**Antalya, Turkey: 8/10**

My favorite seaside town of the trip. Antalya was beautiful--the ruins were beautiful, the beaches were beautiful, the parks and greenery were beautiful-- and walkable and energetic and kind and inexpensive. The food was great. I loved the cats everywhere.

**Tbilisi, Georgia: 8/10**

Tbilisi was really cool. The most artsy city I visited, bar none. Cafes and shops stuffed with original paintings, sidewalks lined with street vendors selling original paintings and beautiful traditional wares, musicians and karaoke singers in restaurants, pianists playing upright pianos on the sidewalk, great antique stores, good restaurants, beautiful monuments and public infrastructure, sulfur baths, churches and castles and statues and parks, and some of the best food I've eaten. I know I didn't wander far outside of the Old Town or the tourist districts, but from what I saw, Tbilisi was in a league above most cities, and in such a unique and artistic way. And the people were really friendly and cool everywhere I went.

**Batumi, Georgia: 3/10**

I sort of hated Batumi. It's a weird array of frat-bro style Russian tourists on dirty beaches, families on amusement park-style rides, and decrepit soviet blocks with insufficient sidewalks and incredibly congested and loud traffic. The city was hard to navigate, sparse on amenities, and had very few good restaurants or cafes that I could find. This wasn't my vibe at all.

**Kutaisi, Georgia: 7/10**

Kutaisi set it right again. Every bit as artsy as Tbilisi, with beautiful buildings and cool ruins and great historical sights and fun markets and cozy cafes... I only spent a couple days here, but I left with a great impression of the city and I'd love to go back. I know people from here are very proud of being from here, and now I see why.

**Gyumri, Armenia: 4/10**

I know Gyurmi is still reeling in the aftermath of a recent earthquake, and so I don't want to be too harsh, but the city wasn't a great destination for me. The roads were difficult to navigate, there weren't many points of interest and those that exist were fully- or partially- closed, and I didn't find any truly great food. I only stayed here for a few days, and I left a few days earlier than planned.

**Yerevan, Armenia: 8/10**

I really liked Yerevan. It seems like an immensely livable city. The city is dense and packed with amenities, the roads are easy to navigate, there are plenty of attractions spread throughout the city, the parks are nice, the cafe scene is very good, the food is good, the people are stunningly beautiful and very friendly, and it just had an overall very nice vibe. It's situated close to many other Armenian attractions like the Geghard Monastery and the Symphony of Stones/Garni Temple and Lake Sevan, and it's a good base for exploring the country as a whole. There's a metro system in the city and trains that run to nearby cities like Gyumri, Tbilisi, and Batumi. I really enjoyed my time in Yerevan.",1,1760979382.0,Balkans,0,1.0,False

1obnjr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1obnjr5/aitah_for_wanting_help_parenting_long_post/,AITAH for wanting help parenting?! Long post,"Good afternoon Reddit,
I have a long drawn out AITAH post for you- so hopefully you like reading & giving opinions/ advice.
I have some important backstory for you: I was in a small fender bender a little over a week ago & have since had a migraine. I‚Äôve been to the ER twice for it, the meds they called in cannot be mixed with my mood stabilizers. I decided to only skip my ‚Äúhappy pills‚Äù twice, because the migraine was SO BAD I could barely function. I have elementary aged children & rarely get to have a weekend with them due to split custody with their dad, so I wanted to spend my time with them instead of in bed. Another part of the back story, we have had a cold going around our house, everyone has had the ick. It started with me, 32F (teacher), I gave it to my 9F & 6F kids, then the last to get sick was my 32M fiance. I don‚Äôt remember what day he got sick, but it was maybe Wednesday or so last week. He‚Äôs off on Fridays, so he napped a lot on Friday. He cleaned up a bit around the house, which he does the bulk of & I‚Äôm very thankful for. 
Saturday, we slept in some, my girls played quietly & got themselves some muffins for breakfast. I had an appointment for some sidework that I do at a client‚Äôs home that shouldn‚Äôt take too long, but it was about a 30 minute drive one way. I had expected Fiance to watch the kids, I‚Äôm not sure if I communicated that or not, I‚Äôm almost certain I had‚Ä¶ Anyway, I had time before I left to eat my breakfast, drink my coffee & jump on my Switch to play my game for about 30 minutes before I got ready to leave. Then Fiance decides he‚Äôs going to leave for urgent care now. This was frustrating to me, because I hadn‚Äôt given myself time to get myself AND the girls ready to go, just myself. I didn‚Äôt complain, I just downed my coffee & got us ready quickly. I ended up being about 15 minutes late to my client‚Äôs home, which I hate, but still didn‚Äôt even mention because I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äúchoose my battles‚Äù. Fiance had his son (5) dropped off at some point while we were gone. After the appointment, I took my girls to grab a Target order I had placed & we got a few more things we needed while we were there. When we got home, Fiance was asleep on the couch with his son playing Roblox on the PS5 next to him. I woke him up & how long he had been asleep & how long son had been there, I didn‚Äôt really get an actual answer. (I feel like I‚Äôm rambling but there‚Äôs a point I promise!) Anyway, he got up, took some meds, we ate some lunch and I took my meds that the ER gave me, the meds made me sleepy - Fiance took over kid duty for a couple hours. Again, I‚Äôm really appreciative of this & thanked him for it.

Sunday, we spent most of the time separate because my kids had Girl Scouts. I had an amazing day with my girls, even though my head hurt! They got to hold snakes, we hiked, we got starbucks, we went downtown to the shops, we got pizza to take home to eat with the boys, then all 3 kids played & it was a lot of fun! After Fiance‚Äôs son got picked up, my oldest started yelling at her sister. I took her iPad from her, in turn 9F started having a tantrum. I asked Fiance for some backup & he threatened to take away a shopping trip that he had promised the girls back in July for their birthdays. I said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really a threat, because it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs happening anyway.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt like my comment, so he ignored everyone & went back to playing phone games. I eventually freaked out screaming & yelling, then 9F took the hint that the next step was a whollopin. Later, she apologized & did some chores to earn her iPad back.

NOW we have reached this morning‚Ä¶ This morning was a SHIT SHOW, but please read this in the entirety. I want to reiterate that I have been missing my mood stabilizers in order to not have my head feel like it‚Äôs splitting open. My Fiance called out because he has a cold, but he typically leaves for work around 3-4 AM. My girls & I wake up around 5:30 & leave at 6:30. I got everyone up, got everyone their breakfast, my breakfast & coffee, as well as made Fiance tea because he was up too. He got a hot shower because he feels like shit, I understand that‚Ä¶ I made lunches, got dressed, started putting my makeup on, I told the girls ‚ÄúToday is picture day at work. Mommy needs y‚Äôall to get dressed quick so I can spend extra time getting ready, please!‚Äù. My 6F decides today is not working for her & she‚Äôs having big feelings, but I can‚Äôt handle that this morning. I remind her a few times, ‚Äúbabe, you gotta get ready, we only have 30 mins‚Äù, ‚Äú20 mins‚Äù, ‚Äú10 mins‚Äù is when I start getting frantic, because she‚Äôs in the floor crying in her PJS & I‚Äôm running around filling water bottles, trying to find tiny socks in the clean clothes pile that‚Äôs been neglected because we all feel bad & don‚Äôt have energy or time to fold clothes. I ask my 9F, ‚Äúplease help your sister find something she wants to wear, because she doesn‚Äôt like anything I picked, but try not to yell at her‚Äù. It gets to where it‚Äôs time to leave & my 6F is still in the floor in her pjs crying‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm yelling, cussing, SCREAMING, I punched the wall (I think I broke my finger). I take a deep breath & say to Fiance ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre tuning this out or ignoring it‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm really struggling & could use some help. I know you‚Äôre sick, but‚Ä¶‚Äù When I mentioned Fiance would have to take 6F to school, then he gets off his phone game, tries to help 6F get dressed, but gave up quickly. He said he couldn‚Äôt take her because he had to go to urgent care as soon as it opened. I told him he could be 30 mins later, but I can‚Äôt be super late to work, because they‚Äôll miss the bus. Eventually, Fiance‚Äôs sister came down (we rent the basement apartment) to help me. I was so fucking embarrassed, I was crying, sweating, shaking and bleeding (from punching the wall) -times like these, I forget there‚Äôs people above us- but with the sister‚Äôs help, we got 6F ready for school. When I was about to leave, I calmly asked Fiance ‚Äúhey, next time, if I‚Äôm yelling, cussing, hitting things & you‚Äôre here, could you please try to help? Because I was really struggling.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick, we‚Äôre not going to fight about this now.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to argue, I just needed help.‚Äù to which he responded for me to ‚Äújust stop.‚Äù.
On the way to school, I had a long talk with both of my girls. My 6F is very particular, but we don‚Äôt have time for that in the morning. I have tried to get her to pick out her clothes in the evenings, but she refuses. I told her, from now on, it‚Äôs not an option, because we cannot be late for work/ school. I did apologize for how I acted, I told them both that how I acted was unacceptable, and no one should be yelling/ screaming/ cussing & hitting things when they‚Äôre mad. I did tell them that mom is going through some tough things right now, but I‚Äôll try to do better. I also told my 6F that it‚Äôs okay to have a bad moment, but to try to keep it to a minimum then keep going!
Also, I forgot my own damn lunchbox after all of this (which has my daily meds, my migraine meds, my water, my caffeine, tylenol, everything). I was 20 mins late to work, but since I typically get there 15 mins before the buses let students off, they didn‚Äôt miss their bus. I was further embarrassed because 6F & I looked like a hot mess. I was sweaty, our hair was both crazy, she/ we forgot her jacket, her pants were up under her feet because she‚Äôs in between sizes‚Ä¶ my sweet angel coworker, gave 6F her jacket & straightened up her pants, I started crying again. 
Later, Fiance brought my lunchbox to me, which was nice of him & I appreciate him for it‚Ä¶ I asked him how it went at the Dr & he said he got antibiotics because his cold is ‚Äúalmost broncitis‚Äù. Idk, I feel bad about this morning, mostly about how bad I lost my temper, but I also feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to do everything alone when help is there- sick or not. Does that make me TAH? I feel like when I‚Äôm sick, I'm still a parent‚Ä¶ I mean, after this fender bender, albeit minor, Fiance asked me to go pick up the grocery order‚Ä¶ So what's the difference in that & asking him to take a kid to school when he has a cold? If I‚Äôm TAH, I‚Äôm okay with that & I will definitely apologize to my fiance. 

IF you read this far THANK YOU! I‚Äôm probably not ready for the comments on this one üò£

1obnj75,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1obnj75/do_bitter_compounds_extract_late/,Do bitter compounds extract late,"**TL;DR: ""Bitter compounds extract late"" is true for dark roasts (phenylindanes need ""dirty water"" to extract) but could be misleading for light roasts (bitterness comes from over-extraction breaking down chlorogenic compounds into harsh acids, not from late extraction).**

¬†

I‚Äôve been looking in depth at the coffee lore captured in the phrase ‚Äòbitter compounds extract late‚Äô and have arrived at a tentative understanding that might question this to a degree. I‚Äôd be grateful for comments, corrections or confirmations on any points here.

Point to note, I am not a chemist (but have been known to play one on AI). I do have an engineering background.

This is, of course, simplified.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The mechanisms and compounds causing perceived bitterness are very different for light and dark roasts (I‚Äôm going to ignore the middle ground and focus on the extremes).  
  


**Dark Roasts**

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For dark roasts, the statement is broadly true. Phenylindanes are a major contributor to harsh bitterness in dark roasts and as they are not easily dissolved in ‚Äòclean‚Äô water, they need a certain amount of other compounds to dissolve in the slurry water before they get extracted. More precisely:

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phenylindanes are **hydrophobic aromatic molecules**, derived from the breakdown of chlorogenic acid lactones.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Because they don‚Äôt interact well with water (which is polar), they dissolve **only after** the water has already picked up enough **polar solutes** (sugars, acids, caffeine, ions, etc.) to reduce its overall polarity.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† So, they do extract late.  
  


**Light Roasts**

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For light roasts things get a bit more convoluted. Here, the main contributors to the bitterness of brewed coffee are chlorogenic acids (CGAs), chlorogenic acid lactones (CGLs) and caffeine. Caffeine and CGAs are fairly easily dissolved in water and will be in your brew very early.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CGLs are mildly hydrophobic and extract after the CGAs and Caffiene; CGLs are primary source of ‚Äúrefined‚Äù bitterness in light roasts.

8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **It is quinic and caffeic acids that, although not bitter themselves\*, enhance the perceived bitterness.** These two acids are not normally freely available in light roasts but can be ‚Äòreleased‚Äô through hydrolysis (breakdown) of CGAs.

9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hydrolysis of CGAs requires:

a.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A catalyst - slightly acidic water (the more acid the faster the process)

b.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Elevated water temperature (the higher the temperature the faster the process)

c.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Time for the process to release the two acids

10.¬† A classic cause of excessive hydrolysis is a stalled brew.

*\*I am not sure this is true ‚Äì some sources say these two acids are bitter! Doesn‚Äôt change the main points raised here.*



So, with light roasts we are not leaving bitter compounds in the coffee bed with a good brew, we are avoiding the release of quinic and caffeic acids.

This partially explains the impact of water temperature, that is often used to control the quality of the brew.

This also explains a scenario I have seen reported on Reddit, where trying to extract the remaining bitter compounds from a brewed coffee bed does not deliver bitterness. The CGAs have already been extracted from the bed, along with the acids that would act as a catalyst, so quinic or caffeic acid release is not easy.

If the above is correct, there are some practical points related to this ‚Äì it‚Äôs not just academic ‚Äì that I am working on. For instance, it could explain why osmotic pour-over enables a brew without significant bitterness from a dark roast ‚Ä¶ the water added is always ‚Äòclean‚Äô so does not extract the phenylindanes.

Thoughts? Corrections? I'm particularly interested if anyone with chemistry background can confirm or correct.",1,1760979280.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been on Ritalin LA 50mg for some time now and the experience I‚Äôve had on it has been mixed. When I first upped the dose from 40 I noticed that I was unbearably tense like never before and anxious but this was mostly in scenarios where I had to be still for a while. Eventually It eased off and was great! I felt better mood wise, could think clearly and I had no problem motivation wise. 


When I moved to college i was overstimulated like I am now so I backed down to 40mg for a while. However, I ran out of it and instead tried 50mg again. I don‚Äôt really feel nearly any benefits from it anymore which is quite frustrating as I‚Äôve been on it only since may. 
Now, I‚Äôm so anxious and overstimulated and it‚Äôs annoying because I can‚Äôt think of why I‚Äôd be this way. I make sure to eat before I take it every morning, drink insane amounts of water and have stopped drinking coffee. It‚Äôs very distracting for college and I also have to sit there for ages trying to concentrate even though I cannot think very clear, feeling lightheaded, tense and tired/wired at the same time. 

Can anyone help me here? It seemed like something that faded at the start but now it‚Äôs confusing to me what i should be doing to avoid overstimulation.

At a recent Cottage Grove Village Board meeting, Village Administrator Matt Giese presented an annual development update, a summary of notable development projects in the village and the condition of the village‚Äôs tax incremental finance districts.

On Sept. 15, Giese walked through where many of the projects are in their construction process, what benefit they will have financially on the village and what board members can expect in the future.

The village of Cottage Grove currently has five tax incremental finance districts (TID). **A TID is an economic development tool that allows municipalities to use tax revenue generated from development to help pay for expenses in a set geographical area.**

**When a TID is created, it freezes tax rates at a baseline amount, which are paid to the four taxing jurisdictions over the 20-year life of the TID. As development occurs in that finance district, and property values rise, the additional revenue created by any development in tax revenue is saved in a fund to pay for projects within that geographical area.**

At the end of the life of a TID, any remaining value created in that TID is distributed in one-time payments to the four taxing jurisdictions it falls in. And if the values of any properties have risen in the TID over the life of the district, municipalities may see dollars coming back on the tax rolls.

**The village of Cottage Grove currently has one TID set to close in 2026, TID 5. It‚Äôs a 127-acre area covering the village‚Äôs commerce park.** Giese called it ‚Äúa very successful TIF district,‚Äù with only about 3.5 acres total left undeveloped in the commerce park, and a handful of parcels around the commerce park still undeveloped.

**The closure will bring more than $257 million back onto the tax rolls with increased value.**

**Giese said that when that happens, the average fair market value home is expected to see $1,300 of positive gross tax impact on their entire property bill, a ‚Äúnotable tax benefit on the average home.‚Äù**

The village is also set to receive about $1 million in a lump sum payment, of funds that were generated by the TID. Finance Director/Deputy Administrator Cameron Sawyer said the majority of that payment is expected to be used to reduce future borrowing on the police station project, with some going into the village‚Äôs capital projects fund to pay for future projects.

**Recently, in TID 5, Giese said, Johnson Health Tech, a current commerce park resident, purchased 2.5 acres in the commerce park for future expansion. And Dolphin Swim Academy is planning to open a new accessory building for summer camp operations, that‚Äôs under construction.**

This year, several new businesses opened in the TID 5 boundaries, include Mr. Queso Sports Bar, opening in the previous BB Jack‚Äôs location.

The Cottage Grove Commons, a mixed use space next to Grace Coffee on Highway N, also saw two new businesses open. Osteostrong and Verizon both received occupancy permits for the space this year.

The village‚Äôs four other TIDs are in active development.

**Giese said that TID 10, created in 2018, spans 300 acres north of the Interstate, and more than half of the district is taken up by the Amazon development at the corner of Highways N and TT, currently under construction.**

**The Amazon development is 154 acres, and the anticipated property value is estimated around $300 million. Construction on the project began in fall 2024, and is expected to continue through fall 2026. Giese shared that Dane County and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation anticipate any potential roadway improvements in the area, to the two county highways near the facility and the roundabouts near the Interstate entrance and exits, to start in spring 2026.**

**Operations at the new facility are expected to start in spring 2027.**

The village also has a TID in the area of Cottage Grove Road coming into the village, TID 8.

In 2025, two new facilities opened in TID 8, including the new Foundations Dance facility and a New Tech Painting facility.

Giese said that in TID 8, construction is pending on a multi-use retail space, that‚Äôs already been approved, along with additional residential parcels being developed by developer Homburg. The Farm sewer sanitary interceptor, a sewer project to expand the capacity of the sewer system in that area, is also pending construction.

**In 2025, the village also heard a concept presentation for a new brew pub in the TID. Giese said village staff are waiting for a formal application to be received from possible developers.**

TID 9, a district that covers Highway BB east of Highway N, is mostly made up of the Authentix apartment complex. The village of Cottage Grove has been in the process of acquiring parcels in that TID, Gises said, for future redevelopment. The village board has had several closed session discussions about that process.

TID 9 is expected to close in 2031.

**Other notable developments in the village include the beginning of construction of the Hey Day multi-family housing development on Highway BB and Buss Road. The 114-unit townhome development is under construction now, which is expected to continue through 2026.**

With all the development projects that have progressed in 2025, Giese said the village has seen an increase of 19% in net new construction. Cottage Grove is one of two Dane County communities that has ranked in the top 5 of all cities and villages in the county for development growth.

The increase in commercial growth, Giese said, helps in ‚Äúdiversifying our tax base, and not being as reliant on only residential,‚Äù which spreads the tax burden across the base and reduces the financial impacts on individual taxpayers.

Board member Heidi Murphy and Village President Cindi Kelm-Nelson expressed support for the work the village has done to encourage development and growth in the last year.

‚ÄúThese are significant numbers that are really going to help provide tax relief,‚Äù Murphy said. And, adding development increases services and offerings for residents, she added. ‚ÄúOver the years, we‚Äôve really provided a lot of new opportunities.‚Äù

The development also creates local jobs, Murphy continued, and offers residents access to more restaurants, childcare, activities and other services.

You know the type ‚Äì early flights, back-to-back sightseeing and an itinerary so tight it might break. But something changed during my solo trip to Vietnam last year, and it completely changed the way I travel.

It started in Hoi An. I had planned to spend only two days there, just enough time for photos of the lanterns and the Old Town. But on my second morning, drinking strong coffee at a riverside cafe, I met a local tailor named Lan. We talked for hours about her life, her art and how tourism has changed her city. That spontaneous connection made me realize something important ‚Äì I wasn't actually traveling, I was just moving.

When I finally slowed down this is what I learned:

* **Depth trumps distance:** I started spending more time in smaller places ‚Äì exploring smaller streets, attending community cooking classes, or just observing everyday life from a park bench. The stories I found were far richer than any checklist.
* **Conversations are the real souvenirs:** Talking to the locals opened doors that no one else could open. From fishermen in Kerala to hostel owners in Prague, each story added a new layer to the way I saw the world.
* **Silence can teach you more than WiFi:** I went for long walks without music or podcasts. Just the sound of the city, or the waves. It's funny how you start to hear yourself more clearly when you stop drowning in the noise.
* **You don't have to post everything:** Some moments feel better when they're just yours. I stopped chasing the perfect shot and started chasing sunsets that didn't require proof.

Since then, I have changed the way I plan my trips:

* I allow at least three full days for each destination, unless there is a transit stop.
* I choose an ""anchor activity""‚Äîlike a local hike, food drive, or volunteer work‚Äîthat connects me to the community.
* I cook on ""free days"" without any planning. That's when the magic usually happens.

Travel for me now is not about escaping from life - it's about noticing it. Every journey becomes a slow conversation between me and the world.

If you've ever traveled alone, have you experienced that moment when fast travel no longer made sense? I'd love to hear how slowing down (or not!) has shaped your journey.",1,1760978622.0,GetMotivated,1,0.67,False

1obnab9,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1obnab9/dc_shutdown_weekend_experience/,DC Shutdown Weekend Experience,"My partner and I recently spent our 9th anniversary in Washington D.C! Our timing was awful truly but we planned this whole thing way before the government was set to shut down, so rather than go to museums we decided to pivot and do a sort of food tour! I did a fair bit of research; lots of videos , Washington post lists, and more than anything else I listened to you guys here on the Dc subreddit ! Just thought it would be fun to write out our experiences with where we went . We tried to get a smattering of high end stuff and cheap local favorites !

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS: DC thankfully doesn‚Äôt become a ghost town when the government shuts down . Still vibrant and busy. I‚Äôd very seriously recommend going on a Sunday when the parking times are more lenient . We were actually able to find free parking on the street most everywhere we went ! 

BENS CHILI BOWL: I half considered not including this one since we got it late delivery when we arrived at our hotel. They forgot our chili so truly it just felt like some very normal big hot dogs and some decent cheese fries . 5.5/10 

ROSE AVE BAKERY: I can see the hype around this one. I love a black sesame dessert and the pastry was of great quality . Everything was a bit rich but no more than one would expect out of stuffed pastries . Scallion bun looked the least exciting but was truly the tastiest part of the meal. Great coffee and tea as well, efficient service too. 8.5/10 

DORO SOUL FOOD: Went to this fun shared restaurant space and had some delicious cocktails while we waited for our fried chicken . Got a mixed 4 piece and the chicken was so crispy and seasoned very well! I could‚Äôve taken more salt but I feel like that‚Äôs more of a personal taste thing. Berbere spice really elevated it to something special . 8/10 

HOWARDS CHINESE: Checks all the flags for a good Chinese place. Sketchy old building with thick acrylic sealing off the service counter from the public . Cash only . Ordered a 5 piece chicken wing with Mumbo sauce and a half cheesesteak. You can tell these guys have been at this forever because the wings were perfect . The sauce was just perfect and the chicken was crisp and salty . If you‚Äôre a first timer for mumbo and chicken wings I‚Äôd say this is a solid stop. 9/10 

CHICATANA : Easily the most disappointing of our experiences . Service was lackluster and unenthused. The food was fine and cocktails were okay for the most part. We ordered huaraches that were pretty tasty and some tacos . The octopus taco was just one big tentacle in a tortilla and was inedibly tough. The lengua was cut in these huge chunks that were texturally unpleasant , and I love lengua ! No idea how it tops so many lists . 6/10 

THIP KHAO: This was the place at the top of every comment section on this subreddit and it did not disappoint. Had Kee Mao and some Alligator Laab and both were just perfect. Cocktails were bright and paired deliciously . We also tried some of the Ya Dong medicinal shots and they were unique and tasty! The service was sparse but this time it seemed to be because the place was packed . If you like thai, Lao, or Cambodian food this is definitely a highlight in the area . 9/10

DEATH & CO: Last time we came through dc we hit a bunch of the restaurants in Blagden Alley but weren‚Äôt able to get to this one before it closed . So we decided to pop in for some end of the night cocktails . The space was really cool . It had a very sophisticated 70s feel and the bartender was just super friendly and gave great recommendations . Best cocktails we had all night for sure . It‚Äôs a tad pricy but not exorbitant. Great way to end the night a 9.5/10 

PIZZA BOLIS : My partner is a former dc native and swore by this place for some drunk late night delivery to our hotel . It wasn‚Äôt mind-blowing but It was solid greasy drunk pizza . The crust is flavorful and they don‚Äôt skimp on the extra cheese ! 8/10

While there were highs and lows I gotta say this subreddit definitely steered us in the right direction . If you‚Äôre a foodie and listen to the locals you can still have a fun delicious weekend, museums or not ! ",17,1760978554.0,washingtondc,1,0.92,False

Toying with the idea of getting a Kingrinder k6, or maybe 1zpresso k-ultra or KP6, I know they are double the price. I was half toying with the idea of getting a electric DF64, but thought it a bit expensive for a cup a day.

Is the hand grinder going to be a noticeable improvement over the Rocky? Don't mind hand grinding, really only drink a cup of coffee a day, if that. Don't drink espresso any more, too much of a hassle to get a good shot.

It seems that every time i start a diet, I get sick. I had norovirus last time. And this time I have a cold. 

I'm down from 265 to 257. 

I try to do the gym 2-3 times a week while walking every day. But I have no energy. I'm only on day two of being sick so this is hitting me hard.

Not to mention, I did cave and have some unhealthy foods but I stayed within my calorie limit, was actually under by like 500. I still gained a pound from it.

I'm going to go walking today but honestly the weight training will have to wait for me.

Also, I've learned that protein makes you dehydrated. Wtf do I do about that? I'm constantly drinking water throughout the day. I'm unsure how to make myself drink even more. 

My diet plan is high protein, moderation on unhealthy stuff but not telling myself no. If I do say no to everything I want I'll end up quitting the diet.

I have also gone from 6-9 sodas a day to maybe 6-12 ounces of soda in total. I usually have a protein coffee to get my caffeine in the morning. 

I've stopped eating out so much. 

I just want to keep my motivation up. 

Seeing the scale go up makes me upset. 

Also, i have no idea which muscles and machines to work out on when i go.

I want to build muslce to burn my fat in a slow manner to manage loose skin. 

I want every area of my body basically. 

Most focused on: back of arms, stomach, my double chin, back, sides, thighs. I want to lift my butt up but not lose it. Its a nice butt.

I went to the dr for a routine check up. Apparently my TSH is at 4.2 so my thyroid is borderline underactive. So I have that working against me too.

So what work outs do i do? How to i hydrate myself? Do you experience getting sick too?

I'm not commissioning this either, I just want to see what you do with the idea. If something like this has already been thought of, do let me know!

Definitely I've always wanted something to write my poetry with that doesn't have notifications on it... But I love my own mechanical keyboard. So I came up with a little idea. Definitely a technical DIY idea, but there's lots of ways to do it, and it should be way easier than the average on this subreddit. :)

AlphaSmart machines are pretty much what I'm emulating, but with a bring your own keyboard kind of philosophy. 

### Things you would hypothetically need: 

- Tiny little display, probably a cheap character display you can get, 
- either a raspberry pi, or if you wanted something more efficient an Arduino. 
- bits and bobs to connect the brain (either the SoC computer or Arduino or whatever else you decide to use) to an external keyboard 
- an external keyboard of your choice 
- bits and bobs to get a USB output to rapidly type out what you typed to the computer like a keyboard.

### Explanation

**Inspiration:** With the AlphaSmart, it was able to be so widely adopted because it had a keyboard and a screen, but to get the text out of the device all you have to do is connect it to a proper computer with a cable, exactly like a keyboard, and it would type out the text you just wrote on the screen. 

**What:** The idea I'm describing here is just like that, except that it takes in keyboard input, acts as a temporary buffer while you're writing, and then, when you plug it into a computer, it just spits it out like it's typing it quickly. So it really is a pretty basic idea.

**How:** You could build it around a Raspberry Pi Pico, an Arduino with USB host/device support, or any microcontroller that can both read from a USB keyboard and emulate a USB HID keyboard. Add a basic screen, some local storage (even just internal flash), and a small power source (battery or USB), and you‚Äôve got the bones of a DIY WriterDeck.

The whole thing could be mounted directly to your favorite keyboard (with a 3D-printed bracket, adhesive, or even zip ties) so it feels like one unified writerdeck. No operating system, no Wi-Fi, no notifications‚Äîjust input, display, and output. üëç

This way you can turn just about any favorite keyboard you like into a basic WriterDeck! 

Have fun with that, I'm curious to know what you do with it. Sorry if I'm a little wordy, I just had coffee. :)",1,1760977935.0,writerDeck,1,1.0,False

Any tips on avoiding the messy ""so are we splitting this tab"" situation at the end?

Obviously I shouldn't set up first meetings at a restaurant, should be going for coffee or drinks

I was thinking I should sit down with the person and have a chat for like 10 minutes before ordering to figure out if its going anywhere. Pick a place that takes payment up front where the food is shareable. And just tell her directly what I'm going to order. She is welcome to share it, and if she wants to get anything else she can do it separately. This way she is not stuck with half the bill either. and it feels semi-professional, doesn't set up for any expectations, but also doesn't just shit on the date entirely.

I am 6'2"". I am looking for new communities in my area as I WFH and don't get a lot of face to face interaction. I went to a new place on Sunday which has a lot of families, and I didn't know anyone there. I wore ankle boots with maybe a 2 inch heel, not very tall, but more than I usually wear as I don't usually wear heels at all. I still towered over basically everyone there so I was already feeling pretty visible and self conscious, especially as the new girl.

I was pretty taken aback and in the moment all I could say was ""thank you"" but I instantly felt embarrassed and left right away. 

I was really mad at the kid for saying something so rude and at myself for letting this kid hurt my feelings so much. I don't really know what to do if it happens again, because I feel like you can't just tell a child to fuck off or really take them to task at all, especially if they don't really know how rude what they said is.

After the flood, there wasn‚Äôt a house standing for anybody to be inside anyway. Standing in the woods with water up to his knees, staring at the pile of wood where his house once stood, he heard the sounds of another wave coming in. The child tried to drag himself through the water back into the forest; he‚Äôs picked up by the wave as his vision went black.

John‚Äôs vision slowly came back; the woods and trees around him swayed back and forth; he screeched. Feeling his face, his jaw was poking out incorrectly, likely from the tidal wave alongside his right foot. Scared and helpless, he cried; John cried until he passed out. The boy was stranded in the woods, hurt, lost, sad, scared.¬†

A week had gone by since the flood, holding on by a thread, he was awoken by a tug on his raincoat. In front was a fox. John was still in a haze and unable to notice the furry creature; the fox made a couple of yelps. He was startled back awake to notice what was in front of him. John tried jumping away, but his foot prevented him. Having learned his face hurt when he made noise, John stayed silent as the fox approached and sniffed him.

Momentarily, more foxes came out from the woods, all of them taking turns sniffing him, one even licked him; they were repulsed. The foxes noticed John‚Äôs shivering and watery eyes. One of the foxes left, returning shortly with several berries, and placed them in front of John. The boy hesitantly munched on them, and all the foxes began laughing.

Multiple foxes started pulling his jacket‚Äôs hood at once. Trying to flail around to be let free, he realized that he was brought out to a river. Before this day, he survived on the handfuls he could muster through the agonizing pain. He didn‚Äôt feel pain, not after the berries; his mobility was just fine, and he could move. One fox yipped for John‚Äôs attention, as they began to drink.

John was hesitant; the smell made him gag. He weakly took in a sip, tasting like a fruit punch. The boy jumped into the river, trying to get as much as possible; the foxes had to pull him back out. John felt refreshed. He sat on the grass, looking up at the ever-so muted gray above. He winced as the pain from his jaw crept back. A fox rammed into John‚Äôs face from the side, knocking him down.

He felt around on his face; his jaw didn‚Äôt hurt as much, and it was back in place. A smile grew on his face; first time since the flood. His foot was still injured; it was bearable as long as he didn‚Äôt run. John jumped for joy; the adrenaline helped his foot. He settled down and trekked through the woods, foxes following him, trying to find his way back to town.

The faint sunshine peeked through the gaps from the pushes. John giggled with cheer as he rushed towards the light. As the light faded, he saw his city, all of four buildings that stood anyway. No noises, cars, homes, nothing, just wet streets for miles. The boy took a look and watched as crows squawked. He bolted towards the city, mainly for his home. Searched for hours until he found what was left of his house. He went to sleep that night under the planks of wood that still stood in his room. He wept until he was tired enough to pass out.¬†

As he woke up the next morning the foxes from earlier stayed by him, sleeping beside John. The boy looked around his room for anything, any form of communication, toys, clothes, a symbol of his life before the flood. Nothing was saved, other than the arm of his dinosaur plushie. Tears were forming once more, but the foxes kept making noise whenever he looked around. One of them eventually bit John on the hand for him to notice, they were leaving. The boy didn‚Äôt want to be alone again; he found it scary, so he followed them, leaving his home behind. He lived with the Foxes for the rest of his life, never returning home or knowing the name of John again.

‚ÄúWhy is this written like a novel? This is a police report, you know that, right?‚Äù Commissioner Scott asked, confused.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ yeah. Just got carried away.‚Äù Detective Lionel explained as he quickly took another sip of his coffee.

‚ÄúWell, we can‚Äôt use this, but is the info here accurate at least?‚Äù Scott sat down in his chair.

‚ÄúFrom what I could gather due to the guy‚Äôs limited English, yeah, it is.‚Äù Lionel confidently answered.

‚ÄúThere was a flood, a real bad one, like 20-some odd years ago, just a few towns over. I‚Äôm pretty sure they turned the demolished city into a beach.‚Äù He began typing at his computer.

‚ÄúYessh, that sounds bleak and kinda distasteful.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh, really don‚Äôt need to tell me. I‚Äôm one ‚Äòback talk‚Äô away from getting canned by the governor personally. Ah, yes cmere.‚Äù Lionel came around the desk to look at the Scott‚Äô computer.¬†

‚ÄúEw‚Ä¶‚Äù Lionel muttered out. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù Scott continued scrolling down the page. ‚ÄúApparently, only a few weeks after the flood, work to demolish it had begun. Lots of outrage‚Ä¶ oh shit my bad.‚Äù Scott turned to see Lionel‚Äôs hand get something shiny stuck on it.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sticky, bro‚Ä¶‚Äù He used the hand sanitizer on Scott‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ why is that on your desk?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got pancakes this morning and syrup spilled onto the desk.‚Äù Scott turned back and continued. ‚ÄúAnyway, the governor's office rather quickly moved past it, so no real time or money was spent trying to save anybody. As i mentioned a moment ago, lots of out cry, ya know, what‚Äôre we gonna do?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPoor kid. From what I got in our talk, he more or less stayed in the woods for the rest of his life.‚Äù Lionel took a deep sigh.¬†

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt he looking rather, for lack of better words, disgusting when your team caught him?‚Äù Scott made a ‚Äòyikes‚Äô face and shrugged. ‚ÄúIs that rude? I‚Äôm sorry if that was.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, captain, he was fucking gross. If he was telling the truth about his age and witnessing the flood, he should be in his late 20s to early 30s.‚Äù Lionel leaned back and looked up with his eyes closed. ‚ÄúHe stood at around 5‚Äô2, weighing at most 80 pounds, and the only thing he wore was the head of a fox.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was naked?‚Äù Scott asked, to which Lionel nodded. ‚ÄúShort, skinny, naked man wearing the head of a fox.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCovered in dried blood, dirt, with scratches and bruises.‚Äù Scott's eyes widened hearing that. ‚ÄúForgot to mention that. We caught him in the woods, eating the raw meat from a dead deer. There were foxes with him, but he wasn‚Äôt fast like his furry companions.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúHoly‚Ä¶‚Äù Scott stood out of his chair and gestured for Lionel to follow him. ‚ÄúWas he violent to you or anybody?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, he tried at least, but since his extreme malnourishment, he wasn‚Äôt able to actually hurt.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd how do you know any of this? Like he was a boy when he started living with foxes, was he still able to speak English?‚Äù Scott pondered.

‚ÄúSurprisingly well, in all honesty. Spoken like a little boy, but was able to communicate properly. Must‚Äôve still been practicing out loud or something.‚Äù Lione sounded rather chipper in response.

‚ÄúThis hall, right?‚Äù Scott pointed at a door.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ CALL FOR BACK UP!‚Äù Scott yells. The prison door was open, and the guard was dead in the cell with a bite-sized chunk of his neck ripped out. The man couldn‚Äôt be found anywhere; they looked all night in the woods, as if John had vanished.¬†

Word spreads; people are more alert now than ever. Mentions of a creature with the head of a fox and the body of a human darting through the woods have become rampant.¬† Legend says that once a year, at the break of dawn, John Saint John‚Äôs shadow might appear from within the woods looking over the town. It‚Äôs generally considered best for people not to investigate; those who had the gall to follow the shadow for answers were never seen again.¬†

1obmv7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1obmv7s/need_help_figuring_out_living_room_versus_dining/,Need help figuring out living room versus dining room,"Help please! I recently bought a small 1960's bungalow, and I've been stuck on my **living room** and **dining room** after living here a couple of months. I'm going in circles trying to figure this out.

**Questions**:

* Which room to use for living room and which for dining room (choices are floor plan *Living* or *Sun Room*)?
* Which furniture to put where (see list)?

The room labelled as *Living* is my **current** **Living Room** space. Currently has:  piano, loveseat, two accent chairs, oval table between them, coffee table, corner shelf stand, and a glass curio cabinet. I have art to hang too. It feels awkward.

The back of the house, labelled as *Sun Room*, is the **current Dining Room**. \[Edit: Windows have california shutters that open into the room and can't be blocked\]. Currently has: a large extendable dining table and sideboard, and two huge paintings on either side of the large window (it is the only place for them).

Note: *Dining* on the floor plan is being used for additional kitchen storage cabinets, as the kitchen storage is abysmal. So, my dining table is my only eating space.

Furniture list *(all must be in one of these two rooms)*:

* piano
* rounded corner shelf unit
* loveseat (will update), two accent chairs (will update) -- happy to merge into one larger piece too
* coffee table (to buy)
* oval accent table (heirloom)
* glass curio cabinet (heirloom)
* extendable dining table with 6 chairs (heirloom)
* large sideboard (heirloom)
* stereo console cabinet (vintage, need a spot for it)
* Two large paintings (too large for furniture against the wall in front of them (heirlooms)

Thanks so much for your ideas!
