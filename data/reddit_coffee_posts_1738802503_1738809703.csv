*  Hello, good morning, afternoon or evening, dear Reddit user! Come in, you are absolutely welcome. I see you're tired; do you want a cup of coffee?

. . .

*  Oh, do you want to know about the game?

* Haha of course. Sorry, sometimes I go around the bush.

* I guess it's time to introduce you to ""Undertale Blue: Legacy"".

NOTE: We advise you to play Undertale and Undertale Yellow before this, as it contains major spoilers for both of those games.

-- A prequel made by and for fans that takes place in the Undertale Yellow and Undertale universe. You play as the 3rd human, ""Sadako"",  a teenage human girl who had the misfortune to fall immediately after Toriel had just finished checking up to see if anyone else had fallen. Without a Toriel to give you a tuToriel (Get it?) to face the challenges of the ruins, you'll have to rely on yourself to discover the mysteries that the underground hides. Surely that's all gonna end well... right?

-- Don't be afraid if you end up getting lost in the lost ruins, I'm sure you'll find the way!

*  What do you mean by ""talking flower""?

*  There aren't echo flowers in the ruins, silly!

*  We better continue!

(Yes, there's no Flowey. Lore reasons.)

-- Undertale Blue: Legacy takes into account the canon established by Undertale Yellow and tells the story of the blue soul human mentioned in said game. At this point, you're probably thinking that the game is not going to have much originality to it, right? I'm pleased to inform you that you couldn't be more wrong. The UTY canon is a starting point, yes, but not the whole story. UTB:L has its own story and its own identity, so don't be worried too much, because this game has 3 new zones and a lot to offer! (Yeah, 6 areas, wish us luck... please.)

-- Our game is a product that seeks to take the average UnderTale fan out of their comfort zone, introducing different characters than one might be accustomed to.

-- In ""UnderTale Blue: Legacy"" you will see the cruelest and dirtiest aspects of the human species portrayed. If you are looking for a fun game suitable for everyone, then this is not your game.

-- Discover new friends, enemies, bosses, routes and secrets in this fangame, play with new mechanics and have fun because this game has...

-ACTION!

-DRAMA!

-MYSTERY!

-I CAN'T SAY IT BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING!

-ROMAN- WAIT WHAT?!

_*History*_
-- Long after the famous ""war between Humans and Monsters"", humans educated future generations under the guise of that war being just a medieval fantasy story, something that never happened. However, those stories shared through generations, always shared an important similarity, the war had been started by monsters, and had claimed many more lives of innocent humans than monsters.

-- And although the story was just ""fiction"", in the vast majority of cases, these stories are based on true events. Mount Ebott has always been a place full of mysteries, such as the disappearance of 2 human childs who never returned to their homes.

-- Sadako's family is a very superstitious one, who firmly believed in all the rumors that were said about Mount Ebott, and of course, the fact that there were evidence that supported these beliefs only made the situation more threatening. The girl of Japanese origin was very close to her family, and a doubt gnawed her: What could happen if the monsters ever escaped from their prison? The situation was one of fear, but also hatred. Sadako didn't want to face a situation like that, but if she had to, she would give her best.

-- Those beasts had mercilessly attacked the human kind. They didn't deserve forgiveness... Or at least that's what she believed.

The kitchen in the house I inherited (a 1960s bungalow) doesn't work for me and it's very small (approximately 9X10 feet).

The last time it was redone was at the end of the 1970s (circa 1979 by my parents).

Pic 1 is the kitchen as it is

Pic 2 is my hand drawn sketched idea of how to make it work

I am not open concepting it

Here's a list  of intended changes to accompany the picture of my sketch in case it isn't very clear what I was trying to illustrate.

Remove closet by front door and have the stairs open up beside the front door.

https://preview.redd.it/do70hggslfhe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b89536446902738d12e631dc4f410b998a92f5cb

Close off one of the 3 doors into the kitchen (the one you enter in from off the stairs because approximately 3 feet from it is a second door the front door and I believe the stairs originally opened to there and the closet was probably added in the 60s).

Have the work space laid out as a L (I may or may not need to change the window to be slightly smaller to accommodate cupboards better).

On the other wall across from the L a counter with uppers fur extra prep and stage (and for a designated spot to put the toaster coffee maker etc) because there isn't enough counter or cupboard space right now and my family members make do of a rolling table inserted near the sink doesn't work because the cutlery drawer can't open all the way.

I may or may not move one of the other doors to have it directly across from the from door and that kitchen doorway.

Please give me feedback back and suggestions m. I hate the way the kitchen is currently (& always have) but now it's mine and I'm free to change what doesn't work for me.

i (21) lost my grandmother (64) two days ago. im really not doing well and im absolutely eat up with guilt and pain and just need to talk about it, advice is welcome

my grandparents took me in when i was 6 and they pretty much raised me. my grandma was always like my mom and she was my closest guardian figure, even after my actual mother came back into our lives to take care of them as they got old and sick. my grandpa died about three years ago (8/2/22), and even though that hurt, he had been in hospice for chf and we had anticipated it. but yesterday morning as i was going downstairs to leave for work around 7:20 am, i found my grandma lying dead on her bed. id heard her saying my name and i thought she probably just wanted me to let the dog out or get her her inhaler (she woke me up at 2 am that morning for that exact thing, nothing was out of the ordinary, i asked her if she could get to her phone to call me if she needed me and she said yes and to go back to bed). but i think she was calling for help and i just wasn't fast enough. it went dead silent as i was going down the stairs throwing my shirt on and when i got in there to see what she wanted she was dead. 

she slept in the living room so we could all get to her if she needed something, and she was in a wheel chair so she needed to be able to move around easily from the living room to the kitchen/dining. 

just two weeks ago she went to the er for chest pain that she thought was a heart attack but wasn't. they said she probably just had bronchitis and the pain was leftover inflammation from the pneumonia. they put her on some meds and wanted to keep her for observation but her insurance wouldn't cover it so she declined and went home. she got a little better and was mobile, still hurting sometimes but up and about and doing all of her usual stuff (letting the dogs out, making herself coffee, cleaning where she could, etc). she hated feeling totally bedbound and always tried to find something to keep herself busy with. she bought herself like 100$ of currency in the object search game she loved to play two days before she died. the last time anyone saw her alive was my mom when she went up to let her dog out at 6 am.

everything hurts. we think she had a major heart attack from the pain she was in. i just keep imagining her alone and afraid and trying to call out for me, awake and aware she was dying and i was just too fucking slow to get there and she couldn't yell loud enough to wake me up before my alarm went off. knowing that she was calling me for help and thought i couldn't hear her or was asleep. knowing that the last thing she ever said was my name. i feel like if i had heard her before or gotten down quicker i could have helped her calm down or given her her inhaler or something and she would have been fine. i would have never imagined the ""love you, goodnight"" at 2 am would have been the last thing we ever said to each other. 

it feels so sudden and jarring. i loved her so much and she meant so much to us all. hearing my mom screaming and begging her to wake up after i ran to the basement to get her was awful. it was horrible and it's all so fresh in my mind. every time i think about it i just want to puke. her bed and all of her stuff and her wheel chair are still in her ""spot"" in the living room and every time i look at it it feels so wrong, she should be there and she isn't. it wasn't supposed to happen like this and i just don't know what to do. i kinda just needed to put this somewhere, sorry that it's long. im a mess!!!",1,1738809447.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Most machines need 15+ bar pressure for good espresso. Budget picks like De'Longhi use 15-bar systems, while pricier models go to 20-bar for better flavor. Pod machines (like Nespresso) trade customization for speed.  

**Key Tip:** Always use fresh beans. Grind right before brewing for maximum flavor.  

Need silky foam? Steam wands work best with whole milk, but alternatives like oat milk need patience. Lower-fat milks froth faster but collapse quicker.  

Machines under $150 can make real espresso. Spend more for temperature control and durability. Manual models require practice, but taste better than pod systems.  

Looking for fast results? Choose Nespresso. Want to master latte art? Try the CASABREWS. Short on counter space? The Stilosa or Spacekey won’t crowd your kitchen.  

Upfront cost seems high, but these machines save money vs daily café trips.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We are all different and our bodies don't agree with some types of food, or we just don't produce the enzymes required to decompose certain foods.

I believe what happens is, we consume food we are not supposed to, quite often. This food then stays stuck inside our intestines causing blockage and disturbing our gut bacteria. 

That causes gasses, which causes GERD, SIBO, Helicobacter Pylori overgrowth, excess of mocus back of the throat,(Can change from person to person)... Then all that ""bad bacteria"" gets into some people's lungs (that's why some people have room filing bad breath just from breathing). It also gets into the nose causing post nasal drip, gets into the tonsils causing tonsil stones and into the gums causing periodontal diseases or bad smell inside gums.

Who from here have done a food intolerance and allergy test, changed their diet and still have bad breath???

I think doing tests to find out bacteria imbalances are good but we need to find the root cause, and I'm almost sure it's the diet as we keep consuming food we can't digest unknowingly.

In my case, I followed the advice from some people in this group and started taking oral prebiotics and kefir. I then had the worst fecal breath you can imagine.

Now, I have stopped dairy, black tea and coffee and changed it for Peppermint tea with Moringa powder in the morning.

I met her at a bar and we hit it off pretty well. She told me immediately she wanted to take it slow as she’s coming out of a relationship. I say cool.

Our first date is at bar trivia, we made out after. Great.

Second date was her friends birthday party. Fun.

Third date was coffee.

Fourth date bar trivia again. Made out after.

Fifth date was another of her friend’s birthday party. Same “group” as before. She said her friends loved me. We went back to her house and made out, and she made it very clear she didn’t want to hook up yet and really appreciated me respecting that. 


During this time (about a month) she would send me photos in lingerie etc, and she would say how turned on she was about the idea of sleeping together, wanted to show me her lingerie etc. we agreed if we never hooked up we would still remain friends because she said I’m great to talk to and she’s learned a lot and likes the way I think (we are from different cultures). 


All of a sudden after the 5th date her texts seem very short, much less frequent and without much opportunity for me to respond/have a convo.

What the hell happened? My only ideas:

* we moved too fast
* she didn’t see a long term relationship for whatever reason (different cultures).
* I said something awful the last time I saw her 
* she’s just busy and I’m freaking out over nothing

I wish she would just tell me. I feel awful not knowing. I’m not going to text her and ask her, I think that would be inappropriate. But now I’m nervous to text her about anything. ",0,1738808623.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False

It was obvious that she got work done on her face, but out of respect, everyone at my workplace did not mention it. I thought this was given, not talking about someone’s procedure in front of them. A few days later, I asked a close friend that frequents my workplace (I work in a coffee shop) whether he noticed anything different about my coworker and I told him that I think she got work done. (I realize now, this is where I went wrong. I should’ve honestly just kept it to myself.) 

A week after, he proceeded to go up to my coworker and asked,

“Did you get plastic surgery? Yeah my friend told me but I can’t really tell” 

I got pretty upset, but given my initial mistake of not keeping that information confidential in the first place, I figured there was myself to blame as well. Was my initial outrage unjustified? Is it ever okay to ask someone you’re not close with if they got work done?

Feel a bit embarrassed, so if no one answers, oh well anyways. Also might be a bit confusing because thoughts are confusing.

It felt like an emptiness in her stomach; a blankness in her eyes. The world was quietly conscious around her, barely breathing. It lived in slow-motion, painstaking step by step. The only feelings in the world right now was the clawing ache in her stomach and the deep self-loathing in her head. 

Nothing felt like everything and everything felt like nothing. Why did she have to act this way? Why did no one love her? Why can’t she do anything right and be so useless? And the girls in her classes were smiling and talking and joking, but when she sat alone they ignored her and sat together afar. But if there was a thought to keep her going it was that firstly, they were bad friends and she should have higher standards, but secondly, that even if so, they did not owe her anything and were barely acquaintances. But she still wanted to talk to someone so she had to. So why did it hurt so much? Because when she sat alone at that desk and her teacher looked at her pityingly and she desperately wanted to scream I have friends! I have friends! But the aching loneliness inside her and the empty spot beside her stripped away the ugly truth. She was unlovable. She always had trouble with people, despite trying, despite a never ending constant effort. She hated herself and she hated her body and wished she had been different and was subject to the cruel unyielding truth that she never would be.

She tried to fight it. The ever-lasting loneliness.

When her friend apologized for being distant; when she talked to a classmate after making coffee; when she called a friend who picked up; when a girl she once knew tried to reach out. But these moments of happiness, of belonging, seemed to be tiny seconds in a never-ending tide of loneliness, and self-hatred, and loathing, and friends who would ignore her and talk to someone else; or would not show up to lunch; or stop talking to you; or pretend you don’t exist when you’ve never done anything wrong. And every time you reached out and heard a maybe that really meant like never; or a quiet when you spoke once and the conversation petered out; or when you desperately tried to make connections but hit a wall; or they wouldn’t reach back, and it’s always you reaching. You are trying. And they are not trying. It doesn’t stop and you don’t stop because you’re afraid you’ll end up lonely and friendless and have no good experiences and try to chase away that loneliness with a stick that keeps breaking but despite 

The bad experiences.

The friends who ignore you.

The desperate reaching.

You don’t stop because 

What can you do?

You don’t want to be alone. 

You just want to be liked.

But something is wrong with you.

And you can’t stop because then where will you be?

And you have to endure even though you want to cry and scream and ask why no one likes you and there’s no answer when you yell into the void because the only people that can answer this are the ones in their casual cruelty are hurting you.

And you just.

Want to cry.

I've been pulling espresso at home for close to ten years now. Over this decade I've ebbed and flowed between small batch roasters and big store bags. This comes with a big gamble every time, especially the latter.

Picking up a bag that you've never tasted before could be an amazing experience or completely trash. It's those times that it's been trash that really puts a damper on the day. What's worse is that (if you're like me) you need to finish that bag of beans before buying the next. Money is too tight these days to buy some coffee just to throw it away.

So after some brainstorming I started a website for crowd sourcing coffee bean rating called RoastQuest.com. No account needed. Just submit your favorite (and least favorite) beans and scroll through the list to find what may become your next coffee bean of choice.

Features:
* Simple 5-star rating system
* No account required
* Free to use

Our office hadn’t made a decision yet to close, so I went back to sleep. When I woke up (about an hour before I normally log in/start work) I saw that the office had made the call to close, so I canceled the catering.

Almost two hours later the leader asked me where the coffee was…and I told them that I had canceled the catering because the office was closed and there wasn’t anyone onsite to accept the order. Odd, because I didn’t think anyone was onsite. Two hours after that my exec asked me where the lunch catering was…I said, AGAIN that the office was closed so I canceled the catering.

1iirlmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iirlmc/we_unexpectedly_lost_my_dad_two_month_ago_what/,We unexpectedly lost my dad two month ago. What the heck happened?,"Hello all. My 74-year-old father passed away due to internal hemorrhaging from a giant peptic ulcer. We are all utterly devastated and confused as to how it got so bad, so quickly. Here’s a little background:

My dad was an attorney and took good care of himself. He stayed active, loved working outside, playing tennis, etc. Unfortunately, he had to stop playing tennis a couple of years ago due to a severely messed up back. He scheduled a back surgery at Stanford, where they fixed the problem in his lower back. However, after about 4 days at home, his surgery site began to ooze. We called Stanford, who instructed him to come back immediately. After being admitted, he was diagnosed with MSSA. He stayed for a week, and was sent home with a PIC-Line, with which my mom had to give him 3 injections with STRONG antibiotics a day. After about 6 months of the pic line, he was then prescribed a strong dose of Doxycycline, along with Cipro. He had to continue those, orally, for another year, after which he was finally done with antibiotics. 

About 4 months after ending his antibiotics, he became tired. He would sleep until 9:30, go to his office to open up, then come back home and take a two-hour nap. He never complained of any pain or discomfort, so we chalked his fatigue up to lingering side-effects from his MSSA infection. In the mean-time, he’s having some stomach issues, which he believed to be caused by mucus/allergies upsetting his stomach. He also mentioned, casually, that he was dealing with hemorrhoids. He’s had a finicky stomach his entire life, so he didn’t seem too worried. Fast forward…

In October, he and my mom went on vacation to Mexico. But soon after landing, he came down with an insane “stomach flu.” He spent the whole 6 days there in the hotel room, vomiting. A doctor came in to give him IV fluids and Zofran, and chalked it up to a gnarly case of Norovirus.

He gets home, and isn’t vomiting as much, but he still can’t eat. I pleaded with him to go to his doctor… that stomach flus were not supposed to last almost 3 weeks. But he assumed it was just his usual stomach issues, magnified by whatever flu he had.

On November 8th, my sister went to his office to find him passed out on his desk, slurring and unable to stand up. I rushed over and we carried him to my car, where I rushed him to the ER. I was SO worried it would be his heart or a stroke, but his tests came back normal. What was NOT normal was the amount of blood he was vomiting. Black, coffee-like substance, which he argued with the doctor was just “the blueberry pie he had eaten that morning.” After a CT scan, it’s clear that there’s a huge mass at the top of his small intestine. They ambulance him to another local hospital where they do a scope, finding a duodenal ulcer. They cauterize it, and admit him, thinking he just needed time to heal. But about a day later, he begins hemorrhaging terribly after walking to the bathroom with his nurse. He ends up getting about two 12L bags of transfusions, as well as a few smaller ones. They called him a “Massive Transfusion Patient,” and called our family in, thinking he wouldn’t make it. They almost lost him twice, but were able to sew him up and get the bleeding to stop. The doctor told my dad that the ulcer was about the size of a tennis ball… He told him it was one of the largest he’d ever seen in his career. He also said that the ulcer was eating away at his arteries (blood vessels?), and that it was a miracle that he lived through that surgery. We thought we were in the clear— it was a miracle! Until a couple of days later, when my dad began bleeding again. My mom and I rushed in to be with him before surgery… and the amount of blood they were pumping out of him… I didn’t even know so much blood with in our bodies. The transfusion bags didn’t look like they’d be able to keep him with the amount he was losing.

After the second surgery, his doctor said that it had reopened, and she double sewed it up to make sure it didn’t break again. We spent a few hours with him. He was in tremendous pain, but was still his witty, gentle, and loving self. I sat by his bed and tried to massage his calves, but noticed they were ballooned up and huge. Like they were going to pop. Visiting hours were over, so we said out “I love you’s” and goodbyes and told him to hang in there. We’d be back tomorrow. But at 11:30 that night, we received a call that the hemorrhaging started again. And this time, he went into shock. His heart couldn’t handle the stress anymore. They gave up after about 20 minutes of trying to revive him. 

Our family is so blindsided by all of this. And there are a couple of things that we just can’t wrap our heads around:

1. Why didn’t he feel any physical pain when they pressed on his stomach. Is that normal? He only had the symptoms of feeling sick, but said he felt no actual stomach pain before being admitted. 

2. I know that people with Ulcerative Colitis get resections. Why couldn’t they just cut the section with the ulcer out? 

3. He also had narrowing of the esophagus, which they said can cause peptic ulcers. Could the antibiotics have been the blame for all of this. Some research shows that Doxycycline has a 1% chance of causing these symptoms. With the large dose he was on, as well as the lengthy treatment term, could this have been the case?

4. How did this develop so quickly? He was very good about getting his labs done, and had been dealing with Stanford for the past couple of years. Is it something that they would have caught before giving him his back surgery?

All-in-all, we are just devastated. This was so unexpected, and he was such a loved, valued part of our family. We just came wrap our minds around he we didn’t notice anything. My mom keeps blaming herself for not realizing that he shouldn’t have been so tired all of the time. I blame myself for not buckling him into my car and taking him to his doctor when he had his “stomach flu.” I know it’s not our fault, but grief tends to come with intrusive thoughts. 

Thank you for your time. His doctors were wonderful, and we’re grateful for all of the support they provided him. They were “dancing” after his first surgery because they’d saved him. And were subsequently so sad about how it turned out. 

Editing to add: He hadn’t taken NSAIDS for the past couple of years due to his doctor’s advice. He also didn’t drink. ",2,1738807689.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Looking for supportive schools, ideally in an area with some walkability. Busy parks, walkable coffee shops, near downtown Overland Park or similar vibes would be great. We need to be near OP for the aforementioned family reasons, but are open to other close by areas if they might fit the bill. 

We both will be continuing to work from home, so commute isn’t really a consideration. We’d love to be able to walk or bike to the local elementary school.

For context, I have been to my normal checkups, and my dr seems to be unperturbed by my higher blood pressure. I'm 20, weigh 120 lbs as a 5'7 woman, I hike almost every day (mountainous city) and backpack every summer. In my opinion, I'm pretty fit--after college started, though, I did eat more fast food than usual (I came from a family who never ate fast food; my first time eating McDonald's was when I was like 18). However, I have a blood pressure of 130/84, which from online charts seems to be indicate of hypertension.
I do not get as much sleep as I'd like to, but I sparsely drink coffee and only eat out with my friends maybe once a month/2 months. However, my family has a history of high blood pressure, and most of my relatives have died from strokes, which leads me to think that while some environmental factors may be at play, some genetic ones are too. My doctor has not said anything about or raised any alarm bells though, so I'm wondering if I'm overthinking it, or if I should start preliminarily trying to mitigate it, and if so, how.

Or explore NYC in a.m.?,"**My question: is hanging out in Hoboken from 9:30am-ish to 1pm on a random Wednesday fun enough to arrive hours early for our Stevens tours?** What we could potentially do near Stevens campus while we wait: we like **coffee houses** (lattes, boba, bakeries), **thrift stores, record stores** (if open at 10am or 11am) & sit-down breakfasts at **old-style diners**. We are pretty good at entertaining ourselves. And/or we could eat at Stevens cafeteria. Or we could just sit for part of the time on campus, to rest and take in the beautiful view over the river (**for weather, it will be late April**).

**Or, is it boring to hang out in Hoboken on a random Wednesday morning, so we should instead spend those bonus 3 hours exploring a bit of Manhattan prior to making our way to Stevens?**

**I am very unfamiliar with Hoboken so that's why I am asking.**

Other background: daughter has never been to NYC & it's her dream ... **BUT we are spending the final 2 days of this college trip in NYC being tourists, so it's not ""necessary"" to see NYC this first morning** for the bonus 3 hours we have prior to our Stevens tour.

**That Wednesday morning, we will have just gotten off a long overnight red-eye flight. Our plane lands at 8am (perhaps earlier) at JFK** (I have not finalized flight: it might be arriving JFK 7am, might be 8:30am). Our **Stevens tours will be at 1pm and a different tour at 3pm**. The 3pm one is a more specialized ""must do""for us  that we are really excited about.

**We will be lingering at Stevens/Hoboken** ***after*** **the 3pm tour until 5:30pm/6pm to wait out traffic** as we then drive a few hours that night (I will be renting a car in Hoboken). **So we do have time both between the two tours, and for about 1.5 hours after the last tour to check out more of Stevens/Hoboken**. So I don't know that we really need those three extra hours in the morning (maybe leaning in to the idea we should spend them in NYC).

Other info: **we will be taking public transportation from JFK to Stevens the Wednesday morning of our Stevens tours. The subway/bus has several points where we can get off to see a bit of NYC: I will research the best option.** We will travel light so not have much luggage at all (and might even find a bag check place for those 3 hours, if I can research a super reliable one). Reasons for public transportation from airport: takes same travel time as driving, we save money by not renting a car until later in day. But most importantly, I'll be tired from red-eye flight so it would be a bad idea to drive a rental in the morning through Manhattan! I'm not worried about figuring out the public transportation aspect (I already did; and we have family abroad & we like big cities so we are comfortable with subways, bus, walking in a big city).

I am actually mad and also anxious now. So I live with my partner and autistic BIL. It’s been speculated I could be on the spectrum but I do have severely bad PTSD. I get overstimulated very easily, stressed out, and often go into freeze mode to do a lot my BIL is doing. The #1 thing has been pacing. I’ve explained before, I have no issue with pacing even I do it some days, but in my space. He does it in the shared space and gets mad if me or my cat are “in his way.” He has been politely asked to stop, directly, and even angrily after he ignored us and then told us to fuck off. He makes me anxious when he does directly behind me while I cook, while I do anything actually. It makes me so anxious that I enter a state of panic but I can’t move, talk, or nothing. I have had breakdowns from how overstimulating it is, I can hear every footstep, every breath, every shuffle, every little thing and it makes me want to rip my skin off. He did it again today when my partner was in the shower, in my pathway too and watched me as I got anxious and couldn’t move. I ran as soon as he left and I went to bed and barely have left my room again. I’m still shaking. I decided to contact my partner today since my BIL has started listening and watching for when my partner is paying attention and he’ll stop pacing when he does so I look like I’m just tweaking but as soon as my partner (who does have pretty heavy adhd) focuses on something, he starts behind me again. I told him that and for the first time since I was extremely traumatized, said very direct this has to stop. My partner is coming home to figure stuff out. Now, the next part. I don’t have much money. I have sparse income and I do what I can to help (but my partner gets paid enough to handle all bills and groceries) But, I did a ton of stuff this week to face my trauma and grow. I bought myself a special coffee creamer flavor just for me to celebrate because I thought I deserved it and my BIL ended up drinking all the coffee creamer that we all use except for one cup. I put my name on it right on the front and put it on my side of the fridge. My BIL knows to not touch my stuff with my name especially without permission because it’s started conflict before. Well, I happen to hear him in the kitchen and something told me to listen. He’s been using my coffee creamer and trying to hide it. I did notice it was going way too fast for just me and that I only used it 3 times for small cups. I decided to not make a false claim so I swallowed my fear and I walked out of my room, and he was drinking coffee, using my creamer. I didn’t have the energy or confidence to say anything, I got scared but as soon as he finished the cup he washed it too so there would be no proof so he couldn’t be caught. He never bothers to do the dishes quick. And it isn’t like he doesn’t get what he wants neither. He has no job, all he does is play video games, be mean to us, and slack on all his chores (dishes is one and he always leaves food on them, unless he’s hiding something.) This week, for groceries, I even took out some sodas I want so he could have flavors he wanted. I’m so upset. What’s worse is I’ve never said no either, all I’ve ever said is please ask me. And every time he has asked me something, I’ve said yes! I don’t know what to do. I texted my partner about this because I am so mad, I am waiting for him to get home, I don’t know if this is ok for me to be mad about but it’s just building up the things he is doing and specifically toward me. People tell me to kick him out, but he has no where to go. No other family is going to take him it seems, we don’t have anywhere to put him and he needs the help. I am trying to be patient and loving but every day he is pushing me further and this is one of the few things I’m mad about. The pacing is triggering me into survival mode and fear, the dishes not being clean cause me to be unable to eat a lot anyway, and he never cleans up after himself but I’ve learned to handle it the best I can. I don’t know what to do. I just want to cry.",3,1738807493.0,AutisticAdults,3,1.0,False

Hello people!

So, umm, I kind of liked a freelance model who lives in Japan (she’s not Japanese though, but she’s East Asian) and I wanted to meet her as soon as came to Japan. She has an Instagram page of about 30 thousand followers, but for some reason she doesn’t get many comments (usually about 10 comments) so perhaps I have more chance to show myself in her daily social media. I saw on her instagram page last autumn that she was to hold her first solo photo exhibition of her life (without collaboration with any other model) and I thought that was also a good moment to show myself to her! The first time I went there, she didn’t notice me at first but when she was with walking with her friend at the exhibition she saw me she looked me in the eyes for about 4 seconds and said nothing, then in order to not look rude I stopped looking at her, did a little bow and said Hello in Japanese to her. After that session of the exhibition ended she came to me and started talking to me in Japanese. She asked me if I was a photographer too, why have I come to Japan and for how long will I stay here. I answered that I used to have a camera and often took landscape photos but have no experience with portraits and I told her that I have come to Japan to study as a student. She talked to me in totally informal Japanese although i did in formal (Japanese has many levels of honorifics) then she started talking in English to me when she saw that I was a bit slow with Japanese. I was surprised when she did that and when I told her she said that it was because she is not Japanese and told me her country of origin. 
After we got out of the building the photographers at the exhibition left and we talked for about 10 minutes. She asked me if I have any camera in mind and told me that the camera I wanted to buy is such an expensive camera to start with and recommended other cameras for starting. Then she told me that her mother was coming to pick her up and then she said goodbye to me. 

Recently we went out for a paid photoshoot for two hours and it was such a good time (obviously she was paid as the model).
We talked for about 1 hour and 15 minutes the night before and except the first ten minutes the rest were about personal stuff, like our favorite anime, her family her friends, what she does in her free time and so on and she told me not to worry because she would teach me how to take good portraits (I genuinely love photography btw, it wasn’t only because of her) and she did so! When we were shooting she told me that I apologize too much and should stop that.
I tend to pick my fingernail skin when I get nervous and at time, needless to say it happened. I suddenly told her that I had to grab a wet tissue, she asked me why and ai showed her my finger. She said “Oh my god! Are you alright?! Why did that even happen?”. I told her why and she told me “Oh why are you so nervous? don’t be nervous lah! I will teach you how to take portraits, so no need to be nervous!”

We talked a lot about many things during the photoshoot session too, about our favorite games and anime, about how much she loves dogs and has a dog as well, about her family, etc.
When we were about to she told me that I had to go the other way, to get to the school but I insisted and told her that I had another place to go and I was fine going along with her. she paused a bit, looked into my eyes for a couple of seconds and then said “okay then! Just don’t be late for your class, okay?” She even asked me some Japanese characters before we left, like a quiz from the billboards on the street. I wanted to treat her to a cup of coffee or tea but she refused and said that usually she has free time after the photoshoots but this time she had another place to go. I gave her a gift of her favorite character when we were about to leave and she accepted happily, she saw the dogs on the gift bag and that was when she started talking about dogs.
Then we said goodbye and went separate ways.
After the photoshoot she said thanks for the small gift.

I finished editing her photos recently and sent her the link, asked for her feedback and said happy lunar new year, but she still hasn’t read or answered. 

By the way, when I told her that I have no real friends she told me that she doesn’t have many friends either and she usually watches anime or exercises or calls her parents or grandma in her free time. She also told me that she has 5 levels of friendship and told me that even the photographers have told her that she replies very slowly.

I think I might have fallen in love with her, and she has such an energetic and cheerful personality!

So what do you guys think?

Do you think that she might like me back?

I would appreciate it very much if you have any advices for me!

By the way sorry for the long text! it’s such a long story but I tried to type it as short as possible without losing any important context (I hope she doesn’t find this post) 😅",1,1738807425.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Not the soft, familiar hush of an empty room, but something deeper. A silence with weight. A silence that seeps into the hollows of my skull, thick and absolute.  

**Deafening.**

The clock by my bedside glows 7:47 AM.

The sun should be up. The birds should be screaming. The world should be waking.  

I hear nothing.  

I rise, slow, deliberate. The floor is cold beneath my feet. I walk to the window.

I press my palm against the glass.

I blink.

The light outside is **wrong**.

Not morning, not night. Just. Wrong.

The sun is bleeding out. Hurt. **Screaming.** The sky is stained in hues of violence.

*My eyes are stabbing into my face.*

I stumble back. Try my phone. Dead. The wrong light illuminates my hands. I close the curtains.

I do not understand what this means.

*And my head throbs.*

I go to the bathroom, splash cold water on my face. The faucet runs. I feel it against my skin, slipping through my fingers. But it does not make a sound. I do not hear the water hit the sink.  

I do not hear my own breathing.  

I do not hear my own heartbeat.  

The silence is **absolute**.  

I open my mouth, try to speak. 

Nothing. 

I try to scream. 

Nothing.  

*My eardrums are about to burst.*

I stagger into the living room, touching, seeing, feeling. Desperate.

The objects look familiar but feel alien under my fingertips. 

A coffee mug cold with yesterdays lies. A book whose words swim and squirm like drowning things. A clock that's run out of time.

*My skull is splitting.*

Then, in the corner of my eye.

A photo. In a frame. On a desk.

I stare.

The eyes inside stare back.

**They sing.**

*I slam my head against the wall.*

Memories begin to surface like bubbles in thick syrup. A dream about falling. The taste of mint toothpaste. The sound of a door closing. Normal things. Safe things. 

*Again.*

I cling to them. A drowning person to driftwood.

This must be a dream. Of course. Dreams don't have sound. Dreams don't make sense. Dreams feel real until you realize they're not.

*And again.*

I let out a silent laugh that tastes of copper and relief. How strange that I didn't see it sooner. Any moment now, I'll wake up. 

*Over.*

And the world will remember how to make noise.

*And over.*

It will right itself, will remember its own name, will remember mine.

*And over.*

The wrong light seeps under my eyelids like jaundiced honey. 

*And overagainoveragainoveragain—*

I feel my consciousness fade. Feel reality rising like a tide.

**Relief.**

I wake up to silence.

1iireq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1iireq6/transaction_classification_challenges_and/,Transaction classification challenges and solutions,"Hey all, thought I'd make a quick post outlining some of the challenges I've had to overcome / am still stumped on when it comes to classifying transactions.

The reason I started this project was I didn't want to manually categorize my transactions anymore, wanted greater visibility into my business spend, and found that most budgeting apps do really poorly with categorization. around ~80% of transactions were off for most of them.

So I've been building this system to categorize them myself and I wanted to see what you think about the challenges I've faced with it and the solutions I've come up with.


# 1. Classification Algos

I found most open source classification algos did a good job with larger vendors (Amazon, Spotify ... ) but failed with things like a local grocery store.

So I used a combined system of a classical classification algo for the larger vendors and for the more niche vendors I've leveraged an LLM + web searching to augment the transaction with relevant data for it's classification.

This brought the number of correct classifications up to 90-95% correct.

# 2. Transactions are too low resolution

How can you categorize a place a transaction at Walmart or Costco? Is it grocery, pharmacy, department store, ... ?

Transactions simply don't have enough information sometimes.

Most of the time it's pretty 1:1 - Starbucks == Coffee

but for cases like these, I think the only solution is to take pictures of receipts.

However, as I work to turn this into something that other people can use - the UX just doesn't make sense for most people. Taking a picture of your receipt is possibly too cumbersome for most.

# 3. Search data

I've opted to use google custom search for getting the data to classify the vendor better.

but there's a few other possibilities
### 1. Google Business Profile APIs
- pros:
  - very accurate, and concise - two things LLMs need for good output
  - seemingly has most businesses
- cons:
  - very expensive ($0.025 / per call)

### 2. SerpAPI
- pros:
  - similar data
  - slightly less expensive
- cons:
  - but still also very expensive (~0.015 / per call)

### 3. Brave Search
- pros:
  - very cheap
- cons:
  - not as accurate or concise

I imagine I must be missing something here, surely there's a better API / data set that can map more niche places no?


Anyways, hope someone can get value out of this post. It's been an interesting project, finally getting to the point where it's becoming pretty useful for my personal needs.

I’m waiting on the word from 2 companies both are pt social media work that would work for my schedule both of those would pay around $20.  I just got sent a email regarding scheduling an interview for a coffee shop where they pay is way lower $10-12 than those 2 other places and they want to meet on tomorrow buttttt like what if I haven’t heard back from the other companies by then and the coffee place wants to nail down a start date😩

Prior company (also public) I was with for 8 years. So I guess I'm a ""loyal"" employee. But I've been consistently underpaid, due to that. I have previously been happy (ish) in my current role, although roles/responsibility and title have been blurry at best for the last 18 months, and work/life balance has been rough. Recently relocated for the company, so I'm in my repayment period. 
But a recruiter from a staffing agency reached out to me on linkedin with a director role. Leadership and Directorship has always been my career goal. After 2 rounds with the hiring manager (VP Operations) and coffee with the CEO, I've been offered a Director of PMO role.

Here's the comparison:

* Currently make \~$120k as a Process Improvement Manager with a PMP, plus bonus & LTI with a 3 year vesting structure. Previously made $95k as a Project Manager in Operations in 2022. Director offer is for $200k + bonus, no LTI. so, about a 67% increase to base salary.
* Right now I manage one direct report plus a matrix structure of PMs/ PgMs (indirects). Director role would have 3-4 directs right now, but VP mentioned potentially consolidating more teams into the PMO as I get settled (bringing design/construction under the umbrella), so I don't know how many people would be on my team.
* Current company is publicly traded, new company is owned by a private equity, it was bought in 2021 so really right in the 3-5 year window for resale.
* Existing role is burning me out due to chronic corporate swirl on decision making & structure, being asked to perform duties outside of my title, and company has been in a state of change/turmoil for the last 2+ years. I guess I currently feel ""safe"" but shareholder/investor demands could definitely force cuts to my dept because we are a support team. Director role is walking into a team where they let go of previous director and 3 PMs for failing to deliver, and this company is looking for someone to ""right the ship"" - VP told me during interview i would have autonomy to build the team as I see fit.
* Director role would have me stretching my knowledge base with reporting and systems, currently I have support teams for those functions.
* Stress is high for both gigs, although maybe I have more ""cover"" at current company because of the corporate layers, but also, as mentioned before - little growth and autonomy in current job.
* Commute is better for new role, but benefits are slightly less comprehensive, it's a smaller company so that's kind of to be expected.

I wasn't actively looking for a new role, mainly due to my repayment handcuffs, but the increase in pay is substantial. The red flags for me are the private equity piece, and the ambiguity around what the department will truly look like, and what my responsibilities will actually include once in the position.

So I decided over night to upgrade my coffee. Tried to check the expensive grinder cheap espresso machine setup. So the grinder is the baratza esp and the machine is the Evvo something. 84 bucks. Pressurized portafiler and I don't have another one. So I know I should manage my expectations. Im grinding Butasso beans which I enjoyed so far with the Philips there(but not really).

The result? From the very first grind at the advised setting (15),damn the smell is amazing even with old beans, I started the machine for a single(even though I loaded it for a double,duh) nothing came out...let's call it presoaking or whatever . Ran again...nothing came out. Damn it I choked it??? Ok switch to manual,run the water and goodness started flowing. Tasted it and yeah it was bitter as fuck but holy shit the flavours and aroma coming out of it,it wasn't even hot enough but damn it was the best coffe i had in years and it can only get better. Then I tried the milk thing and I guess I need some practice.... And a milk pitcher..

Next upgrades are probably a milk pitcher first,then probably a regular portafiler? Fresh specialty beans is of course the first and a way to store them (right now I use the fold over the bag technique,don't kill me I'm learning)

Anything else I'm missing? Do you think I should just ditch the machine and get something else?

1iir3x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1iir3x6/small_debt_big_principle_why_not_paying_back/,"Small Debt, Big Principle: Why Not Paying Back Matters!!!","So, I need someone to tell me if my perspective is flawed. There’s a situation with one of my coworkers that’s been on my mind, and I need to know if I’m overthinking it. About two weeks ago, I was at work about to go on break when one of my coworkers asked where I was headed. I told her, “I want to get myself a coffe from Starbucks.” She then turned to another coworker and said, “Oh, she’s going to get something from Starbucks. I want a bagel, but I don’t have cash.”I then overheard the other coworker telling her, “It’s fine, I’ll buy it for you.” On my way out, the coworker who was buying the bagel yelled after me to grab one for her and that she’d pay me back. I agreed—it was just $4, no big deal and she reassured me she’d give me my money back. When I came back from lunch, I gave my coworker her bagel, and then went to the manager’s office to take my break and enjoy my coffee. I wasn’t stressing the money since it was really busy, and they were both handling customers. When I came back from break I noticed the coworker who I gave the bagel to gave it to the other coworker who was suppose to be giving me the money for the bagel. (I got her a plain bagel and she did not like plain bagel). No problem with me, she still assured me that the coworker would give me the money. By the end of my shift, things had slowed down, so there was plenty of time for her to give me my money.  I didn’t bring it up because I wanted to see what she would do. It wasn’t about the $4, I was testing her character. I left that day without getting my money.

Fast forward to about a week later. We were on an opening shift together, and the first thing she said to me was, “Do you want coffee?” I said yes, and she started placing an order on her phone. When she asked me I was under the impression that she was paying me back for the bagel, so at first I did not offer to give her money for my drink. To me in that moment I was perceving her behavior as returning the favor. While she was doing that , she also ordered for the coworker I had bought the bagel for (btw the coworker is a 72 year old black woman who has breast cancer and they are really close outside of work). She handed me her phone to place my order, and when I did, I made sure to keep my total low. I got a tall iced caramel macchiato with sugar-free vanilla and light caramel which was around the same price as the bagel. While ordering, I accidentally pressed a few buttons and thought I might have deleted someone’s order. I told her, but it turned out I didn’t mess anything up. When I gave her phone back, I could tell she had a slight attitude. And I don’t think it was because of the mistake, I think it was because she had to pay for my drink. That made me feel weird about the situation, so I told her, “Let me know when you go pick up the drinks so I can give you my Zelle QR code to pay you back” (I had manager duties to take care of, so I couldn’t do it right away). She just replied, “Okay.” After that, the vibe felt a little less tense. Before she went to get the drinks, I caught her again and told her to scan my QR code so she could request the money. That’s when she said, “It’s okay, consider it a treat from me.” I thanked her, of course, but in my mind, I was like, ""Oh, *A treat from you? Hmm… interesting.""*

Here’s my thing—I don’t mind doing things for people without expecting anything in return. By nature, I’m a giver. But I had to stop that because I was constantly giving to people who didn’t see me as worthy of the same reciprocity. And that’s fine not everyone sees you as part of their community. But in this case, it wasn’t about the *funky-ass* $4. It was the principle. This woman is a 54-year-old Black woman, and I expected a level of integrity from her that I feel she didn’t display. I’m 25 so it felt like she was trying to play me. The fact that she initially had no problem letting me buy the coffee, but then turned around and said, “It’s just a treat from me,” felt disingenuous. Ever since then, I’ve been side-eyeing her. And yeah, I’ll admit it was a little childish of me to *test* her integrity. But sometimes, you have to test a MF soul just to see who they really are.",2,1738806238.0,blackgirls,1,1.0,False

Basically earlier this week I was in a college class with this guy who is a handful of years older than me. We've been paired up a couple times in class for engagement activities and he's seemed super nice. He asked me to hang back for a bit so he can ask me to expand on something I talked about in class. I ask where he wants to talk, he says in the lobby or a coffee shop would be good, notably public places. I was most comfortable in the lobby, so we talked there. 

The conversation stuck to our majors and then careers- his involving cuisine, and he asked about the cuisine of my culture and I talked about that. Very innocent conversation. I find him really friendly and fun so we exchanged numbers and Instagram. Note that I have no problem exchanging info with people on the regular, especially people who go to my college. After that he asked if I'd ever wanna try cooking with him or hit up different restaurants. I asked if this was like a one-on-one thing, he said it could be a date, a friend hangout or a thing with other people, whatever I was down for. I told him I had to look at my schedule because I'm busy, and I'm also currently dating. He's super chill about it and then we part ways. Pretty normal.

After that, though, I got like a super anxious feeling. On Instagram I decided to look through who he follows just out of curiosity. Its mostly gym bros, which is fine, but his most recent follow is a podcast that spits out a lot of misogynistic and Islamophobic rhetoric, and there was even a comment made by a podcast host making light of sexual assault. Mind you, I am a Muslim-raised female and he knows this. Am I overreacting for now feeling EXTREMELY uncomfortable with being around him? He was so nice to me, but now I'm having the urge to sit somewhere else in class with a female acquaintance and limit my interaction with him. I really don't wanna just ice him out altogether because he seems nice as a person (I also don't wanna make him angry and seek me out, because he's like a big tall guy and I'm under 5'4). 

Yes, I know it was kind of stupid to just give my number out, but I do that a lot with classmates of any gender for group assignments or casual friendships and I made my boundaries clear. Throwing my head back and crying rn. ",2,1738806135.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.75,False
1iir1lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1iir1lk/a_foreveralone_mans_plan_for_valentines_day/,A ForeverAlone man's plan for Valentine's Day,"Kill myself.

Just kidding!

Seriously, though, hear me out. I put 100% of my effort into dating for over a decade. I was on like 9 dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I was going to Meetup ( https://www.meetup.com/ ) and Eventbrite ( https://www.eventbrite.com/ ) events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's co-gender running club and before that my university's running club. I majored in Computer Science and got a high paying coding job at Amazon because I thought a job would help me attract women.

After all that effort, the most I got was a 6 month (mostly platonic) dating relationship and a few one night stands (all of which were with women who weren't particularly hot or good-looking). I was never married, engaged, or in an official boyfriend and girlfriend relationship despite being a straight man who wanted those things. Now I'm 31 and I've given up.

I'm just tired of trying. The juice is not worth the squeeze. The amount of effort put in is not worth what I get out of it. I have been single every Valentine's day for my entire post-pubescent life and I'm sick of trying. At this age I lack the necessary hormonal horniness to motivate me to want to try.

So here's my plan for Valentine's Day. I'm going to go to the massage parlor and get a full-body massage (from a woman), and then I'm going to go to the strip club, grab a meal with a stripper (for a fee of course), get some lap dances (from said nude stripper), and have a fun time (my local strip club doesn't allow sex but full-body touching is allowed). I have this one stripper's number (I'm just a client), but I'm going to call her after she gets off work and ask her if she would accept money from me to meet me outside the strip club. That's my plan for Valentine's Day.

Basically, I'm done seeking out free time and free sex from women. One year of swiping on dating apps is not worth the single one-on-one date with no compatibility that I get out of that effort. Three years of swiping on dating apps every day is not worth the single one-night-stand with a not-so-attractive woman that I get out of that effort.

**TL;DR** - I'm going to pay on Valentine's Day instead of expecting anything free from women. Also, fuck dating. I put in the effort, I'm in my 30's now, I'm done. Oh, and also I have severe psychiatric and/or personality problems that aren't really fixed by medication or therapy, maybe that's the issue, but again it's not really fixable.",0,1738806044.0,lonely,0,0.5,False

Chapter One: Empty
I wake to silence.
Not the comfortable kind, the kind where the house settles into itself, sighing against the weight of time. No, this is different. Wrong. A void. A hush so deep it presses against my ears, muffling the sound of my breath.
I reach across the bed, fingers brushing cold sheets.
My husband’s side is empty. It has been for almost two years now, but I still reach for him sometimes. A habit I can’t seem to break. But that isn’t what unsettles me.
It takes me a moment to realize what’s missing.
Lily.
She always wakes me up before sunrise, her little feet padding across the hardwood, her weight sinking into the bed as she climbs in beside me. Some mornings, she presses her cold toes against my legs just to hear me shriek.
But today—nothing.
I sit up too fast, the room tilting, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""Lily?"" My voice scrapes the air. No answer.
The house feels too still as I throw the blankets aside, feet hitting the cold floor. I move on instinct, my hand trailing along the wall as I make my way down the hallway. The doors are all shut except for one—Lily’s.
It’s wide open.
She never sleeps with the door open. She says the hallway is too dark, too full of shadows that stretch and crawl when the wind shifts.
I step inside, my breath coming fast now.
Her bed is empty. The blankets were thrown back, her stuffed rabbit—Mr. Flop—missing from its usual spot. The room smells faintly of lavender and something else, something stale, like the ghost of a bad dream.
A small shiver works its way up my spine.
""Lily?"" I call again, louder this time, moving through the house now, checking the bathroom, the kitchen, and even the coat closet. The grandfather clock in the hallway ticks sluggishly, marking time that has begun to feel unreal.
The back door is locked. The windows are shut.
She isn’t here.
I grip the edge of the kitchen counter, trying to steady my breathing.
Where is she?
I turn back toward the hallway, and for a split second—just a breath of a moment—I swear I see something.
A shape, small and still, standing in the doorway to her room.
I blink, and it’s gone.
A cold weight settles in my stomach.
I reach for the phone with shaking hands and dial. The moment the line clicks open, I hear my voice before I even recognize it as mine.
""My daughter is missing.""

Chapter Two: The Search
The police arrive in under twenty minutes.
The sirens slice through the quiet morning, red and blue lights flashing against the walls of my house, warping the shadows into something jagged. Two officers step out first, all straight backs and unreadable faces. A third car pulls up moments later, and from it emerges Detective Wallace.
I know him. Everyone in town does. He’s been here forever, seen every crime this place has to offer—most of them small, forgettable things. Nothing like this.
""Mrs. Holloway?"" He says my name like it’s a question like he’s testing how steady I am.
I nod, arms wrapped around myself, though I can’t stop shaking. The air is too cold for September. Or maybe it’s just me.
""Tell me everything,"" Wallace says.
My tongue feels thick, and slow. ""I—I woke up and she was gone. She always wakes me up first, but today... today she didn’t."" I shake my head, trying to keep my thoughts from unraveling. ""The back door was locked. The windows were shut. I checked the whole house. I— I don’t understand where she could’ve gone.""
Wallace’s eyes flick toward the front door. ""Mind if we come in?""
I step aside, and the officers spill into my home. I watch them move through the rooms, their boots too loud against the floor. One of them radios for a K9 unit. Another speaks in hushed tones to a woman taking notes.
Wallace keeps his eyes on me. ""When was the last time you saw her?""
I swallow hard. ""Last night. She went to bed around eight-thirty. She was tired—she’d been playing outside all day.""
""Did she seem upset? Was there anything unusual about her behavior?""
""No,"" I say automatically, but something tugs at me. A flicker of something just out of reach. A feeling. A sound.
Crying.
Lily had been crying last night. I remember it now. Small, hiccupping sobs muffled by her hands.
I squeeze my eyes shut. Why was she crying?
""Mrs. Holloway?"" Wallace’s voice brings me back.
I open my eyes. ""No,"" I say again, firmer this time. ""She was fine.""
Wallace studies me for a moment before nodding. He gestures toward the stairs. ""Would you mind showing me her room?""
I lead him down the hall, my footsteps feeling too loud like they don’t belong to me. The door to Lily’s room is still open, yawning like a dark mouth.
Inside, everything is exactly as I left it. The blankets were tossed back. The pillow indented where her head had rested. A few books are scattered on the floor.
But now, standing in the doorway with Wallace at my side, something feels wrong.
It takes me a second to realize what it is.
The air.
The room smells...off. Under the lavender and fabric softener, there’s something else. Something faint.
Damp earth.
A shudder rolls through me.
""Does anything look out of place?"" Wallace asks.
My eyes scan the room. The toys, the clothes, the tiny pink slippers beside the bed.
Then I see it.
Mr. Flop.
He sits on the floor near the closet, half-hidden in the shadows. I didn’t notice him before. But that’s not what makes my stomach lurch.
It’s the way he’s positioned.
Lily never went anywhere without him—she always tucked him into bed beside her, his floppy ears peeking out from under the blankets. But now he sits on the floor, slumped unnaturally, his head tilted at an odd angle.
Like someone put him there.
Like someone wanted me to find him.
My throat tightens. ""He wasn’t there before.""
Wallace crouches, picks up the rabbit, turning it over in his hands. His fingers brush something dark, smeared along the fabric.
My stomach clenches.
Blood.
A tiny streak, dried now, staining the soft fur.
Wallace exhales, his face unreadable. Then, carefully, he places Mr. Flop into an evidence bag.
I watch the rabbit disappear behind plastic, something hot and sour rising in my throat.
This isn’t real. This isn’t happening.
But then Wallace turns to me, his face dark with something I can’t quite name.
And in that moment, I know—
They think I did something to her.

Chapter Three: Vanishing Points
The house feels wrong with strangers inside it.
The officers move through my space like they own it, opening drawers, scanning shelves, and stepping over Lily’s small, scattered belongings without care. Their radios crackle with updates—words I can’t make sense of.
Outside, more people arrive. I see them through the window—neighbors, onlookers, standing on the sidewalk, whispering to each other. Some I recognize. Some I don’t. Their faces are pale in the early morning light, their eyes darting toward my house with something I can’t name.
Fear?
Pity?
Suspicion?
A chill moves through me.
Detective Wallace hasn’t left my side since we found Mr. Flop. He’s watching me now, quiet, unreadable.
""Mrs. Holloway,"" he says, voice careful, ""can you think of anyone who might want to harm Lily?""
His words feel foreign. Like an infection working its way beneath my skin.
""Harm?"" My voice cracks at the word. ""She’s seven years old.""
Wallace doesn’t flinch. ""Sometimes it’s not a stranger.""
I suck in a sharp breath.
""Are you implying—""
""No one’s implying anything,"" he says quickly. Too quickly. ""But in cases like this, we have to look at every possibility.""
Every possibility.
The words settle in my stomach like lead.
I turn away from him, scanning the room, searching for something—anything—to ground me. My eyes land on the window, the backyard stretching beyond it. The old oak tree stands still, its gnarled branches clawing at the sky.
Lily spent hours under that tree, playing in the dirt, making up stories about buried treasure and lost kingdoms.
Buried treasure.
The thought sends a slow, creeping unease through me.
I turn back to Wallace. ""You should check outside,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""The backyard.""
He studies me for a long moment, then nods. ""I’ll send a team.""
I watch as he steps away, speaking into his radio. The other officers move with purpose now, pushing out the back door, their voices low, serious.
Something is happening.
Something is wrong.
And then—
A scream.
One of the officers. From outside.
For a moment, everything stops.
The voices. The movement. The world itself.
Then chaos. The officers rush toward the backyard. Wallace moves fast, hand hovering near his gun.
My pulse thrums in my ears.
I don’t realize I’m moving until I’m outside, the cold morning air biting my skin. The backyard is swarming with officers, circling the base of the oak tree.
Then I see it.
The dirt. Disturbed.
A hole, shallow but unmistakable.
And in it—
A small, pale hand.
Sticking out from the earth like a root.
I open my mouth, but no sound comes out. The world tilts, everything slipping sideways.
I sway on my feet. Someone grips my arm to steady me. Wallace. His voice is distant, muffled, like he’s speaking through water.
""Mrs. Holloway—""
I shake my head. No, no, no.
This isn’t happening.
This isn’t real.
But the earth is real. The hand is real. The smell of damp soil and something worse—rot—is real.
And in that moment, a memory slams into me.
Lily’s voice. Small. Trembling.
""Mommy, please—""
My breath catches.
I blink.
And for just a second—just the briefest moment—
I see her.
Standing at the edge of the yard.
Barefoot. Her nightgown fluttered in the wind.
Her face was pale, her eyes dark, staring straight at me.
Then she’s gone.
I stumble back, gasping. My head spins, my vision narrowing to a pinprick.
The last thing I hear before the world goes black—
Wallace’s voice was sharp and certain.
""Get the coroner.""

Chapter Four: The Girl in the Dirt
The world fades in and out.
Hands on my arms. Voices above me. The sky pressing down.
I don’t remember falling. I only remember her.
Standing there. Watching me. Lily.
But it wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.
Could it?
""Mrs. Holloway, can you hear me?""
I blink, the world snapping back into place. Wallace is kneeling beside me, his face tight with something I can’t name. The officers in the yard are moving like a well-oiled machine, roping off the base of the oak tree, speaking in clipped, urgent tones.
And then I see it again.
The hand.
Still there. Still reaching from the earth. Small. Still.
I turn away, bile rising in my throat.
""We need you to stay with us,"" Wallace says. His voice is firm but not unkind.
I squeeze my eyes shut. ""I—I don’t understand. That can’t be Lily.""
Wallace doesn’t respond right away. Then, carefully, ""Why not?""
Because I just saw her.
Because she was standing there, watching me.
Because I can still feel her.
I shake my head. ""She wouldn’t—she couldn’t be—"" My voice cracks, words turning to dust in my throat.
Wallace studies me, his gaze too heavy, like he’s looking through me instead of at me.
""Do you recognize the nightgown?"" he asks.
I don’t want to look.
But I have to.
Slowly, I turn my head, forcing myself to take it in. The dirt-streaked fabric. The tiny fingers curled slightly inward. The delicate lace trim at the wrist.
White with little pink flowers.
Lily’s favorite.
The one she wore last night.
A thin, broken sound escapes my lips. I press a hand to my mouth, my whole body shaking.
This isn’t real. It can’t be real.
One of the officers murmurs something into a radio. Another kneels by the grave, carefully brushing away more soil. The shape beneath the dirt becomes clearer. A small, still form, curled into itself.
Lily.
I hear a wretched, gasping sob and don’t realize it’s mine until Wallace reaches for me again, steadying me before I fall.
""This—this doesn’t make sense,"" I whisper. ""She was just here.""
Wallace’s expression doesn’t change. ""What do you mean?""
I open my mouth, but the words won’t come.
Because how do I explain what I saw? How do I tell him that my daughter—who has been buried in my backyard—was standing there just moments ago, staring at me?
They’ll think I’m crazy.
Maybe I am crazy.
Wallace exhales, dragging a hand down his face. ""Mrs. Holloway,"" he says, quieter now. ""We need to ask you some questions down at the station.""
The words are soft, but the meaning is sharp.
They don’t think I’m a grieving mother.
They think I’m a suspect.
The world is still spinning around me, a carousel I can’t escape.
Somewhere in the yard, an officer pulls out a small plastic bag.
Something inside it catches the light.
Something familiar.
A set of keys.
My keys.
Found in the dirt.
Near the body.
I suck in a sharp breath. No.
Wallace watches me carefully, his voice careful, quiet.
""Mrs. Holloway… do you remember how they got there?""
I stare at the keys. At the hand in the dirt. At the place where I swear—I swear—I saw Lily standing only minutes ago.
My vision blurs. My pulse pounds.
And somewhere, deep in the locked corridors of my mind—
Something shifts.
A door creaked open.
A whisper of a memory.
A voice.
""Mommy, please—""
Darkness presses in.

Chapter Five: Black Gaps
I wake to the sound of humming.
Soft. Sweet. Familiar.
A lullaby.
For a moment, I think I’m in Lily’s room, curled up beside her like I used to be when she had bad dreams. I can almost feel her small fingers tangling in my hair, the warmth of her breath against my skin.
Then I open my eyes.
And the cold, fluorescent lights above me shatter the illusion.
I’m not in Lily’s room.
I’m in a police station.
The walls are bare, the table in front of me a dull, gray slab. The air is thick with the scent of old coffee and something else—something metallic, like blood dried into the fibers of my clothes.
My clothes.
I look down, my stomach twisting.
Dirt stains my hands. My sleeves. The fabric of my jeans.
So much dirt.
A memory stirs—kneeling in the backyard, my fingers pushing into the earth, the sharp scent of soil filling my nose.
I grip the edge of the table, my breath coming too fast. No. No, that’s not real.
But the dirt is real. The body is real.
And I don’t know how it got there.
The door creaks open.
Detective Wallace steps inside, a file tucked under his arm. He looks tired, his mouth set in a hard line. He pulls out a chair, sits across from me, and lays the file on the table between us.
""How are you feeling?""
The question is strange. How am I feeling?
Like my insides have been hollowed out. My mind is a maze, and every turn leads to a dead end.
Like my daughter is dead and somehow—I don’t know how—I might be the reason why.
""I don’t know,"" I whisper.
Wallace nods as if he expected that answer. He flips the file open.
A photograph slides toward me.
A close-up of Lily’s small, lifeless hand emerges from the dirt.
I turn away, nausea rising in my throat.
Wallace doesn’t move the photo. ""We need to talk about last night, Mrs. Holloway.""
""I told you,"" I say, my voice hoarse. ""I don’t remember.""
His expression doesn’t change. ""Try.""
I squeeze my eyes shut, forcing myself to reach back into the black spaces of my mind. To the moment I tucked Lily into bed.
She was crying. Why was she crying?
""Mommy, I didn’t mean to—""
My fingers tighten around the edge of the table. ""She was upset,"" I murmur. ""I remember that.""
""What was she upset about?""
The memory is slippery, shifting every time I try to hold onto it.
""I—I didn’t mean to break it.""
Break what?
I shake my head. ""I don’t know.""
Wallace studies me, then pushes another item toward me.
A plastic evidence bag.
Inside—
A hammer.
Small. Old. The kind I kept in the junk drawer for hanging pictures.
The handle is covered in something dark.
A horrible, sickening recognition crawls through me.
Wallace watches my reaction carefully. ""We found this buried near the body."" His voice is calm. Even. Too even. ""There was blood on it.""
My vision tilts. ""No.""
Wallace exhales, sitting back. ""I need you to be honest with me, Mrs. Holloway.""
My hands are shaking. ""I didn’t—I would never—""
But the words won’t form properly.
Because in the space where the memory should be, there’s only darkness.
A gap. A hole. A place where something terrible should live.
Wallace leans forward, his voice quieter now. ""Can you tell me the last time you saw Lily alive?""
I squeeze my eyes shut, trying—trying—to reach back.
Lily’s face swims before me. Her wide, teary eyes. Her small hands gripped my shirt.
""Please don’t be mad, Mommy—""
Something inside me cracks.
A sound—a THUD.
The walls of my mind splinter.
And suddenly, I am there.
Standing in the bathroom.
Lily is on the floor.
Her nightgown is damp, clinging to her small frame.
The mirror above the sink is broken.
Shards of glass glitter on the tile like fallen stars.
And in my hand—
In my hand—
A hammer.
My breath catches.
The memory is sharp. Blinding. Undeniable.
I look up at Wallace, my throat tight, my stomach twisting.
Tears burn the back of my eyes.
""I think I did something,"" I whisper.
Wallace doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink.
I press my hands against my face, the truth unraveling inside me, slow and merciless.
""I think I killed my daughter.""

Chapter Six: Cracks in the Mirror
The words hang in the air, thick and suffocating.
""I think I killed my daughter.""
Wallace doesn’t react—not at first. His fingers tap against the file, slow and measured, like he’s waiting for me to take it back.
I don’t.
I can’t.
Because the moment I said it, something inside me shifted.
A door unlocked.
And now, more memories are bleeding through.
Not just flashes, but pieces—sharp, jagged fragments cutting their way in.
Lily, crying in the bathroom.
Lily, whispering, I didn’t mean to, Mommy. Please don’t be mad.
Lily, backed away from me, small hands trembling.
I inhale sharply, gripping the edge of the table to steady myself. My whole body feels wrong—like it doesn’t belong to me.
Wallace leans forward, voice careful, controlled.
""You think… or you remember?""
The distinction stings.
I shake my head, trying to clear it. ""I—I don’t know. It’s like pieces of it are there, but the rest—"" I press my fingers against my temple. ""It’s like looking through fog. I don’t know what’s real.""
Wallace exhales, his expression unreadable. ""Tell me what you do remember.""
The words sit heavy on my tongue. I don’t want to say them, because if I say them, they become real.
But they’re already real, aren’t they?
I lick my lips, my mouth dry. ""She broke something. I think… I think it was the mirror.""
Wallace’s gaze sharpens. ""The mirror in the bathroom?""
I nod, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ""She was crying. She said she didn’t mean to. She—she was scared.""
""Of you?""
The question lands like a slap.
I open my mouth to say no—to say of course not—but the words don’t come.
Because the truth is, I don’t know.
I squeeze my eyes shut, another fragment breaking through.
The mirror.
The broken glass on the floor.
Lily’s reflection, fractured and doubled.
And then—
A noise.
Not a scream.
Not a cry.
A thud.
I inhale sharply, my hands trembling against the table.
Wallace doesn’t look away. ""Did you hit her?""
The air leaves my lungs.
The hammer. The blood. The way Lily’s body had slumped, her small form curled against the cold tile.
""Oh God.""
Wallace is still watching me, his face unreadable. ""Did you hurt your daughter, Mrs. Holloway?""
I don’t want to say it.
I don’t want to believe it.
But deep in the hollow space of my mind—where the memories were buried beneath grief and guilt—something is stirring.
Something that has been waiting.
Something that knows.
I press my fingers against my lips, my breath shallow and uneven.
""Please don’t be mad, Mommy—""
Tears burn my eyes.
""I think I did.""
Wallace sits back, exhaling through his nose. For a long moment, he doesn’t speak.
Then he says, ""We need to go back to your house.""
The words send a shiver through me.
""Why?"" My voice is barely a whisper.
Wallace’s gaze doesn’t waver.
""Because if Lily died in that bathroom,"" he says, voice low and careful, ""then how did she end up buried outside?""
The question knocks the breath from my lungs.
I stare at him, my mind twisting, folding in on itself.
Because he’s right.
If I killed her in the bathroom—
Who put her on the ground?


Chapter Seven: Something in the Dark
The drive back to the house is suffocating.
Wallace doesn’t speak. I don’t either.
The world outside the car feels unreal—too bright, too normal. People walking their dogs, sipping coffee, laughing. They don’t know. They can’t know.
Inside me, something is breaking apart.
I think I killed Lily. I think I held the hammer. I think I heard the thud.
But I don’t remember burying her.
That part is missing.
I close my eyes, trying to force my mind to reach deeper, to find the missing hours. But there’s only blackness.
An empty, yawning void.
The car slows, tires crunching against the driveway. My stomach lurches at the sight of the house. The front door gapes open, crime scene tape stretched across it like a mouth sewn shut.
I don’t want to go inside.
Wallace opens his door. “Come on.”
I swallow hard and step out. The cold air bites my skin, but it’s nothing compared to the ice pooling in my gut.
The officers at the scene move aside as we step through the threshold. The house is quiet—too quiet.
Something about it feels… off.
Wallace gestures toward the hallway. “Take us through last night.”
I hesitate. My body resists moving forward as if my bones know something I don’t.
Then, slowly, I walk.
The hallway stretches longer than I remember. My breaths are shallow, my heartbeat a frantic drum against my ribs.
I stop in front of the bathroom door. It’s closed. My hand trembles as I reach for the handle.
Wallace watches me carefully. “Whenever you’re ready.”
I’m not. I’ll never be.
But I push the door open anyway.
The air inside is thick and stale. The mirror above the sink is shattered, just like in my memories. Glass glitters on the floor, reflecting fractured pieces of me.
And then I see it.
A stain on the tile.
Dark. Brown at the edges.
Blood.
A choked sound escapes my throat. My legs nearly give out, but I grip the sink to keep myself standing.
""Mommy, please—""
I squeeze my eyes shut, and the past crashes over me.
Lily, standing right there, her face streaked with tears. Her small hands shaking.
""I didn’t mean to break it, Mommy—""
Something inside me snapped.
The hammer was in my hand before I even thought about it. I don’t remember picking it up. I don’t remember moving toward her.
But I remember the sound.
A sickening, dull thud.
Her body crumpled.
Her tiny fingers twitched once—then went still.
A sob rips from my throat.
Wallace kneels beside me. “Talk to me.”
Tears blur my vision. “I—I hit her. I didn’t mean to, I swear. It was an accident, I just—” My breath shudders. “Oh God. I killed her.”
Wallace doesn’t move. He’s too still.
Then he asks, “Then who cleaned up?”
I blink. “What?”
He gestures around the room. “The blood. It should be everywhere. But someone scrubbed these floors.”
He’s right.
The blood is contained. Just a stain, faded with cleaning solution.
My stomach churns.
Wallace watches me carefully. “Are you sure you were alone last night?”
Something cold wraps around my spine.
I was alone. I must have been alone.
But I don’t remember burying her.
I don’t remember cleaning up.
And suddenly—I feel watched.
The air shifts. The room tightens.
And for the briefest second—
I swear I hear something.
A whisper.
From the hallway.
""Mommy?""
My blood turns to ice.
I spin, eyes wide, but there’s no one there.
Wallace frowns. “What is it?”
I open my mouth. Close it. Shake my head.
Because if I tell him—if I tell him I just heard my dead daughter’s voice—he’ll think I’ve lost my mind.
Maybe I have.
Wallace sighs. “Come on. We need to check the backyard.”
I don’t move right away.
Because suddenly, I don’t want to go outside.
I don’t want to see the grave again.
Because if I do…
I might see something else.
Something still moving.",1,1738805925.0,creepypasta,1,0.67,False

Just kidding!

Seriously, though, hear me out. I put 100% of my effort into dating for over a decade. I was on like 9 dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I was going to Meetup ( https://www.meetup.com/ ) and Eventbrite ( https://www.eventbrite.com/ ) events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's co-gender running club and before that my university's running club. I majored in Computer Science and got a high paying coding job at Amazon because I thought a job would help me attract women.

After all that effort, the most I got was a 6 month (mostly platonic) dating relationship and a few one night stands (all of which were with women who weren't particularly hot or good-looking). I was never married, engaged, or in an official boyfriend and girlfriend relationship despite being a straight man who wanted those things. Now I'm 31 and I've given up.

I'm just tired of trying. The juice is not worth the squeeze. The amount of effort put in is not worth what I get out of it. I have been single every Valentine's day for my entire post-pubescent life and I'm sick of trying. At this age I lack the necessary hormonal horniness to motivate me to want to try.

So here's my plan for Valentine's Day. I'm going to go to the massage parlor and get a full-body massage (from a woman), and then I'm going to go to the strip club, grab a meal with a stripper (for a fee of course), get some lap dances (from said nude stripper), and have a fun time (my local strip club doesn't allow sex but full-body touching is allowed). I have this one stripper's number (I'm just a client), but I'm going to call her after she gets off work and ask her if she would accept money from me to meet me outside the strip club. That's my plan for Valentine's Day.

Basically, I'm done seeking out free time and free sex from women. One year of swiping on dating apps is not worth the single one-on-one date with no compatibility that I get out of that effort. Three years of swiping on dating apps every day is not worth the single one-night-stand with a not-so-attractive woman that I get out of that effort.

**TL;DR** - I'm going to pay on Valentine's Day instead of expecting anything free from women. Also, fuck dating. I put in the effort, I'm in my 30's now, I'm done. Oh, and also I have severe psychiatric and/or personality problems that aren't really fixed by medication or therapy, maybe that's the issue, but again it's not really fixable.

Chapter One: Empty
I wake to silence.
Not the comfortable kind, the kind where the house settles into itself, sighing against the weight of time. No, this is different. Wrong. A void. A hush so deep it presses against my ears, muffling the sound of my breath.
I reach across the bed, fingers brushing cold sheets.
My husband’s side is empty. It has been for almost two years now, but I still reach for him sometimes. A habit I can’t seem to break. But that isn’t what unsettles me.
It takes me a moment to realize what’s missing.
Lily.
She always wakes me up before sunrise, her little feet padding across the hardwood, her weight sinking into the bed as she climbs in beside me. Some mornings, she presses her cold toes against my legs just to hear me shriek.
But today—nothing.
I sit up too fast, the room tilting, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""Lily?"" My voice scrapes the air. No answer.
The house feels too still as I throw the blankets aside, feet hitting the cold floor. I move on instinct, my hand trailing along the wall as I make my way down the hallway. The doors are all shut except for one—Lily’s.
It’s wide open.
She never sleeps with the door open. She says the hallway is too dark, too full of shadows that stretch and crawl when the wind shifts.
I step inside, my breath coming fast now.
Her bed is empty. The blankets were thrown back, her stuffed rabbit—Mr. Flop—missing from its usual spot. The room smells faintly of lavender and something else, something stale, like the ghost of a bad dream.
A small shiver works its way up my spine.
""Lily?"" I call again, louder this time, moving through the house now, checking the bathroom, the kitchen, and even the coat closet. The grandfather clock in the hallway ticks sluggishly, marking time that has begun to feel unreal.
The back door is locked. The windows are shut.
She isn’t here.
I grip the edge of the kitchen counter, trying to steady my breathing.
Where is she?
I turn back toward the hallway, and for a split second—just a breath of a moment—I swear I see something.
A shape, small and still, standing in the doorway to her room.
I blink, and it’s gone.
A cold weight settles in my stomach.
I reach for the phone with shaking hands and dial. The moment the line clicks open, I hear my voice before I even recognize it as mine.
""My daughter is missing.""

Chapter Two: The Search
The police arrive in under twenty minutes.
The sirens slice through the quiet morning, red and blue lights flashing against the walls of my house, warping the shadows into something jagged. Two officers step out first, all straight backs and unreadable faces. A third car pulls up moments later, and from it emerges Detective Wallace.
I know him. Everyone in town does. He’s been here forever, seen every crime this place has to offer—most of them small, forgettable things. Nothing like this.
""Mrs. Holloway?"" He says my name like it’s a question like he’s testing how steady I am.
I nod, arms wrapped around myself, though I can’t stop shaking. The air is too cold for September. Or maybe it’s just me.
""Tell me everything,"" Wallace says.
My tongue feels thick, and slow. ""I—I woke up and she was gone. She always wakes me up first, but today... today she didn’t."" I shake my head, trying to keep my thoughts from unraveling. ""The back door was locked. The windows were shut. I checked the whole house. I— I don’t understand where she could’ve gone.""
Wallace’s eyes flick toward the front door. ""Mind if we come in?""
I step aside, and the officers spill into my home. I watch them move through the rooms, their boots too loud against the floor. One of them radios for a K9 unit. Another speaks in hushed tones to a woman taking notes.
Wallace keeps his eyes on me. ""When was the last time you saw her?""
I swallow hard. ""Last night. She went to bed around eight-thirty. She was tired—she’d been playing outside all day.""
""Did she seem upset? Was there anything unusual about her behavior?""
""No,"" I say automatically, but something tugs at me. A flicker of something just out of reach. A feeling. A sound.
Crying.
Lily had been crying last night. I remember it now. Small, hiccupping sobs muffled by her hands.
I squeeze my eyes shut. Why was she crying?
""Mrs. Holloway?"" Wallace’s voice brings me back.
I open my eyes. ""No,"" I say again, firmer this time. ""She was fine.""
Wallace studies me for a moment before nodding. He gestures toward the stairs. ""Would you mind showing me her room?""
I lead him down the hall, my footsteps feeling too loud like they don’t belong to me. The door to Lily’s room is still open, yawning like a dark mouth.
Inside, everything is exactly as I left it. The blankets were tossed back. The pillow indented where her head had rested. A few books are scattered on the floor.
But now, standing in the doorway with Wallace at my side, something feels wrong.
It takes me a second to realize what it is.
The air.
The room smells...off. Under the lavender and fabric softener, there’s something else. Something faint.
Damp earth.
A shudder rolls through me.
""Does anything look out of place?"" Wallace asks.
My eyes scan the room. The toys, the clothes, the tiny pink slippers beside the bed.
Then I see it.
Mr. Flop.
He sits on the floor near the closet, half-hidden in the shadows. I didn’t notice him before. But that’s not what makes my stomach lurch.
It’s the way he’s positioned.
Lily never went anywhere without him—she always tucked him into bed beside her, his floppy ears peeking out from under the blankets. But now he sits on the floor, slumped unnaturally, his head tilted at an odd angle.
Like someone put him there.
Like someone wanted me to find him.
My throat tightens. ""He wasn’t there before.""
Wallace crouches, picks up the rabbit, turning it over in his hands. His fingers brush something dark, smeared along the fabric.
My stomach clenches.
Blood.
A tiny streak, dried now, staining the soft fur.
Wallace exhales, his face unreadable. Then, carefully, he places Mr. Flop into an evidence bag.
I watch the rabbit disappear behind plastic, something hot and sour rising in my throat.
This isn’t real. This isn’t happening.
But then Wallace turns to me, his face dark with something I can’t quite name.
And in that moment, I know—
They think I did something to her.

Chapter Three: Vanishing Points
The house feels wrong with strangers inside it.
The officers move through my space like they own it, opening drawers, scanning shelves, and stepping over Lily’s small, scattered belongings without care. Their radios crackle with updates—words I can’t make sense of.
Outside, more people arrive. I see them through the window—neighbors, onlookers, standing on the sidewalk, whispering to each other. Some I recognize. Some I don’t. Their faces are pale in the early morning light, their eyes darting toward my house with something I can’t name.
Fear?
Pity?
Suspicion?
A chill moves through me.
Detective Wallace hasn’t left my side since we found Mr. Flop. He’s watching me now, quiet, unreadable.
""Mrs. Holloway,"" he says, voice careful, ""can you think of anyone who might want to harm Lily?""
His words feel foreign. Like an infection working its way beneath my skin.
""Harm?"" My voice cracks at the word. ""She’s seven years old.""
Wallace doesn’t flinch. ""Sometimes it’s not a stranger.""
I suck in a sharp breath.
""Are you implying—""
""No one’s implying anything,"" he says quickly. Too quickly. ""But in cases like this, we have to look at every possibility.""
Every possibility.
The words settle in my stomach like lead.
I turn away from him, scanning the room, searching for something—anything—to ground me. My eyes land on the window, the backyard stretching beyond it. The old oak tree stands still, its gnarled branches clawing at the sky.
Lily spent hours under that tree, playing in the dirt, making up stories about buried treasure and lost kingdoms.
Buried treasure.
The thought sends a slow, creeping unease through me.
I turn back to Wallace. ""You should check outside,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""The backyard.""
He studies me for a long moment, then nods. ""I’ll send a team.""
I watch as he steps away, speaking into his radio. The other officers move with purpose now, pushing out the back door, their voices low, serious.
Something is happening.
Something is wrong.
And then—
A scream.
One of the officers. From outside.
For a moment, everything stops.
The voices. The movement. The world itself.
Then chaos. The officers rush toward the backyard. Wallace moves fast, hand hovering near his gun.
My pulse thrums in my ears.
I don’t realize I’m moving until I’m outside, the cold morning air biting my skin. The backyard is swarming with officers, circling the base of the oak tree.
Then I see it.
The dirt. Disturbed.
A hole, shallow but unmistakable.
And in it—
A small, pale hand.
Sticking out from the earth like a root.
I open my mouth, but no sound comes out. The world tilts, everything slipping sideways.
I sway on my feet. Someone grips my arm to steady me. Wallace. His voice is distant, muffled, like he’s speaking through water.
""Mrs. Holloway—""
I shake my head. No, no, no.
This isn’t happening.
This isn’t real.
But the earth is real. The hand is real. The smell of damp soil and something worse—rot—is real.
And in that moment, a memory slams into me.
Lily’s voice. Small. Trembling.
""Mommy, please—""
My breath catches.
I blink.
And for just a second—just the briefest moment—
I see her.
Standing at the edge of the yard.
Barefoot. Her nightgown fluttered in the wind.
Her face was pale, her eyes dark, staring straight at me.
Then she’s gone.
I stumble back, gasping. My head spins, my vision narrowing to a pinprick.
The last thing I hear before the world goes black—
Wallace’s voice was sharp and certain.
""Get the coroner.""

Chapter Four: The Girl in the Dirt
The world fades in and out.
Hands on my arms. Voices above me. The sky pressing down.
I don’t remember falling. I only remember her.
Standing there. Watching me. Lily.
But it wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.
Could it?
""Mrs. Holloway, can you hear me?""
I blink, the world snapping back into place. Wallace is kneeling beside me, his face tight with something I can’t name. The officers in the yard are moving like a well-oiled machine, roping off the base of the oak tree, speaking in clipped, urgent tones.
And then I see it again.
The hand.
Still there. Still reaching from the earth. Small. Still.
I turn away, bile rising in my throat.
""We need you to stay with us,"" Wallace says. His voice is firm but not unkind.
I squeeze my eyes shut. ""I—I don’t understand. That can’t be Lily.""
Wallace doesn’t respond right away. Then, carefully, ""Why not?""
Because I just saw her.
Because she was standing there, watching me.
Because I can still feel her.
I shake my head. ""She wouldn’t—she couldn’t be—"" My voice cracks, words turning to dust in my throat.
Wallace studies me, his gaze too heavy, like he’s looking through me instead of at me.
""Do you recognize the nightgown?"" he asks.
I don’t want to look.
But I have to.
Slowly, I turn my head, forcing myself to take it in. The dirt-streaked fabric. The tiny fingers curled slightly inward. The delicate lace trim at the wrist.
White with little pink flowers.
Lily’s favorite.
The one she wore last night.
A thin, broken sound escapes my lips. I press a hand to my mouth, my whole body shaking.
This isn’t real. It can’t be real.
One of the officers murmurs something into a radio. Another kneels by the grave, carefully brushing away more soil. The shape beneath the dirt becomes clearer. A small, still form, curled into itself.
Lily.
I hear a wretched, gasping sob and don’t realize it’s mine until Wallace reaches for me again, steadying me before I fall.
""This—this doesn’t make sense,"" I whisper. ""She was just here.""
Wallace’s expression doesn’t change. ""What do you mean?""
I open my mouth, but the words won’t come.
Because how do I explain what I saw? How do I tell him that my daughter—who has been buried in my backyard—was standing there just moments ago, staring at me?
They’ll think I’m crazy.
Maybe I am crazy.
Wallace exhales, dragging a hand down his face. ""Mrs. Holloway,"" he says, quieter now. ""We need to ask you some questions down at the station.""
The words are soft, but the meaning is sharp.
They don’t think I’m a grieving mother.
They think I’m a suspect.
The world is still spinning around me, a carousel I can’t escape.
Somewhere in the yard, an officer pulls out a small plastic bag.
Something inside it catches the light.
Something familiar.
A set of keys.
My keys.
Found in the dirt.
Near the body.
I suck in a sharp breath. No.
Wallace watches me carefully, his voice careful, quiet.
""Mrs. Holloway… do you remember how they got there?""
I stare at the keys. At the hand in the dirt. At the place where I swear—I swear—I saw Lily standing only minutes ago.
My vision blurs. My pulse pounds.
And somewhere, deep in the locked corridors of my mind—
Something shifts.
A door creaked open.
A whisper of a memory.
A voice.
""Mommy, please—""
Darkness presses in.

Chapter Five: Black Gaps
I wake to the sound of humming.
Soft. Sweet. Familiar.
A lullaby.
For a moment, I think I’m in Lily’s room, curled up beside her like I used to be when she had bad dreams. I can almost feel her small fingers tangling in my hair, the warmth of her breath against my skin.
Then I open my eyes.
And the cold, fluorescent lights above me shatter the illusion.
I’m not in Lily’s room.
I’m in a police station.
The walls are bare, the table in front of me a dull, gray slab. The air is thick with the scent of old coffee and something else—something metallic, like blood dried into the fibers of my clothes.
My clothes.
I look down, my stomach twisting.
Dirt stains my hands. My sleeves. The fabric of my jeans.
So much dirt.
A memory stirs—kneeling in the backyard, my fingers pushing into the earth, the sharp scent of soil filling my nose.
I grip the edge of the table, my breath coming too fast. No. No, that’s not real.
But the dirt is real. The body is real.
And I don’t know how it got there.
The door creaks open.
Detective Wallace steps inside, a file tucked under his arm. He looks tired, his mouth set in a hard line. He pulls out a chair, sits across from me, and lays the file on the table between us.
""How are you feeling?""
The question is strange. How am I feeling?
Like my insides have been hollowed out. My mind is a maze, and every turn leads to a dead end.
Like my daughter is dead and somehow—I don’t know how—I might be the reason why.
""I don’t know,"" I whisper.
Wallace nods as if he expected that answer. He flips the file open.
A photograph slides toward me.
A close-up of Lily’s small, lifeless hand emerges from the dirt.
I turn away, nausea rising in my throat.
Wallace doesn’t move the photo. ""We need to talk about last night, Mrs. Holloway.""
""I told you,"" I say, my voice hoarse. ""I don’t remember.""
His expression doesn’t change. ""Try.""
I squeeze my eyes shut, forcing myself to reach back into the black spaces of my mind. To the moment I tucked Lily into bed.
She was crying. Why was she crying?
""Mommy, I didn’t mean to—""
My fingers tighten around the edge of the table. ""She was upset,"" I murmur. ""I remember that.""
""What was she upset about?""
The memory is slippery, shifting every time I try to hold onto it.
""I—I didn’t mean to break it.""
Break what?
I shake my head. ""I don’t know.""
Wallace studies me, then pushes another item toward me.
A plastic evidence bag.
Inside—
A hammer.
Small. Old. The kind I kept in the junk drawer for hanging pictures.
The handle is covered in something dark.
A horrible, sickening recognition crawls through me.
Wallace watches my reaction carefully. ""We found this buried near the body."" His voice is calm. Even. Too even. ""There was blood on it.""
My vision tilts. ""No.""
Wallace exhales, sitting back. ""I need you to be honest with me, Mrs. Holloway.""
My hands are shaking. ""I didn’t—I would never—""
But the words won’t form properly.
Because in the space where the memory should be, there’s only darkness.
A gap. A hole. A place where something terrible should live.
Wallace leans forward, his voice quieter now. ""Can you tell me the last time you saw Lily alive?""
I squeeze my eyes shut, trying—trying—to reach back.
Lily’s face swims before me. Her wide, teary eyes. Her small hands gripped my shirt.
""Please don’t be mad, Mommy—""
Something inside me cracks.
A sound—a THUD.
The walls of my mind splinter.
And suddenly, I am there.
Standing in the bathroom.
Lily is on the floor.
Her nightgown is damp, clinging to her small frame.
The mirror above the sink is broken.
Shards of glass glitter on the tile like fallen stars.
And in my hand—
In my hand—
A hammer.
My breath catches.
The memory is sharp. Blinding. Undeniable.
I look up at Wallace, my throat tight, my stomach twisting.
Tears burn the back of my eyes.
""I think I did something,"" I whisper.
Wallace doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink.
I press my hands against my face, the truth unraveling inside me, slow and merciless.
""I think I killed my daughter.""

Chapter Six: Cracks in the Mirror
The words hang in the air, thick and suffocating.
""I think I killed my daughter.""
Wallace doesn’t react—not at first. His fingers tap against the file, slow and measured, like he’s waiting for me to take it back.
I don’t.
I can’t.
Because the moment I said it, something inside me shifted.
A door unlocked.
And now, more memories are bleeding through.
Not just flashes, but pieces—sharp, jagged fragments cutting their way in.
Lily, crying in the bathroom.
Lily, whispering, I didn’t mean to, Mommy. Please don’t be mad.
Lily, backed away from me, small hands trembling.
I inhale sharply, gripping the edge of the table to steady myself. My whole body feels wrong—like it doesn’t belong to me.
Wallace leans forward, voice careful, controlled.
""You think… or you remember?""
The distinction stings.
I shake my head, trying to clear it. ""I—I don’t know. It’s like pieces of it are there, but the rest—"" I press my fingers against my temple. ""It’s like looking through fog. I don’t know what’s real.""
Wallace exhales, his expression unreadable. ""Tell me what you do remember.""
The words sit heavy on my tongue. I don’t want to say them, because if I say them, they become real.
But they’re already real, aren’t they?
I lick my lips, my mouth dry. ""She broke something. I think… I think it was the mirror.""
Wallace’s gaze sharpens. ""The mirror in the bathroom?""
I nod, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ""She was crying. She said she didn’t mean to. She—she was scared.""
""Of you?""
The question lands like a slap.
I open my mouth to say no—to say of course not—but the words don’t come.
Because the truth is, I don’t know.
I squeeze my eyes shut, another fragment breaking through.
The mirror.
The broken glass on the floor.
Lily’s reflection, fractured and doubled.
And then—
A noise.
Not a scream.
Not a cry.
A thud.
I inhale sharply, my hands trembling against the table.
Wallace doesn’t look away. ""Did you hit her?""
The air leaves my lungs.
The hammer. The blood. The way Lily’s body had slumped, her small form curled against the cold tile.
""Oh God.""
Wallace is still watching me, his face unreadable. ""Did you hurt your daughter, Mrs. Holloway?""
I don’t want to say it.
I don’t want to believe it.
But deep in the hollow space of my mind—where the memories were buried beneath grief and guilt—something is stirring.
Something that has been waiting.
Something that knows.
I press my fingers against my lips, my breath shallow and uneven.
""Please don’t be mad, Mommy—""
Tears burn my eyes.
""I think I did.""
Wallace sits back, exhaling through his nose. For a long moment, he doesn’t speak.
Then he says, ""We need to go back to your house.""
The words send a shiver through me.
""Why?"" My voice is barely a whisper.
Wallace’s gaze doesn’t waver.
""Because if Lily died in that bathroom,"" he says, voice low and careful, ""then how did she end up buried outside?""
The question knocks the breath from my lungs.
I stare at him, my mind twisting, folding in on itself.
Because he’s right.
If I killed her in the bathroom—
Who put her on the ground?


Chapter Seven: Something in the Dark
The drive back to the house is suffocating.
Wallace doesn’t speak. I don’t either.
The world outside the car feels unreal—too bright, too normal. People walking their dogs, sipping coffee, laughing. They don’t know. They can’t know.
Inside me, something is breaking apart.
I think I killed Lily. I think I held the hammer. I think I heard the thud.
But I don’t remember burying her.
That part is missing.
I close my eyes, trying to force my mind to reach deeper, to find the missing hours. But there’s only blackness.
An empty, yawning void.
The car slows, tires crunching against the driveway. My stomach lurches at the sight of the house. The front door gapes open, crime scene tape stretched across it like a mouth sewn shut.
I don’t want to go inside.
Wallace opens his door. “Come on.”
I swallow hard and step out. The cold air bites my skin, but it’s nothing compared to the ice pooling in my gut.
The officers at the scene move aside as we step through the threshold. The house is quiet—too quiet.
Something about it feels… off.
Wallace gestures toward the hallway. “Take us through last night.”
I hesitate. My body resists moving forward as if my bones know something I don’t.
Then, slowly, I walk.
The hallway stretches longer than I remember. My breaths are shallow, my heartbeat a frantic drum against my ribs.
I stop in front of the bathroom door. It’s closed. My hand trembles as I reach for the handle.
Wallace watches me carefully. “Whenever you’re ready.”
I’m not. I’ll never be.
But I push the door open anyway.
The air inside is thick and stale. The mirror above the sink is shattered, just like in my memories. Glass glitters on the floor, reflecting fractured pieces of me.
And then I see it.
A stain on the tile.
Dark. Brown at the edges.
Blood.
A choked sound escapes my throat. My legs nearly give out, but I grip the sink to keep myself standing.
""Mommy, please—""
I squeeze my eyes shut, and the past crashes over me.
Lily, standing right there, her face streaked with tears. Her small hands shaking.
""I didn’t mean to break it, Mommy—""
Something inside me snapped.
The hammer was in my hand before I even thought about it. I don’t remember picking it up. I don’t remember moving toward her.
But I remember the sound.
A sickening, dull thud.
Her body crumpled.
Her tiny fingers twitched once—then went still.
A sob rips from my throat.
Wallace kneels beside me. “Talk to me.”
Tears blur my vision. “I—I hit her. I didn’t mean to, I swear. It was an accident, I just—” My breath shudders. “Oh God. I killed her.”
Wallace doesn’t move. He’s too still.
Then he asks, “Then who cleaned up?”
I blink. “What?”
He gestures around the room. “The blood. It should be everywhere. But someone scrubbed these floors.”
He’s right.
The blood is contained. Just a stain, faded with cleaning solution.
My stomach churns.
Wallace watches me carefully. “Are you sure you were alone last night?”
Something cold wraps around my spine.
I was alone. I must have been alone.
But I don’t remember burying her.
I don’t remember cleaning up.
And suddenly—I feel watched.
The air shifts. The room tightens.
And for the briefest second—
I swear I hear something.
A whisper.
From the hallway.
""Mommy?""
My blood turns to ice.
I spin, eyes wide, but there’s no one there.
Wallace frowns. “What is it?”
I open my mouth. Close it. Shake my head.
Because if I tell him—if I tell him I just heard my dead daughter’s voice—he’ll think I’ve lost my mind.
Maybe I have.
Wallace sighs. “Come on. We need to check the backyard.”
I don’t move right away.
Because suddenly, I don’t want to go outside.
I don’t want to see the grave again.
Because if I do…
I might see something else.

Education and teaching light up my world, and I’m excited to continue growing in this rewarding path.

I’m 5’4” with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos. But beyond the details, I’m someone who finds beauty in life’s simple pleasures—like sipping a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while admiring the city lights, or sharing a laugh over coffee and cake. I prefer bookstores to bars, quiet moments to loud parties, and thoughtful conversations to mindless chatter.

So why am I here—especially on Reddit, of all places? Because dating apps have become a cycle of swipes, forgettable small talk, and mismatched connections. You meet, you go on a date, and something feels off—maybe they talk over you when they drink, maybe they dominate the conversation, or maybe they disappear without a word. Then the app gets deleted, only to be redownloaded later, repeating the cycle all over again.

This Valentine’s Day, I want something different. Something real. If you’re tired of the same dating app routine, consider this your invitation to break free. I’m looking for old-fashioned romance—the kind where dates happen in real places, not just over DMs or in someone’s living room. The kind where you get dressed up, get picked up, and create actual memories together.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I have a soft spot for the original *Gossip Girl* (2007—no reboot, please!) and would love a partner who’s down to binge it with me. Some of my favorite films include *Dogfight, Cruel Intentions, Stand By Me, Career Opportunities, Secret Admirer,* and *The Bling Ring.* My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like *Sunset* by The Midnight, *Summer Eyes* by Coastal, and *Miracle Love* by Lazer Club.

While I cherish my independence, I’m ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I want the kind of relationship where we create silly inside jokes, enjoy life’s little moments, and always have each other’s backs. Romance, to me, isn’t about grand gestures—it’s in the quiet seconds where you lock eyes, smile, and just *know.*

# What I’m Looking For:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** 5’10” or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is fine
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you’re open to starting a family someday!

# A Few Non-Negotiables:

You’re emotionally available, single, stable, and employed. You’re not in touch with exes (I believe in being fully present), and you value communication and consistency. It’s the small things that mean the most to me.

If you’re kind, stable, and looking for something genuine, I’d love to hear from you. Please include a photo in your message, and if we vibe, I’ll gladly share one back. Let’s see where this Valentine’s journey could take us. ❤️",0,1738805773.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1iiqwzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/1iiqwzv/i_remember_you/,I Remember You,"You don’t remember me. Because I’m just a Lyft driver. Not even human. Just someone to be used to get you to work. Not a human being who has a life.

I remember you, because you live in a quiet area between where I live and where I tend to work in the mornings. There aren’t many drivers in your area early in the morning.

I remember you, because you requested a ride and in the 10 minutes it took me to get to pick you up, you still weren’t ready. You’re one of those people who are bitter because you have to be at work, and refuse to be even a few minutes early. So you compensate by stealing time from other human beings. Because you’re a user.

I remember you, because you’re one of those people who has it down to a science. You know exactly how long a Lyft driver has to wait (unpaid) before they can cancel without penalty. You have it down to the second, that’s your time. Because you’re a user. And you timed it to come out and hit the door handle exactly at 4:59. 

I remember you, because then you sighed repeat and kept looking at your watch. When I dropped you off at your work, it was 5:29am. The only reason you stressed about being to work on time is because you didn’t get ready during the 10 min it took to get to you, and then drug your feet coming out.

I only got paid like $4 for that short ride to work. I didn’t get paid for the time to get to you, or for the wait. On that trip, I had more unpaid time than paid. And you didn’t even say “thank you”.

And because I’m a nice guy, I didn’t hammer your ratings. Everyone is allowed a bad day. It happens.

So when you requested another ride this morning, from and to the same place, I remembered you. And I took the ride. Because, as I pointed out earlier, I’m headed from my house to my preferred work area. It’s not a great paying ride, but it’s on the way. 

But this time, because I remember you, when I accepted the ride, I passive aggressively messaged you:

“I’m your driver!”
“Good morning!”
“I’m on my way!”
“I’ll be there in 10 minutes!”

(Drivers know, these are canned messages in the app. I like to add “good morning”)

And when I pulled up, of course you weren’t ready. But I texted “I’ve arrived!”. But you have it down to an art how long drivers have to wait, and you can’t stand the idea of being even a minute early to work. So f those drivers. They can wait, right?

So at 4:30, I took my car out of park and turned off my flashers and started to turn around at the dead end next to your apartment. 

Yes, I saw your door open at 4:40. I saw you see me moving and start to fumble with your keys to lock the door. I saw you deadass start to RUN down those stairs as I slow rolled through 4 min 50 seconds. I didn’t accelerate quickly because I wanted you to think maybe you had a shot. I’ll give you this, you’re quick.  Bet that shot of adrenaline woke you up. And like a NASA count down, I thoroughly enjoyed the 3…2…1…. CANCEL. You were still a good 25 feet away. If you’d even bothered to get out on time, you would have made it.

Good luck getting to work on time. In your area it’s a minimum 10 min wait. If a driver will even leave the busier areas near you to go there for your <$3 no tip ride. Will you learn anything from this? No, you’ll probably complain that “the driver didn’t wait”, because you’re a user and other people don’t exist and you’re entitled to their time. But I enjoyed it. Because I remembered you. 

Oh, and just so you know, when I left, I went over to the convenience store, grabbed a coffee, and contacted Lyft support to make sure I’m never paired with you again. So I won’t have any worries about my cancellation rate, and congratulations, now you have one fewer driver in your (quiet) area to take you to work in the morning.

Just kidding!

Seriously, though, hear me out. I put 100% of my effort into dating for over a decade. I was on like 9 dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I was going to Meetup ( https://www.meetup.com/ ) and Eventbrite ( https://www.eventbrite.com/ ) events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's co-gender running club and before that my university's running club. I majored in Computer Science and got a high paying coding job at Amazon because I thought a job would help me attract women.

After all that effort, the most I got was a 6 month (mostly platonic) dating relationship and a few one night stands (all of which were with women who weren't particularly hot or good-looking). I was never married, engaged, or in an official boyfriend and girlfriend relationship despite being a straight man who wanted those things. Now I'm 31 and I've given up.

I'm just tired of trying. The juice is not worth the squeeze. The amount of effort put in is not worth what I get out of it. I have been single every Valentine's day for my entire post-pubescent life and I'm sick of trying. At this age I lack the necessary hormonal horniness to motivate me to want to try.

So here's my plan for Valentine's Day. I'm going to go to the massage parlor and get a full-body massage (from a woman), and then I'm going to go to the strip club, grab a meal with a stripper (for a fee of course), get some lap dances (from said nude stripper), and have a fun time (my local strip club doesn't allow sex but full-body touching is allowed). I have this one stripper's number (I'm just a client), but I'm going to call her after she gets off work and ask her if she would accept money from me to meet me outside the strip club. That's my plan for Valentine's Day.

Basically, I'm done seeking out free time and free sex from women. One year of swiping on dating apps is not worth the single one-on-one date with no compatibility that I get out of that effort. Three years of swiping on dating apps every day is not worth the single one-night-stand with a not-so-attractive woman that I get out of that effort.

**TL;DR** - I'm going to pay on Valentine's Day instead of expecting anything free from women. Also, fuck dating. I put in the effort, I'm in my 30's now, I'm done. Oh, and also I have severe psychiatric and/or personality problems that aren't really fixed by medication or therapy, maybe that's the issue, but again it's not really fixable.",0,1738805545.0,Healthygamergg,6,0.4,False
1iiqva1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1iiqva1/the_power_of_accountability_finding_your_support/,The Power of Accountability: Finding Your Support System,"🌟 Hey, Empowish Community! 🌟

Have you ever set a goal and then found yourself stuck in the same spot weeks later? You're definitely not alone. We’ve all been there. But what if I told you the secret sauce to making progress is actually… other people? Yup, it’s true! Today, we're diving into the power of accountability and how crafting a solid support system can be your game-changer in turning dreams into accomplishments. 🚀

✨ *Embrace Accountability like a Friend* ✨

Accountability isn’t about someone breathing down your neck or nitpicking your every move. Think of it as a positive push from a friend who genuinely cares about your success. When you share your aspirations with someone, you're not just speaking them into the void; you're bringing them to life. Imagine telling a friend, ""I'm aiming to run a marathon this year."" Now, that simple declaration makes the goal tangible and gives you a cheerleader along the way.

🔑 *Key Step: Choose Your Accountability Allies Wisely* 🔑

Not everyone is going to make the best accountability buddy. It's important to choose someone who will be supportive yet honest. They should inspire you to strive harder rather than discourage you. It could be a friend who's also working on personal growth, a family member whose opinion you trust, or even a community member here at Empowish. The key is mutual understanding and shared drive.

🗓️ *Set Realistic Check-In Points* 🗓️

Once you’ve got your accountability partner, establish regular check-ins. These meetings don’t have to be long or intense—just a simple coffee chat or a quick message exchange works wonders. Regular check-ins help keep the momentum going and provide structured opportunities to reflect and readjust your strategies. Plus, knowing you have a ""report"" due can be a great motivator when procrastination sneaks in! 😅

📚 *Get the Tools and Track Your Progress* 📚

Equipping yourself with the right tools is essential. Whether it's a shared Google Doc, a project management app like Trello, or a good old-fashioned journal, find what works best for you to track your progress. Having a visual representation of your journey can be incredibly satisfying. It lets you spot patterns, celebrate milestones, and see just how far you’ve come. And trust me, nothing feels better than ticking off completed tasks! 🎉

👏 *Celebrate EVERY Victory* 👏

In the hustle to reach our grand goals, we often forget to acknowledge the small victories. But remember: every step forward is a step closer to your dream. Share your wins, no matter the size, with your accountability partner. Did you tick off every item on your to-do list today? Fantastic! Hit your weekly workout goal? Amazing! And don’t forget, your victories inspire others in the community gathering courage to embark on their own journey.

🔥 *Your Call to Action: Share Your Journey!* 🔥

Empowish community, let's use this thread to build our network of accountability allies. Share your goals in the comments below and connect with those who resonate with your journey. What are you aiming for, and how can we help hold each other accountable? Also, if you've had an accountability experience that transformed your journey, we’d love to hear about it! Let’s lift each other up and transform our dreams into reality, together. 💪💬

Remember, with the right support system, there's no limit to what you can achieve. Go out there and make your dreams happen, Empowish family! 🌈✨",2,1738805517.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

1iiqtos,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/made-in-canada-product-of-canada-1.7451556,Made in Canada / Product of Canada,"Summarization:
The distinction between Canadian product labels carries significant regulatory and economic implications.

Product Label Categories
Product of Canada:
A product can only carry this designation if 98% or more of the total direct production costs were incurred in Canada. For products that are entirely Canadian, manufacturers can explicitly state “100% Canadian”.

Made in Canada:
This label indicates that 51-98% of the total direct production costs occurred in Canada. Manufacturers are encouraged to include qualifying statements such as “Made in Canada with imported parts” or specific percentage breakdowns of Canadian versus imported content.

Additional Labeling Requirements
For both “Product of Canada” and “Made in Canada” designations, the final substantial transformation of the product must occur within Canada. For example, assembling ingredients into a pizza qualifies as substantial transformation.

Specialized Food LabelsSeveral specific labeling terms are permitted for certain products:
•Coffee: “Roasted and blended in Canada”
•Imported jam packaged domestically: “Packaged in Canada”
•Cane sugar: “Refined in Canada”
•Water: “Distilled in Canada”

Enforcement
The use of Canadian symbols like the maple leaf or flag on products automatically subjects them to “Made in Canada” standards. 

Violations of these labeling regulations can result in substantial penalties, with corporations facing fines up to $10 million for first offenses and $15 million for subsequent violations.

Consumer Impact
The complexity of these labels has created challenges for consumers attempting to buy Canadian products. Even items meeting Canadian labeling requirements may be produced by international companies operating local factories, such as Lay’s potato chips, which are made in Cambridge, Ontario, but owned by PepsiCo. 

Remember, Made in Canada, even by a foreign company, means Canadians are employed and this contributes positively to our economy.

Open to male roommates (would perfer this - I hate drama) so long as the relationship is very much sister vibes and no weird shit. Grew up with brothers so used to the banter anyway. In this case, an additonal offer to do laundry/clean for free coffee is in place. 

Super general post but really open to anything. Just looking for a person or group of people who have passions they are pursuing, are kind/gentle, will go for walks with me and get coffee on occasion and maybe have traditonal sunday roasts.

She was acting fine when I woke up around 830, I fed her and my other cat their usual breakfast (Crave Cat Food, grain free chicken formula, been feeding that bto the both of them for about 2 years, before that it was Natural Balance cat food but I can no longer find it in my area)

She was eating and acting completely normal

At around 930 I ran out of the house to quickly grab a coffee and I noticed when I got back there was vomit by the door. I then heard my cat throw up again and then once more, one solid and one just bile.

Inwent to check on her and she was in the closet on one of her beds breathing heavily and panting. She was also meowing a lot and she usually only meows when she sees birds or is happy but it's just a few short chirps.

I called the vet a d was able to get in at 11..in the way there her blanket in the carrier looked like she peed a little, which she has never done before in her carrier.

Vet listened to her chest and then they did a blood panel, results will be attached. 

He saw nothing concerning except for slightly high cholesterol, result 5.85 (from being overweight) and GGT, result 5 (which he said was from vomiting) 

As it seemed like she was doing better at the vet we left assuming she was okay

When I got home, she threw up bile again twice about an hour after we got home and then maybe a few hours after. And then she just threw up bile again around 8pm. 

When I let her she does seem content and purr (I know this can be a sign of pain too tho)

Bowel movements seem normal but I do have two cats sharing one litter box

I don't have any toxic plants or anything around that she would have gotten into and she is 100% indoors. She hasn't taken any medication except her flea meds given by the vet months ago

Step 2: Add the cash back offer and it’ll tell you until when the offer is good.

Step 3: Use the card you connected on the app.

Step 5: Once you get the money back you can do a 3-5 business day transfer for free or $1 for same day transfer (typically gets to bank at night)

Khamrah qawha - it's not smooth and it tries to have a coffee note that somewhere between caramel and coffee. It's really not smooth it is synthetic it does have a little bit of off bug spray smell. Not good 

Raghba for men - cheap green Irish Tweed that's not fresh and has synthetic smell to it that can be headache inducing. It does not project more than a skin scent you have to get your nose right on your skin to even smell it. 

Asdaaf Ameer Al Arab black - really bad no joke smells straight up like purple tums. I'm not joking I'm honest and I don't lie. I knew it was bad the moment I smelled it but then I asked myself where have I smelled this before and it's purple Tums. 

Royal supreme the king - not as bad as the others but I was told it smelled a lot like reflection man and it does not at all. Synthetic not very good not something I would spend my money on at all. It'd be better for you to save your money and buy reflection man at a discounter. But a more so disappointed in the YouTube reviews and people I trust that said that smelled like reflection man. Shiyaaka red is so much better and I have that fragrance although it has no performance at all. 

Asdaaf Ameer al Arab imperium - just smells like lavender and citrus it doesn't develop into anything else at all. It also doesn't project AT ALL I sprayed it on my arm and then would have to get really close to my skin to smell it. It's not very good and it's just not really worth it it's better suited for a bathroom air freshener that's smells rather quite nice. 

Malik al Tayoor - not that bad actually smells nice sweet and fresh and it actually is pretty good. It's actually the only fragrance that didn't seem that bad along with the last one. It actually is pretty decent not going to lie. 

Liam grey - knocked it out of the park this is smooth classy refined and warm and IT projects a lot I don't know what they did right with this fragrance and somehow the other ones are just not good but that's just the way it is. Projection was really decent off the skin and it's very smooth classy and refined
 I  just wish they were able to do that with all the fragrances. 

Needless to say y'all I'm done with Middle Eastern cheap clone fragrances. I spent $130 on this Hall and this was my last time giving a chance to cheapies before actually choose to spend my money on real fragrances that are actually good. I'll be spending my money on things like Creed, zaharoff, Hermes, and a couple others that have smelled in between Nordstrom and ZGO perfumery. When I started my fragrance journey I smelled all these amazing perfumes at the store and I thought maybe I could save a little money by buying clothes..... Those days have come up to an abrupt end. Sad to say but I will admit Liam Gray is absolutely a spectacular and you should definitely try it out for yourself that is one that has my recommendation and you should definitely get your nose on it. I don't know why but that one is so good and the others were just not with the exception of the second to last one. If any of you have experience with any of these I'd like to hear your thoughts. 

As an adult who actually can afford the real stuff I'm going to save up and spend money on about six to seven expensive perfumes and call it a day and that will be my fragrance collection in my closet. ",0,1738804909.0,fragranceclones,35,0.36,False

Creating memorable experiences often begins with thoughtful gestures, and personalized gifts can significantly enhance the moment. Here’s how you can craft unforgettable Valentine’s Day experiences through aesthetic DIY gifts that speak directly to the heart.

### Why Personalized Gifts Make a Difference

Personalized gifts hold a unique charm. They show thoughtfulness and effort, making your loved one feel cherished. Whether it’s a handmade item or a customized keepsake, personalizing a gift adds a distinct touch that mass-produced items can’t replicate. Here are several reasons to choose personalized gifts:

- **Shows Effort:** Investing time to create something special displays your dedication.
- **Creates a Bond:** A personalized gift can evoke shared memories and strengthen your connection.
- **Enhances Sentiment:** These gifts often carry emotional value, making them more memorable.

### Crafting Aesthetic DIY Gifts

If you're considering making a one-of-a-kind present, here are a few creative ideas that will sweep your partner off their feet:

#### Customized Photo Book

A photo book brimming with memories is an intimate way to celebrate your relationship. Gather pictures from your journey together, and arrange them chronologically or thematically. You can add captions or handwritten notes next to each photo to express your feelings.

#### Handwritten Love Letters

Words can be incredibly powerful. Write a series of love letters expressing your feelings, one for each day of the week leading up to Valentine’s Day. You can use beautiful stationery, and seal each letter in an envelope to create an air of anticipation. This thoughtful gesture shows how deeply you care.

#### Scented Candles with a Twist

Creating personalized scented candles is an engaging and aromatic gift idea. Pick a scent that reminds you of meaningful moments together and combine it with a carefully designed label. You can even color the wax to match your partner’s favorite colors or your shared aesthetic.

### Simple Yet Sweet DIY Gifts

Sometimes, the simplest gifts are the most endearing. Here are some easy DIY ideas that require minimal resources but come packed with love:

#### Memory Jar

Collect small notes that feature memories, reasons you love your partner, or future date ideas. Fill a jar and decorate it with ribbons or paints to enhance its aesthetic appeal. This gift is not just a lovely decoration but also encourages engagement as you go through the notes together.

#### Customized Mugs

Design mugs with meaningful quotes or images that resonate with both of you. You can use ceramic paint or markers to create your designs. Each morning cup of coffee or tea will remind your partner of your special bond.

#### DIY Scrapbook

Gather mementos from your adventures together—ticket stubs, photographs, and notes—and compile them into a scrapbook. This visually appealing gift will serve as a lovely chronicle of your love story, capturing those special moments that define your relationship.

### Experiencing Love Through Dedicating Time

Beyond gifting, the experience itself can be a beautiful part of Valentine’s Day. Devote time to create or help your partner with a DIY project they love. This collaborative experience adds depth to your connection and encourages bonding.

#### A DIY Date Night

Choose an evening to make the crafting process a date night. Set up a cozy crafting space filled with snacks, music, and plenty of supplies. Enjoy each other’s company while creating gifts that will be treasured for years to come.

#### Cook Together

Consider cooking a meal that holds significance for both of you. You can create a romantic vibe with candles, music, and a surprising dessert. This hands-on activity not only creates delicious memories but bonds you through teamwork.

Creating memorable Valentine’s Day experiences with personalized gifts doesn't have to be complicated. Simple, thoughtful gestures can speak volumes and deepen your connection. Embrace the joy of crafting and share in the love of the season!

### Conclusion

Valentine’s Day is not just about lavish purchases; it’s about expressing heartfelt emotions through thoughtful gestures. By embracing aesthetic DIY gifts, you can create a lasting impression that resonates deeply with your loved ones. The beauty of crafting your own gifts lies in the personal touch they carry—every detail reflects your affection and consideration, making them standout surprises that commercial gifts simply can’t match.

From creating unique wall art to designing customized photo albums, the options are endless when it comes to aesthetic DIY projects. Each item you create helps narrate your love story, capturing moments that are special to you both. Plus, the act of crafting together can also become a beautiful experience in itself, fostering connections and memories that will last a lifetime.

As you prepare for this Valentine’s Day, let your creativity shine. Prioritize personalization and thoughtfulness, which truly encapsulate the spirit of the occasion. Remember that it’s not about the extravagance of the gifts, but the meaning and effort behind them. Making your loved one feel adored and appreciated is the ultimate goal, and what better way to achieve that than by investing your time and creativity into a one-of-a-kind gift?

So gather your supplies, unleash your inner artist, and enjoy the process. This Valentine’s Day, let your DIY creations speak volumes about your feelings. Embrace the joy of giving something meaningful, and you’ll surely create memories that both of you will cherish for years to come.

Just kidding!

Seriously, though, hear me out. I put 100% of my effort into dating for over a decade. I was on like 9 dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I was going to Meetup ( https://www.meetup.com/ ) and Eventbrite ( https://www.eventbrite.com/ ) events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's co-gender running club and before that my university's running club. I majored in Computer Science and got a high paying coding job at Amazon because I thought a job would help me attract women.

After all that effort, the most I got was a 6 month (mostly platonic) dating relationship and a few one night stands (all of which were with women who weren't particularly hot or good-looking). I was never married, engaged, or in an official boyfriend and girlfriend relationship despite being a straight man who wanted those things. Now I'm 31 and I've given up.

I'm just tired of trying. The juice is not worth the squeeze. The amount of effort put in is not worth what I get out of it. I have been single every Valentine's day for my entire post-pubescent life and I'm sick of trying. At this age I lack the necessary hormonal horniness to motivate me to want to try.

So here's my plan for Valentine's Day. I'm going to go to the massage parlor and get a full-body massage (from a woman), and then I'm going to go to the strip club, grab a meal with a stripper (for a fee of course), get some lap dances (from said nude stripper), and have a fun time (my local strip club doesn't allow sex but full-body touching is allowed). I have this one stripper's number (I'm just a client), but I'm going to call her after she gets off work and ask her if she would accept money from me to meet me outside the strip club. That's my plan for Valentine's Day.

Basically, I'm done seeking out free time and free sex from women. One year of swiping on dating apps is not worth the single one-on-one date with no compatibility that I get out of that effort. Three years of swiping on dating apps every day is not worth the single one-night-stand with a not-so-attractive woman that I get out of that effort.

**TL;DR** - I'm going to pay on Valentine's Day instead of expecting anything free from women. Also, fuck dating. I put in the effort, I'm in my 30's now, I'm done.",1,1738804821.0,ForeverAlone,2,0.67,False

Thank you so much…  it is definitely not said enough I can’t thank you enough 
Looking back as a care leaver I can say I was very in-compliant and hard to work with I didn’t know it back them but I always will remember now and realise how it meant those sessions cooking or shopping etc ment more to me than anything to turn me into who I am today. 

Let me tell you about my experience growing up while being exploited by gangs 

So at 15 years old I was placed  placed in a semi independent care home looked after by my local authority My placement was borough in London (that I wont name for privacy reasons) 

I should tell you how I got here but first let me just say 50% of children in care become young offenders by age 24 compared to 13% otherwise but don’t think it’s because these kids/young adults are bad people.

To put things plainly, my placement was in a notoriously dangerous area for gangs/knife crime and radicalisation,
I was housed with children from war torn countries 
(who had no ID to prove otherwise they weren’t the age they said) 
as-well as children who had been abused or even simply chose the wrong path, 

I came to my placement as an emergency placement but ended up staying it was semi independent and always full with 1 room always having people join and leave. 

I went through 10+ social workers from 16-18 no exaggeration. This was before I could meet them.
There’s such a shortage of social workers I fully understand years later. I would get a phone call by a new social worker and I’d get another phone call from a new one before I can even meet them.

Obviously this made me In-compliant as I could never talk to a social worker for long enough to have a relationship and really connect I started to go off the rails and nobody would notice as I never had a social worker for longer than 1 week to see a change in me 
Looking back this is a huge failure I do and did feel let down but I feel worse for other children with needs that were forgotten about. 

As I was new to the area of my placement I started to befriend local kids and try to make friends, 
Kids came round the my placement saw I had nothing just a bed fridge and £57.90 allowance back then they couldn’t understand how it was like 

The grooming/exploitation:
Other kids in the placement would end up befriended older boys from the area who accepted them for their situation and they would help by lending money and having their back if they were bullied 
(bare in mind not having a social worker or someone older to guide you family etc we would cling to this and see it as love care family etc)

they would come round the house hang out (as a semi independent house is only occupied by a key worker for 3-4hour a day they would spend the evenings/night there 

Very slowly teaching (brainwashing/convincing  foreign or vulnerable children so little things for them which they would as they feel they owe them now. 

You get the picture where this goes but many people I have seen come in and out of care have ended up in jail for things they would never dream of doing otherwise, like brothers in my home we bonded and cared looked after fed taught each other I can really call them brothers but we all were trapped and before we knew it we were all facing jail time and the local authorities were never there to see it.

No body who works for their local authority gets paid enough for what they do 

there’s not enough people to work around the clock yes there may be lots of numbers to call but would you really expect someone who has nothing to lose and feels unwanted to even try get on the right path no.

All I can say i believe if I didn’t have my key worker I wouldn’t be writing this 
please keep trying with these kids every single second just shopping or going for a coffee talking or cooking even getting told off (especially getting told off like a mum would) was the only thing that made us feel loved and cared for outside of the exploitation

Recently Completed!","Not everybody would hire an orc as their military strategist, but David Fleer would. He’d also use a little old lady as his getaway driver, and a deranged lizardman who clings to reality like a nudist clings to a cactus.

Maybe that’s why he’s on the verge of going out of business.

Fleer runs– or tries to run– Riotfish, Inc., a hard-luck mercenary outfit working cheap contracts for megacorporations who don’t want to get their hands dirty. He’d be better off fielding real soldiers, but he’s grown to love his misfits. Plus, they’re all he can afford.

Now the Riotfish are facing a critical cash shortage. They’re under the gun in more ways than one, and after a misunderstanding leads them to assault their auditor, all their loans are called due. Fleer and his crew have six weeks to come up with half a million credits, or they’ll be terminally out of business. And nobody will hire the survivors.

To make that kind of money, the Riotfish are going to have to get in way over their heads: navigating dark corporate conspiracies, blackmailing execs, and dodging vengeful black ops squads while working out how to steal a vast cache of forgotten corporate assets. Keeping the Riofish in business won’t mean much if they all end up dead, though. And Fleer is going to find out just how far he can push them.

Posted in SLF inbox flooded, time wasters, pic hunters, etc… one guy came later, told me where he lived, asked if I was close… I am. I usually entertain these messages when I’m bored and I was bored. But like I always do I ask a lot of questions and for pics. A little while later I’ll ask for a very specific pic of them holding something or doing something to verify to A) see if they can do it and B) if the pics match or (what usually happens) they disappear. Low and behold this guy did it within a minute. So we continue talking. 

He only lives a couple of hours away and comes here often. He offers a generous four digit ppm for a night, asks me where to book the hotel. It sounds too good to be true and I KNOW the cardinal rule is that Reddit men are fake, right?! 

EXCEPT, I’ve actually met two in person in the last month. One has a panty kink and we meet weekly (and he’s actually hot wtf) and the other we’ve met for coffee and have plans again Friday. 

But we continue talking, a lot, exchanging pics back and forth, we talk about the upcoming weekend. I ask him if he’s really serious because I’m arranging childcare that will be a really bad look if I have to cancel and he assures me he’s real. He’s coming. We’re talking about places to eat, to shop. Talking about life, etc. 

We start counting down sleeps. We talk all day today. Then BAM account deleted. 

F$$KKKK 

I know I messed up. I know I let this slide though. But damn if it doesn’t still sting. 

I’m just glad I’m the kind of girl that doesn’t count the $ until it’s in my hand or else I’d be even more upset. ",1,1738803527.0,SugarBABYonlyforum,4,1.0,False
1iiq649,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1iiq649/stress_induced_lpr/,Stress induced LPR?,"So this all started in the beginning of 2019 where I would always have a lot of phlegm in my throat shortly after eating any meal. I had a suspicion that this was maybe caused from acid reflux. I am a coffee and spicy food lover, so I wanted to do a test and see if these were my culprits. For an entire year I stopped drinking coffee (which was torture) and had no spicy food at all.  
  
NOTHING changed, I was still clearing my throat chronically after every meal. So I tried cutting carbs and only eating meat and veggies, nothing changed there either.
  
I've lived with this for about 5 years and I'm not the type of person to take medications, so I've refused PPI's and anything of the sort because of how negatively they can affect you.
  
I've tried Digestive Enzymes, Manuka Honey, herbal teas, Slippery Elm, etc.
  
Which really only leaves me to wonder if this could be stress related. I've had anxiety issues in my past but never really thought I was stressed. It's so hard to tell.

1iipzyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iipzyw/who_to_consider_dating_and_who_to_keep_as_more_of/,Who to consider dating and who to keep as more of a friend?,"I (25M) am at least a little bit interested in 3 women at the same time. I am totally OK keeping all three of them as friends (most of my best/lasting friendships are with women and there's never been anything romantic between me and them), but I would like to overcome my shyness and ask at least one of them out at some point, ideally with a long-term relationship in mind. I have the willpower to do it, but I'm not sure how to proceed the situation with each of them is so different.

The first person (let's call her ""K"") is a few years older than me and we've known each other for almost two years now. K studied/works in a similar field and is from a country that I used to live in, but we lived in different places so we've only met four or five times in person - I only developed a crush on her after she left and she started helping me practice her language. We've since gotten a lot closer, had a bit of a flirty vibe in texts sometimes, and talked openly about everything from daily life to existential/philosophical topics, even relationships (we have also had plans to call at some point.) She is gorgeous according to everyone and probably has the mind I appreciate the most, but I'm probably a less polished person than she is and she *might* see herself as out of my league looks-wise. I don't think she sees me as more than a friend right now and it feels the least likely to happen, but I know she is single and she might be open to dating under the right circumstances. If I want to take a chance on it, I will certainly have to wait until the next time I'm in her country (at least 3-4 months.) I should add that the field I work in/study is highly specific and it would be very nice, although not required, to have a partner who can relate to it. 

The second one (I'll call her ""L"") is someone I met relatively recently in person doing an extracurricular activity. I think she's cute, she's a year younger than me and she appears to be single but I don't know all that much about her yet. From what I do know, we generally have similar values, although I recently saw she attended a party while I'm definitely not a party type (and don't drink, although being in bars is fine). I think we're going to be in the same country for the next year or more - she's the only one of the three people who is in the country I live in right now - and her country of origin also happens to be the country I'd like to settle down in eventually. I have her social media and plan to ask her for a coffee soon either way, but given the situation with the other people, I'm not sure exactly how I should frame it.

The third person (""J"") is someone I've been talking to through an app, just out of curiosity to meet people from elsewhere. She's from the same country as L but still living there, and she definitely knows how to hold a conversation unlike a lot of other people. From what I can tell, we are a lot more similar - for example, she doesn't drink as well - and looking for the same thing (long-term relationship, or just staying friends). Naturally, I also find her attractive. However, figuring out someone's personality and literally going the extra mile for them without ever having met them in person is a big risk in my mind; like with K (the first person), I would have to wait until the summer for anything to develop.

Or, if there is another word that maybe is better suited? We have designated “mentorships” at my school, so mentor is only termed for that individual. 

I posted in no stupid questions because I feel stupid having to even ask it and that I’m way overthinking it. I just don’t want to come off the wrong way to those who are really ingrained in higher academia. 

I’m 22f and this professor was 27F, I believe. Her class was great, and we keep in contact about my education/career, her career, current political updates, personal life updates, etc. We meet up for tea/coffee to update each other on all the things that are going on in our lives and the world. We had a lot in common, and when I was in her class, she helped me a lot finding my path (career wise). Really was my biggest motivator into pushing myself and following my passion. 

I’m still enrolled in school, but I no longer am in her class and won’t be in the future. I just really need help to figure out if “friend” is okay, because in high school, obviously, that wasn’t normal and was weird. However, now I am an adult, we are peers (age and field of study wise), etc. I just really don’t want to come off as clueless and that I don’t “belong” there. 

(This all came up because she provided references to a position I am hiring for. I was explaining she’s a former professor I respect a lot and keep in touch with often, and I trust her insight a lot. I don’t want to go on tangents like I am rn and rather say a past professor I’m  friends with/have a great professional relationship/ whatever sounds the best and doesn’t make me look stupid!)

I have a new job which requires me to stay at a house in another state a few hours a way for a few days a week.  I found a used machine on Facebook marketplace which I *thought* was a great deal - I *thought* it was another Gaggia classic for $250.  I now have the machine in my house and set up on my counter.  It is NOT a gaggia classic - it says 'Coffee Gaggia' on the front.  It doesn't SOUND the same as my gaggia classic.. the portafilter has two holes for the espresso to come through instead of 'spouts' like on my Classic.  Also, I only get good crema on the second 'pull'.  So - my questions -basically- are:  1) What is this machine?  Is it the 1980's version of the classic? and 2) @$250, was I ripped off?

Ply here from Rogue Wave Coffee. A long update today.. 

This month code is LoveYourCoffeeYourWay or use [this link](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/discount/LoveYourCoffeeYourWay) for 10% off coffee, mech, MX.cool, and until next update, will work on drinkware as well. There are a few things to update, first of....


Coffee - Lots of new coffees! Watch out for New fruity decaf this week! Wilton Benitez (Granja Paraiso 92) Sidra is also back. And Kenya CM Natural from Maguta Estate as well! The Ethiopia Wush Wush (region) Red Honey has been tasting good, and the Nguisse Nare Murago is quite blue berry forward, if that is your Jam.  

Gears! Big Origami restock are hopefully will come by the end of the month. We have some new Cafede Kona stuff, and also Femobook A4Z as well! 

Now to a more important stuff

**Tariff** to USA.

As many of our customers are from the States, right now shipping to USA is somewhat not stable. While Tariff for Canada is halted for a few more weeks, this is not the case for China, and this can impact your order. This Tariff on China, is also tariff on products made in China, even if it is shipped from other countires. So some of your grinders, scales, milk pitcher, glasswares, etc these items can get, and will, get pull into formal clearance, as ""de minimis"" excemption are now not eligible for products of China (as well as shipment originated in China).

Quote from the Departmment of Homeland Security of USA [Document](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-02293.pdf)

""The additional ad valorem duty provided for in new HTSUS heading 9903.01.20 applies in addition to all other applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges. Further, the February 1, 2025 Executive Order clarifies that duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C.1321 shall not be available for the articles of China subject to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty. Accordingly, articles covered by heading 9903.01.20 shall not be eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) — the so-called “de minimis” exemption.""


**So please be mindful when you purchase stuff from us, or from other places shipped internationally to USA** as you will likely be responsible for duties and brokerage fees. Looking at the current rate, it seems like the minimum are around $32 USD per shipment for clearance. If you are purchasing something from outside the US, you would be consider an importer for said item(s). 


**SO FAR - our coffees, and products that are not manufacturer in China seems to have no problem with express clearance, and are not subject to tariff, duties, or brokerage fees.** In the next few days, we will update the listing for our items  to include where the items are made from, so that you can make an inform purchase. 

To say its been a stressful week would be an understatement. Thank you for your all your support and orders, we really really really do appreciate it. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concern at all.",4,1738802574.0,u_RogueWaveCoffee,2,1.0,False

Where to start. I genuinely hate writing these posts because I feel like I never tell or say enough. I guess I just have to hope for the best yet again. I'd love nothing more than to find a soulmate and a partner for life here but I know that's very rare and will probably not happen. Blah blah, at least I'm trying.

So yes, 'tis I. I'm 23 and I live in Finland, born and bred. I have a lovely borzoi dog and I live in a wonderful apartment near my parents. Family means everything to me. I'm a graduated hairdresser/barber and I am currently studying history and archeology online. I love cinema and writing (actually finished a poetry collection a month back) and also read, draw and sing in my free time (although I suck big fat redacted at singing). I am also a feminist, I love coffee, LOTR and I would do anything for the people I love.

That brings us to you!

From you, I would hope you're a decent human being. I have had my fair share of man children and trauma. I think it's a fair ask. I also hope you are good at speaking English and can keep up with my wittiness. I don't mind if we don't share the same music taste or if you don't like going to museums and discussing knights — what matters most is that we get along and our values match.

Now, I know bots and trolls are gonna swarm my DMs, so this is important: in your opening message, tell me your name, age, country and anything else you want to add — it could be about yourself or why you decided you want to get to know me.

Looking forward to hearing about you!  ",2,1738802549.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
