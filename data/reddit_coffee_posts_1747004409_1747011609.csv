The coffee caramel is amazing! Tastes like it has espresso beans in it.

Also tried their famous ‚Äúbee‚Äôs knees‚Äù flavor but it‚Äôs milder than I like. Very good, don‚Äôt get me wrong, just not as pronounced a flavor as I would‚Äôve preferred. The bits of honeycomb were a nice touch though.

Saw the long line outside the shop and figured it had to be good. Definitely worth a stop if you‚Äôre visiting the area of Cannery Row, Fishermen‚Äôs Wharf, or Alvarado Street. I‚Äôll certainly be taking any visiting family or friends.

Listen I (F27) want to start off by saying I have NEVER thought about doing this before. I recognize that a bartender is in their place of work. I used to work in the food industry so I know how it is.

That being said, there is a bartender I really like at my regular place (also female and gay- yes she told me she‚Äôs gay). We always talk and joke around, make eyes at each other from across the room, wave and so on. I‚Äôve caught her looking at me before a few different times, and whenever we lock eyes, she turns away really fast and I do too. 

Yesterday she made me a drink and I told her I ‚Äúloved it.‚Äù (It was the best espresso martini I‚Äôve had not too creamy and strong coffee and she put my initials in the drink lol) and she goes ‚Äúwell do you love me too?‚Äù 

Now I know bartenders flirt to get tips and I do tip really well, but idk it‚Äôs been months since we‚Äôve been joking around and I‚Äôve discovered I really like her personality. She‚Äôs sooo funny I am nearly on the floor everytime we talk. My friend who goes with me every week keeps telling me to just go for it. She said she can feel the vibes, but I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of just leaving my number on a receipt and seeing what happens. 
I just don‚Äôt want to be THAT person that makes someone feel uncomfortable. I would totally respect it if she chose not to text.  I‚Äôm not looking for a booty call either or anything it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve gotten to know her from going there so much and I really like her. ",4,1747011134.0,bartenders,0,1.0,False

I've tried to heed the advice from many on this sub putting this itinerary draft together, but please feel free to drop your two cents in the comments! I would also *love* any suggestions for food, coffee, breweries, wine tasting, and lodging where we're going!

1kkfuh1,https://i.redd.it/ouyw3oypz80f1.png,"First time Yopo snuff, incredible experience","Feel like there's never too many personal accounts of working recipes and experiences so here's mine.

Took about 13 seeds and toasted them, covered, on a warm pan until most popped.  

There was a roasty popcorn smell and a bit of smoke when I took off the lid

The seeds were now puffy and brittle.

Then very gently peeled the outer husk off each seed

Put the seed meat into a coffee bean grinder and pulsed until a fine powder.

Eyeballed 10:1 seed to calcium hydroxide.  So about 1/4 teaspoon of calcium hydroxide powder for 13 seeds (some were small some were big so if say this works for anywhere from 10-15 seeds but haven't tried a lower or higher ratio)

Added the CaOH to the coffee bean grinder with the seeds and pulsed again until mixed well.

Poured the powder into a bowl and added enough water to make the mix pasty.  1/2-1 teaspoon.  Mixed well with a silicone spatula.

Spread the mix thin on the warm pan and turned the heat on and off to keep it warm and accelerate drying.  Left it on the pan until it was a brittle flaky texture and the color had turned light and nothing felt soft.  Smells just like peanut butter or roasted peanuts.

Scraped everything up into a little foil dish and let sit for 48 hours, kneading the chunky powder now and then. peanut smell was almost gone in that time.

Put the chunky powder back into the coffee bean grinder and pulsed until a fine powder accumulated on the cover.  Dusted it off into a tiny jar.

Woke up 7:30 am did not eat breakfast just drank water. 

At 11:00 am I sat down to take the snuff.

Packed tepi with 1/2 teaspoon of snuff for each nostril.

Burned like all hell and forced my eyes closed.  Felt immediate pressure in the head and tingliness over the entire body.

1kkfte9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kkfte9/every_full_moon_my_friends_lock_me_in_my_room/,"Every full moon, my friends lock me in my room until dawn. I wish I never found out the reason why.","I don‚Äôt think my friends are human anymore.

Sorry for typos or just a MESS of a post. But I'm at a loss what to do. 

This is a pretty explosive statement to make, but I have nowhere else to go.

There‚Äôs something seriously wrong with my roommates. 

I‚Äôve lived with them for almost two years now. 

They were my saving grace in my sophomore year of college when I was at my worst mentally. 

I won‚Äôt spend a long time describing them or telling our backstory, but I want you to know these are not bad people. 

I‚Äôve known them and trusted them too long. In a way, they‚Äôre like my second family or even my first.

I‚Äôm writing this post because I‚Äôm getting increasingly worried about them and myself, and the state we have found ourselves in.

It began around a month ago. 

I started losing time. Long stretches of time, whether it was night or day. 

I‚Äôd go to class or to the library to study, and suddenly wake up at home. I didn‚Äôt remember walking back or what I‚Äôd been doing in that missing stretch of time.

I thought it was stress-related or maybe health-related, so I went to see the campus doctor. 

But he just prescribed me sleeping pills and asked me questions about my diet and lifestyle, as if that had anything to do with the fact that I was blacking out.

It was the same every time. 

I woke up in bed with a gnawing hunger in my gut, like I hadn‚Äôt eaten in weeks, and no memory of how I got there.

It was definitely a weird situation, and paired with the fact that my roommates  were acting increasingly weirder and less like themselves, I figured the two were linked. 

The thing with them wasn‚Äôt too crazy at first. 

I mean, it was just something I noticed. 

For reasons which baffled me, the three of them were suddenly sensitive to the moon.

And I don‚Äôt mean that it caused them headaches or nausea. I mean it affected them in ways which didn‚Äôt make sense.

Have you ever heard of the Transylvania Effect?

According to Discovery Magazine:

‚ÄúIn the dark sky, the clouds shift, revealing the full moon‚Äôs eerie silver gleam, and the people on Earth below go mad.‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt have called it going mad, but something was wrong with them.

Different.

And it‚Äôs always the full moon that triggers it. Which made me wonder if it was, in fact, the Transylvania Effect.

I first noticed it at Abigail Matheson‚Äôs house party. The party was nothing special, really. 

I didn‚Äôt drink that much that night. 

The point is, I can‚Äôt blame what I saw on being drunk.

I know perception can be misinterpreted and messed up when you‚Äôve had one too many canned Strawberry Daiquiris, but I was completely sober.

And I was planning on staying that way until we left.

I remember the night in clarity. I‚Äôm not a fan of crowds, so I lingered in Abigail‚Äôs kitchen playing around on my phone.

I only knew Abigail Matheson from Rowan and Immie. They were in the same classes.

I needed to find something to occupy my mind or I was going to die of boredom.

Most of the party was in the living room playing Mario Kart, and I was refilling my glass when I glimpsed Immie‚Äôs familiar blonde ponytail bouncing through straggling students grinding against each other.

The party wasn‚Äôt costume-themed, but Immie insisted on wearing a baby blue ribbon in her hair, which reminded me of a grown Disney character.

Imogen Prairie was the human embodiment of a golden retriever.

She is as adorable as she is na√Øve and is always smiling no matter the situation.

I lifted my drink in greeting, about to shout her name, but then I saw the expression on her face.

She looked‚Ä¶ wary.

No, that‚Äôs not the word. 

I can‚Äôt describe her expression because I couldn‚Äôt understand it myself. 

For once, Imogen wasn‚Äôt smiling. Her eyes were wide, lips twitching into a scowl.

Her movements were erratic as she headed into the kitchen, grabbing a glass of punch and downing it before striding towards the back window and pulling the blinds shut.

Rowan, roommate number two, was right behind her.

They were talking in hushed whispers, their heads pressed together before Rowan noticed me.

Rowan was what you would call pretentious cute.

Usually dressed in trench coats, his party outfit was oddly normal.

Shirt and jeans, a loose pair of glasses sitting on top of unruly brown curls.

Rowan Beck resembled what *he* called a ‚Äònormie‚Äô.

He fixed me with what I can only describe as a patient smile. ‚ÄúNin! Have you seen Kaz?‚Äù

The copious amounts of lemonade I‚Äôd been drinking all night started to crawl back up my throat.

His tone was different. Darker. Nothing like I knew.

That was the first night I noticed something was wrong with him.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I said stupidly. ‚ÄúKaz?‚Äù

Rowan raised a brow. ‚ÄúYep. Kazzzz.‚Äù He dragged out the Z. ‚ÄúThe guy you *live* with. Have you seen him anywhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't think so.‚Äù I caught his sharp glance at the blinds. ‚ÄúRowan, are you‚Ä¶ okay?‚Äù

The man's gaze snapped to me. 

‚ÄúI'm peachy.‚Äù

Rowan leaned against the table, his expression darkening. I sensed the desperation emitting from him, but it didn‚Äôt make sense. Was Kaz in trouble? 

And why were they keeping it between them? What were we, little kids? 

His expression was sour, like he couldn't bear talking to me. 

‚ÄúDid Kaz by any chance‚Ä¶ I don't know,‚Äù he tapped out a tune on the countertop. ‚ÄúMayyyybeee go outside?‚Äù

Our third roomie had been MIA since the four of us walked in earlier. 

He made a comment about going to talk to a guy he was crushing on before disappearing into the crowd. 

I hadn‚Äôt seen him since. Which was very unlike Kaz. 

When it comes to games, or anything playable, he‚Äôs a competitive bastard. 

I expected him to be in the living room with the others, slamming buttons like his life depended on it. Instead, he was nowhere to be seen. 

I opened my mouth to speak, when Immie stuck her head through the gap in the door. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine!‚Äù Immie said, a streak of panic in her tone. She shooed me back when I started forwards. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this. Kaz is just, uh, well, he's doing Kaz stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúKaz *stuff*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Imogen‚Äôs smile was a little too big. ‚ÄúLike I said, we‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave we?‚Äù Rowan snapped. He raked his fingernails down his face. ‚ÄúHow do you lose a 23 year old guy?‚Äù

Immie scowled, throwing a cup in his face. 

‚ÄúHe told me he was going to the bathroom.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I could follow him.‚Äù

Rowan tossed a cup right back at her. ‚ÄúIn these circumstances, yes, you should have followed him!‚Äù 

Lowering his voice, Rowan pulled her closer. But I still heard him. ‚ÄúHe could *drown!* What did I tell you about keeping the idiot away from the pool?‚Äù 

Imogen scoffed. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, how is that fair? Why don't *you* babysit?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou offered.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, not for the whole night!‚Äù

Their argument was barely registering. 

*Drown?*

‚ÄúNin. You stay here.‚Äù Immie grabbed a reluctant Rowan‚Äôs arm.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go get him.‚Äù

I nodded with a smile, but that didn‚Äôt stop me following them. 

I made it to the front door, almost tripping over myself. 

The party continued behind me, laughter, and giddy screaming from the living room. 

In front of me, however, was something entirely different from the party. 

The front door was wide open, and the night sky bled inside the house. 

My three roommates  stood on the threshold, their heads tipped back, eyes on the night sky, and the full moon bathing the dark in unearthly light. 

I‚Äôve looked this phenomenon up, and it can be called ‚ÄúMoon drunk‚Äù but this had never happened before. I had lived with them for two years and this was the first time they were entranced by the fucking moon of all things. 

Kaz was in front of the others, and I glimpsed a can of beer at his feet spilling its contents onto rough concrete.

At first, I thought they were marvelling the sight. I mean, it was beautiful enough to stare at and smile, maybe comment on it or take a photo. 

""Hey."" I clapped my hands in Rowan's face. ""What's going on?"" 

He didn't even blink. 

Moving to Immie and Kaz, I shook them. 

Still nothing. 

They did move‚Ä¶ eventually. 

‚ÄúSee.‚Äù Rowan‚Äôs voice was almost a breath, his gaze still on the sky. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found him.‚Äù

When the music stopped, they came back to life, ignoring me, and bound back into the party with no explanation to what the hell had just happened.

‚ÄúMoon drunk‚Äù was starting to make the most sense.  

I got my answer when I went back inside, and Kaz was raiding the refrigerator. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I saw pieces of raw bacon squelching between his fingers and stringy white sticking from his mouth. 

Now, there‚Äôs getting the munchies, and there‚Äôs willingly stuffing yourself with raw bacon. 

‚ÄúKaz?‚Äù

The boy twisted around so fast, almost inhuman. 

Kaz slowly inclined his head, bacon fat caught between his teeth. 

There was a feral look in his eyes, which told me if I even attempted to stop him from feasting on raw pork, I‚Äôd lose a finger.  

His gaze tracked me like a predator, before turning back to his meal. 

I left him to whatever *that* was. 

Immie, who hadn‚Äôt paid attention to a guy since freshman year when she was assaulted at a party, was sitting in a random guy‚Äôs lap, her lips latched to his ear. 

It was Immie who looked to be the one in control, but even being moon drunk, I didn‚Äôt want her anywhere near a guy. 

Not when she was still in therapy. 

Before I could intervene, my housemate was yanking the guy to his feet in one pull and dragging him upstairs.

To my shock, though, it was the guy who pulled away from her. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù He hissed, ‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù

Immie didn‚Äôt seem fazed. She just offered him a smile and walked away, this time plonking herself in a girls lap.

It was strange behavior, considering Kaz was a vegetarian, and Imogen was terrified of intimacy.

Rowan was acting, objectively, the least weird. I found him in the kitchen staring into his drink.

When I tried talking to him, he responded with one-word answers, his gaze glued to whatever was so fucking fascinating about his glass of diet coke. Was it a dead fly? 

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

I followed him around, trying to snap him out of it. 

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù His voice was almost sing-song. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

He twisted around, doing a little dance, half lidded eyes struggling to take me in. 

‚ÄúWhaaaaaat?!‚Äù

I tried to keep my patience. ‚ÄúDid you know your best friend is currently gnawing on raw pig?‚Äù

I regretted my words ten seconds after saying them. 

This guy was going to be *zero* help. 

‚ÄúUhmmm, soooo?‚Äù Rowan settled me with a childish grin. ‚ÄúYou know what you are, Nin?‚Äù

I didn't answer, already expecting a stupid answer. 

Rowan threw a plastic cup at me. *‚ÄùCuphead.‚Äù*

Comedic genius. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù I hissed, only for him to lean forward, and blow in my face. 

‚ÄúDo you like chicken *tenders*?‚Äù He asked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Rowan spent the rest of the evening aimlessly walking around with a stupid smile on his face. 

He called me *Cuphead* for three hours straight. 

All three of them had that same mystified grin and I couldn't snap them out of it. 

After the party, I noticed the following full-moon they seemed to go 0-100 in terms of personality changes. 

Kaz would spontaneously decide to go visit his parents in another state for no reason. 

Rowan was obsessed with blocking every window to avoid moonlight spilling in, and insisted the whole house had to be protected with duct tape covering every window and reflective surface. 

As for me, I was locked inside my room with the curtains drawn‚Äîforced to wear headphones with music playing. 

There was only one rule I had to follow, and when I questioned it, I just got the same answer from all three. ‚ÄúTrust us.‚Äù 

They wanted me to trust them when Kaz was gnawing on raw meat like an animal during a full moon, Immie was throwing herself at random guys and girls, and Rowan went into a trance-like state when he caught sight of anything reflective.

I understood the moon was affecting them in ways I couldn‚Äôt understand. 

But locking me in my room until the morning was over-kill. 

I was the only one who wasn‚Äôt affected by the moon‚Äôs light, and yet they treated me like I was in trouble too.

Despite being overly reluctant, I agreed to their rules. I stayed in my room and listened to music as loud as it would go. 

According to them, I couldn‚Äôt at any point remove my headphones. 

After playing half of my Spotify playlist, I drifted off, and before I knew what was happening, I was waking up with sunlight poking through the blinds,  feeling like shit, a gnawing hunger in my gut which splintered into nausea. 

There were differences that jumped out at me when I pried my eyes open, blinking through intense sunlight.

I was wearing different clothes. 

I remembered I‚Äôd changed into a shirt and shorts for bed, but I was dressed for the day. I didn‚Äôt remember drinking anything before falling asleep, but an empty glass was on my bedside.

Except mouth was parched, my lips dry.

I didn‚Äôt question it. I wanted to, but anything was possible.

Maybe I was the delusional one. 

I was blacking out, so maybe I dressed myself without knowing, and then slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink of water in the early morning.

After that night, things seemed to go back to normal. 

I decided that it really was a case of being moon-drunk. 

The others didn‚Äôt talk about it again, and life went on, I guess.

I thought about talking about it with them, but when I tried, they would stiffen up or change the subject. 

Rowan would completely shut me down, and Kaz acted like I had a contagious disease. 

I asked Immie if anything happened, and she screwed up her face and jumped up with an excuse that she needed to go somewhere. 

Kaz dismissed everything I said and told me they were fine, and that the moon just ‚Äúgave them headache‚Äù.

I can be an idiot sometimes, but I was pretty sure eating raw bacon like an animal couldn‚Äôt be justified with that excuse. 

When I tried to argue, he grabbed the controller from a sleeping Rowan, and dared me to fuck up Immie‚Äôs island. 

I did, swiftly ending up covered in Rowan‚Äôs breakfast the next morning.

So, basically, my roommates  were hiding something big from me, and I wasn‚Äôt planning on telling them about the blackouts.

Because part of me wondered if they were involved. 

I was convinced the two phenomenons were linked.

So, yeah, a pretty toxic mindset to have on both sides.

Anyway, this leads me to what happened last night.

It was the usual‚Äì the usual I had gotten used to, anyway. 

After class, I hurried home to help with prepping the house for the full moon. 

Rowan was standing on a chair, taping up the windows, and Immie was closing all the curtains and blinds. 

He was being an asshole as usual, so I busied myself with hiding everything reflective I could find, before retiring to the living room and joining Kaz who was working on his laptop. 

Immie and Rowan were hard to talk to about what was going on, but with Kaz being the resident stoner, his walls came down a little. I slumped down on our Craigslist couch and grabbed a controller, resuming a game of COD from earlier. 

‚ÄúSo.‚Äù I focused on the game, navigating my first-person character through a pile of bodies.

Kaz offered me a smile over his laptop. He reeked of weed. 

‚ÄúSoo..?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you ever planning on telling me what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe moon.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moon night, and as usual everyone‚Äôs freaking out.‚Äù

‚ÄúFreaking out?‚Äù Kaz‚Äôs gaze strayed on his laptop screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the epitome of calm right now.‚Äù

I threw a cushion at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stoned. And I‚Äôm still waiting for you to explain your spontaneous Peppa Pig binge.‚Äù

He tossed me a sheepish smile. ‚ÄúI was hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a vegetarian!‚Äù I said, immediately remembering Rowan‚Äôs moon-drunk state. 

‚ÄúRowan was‚Ä¶ *giggling*.‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ oh god, I'm still having nightmares.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúOkay, he was definitely replaced.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr you *both* were.‚Äù 

Kaz shrugged. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already told you. It‚Äôs just sensitivity. The moon can do shit like that. Look it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSensitivity.‚Äù I repeated in a scoff, glaring at war-torn Europe on the TV screen. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre calling it?‚Äù

Kaz lifted his head, his gaze snapping to me. ‚ÄúWhat else do you want to call it?‚Äù

I took a deep breath. I had some guesses.  

‚ÄúWerewolf?‚Äù

He curled his lip, but I noticed his eyes darken significantly. ‚ÄúVery‚Ä¶ original. Ten points for creativity.‚Äù

‚ÄúWerewolves freak out every full moon.‚Äù I said. 

He nodded, humoring me as he typed. Kaz was like an older brother. ‚ÄúUh-huh. They're also not real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that far-fetched!""

Kaz stopped typing, raising a brow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure humans can‚Äôt turn into dogs under the full moon. You've been watching too many movies.‚Äù He shot me a look. ‚ÄúWeren't you like, *really* into Teen Wolf?‚Äù 

I put the controller down. ‚ÄúYou lock me in my room until morning.‚Äù I twisted to face him. ‚ÄúHow is that normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a precaution. You‚Äôve told us how weird we act, so it‚Äôs better to stay away from us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel better if I was with you.‚Äù I swallowed. ‚ÄúSo, I know what‚Äôs really going on.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs expression seemed to change, relaxing slightly. He looked like he might reply, before Rowan came crashing in. Quite literally. 

That guy can‚Äôt walk two feet without falling or slamming into something. 

In this case, he tripped over the rug Immie had been vacuuming. I blamed the moon‚Äôs influence on him being more hyperactive than normal. Rowan oozed ADHD. 

Stumbling into the back of the couch, he grasped onto the back to stable himself. ‚ÄúWhat are you guys talking about?‚Äù

Kaz went back to typing with an exaggerated sigh. ‚ÄúNin thinks we‚Äôre werewolves.‚Äù

Rowan straightened up with a very nervous laugh. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWerewolves.‚Äù Kaz shut his laptop. ‚ÄúYou know, people who can turn into dogs? Honestly, I‚Äôm offended. I thought Nin was more creative than that. There‚Äôs a whole Wikipedia page on moon afflicted creatures, and she goes with the obvious.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um, wowwwww.‚Äù Rowan chuckled. ‚ÄúTeen Wolf style?‚Äù

Kaz grinned. ‚ÄúTV show or 1980‚Äôs movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Rowan started clearing up the TV table, flipping through comic books.  ‚ÄúThey both suck.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat sucks?‚Äù Immie yelled from the kitchen.

‚ÄúTeen Wolf!‚Äù Rowan yelled back.

The girl made a sound of horror, and it was hard to hide my smile. 

‚ÄúTake that back!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad.‚Äù Rowan said, loud enough for her to hear. ‚ÄúYou forced me to watch an episode, and I fell asleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was after season 3!‚Äù Immie appeared in the doorway, wielding a spoon like she was going to attack him.

Gesturing wildly with the spoon, Immie was desperate to defend her lockdown guilty pleasure.

‚ÄúAfter season three it declined in quality. But it was still good! You liked the episode with the chess game!‚Äù

Rowan shrugged. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt change my overall rating.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you, IGN?‚Äù Immie turned and marched back into the kitchen and slammed the door.

It took maybe an hour for the two of them to get back on her good side.

See, I think about these moments, and I wonder why I‚Äôm writing this post.

I think I‚Äôm still in denial. I want to tell you thousands of reasons why they‚Äôre not bad people.

But then I remember what happened after that. I remember why I can‚Äôt talk to anyone else but an anonymous subreddit.

At around 10PM I found myself once again in my room going through the same routine.

This time, though, they wanted to be extra careful. Which meant a new addition to make sure I stayed there until dawn.

Rowan knelt in front of me. I couldn‚Äôt see the look in his eyes through his raybans, but I could tell he was wary.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù He fixed the headphones over my ears, jiggling them a little to make sure they were fitted properly.

I tugged at the handcuffs securing my left hand to the bed frame. ‚ÄúKinky.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just until morning, Nin.""

‚ÄúHandcuffs, though?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAre they really necessary?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúRemember what you have to do?‚Äù

""Music on and blasting until I fall asleep.‚Äù

""And?""

""And I'm not coming out until morning.""

Rowan hummed. ‚ÄúLastly?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remove the headphones.‚Äù

He jumped up. ‚ÄúAll right! Are you all set?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I tried to smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got enough 80‚Äôs pop and sad indie to last me a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome.‚Äù

I tugged at the cuffs. ‚ÄúRowan, if something is going on, you can tell me.‚Äù

He didn't turn around. ""Really? Because, no offence, but I don‚Äôt think a pep talk will help.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I can try.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be locked up here every full moon because you‚Äôre scared of moonlight.‚Äù

I was startled when he sputtered out a laugh before getting close‚Äîtoo close‚Äîhis icy breath grazing my cheeks.

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù Rowan murmured, ‚ÄúMaybe if you weren‚Äôt a coward that day, things might be different. But here we are, Nin,"" He flicked me on the nose. ""Drunk on the fucking moon."" He exhaled in my face, and something warm crept up my throat. ‚ÄúQuite literally.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a werewolf, Rowan?‚Äù I blurted. 

His entire demeanour changed suddenly. I felt him stiffen. 

I was used to his bad moods before the moon, but this was something different. 

This was hatred and resentment in its purest form shown in the twitch of his lips. 

I didn‚Äôt have to see his eyes. 

His smile through gritted teeth told me everything.

Slowly, Rowan tipped his head to the side, like he was feigning innocence. ‚ÄúWhat gave you *that* idea?‚Äù

Before I could reply, he climbed off the bed and offered me a two fingered salute, his lips twisting into a grin I knew was fake.

It made me wonder if I was wrong.

If the moon didn‚Äôt change them, instead bringing out their true feelings and selves. 

But that only brought more questions. 

He mentioned ‚Äúthat day‚Äù which was part of the endless blur of darkness, memories torn from me in my blackouts. 

Did something happen during one of those instances which had triggered them to act like this? 

With that question in my mind, I attempted to lunge from the restraints, but he was already at the door. 

‚ÄúNight.""

I didn‚Äôt reply. 

I knew not to entertain him when he was starting to feel the moon‚Äôs effects.

When the door slammed shut and I heard the twist of the key in the lock, I lay back and closed my eyes.

I considered tearing off the headphones and ignoring the rules, but that seemed petty.

Plus, I was tired.

I drifted off to music slamming in my ears. I still don‚Äôt know how I slept through it. 

I don‚Äôt know how long I was out for, but it couldn‚Äôt have been long. 

A few hours. 

I woke up feeling ravenously hungry, and yet hollow at the same time.

When I sat up, I noticed something felt‚Ä¶ wrong. 

I frowned at my toes for way longer than necessary until I realized one was missing. 

*I was supposed to have five toes on each foot*, my foggy mind murmured. 

I counted them twice, but there were only four. My pinkie toe was gone. 

After staring at it for a while, I blinked, and I could have sworn it appeared in flashes, like the flesh was knitting itself back together. I was seeing things. 

That‚Äôs what I told myself. Sleep paralysis was a thing, so I waited until I was fully with it, and when I was, my mind began to drink in my surroundings. The room was still dark, only lit up by my bedside lamp. 

I was in different clothes once more, and an empty glass of water stood on my bed stand. 

Something was different though. 

It was still dark outside, and I could just about glimpse a sliver of moonlight poking through the blinds.

Another thing which was different: My hand was no longer cuffed to my bed frame.

Sitting up, I stretched, and headed to the door. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to peek, I thought.

I reached out and grabbed the handle and twisted it, only for the door to swing open.

Weird. Wasn‚Äôt it locked?

They probably had some weird ritual to keep the moon out which Kaz found on Yahoo Answers.

Far too embarrassing for me to see.

Slowly, I made my way across the hall and passed the others rooms which were all silent. Which meant they were downstairs.

If I was honest with myself, I really didn‚Äôt want to deal with them if they were under the moon‚Äôs effects, but the rest of me was desperate to know what they had been hiding. 

Why was I sentenced to my room until dawn? 

The clock on rustic paintwork told me it was 1am as I slipped down the stairs, careful not to make noise. That meant I‚Äôd been asleep for around four hours. 

I heard voices when I reached the kitchen door. Immie was laughing, and Rowan made a hissing noise.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair. You always get the blue ones first and never give anyone a chance. I call bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, because you‚Äôre losing!‚Äù Immie shot back.

‚ÄúRowan‚Äôs right, though.‚Äù Kaz joined in. ‚ÄúYou do act territorial over Park Place and Boardwalk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not!‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least give someone else a chance to get the blue ones, Immie.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? I got them fair and square! You‚Äôre just calling me out because you‚Äôve got‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Rowan yelled. ‚ÄúHey, she can‚Äôt just do that!‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo hundred dollars left.‚Äù Immie sang. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre stuck in jail. I rest my case.‚Äù

Huh. They were playing Monopoly without me. So, they locked me in my room and played games till dawn?

That stung a little.

I could have walked away. I mean, they were having fun. I should have left them to tear themselves apart over a board game.

But I was grabbing the handle and twisting it, pulling open the door.

When I stepped into our kitchen, the first thing I saw was the impressive amount of property cards Immie had lain out in front of her, as well as the pile of cash sitting next to the board. I started to speak. 

I think I was going to congratulate Immie on her clear win, but the words choked up when my gaze continued across the table, this time settling on a small plastic container filled with red mush, which Kaz was sticking his fingers in and scooping into his mouth. The kitchen looked so familiar and yet different as my brain struggled to react with what I was seeing. 

Immie‚Äôs face was split into a manic grin because of her win, but there was something splattered on her lips and dripping from her chin. It wasn‚Äôt Immie I was looking at. It was what was in front of her, spread out like a main course, what she was tearing at like an animal.  

What was hanging out of Kaz‚Äôs mouth in slithering strands dyed scarlet and piled on Rowan‚Äôs plate. 

I was seeing flesh covering the table and them‚Äîand the floor. 

And they were stuffing themselves.

I thought it was raw chicken at first and had decided at that moment that they really had lost their minds. 

Then, though, I saw what was lying at their feet. I saw the torso first, which had been torn into, guts spilling out onto the floor. 

The body was an unrecognizable mass of skinned bone and pooling scarlet before I saw the face, and clumps of hair which had been ragged from the skull. 

I recognised that dirty blonde ponytail. Unbelievably, I was staring at myself. 

I was ahead of my brain at that moment. 

I was already seeing everything for what it was in a hazy red cloud, and my brain could do nothing.

It was me they were eating.

They were ripping me apart‚Äîgnawing on my bones.

Stuffing my guts into a plastic container and using me as dip.

I was paralysed. I looked at the window, at the duct tape blocking out the moon‚Äôs light.

So, this wasn‚Äôt an effect of the moon.

This was them.

This was all THEM.

Immie was the first to notice me. 

Her smile dampened, and she dropped what looked like stringy pieces of intestine clenched between her fists. 

My roommate's eyes widened, and for a moment she looked like she was on the edge of hysteria. ‚ÄúNin!‚Äù she squeaked, the mushy mess of guts slipping from her hands. ‚ÄúHey! Uh, this‚Ä¶. this‚Äî‚Äù

The girl was struggling, her eyes snapping to my body which had been hollowed out and cut into pieces on the floor.

Then, to Rowan‚Äôs plate filled with a red mush of blended whatever.

And whatever the fuck Kaz was sticking his fingers in. 

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt what it looks like.‚Äù Kaz finished for her. He stood up,  seeming calmer than the others.

Rowan was staring at me. 

His raybans pinned back dark curls, and his eyes didn‚Äôt seem angry or even fazed that I was seeing this. They only regarded me with amusement. 

Like he *wanted* me to find this. He looked torn whether to continue chewing on my flesh or try to explain.

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù Immie jumped up. ‚ÄúWe can explain.‚Äù She whispered. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶ or we can‚Äôt explain right now, but if you just let us‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLet us what?‚Äù Rowan scoffed. ‚ÄúExplain? Yeah, we‚Äôre way past that point. ""Do you want to try explaining caf√© de Nin?‚Äù

He pointed to his chin. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a little of her small intestine there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Immie shot me a look, swiping at her chin with her sleeve. ‚ÄúNin, ignore him!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember my legs moving, but I was at the front door before I could release a breath.

They followed me, their thundering footsteps pounding behind me.

Now they were scared.

When I was so close to the door, so close to letting in that unearthly light, their expression‚Äôs turned fearful.

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù Kaz swiped blood from his mouth and chin.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open that fucking door.‚Äù

Immie wrapped her arms around herself. ‚ÄúIs she here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Rowan grumbled, shading his eyes. ‚ÄúAnd she won‚Äôt come, as long as that door stays shut.‚Äù

I found my voice. ‚ÄúWho are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody.‚Äù Kaz said. ‚ÄúJust go back upstairs. We‚Äôll explain. I promise you. But you have to trust us.‚Äù

His tone was a warning.

‚ÄúTrust you?!‚Äù I managed to get out. ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me?‚Äù

It was funny.

How they wanted me to trust them when I saw what they had done to me.

I couldn‚Äôt speak, couldn‚Äôt breathe. 

I didn‚Äôt want an explanation or a scuffed excuse. I wanted out of there.

The rest is a sort of blur. I remember opening the door. Or at least I started to open it, and then I shut it again, panicking.

Their cries were enough to make me regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I watched their eyes fill up with that same unearthly light which bathed the sky. It was beautiful and terrifying the way their resolve crumbled in their eyes and lips. 

Scowls turned to whimsical smiles, and blood stained hands fell to their sides. 

The three of them headed back into the kitchen, and a sudden rhythmic knock on the front door startled me. 

I remember Rowan at the corner of my eye, rummaging around in a draw. 

Immie and Kaz stood behind him.

I risked going to the window and peeking out, but all I saw was the moon. 

The moon was right there, three inches from my face like it had encased the sky and oblivion beyond. For a moment I was taken aback at how beautiful she was. 

There she was bathing me in her light, in her glow, filling me with her song and her sweet words. And then a thud sounded behind me. 

Whatever had leached onto my mind let go, and I twisted to find Rowan on the ground in a rapidly growing pool of red. 

Her voice was in his head. Just like it was in mine. Another thud, and then another, almost in sync. Kaz and Immie followed. 

Their throats had been slit by their own fingernails fashioned into claws. 

When it hit me that my roommates  were dead, I was seeing her reflection in everything. In silverware which had been brought out from the draws‚Äîbleeding through the duct tape on the back window. 

I knew what I had to do.

 I had to get the cops. 

I was halfway upstairs when a blinding flash filled the hallway, followed by the sound. It sounded like a camera, like someone was taking a photo. 

When I grabbed my phone from my room, the moon lingered on the screen, growing larger until I swore she wasn‚Äôt just in reflective surfaces. 

She was at the corner of my eye, a half crescent quickly reaching totality the more I caught her shadow looming.

It was like a game she was playing. The more I caught her light, she only grew bigger.

After a hysterical freak-out with the cops, they came 5 minutes later.

Two officers followed me inside the house, one of them asking how many people were dead.

‚ÄúThree.‚Äù I kept saying. ‚ÄúMy roommates .‚Äù I was speaking in barely decipherable sobs. ‚ÄúMy roommates  are dead.

When I led them into the kitchen, however, bracing myself for the gory aftermath of what I saw, I was greeted by the three of them sitting on the floor, resuming their game of Monopoly. 

My body, as well as every piece of me was fucking gone.

The blood pooling on the floor, as well as staining their skin and faces‚Äîwas gone.

‚ÄúOfficers.‚Äù Rowan saluted the cops with his drink. I noticed a glitter of light in his eyes, in Kaz‚Äôs when he stood and folded his arms, his lips pulling into a smile. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He shot a look at me. ‚ÄúNin, come on. We‚Äôre in the middle of a game.‚Äù

The officer standing behind me frowned. ‚ÄúWe were informed of a triple homicide.‚Äù He cleared his throat. 

‚ÄúEverything seems to be relatively normal.‚Äù  

Stepping in front of me, he was scowling. ‚ÄúMiss Caine, are you aware that wasting police time is a criminal offence?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were dead.‚Äù I said in a hiss. ‚ÄúI saw them. They were dead!""

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù The second officer sighed, turning to Kaz.

‚ÄúIs your friend under the influence of drugs?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr too many scary movies?‚Äù The other scoffed.

Rowan jumped up. ‚ÄúUh, nope! No, we‚Äôre all good, officer!‚Äù 

When he came over and grabbed my arm, his grasp was strangely gentle. When I was leaning into it, however, I glimpsed something on his neck. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but it was engraved into his flesh. 

The number 2. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not feeling great.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWe, uh, we apologize for any crap caused.‚Äù

The cops didn‚Äôt say a word when they left, only muttering to each other about ‚Äústupid kids‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt face my roommates  after that. I went upstairs and splashed water on my face.

I was seeing things, I told myself.

I was going fucking crazy.

But then my fingers found the back of my neck, and I was twisting around, something acidic creeping up my throat.

Rowan‚Äôs neck displayed the number 2.

While mine had the number 27.

I went to bed after that. I was all ready to grab my things and leave while they slept, but when I risked standing on the top of the stairs, Kaz was in front of the door. 

It didn‚Äôt look like he was blocking it intentionally, but I wasn‚Äôt going to try.

This morning was awkward. That‚Äôs the only word I can think of to describe it.

My roommates  acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing happened. 

When I asked if the police had come back, Immie frowned at me over her oatmeal she hadn‚Äôt touched. 

‚ÄúPolice?‚Äù Her eyes grew wide. ‚ÄúWait, did something happen last night?‚Äù

I was waiting for her to eat it, but she was just staring at it like it was sentient. 

I thought back to last night, watching her chewing through a mouthful of me, and I felt sick to my stomach.

‚ÄúDoubt it.‚Äù Rowan had his back to me, making coffee. ‚ÄúAll I remember is passing out after Monopoly.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter you lost.‚Äù Immie coughed. 

‚ÄúLast night doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù 

Kaz grabbed a seat next to me. ‚ÄúAs far as we know, moon sensitivityTM didn‚Äôt get us, and Rowan let Imogen win Monopoly. Nin stayed in her room, and we survived another full moon.‚Äù 

He smiled. ‚ÄúCheers to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Nin.‚Äù Rowan pushed past me when he took his plate to the dishwasher. ‚ÄúIf anyone knocks today, don‚Äôt fucking answer it.‚Äù

I noticed Immie stiffen up.

Kaz‚Äôs smile faded.

‚ÄúUnderstand?‚Äù Rowan said. ‚ÄúShut off all the lights.‚Äù

With no explanation, the others left for class after breakfast, and I planned my escape.

I wanted to pack up all my stuff, but instead I found myself scouring their rooms for anything which would confirm last night was real,  and I hadn‚Äôt fucking hallucinated it. But their rooms were exactly how I knew them. 

Immie‚Äôs was a total mess, covered in exotic plants she forgot to water, textbooks, a whole bookshelf dedicated to the horror genre, and every plushie you could think of. 

I looked under her bed, though there were just old snacks she‚Äôd forgotten to throw away and letters to her parents she had never sent.

I tried Rowan‚Äôs next, but it was more or less the same. I knew his room from movie nights I spent with him, though it still felt wrong going in there. Rowan‚Äôs room was perfect. Everything was in its place and was strangely symmetrical. 

His books were color coded and there was one singular Yoda plushie peeking from his bed covers. 

Under his bed were the usual things you‚Äôd find in a man‚Äôs room: Used tissues and odd socks. 

But there was nothing I‚Äôd consider weird.

Nothing that told me he was a cold blooded murderer.

I was losing motivation when I reached Kaz‚Äôs room at the end of the hallway. 

I expected the usual when I stepped inside, movie posters on the walls, and Japanese snacks littering the floor. 

There was that, of course. I knew Kaz well. 

But when I peeked under his bed, there was something wrapped in plastic. 

When I crawled further under, I saw through the plastic. I saw the same flesh from last night, pieces of torso and limbs ripped through and torn into. 

But there wasn‚Äôt just one of me. There were multiple mutilated bodies which all had my face squished against the plastic and pooling red. My cannibalised body stuffed into trash bags, my own dead eyes staring at me. 

My mind flashed back to the blinding light filling the hallway, and the sound of a photograph being taken.  

The moon following me, creeping behind me as I made my getaway upstairs to grab my phone to call the cops. 

My pinkie toe growing back right in front of my eyes. 

I know this sounds fucking crazy, but I think my roommates  are copying me.

That‚Äôs what the 27 means. I‚Äôve been copied 27 times.

Copied. Cloned. Whatever.

So they can eat me.

I am yet to go back home as I‚Äôm writing this. I‚Äôm planning to go back and get my stuff, but right now I can‚Äôt.

I want to blame all of this on them, but I keep thinking back to Rowan‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúThat night‚Äù I was a coward and left them, and somehow, these are the consequences.

What did I do to turn them into this? Rowan said this is my fault. It‚Äôs driving me crazy that I can‚Äôt remember it.

How can I get those memories back?

But do I want them back? 

Do I want to know what turned my roommates into this?",1,1747010593.0,stories,0,1.0,False

This district is kind of a tourist attraction spot and has a lot of different eclectic stores and def caters to hippy, artist, eco, trendy types of folks.  

This area had a large mix of middle class, travelers, visitors, shoppers from all walks of life, gutter punks, criddlers, and homeless around.


Was gone about an hour. when I came back to my parked car I noticed that someone had put a mark with a red sharpie about 4"" long on the hood of my car.  

Pretty sure someone put that mark on the hood of my car to target it for theft.  Mark came off easily, nothing permanent, but always be aware of your surroundings and the status of your home. 

My car is not stealth. I have a cargo basket, awning, and a bike rack mounted on the roof. all of my rear windows are blacked out 24/7 and I have a curtain that I pull shut when parked that hides the area behind the driver and passenger seats of my outback. My car also has front and rear dash cam that is hard wired to the battery and runs in park mode with audio, and my car has a car alarm (not that it matters much).

Made a big breakfast ‚Äî eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, fruit, coffee, juice. Got her flowers ‚Äúfrom the girls.‚Äù I even printed out a bunch of Mother‚Äôs Day coloring pages for them to do, which they gave her in the morning.

Then I packed a picnic and took all of us out to a beautiful oceanside hike we used to do before we had kids. We had lunch out on the rocks, watched seals, the girls played in tide pools and caught little crabs. It was the kind of day people dream of.

But my wife was barely there. She showed up physically, which is rare (I usually do this kind of thing alone with the kids), but she spent most of it taking selfies, wearing earbuds, and playing Scrabble on her phone - same things she would do if we were at home.

Even on the drive home, I made a light comment about another driver doing something dumb and laughed, and she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking to yourself,‚Äù which is typical.

Anyone else been in this limbo? How do you make the call when the emotional connection is gone but the parenting situation is complicated?

Weather was a bit warm for winter (23\~25 deg celsius) and I could feel the heat a bit.

I tried to wake up at least 2 hours before the game and squeeze in a toastie and a cup of coffee to have something in the system.

Field was also hard and bouncy so didn't feel that great either.

1kkfq65,https://www.reddit.com/r/rsforgays/comments/1kkfq65/rant/,rant,"I have never had an internal monologue.¬†

I don‚Äôt hear a voice talking to me all the time, as my brother allegedly does. During conversations, the voice relays words to him, which he then ‚Äúchooses‚Äù to vocalise or not. When he told me this I became a little disconcerted. Suddenly every word ever spoken by him appeared to have come from a stranger, from this internal dictator I had never met, yet who has lived beside me my entire life.¬†

When I talk, I hear nothing. The words just come out, marching as they are. When I‚Äôm sitting alone drinking coffee, there is nothing. When I see someone beautiful, that is what I think: how beautiful, how big the forearms and black the mustache, but there are no words, not even a semantic sniff. It just is. The only time I hear things is when I‚Äôm reading, or, much more rarely, have decided to talk to myself *sine voce*. I can only describe this as talking to myself without opening my mouth; that is to say, the words just come out.¬†

It‚Äôs a little different in Spanish or Russian, as I have to ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for a word, but again, there is no monologue. When I‚Äôm reading these languages, the words just sort of become autotranslated into English, vocalised again mentally, though conceptual differences (–ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å =/= –ø–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å) linger on.

I find internal monologues really creepy. I have wondered whether it is a sign of impaired intellectual function. Teachers thought I might be autistic, a diagnosis my mother simply rejected and refused to test for. However, I can‚Äôt say I struggle reading emotions, facial expressions, or social situations. I have had a few successful, long-term, romantic relationships. I have very close friends, though some of those people are diagnosed with autism, whatever currency that may hold. What is truly strange, and I‚Äôm not sure how to frame this, is that I used to incessantly talk to myself growing up. I used to play with this wooden snake as a kid, writhing it around with both hands, narrating stories with it. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it beyond the fact that *the snake could be a dinosaur, ninja, storm cloud, vampire, dragon, wizard, sports car, octopus, any number of things a young boy could be fascinated by.* There wasn‚Äôt really a plot to these narratives, nor cast of characters. Setting was usually contingent on whatever I imagined the snake as; there are no dinosaurs in the arctic, for example. My parents were initially freaked, I think, by this behaviour, though it slowly endeared itself to them. It helped that I grew out of it and moved onto something a little less weird.

Circa twelve I started to play tennis, and would practice hitting a ball against my house. I realised I could talk while doing this. Immediately, I began to copy out the process of narrating these stories. This progressed into a sort of encyclopedic worldbuilding, as I just read the Silmarillion, and so these essays grew in detail and complexity over the years until I was fifteen, at which point my parents moved across the country and we had to live in a rental, where of course it was unacceptable to potentially damage the walls with a dirty tennis ball. At that point, I just stopped talking to myself.

People don‚Äôt speak in my dreams, though I do sometimes hear snippets of voices before I ‚Äúgo under.‚Äù Otherwise my mental experiences are soundless and asemantic. Based on my brother‚Äôs reportage, however, many people seem to hear a constant, inaudible diatribe. I think that would make me suicidal.

I wonder how linked internal monologues are to cognitive function more broadly. I personally believe I possess a low IQ, contrary to what many people believe about me (1). I struggle with mathematics, incontinent rather than incompetent, despite enjoying reading about the subject, and I am not a fast learner in any discipline. I also have no aptitude towards music. I just think I am very hardworking and capable of enduring a great deal of boredom and frustration, which has supported a stellar academic record. If I were a psychologist, I would be very interested in studying the relationship between some of these phenomenological experiences and quantitative cognitive metrics.

I think people who do have internal monologues possess a cognitive toolkit that is more advanced than mine. Evolutionarily, it makes sense that certain traits, such as language ability, are distributed across a gradient; all traits are open to variation by virtue of genetic mutation. The human hip is just a fish fin, as is recited in every high school biology class.

What inspired this post was reading an article about LLMs reasoning, and how it improves if you ask the machine to explain its reasoning to itself. I do the exact same thing myself, speaking aloud to understand my reasoning or to refine it. Again, there is no internal monologue that occurs; I only hear the words when I say them aloud, or ‚Äúsay‚Äù them without moving my lips. I also have been reading Hubert Dreyfus‚Äô *What Computers Can‚Äôt Do.* I find the philosophy of mind, and by extension AI, fascinating. I personally think that much philosophy, and so downstream of this, most of the sciences, has falsely equivalized language with thought, but I also comprehend that we can‚Äôt seem to discuss thought without resorting to language.

Personally, I think my brain is closer to that of a chimp‚Äôs or cat‚Äôs compared to most people‚Äôs because of the lack of a monologue. I don‚Äôt want to say I experience the world in a more pure way, as I still use language and have some mathematical skills, which firmly segregate me from every other primate, but I definitely lack a dimensionality that an internal monologue imparts. More conscious people (people, in my experience, with a higher level of intelligence) unilaterally have a complex internal monologue.¬†

While this didn't take me completely surprised (I'll explain more below), I nonetheless feel broken, rejected and sad, which I really cannot understand at the moment.

I met this girl through playing badminton, and she had broken up with her long time ex about 3 weeks to a month before we started dating.

She said she was completely over him and I agreed - I knew who he was too. I am aware that there is a high likelihood that I was a rebound, though this isn't why I am confused about my feelings.

Early on, we discussed our values over several dates, and gotten to know each other much better. Though we have known each other for a few years, we only got together recently.  
While discussing our future, one area that did not align was our future goals/aspirations.

She is 27 and wants to have children at 33 by the latest, while my aspirations is to build my own business/further my career, more of the former before I am 40.

We were seeing each other 2 times per week, usually on a weekday evening for a few hours and I would stay over and Saturday evening and most of Sunday. And sometimes she would mention that she expects us to see each other more often when we become bf/gf.

More recently I did drop hints that I would commit more (time wise) to our relationship. Though given I live with my family with a mortgage on a house (mum and brother) may be another factor that doesn't align as she would like us to live together by ourselves. She is quite well off so we could get a place not too long from now, so financially it wasn't a barrier. I am asian and she is caucasian so a bit of a cultural difference there in terms of living with parents.

A week ago, she texted me out of the blue saying that she would like to stop seeing me, and that I am a great guy, and that I was a breath of fresh air from her toxic ex, and a few other 'nice' things. But that our futures don't align and that's why she would like to stop seeing each other.  
My stomach absolutely sank when I heard this, as I was warming to the idea of getting serious. And the times we spent together were happy times, and I know that she felt the same.

What bothers me more is that towards the start of the relationship I had mentioned to her my expectations of building my business and forwarding my career so I wouldn't be able to commit as much time to the relationship, and there were times when I tried to hint that I wanted to stop seeing each other and in my mind that's genuinely what I wanted.

But after spending more time with her, I started warming to her company, and now that it's over, I miss it a lot.

Having spent some time thinking what I miss about her, it is things like updating each other with how our days are going, and being able to see her in person and have a companion to go out and do things with.  
I have friends who I could go out with for dinners, and to do things but it's not quite the same.  
As I felt like I could really open up to her (I'm no the most open person, and through this relationship I have become a lot more open with others).

Thank you if you have read this far, I am just very confused why I feel so rejected, lonely and sad now. When I didn't want the relationship in the first place almost at all.

Also, I see her twice a week at badminton now, and after the session when I see her, I feel sad again. It feels as though it is getting better but I know I still feel sad at my core.

The other thing that I really can't shake is I am wondering if it is other parts of me that she didn't like which is why she ended things. She was much more keen on us going out when we first started seeing each other, so when I logic it out it must be something about me that she must have not liked. Perhaps it is genuinely the differences in our near future, and it is this unknown that hurts a lot.

And finally, she also broke up with me through text. I felt so disappointed, sad and disrespected that she didn't do it in person, so I could at least understand things more. But I've told her I don't want to talk about it anymore, and at badminton sessions we have not been talking (perhaps more on my side than hers), as in her text she said that she would be happy to talk things over, over 'coffee' or at a badminton session.  
And I replied saying that its okay, no need to talk anymore and that I knew where we stand.

About a year ago I wen thorough another very hard breakup, which I am over now, so I am aware of deleting her messages and not following her on social media to get updates, and that has helped a lot.   
But I still remain confused about my feelings of sadness and being rejected. I wonder if I still feel like this if I ended things with her earlier - I have a strong feeling I wouldn't. ",1,1747010099.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

We arrived last night and had beef noodles for a midnight snack. I‚Äôve noticed there is a lot of English around but I don‚Äôt want to rely on that. Is there a suitable way I can stress that I don‚Äôt eat pork if the menu looks confusing? Chicken and beef are fine. Me and my partner enjoy finding the places where locals eat, so I don‚Äôt want to expect English everywhere. 

Next up, any weird experiences in the city we can see/do? I have a few speakeasy cocktail places, the toilet restaurant and that‚Äôs it! Anything that is considered unique from western culture. 

I‚Äôm a HUGE coffee and boba person, recs on that would be amazing.

And lastly, we only have two whole days here. One hike would be awesome but my god there are SO many. We have hiking shoes and are active people. I was thinking something off of Jiufen old street like the teapot trail, I know it‚Äôs busy but I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs worth it. Perhaps there‚Äôs others that are better? Around 2-2.5 hours would be great. 

I know this is a last minute post! Most likely exploring the city today and maybe further afield for a hike tomorrow and an old street market of some sort. Thanks!",0,1747010008.0,Taipei,0,0.33,False

Hi there!

I‚Äôd really appreciate your help figuring out why a guy from work stopped talking to me.

I recently started a new job, and it‚Äôs been pretty hectic from the start‚Äîprojects, meetings, creating things... I hadn‚Äôt even noticed this guy existed until my boss introduced us.
I still remember that day‚Äîit was super spontaneous: ‚ÄúHey, this is Jhon Doe, he‚Äôs quite the character!‚Äù
I was intrigued, and we started chatting. It turned out we had the same taste in music, hobbies, beliefs... It was such a great conversation, and I was genuinely interested!

For context, I‚Äôm married, and everyone at work knows that‚ÄîI‚Äôm always talking about my husband because I love him deeply.

That day we talked for a good while and had a great time, but that was it.
About two weeks later, he messaged me again. He said, ‚ÄúI wanted to show you this! I‚Äôm working on this project and thought you‚Äôd like it.‚Äù He showed me a video, and I said, ‚ÄúWow! That‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù
After that, we didn‚Äôt talk again, but I was left with a feeling... I thought, ‚ÄúThis person is really interesting! I‚Äôd love to get to know him better.‚Äù So I started wondering how I could strike up more conversations. I truly wanted to be friends‚ÄîI felt like we could really get along!

A few days later, I saw on his Instagram story that he was looking for tickets to a new museum that had just opened in the city and was already packed. As it happened, I knew someone selling tickets at a great price, so I messaged him: ‚ÄúHey, Jhon Doe is selling them.‚Äù We exchanged a few messages.
The next day at work, I stayed late to wrap up some projects. At one point, I checked Instagram and saw he‚Äôd gotten the tickets, so I turned to him and said, ‚ÄúHey, you got the tickets!‚Äù
After that, we ended up talking until 10 PM. It was such a deep and fun conversation! I was thrilled because it was the kind of chat you don‚Äôt often have‚Äîabout life, the universe, and your deepest thoughts.

From that point on, we chatted regularly on Instagram. There were a few nights we talked until 3 in the morning. I was so happy to have found a friend like that!
He would say things like, ‚ÄúHope you stay up with me tonight!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThanks for letting me steal a piece of your philosophy.‚Äù It all felt so beautiful‚Äînot romantic, but something more mystical, like soulmates... as friends.

One of the coolest things was that he reawakened a part of me I had left behind‚Äîwriting. I used to write a lot and loved acting too. After meeting him, I felt inspired to do it again. I created some beautiful things, and one day I shared a piece of my writing with him... and he turned it into a song! It was incredible‚ÄîI felt truly heard.

We agreed to hang out, and I was really excited. But before we went out, I told him: ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve said this is just a friendship, but I want to be clear‚Äîif I smile or give you a flirty look, don‚Äôt take it the wrong way! I‚Äôm only looking for friendship.‚Äù His response was really understanding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking for friendship too.‚Äù (In short.)

When we went out, it was amazing. We grabbed coffee and talked about philosophy, the economy, and China‚Äôs tariffs... Later, we went to a small bar and had a few drinks. I told him about my exes, he told me about his, we shared stories, even a few dark little secrets... It was such a fun, unique conversation for me.
When we left the bar, things were a little more relaxed. He playfully tousled my hair, offered me his arm like a gentleman, and gave me a hug.
Once I got home, I thanked him for the night and told him I had a great time. By the way, he paid for everything‚Äîeven though I offered to pay my share. I told him next time, drinks were on me.

We planned to hang out again that same week, and I was so happy‚ÄîI'd never had a friend like him before. But on the day of, he canceled. And that‚Äôs fine‚Äîthings come up. I wasn‚Äôt offended.
But after that, he started pulling away. We stopped having those late-night talks. It just didn‚Äôt feel the same. I gave him space. He still replied sometimes, but not like before.

One day I asked, ‚ÄúHey, is it just me or do you seem a bit distant? Let me know if I did or said something that bothered you‚Äîthis curiosity is killing me!‚Äù
He replied, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm just caught up in some projects. Everything‚Äôs good, chill.‚Äù
But things stayed the same‚Äîjust the occasional message.
One day I sent him a song and said, ‚ÄúThis song really reminds me of you, not sure why.‚Äù Left on read.
Another time I told him, ‚ÄúHey! I signed up for a theater course. I‚Äôm super excited!‚Äù Also left on read.

Honestly, that hurt. I felt like I was losing a really meaningful friendship‚Äîone that had excited me so much. But what could I do? I respected his space again.

One day, we crossed paths at the office and said hi. He smiled and ruffled my hair like he did on our night out, and I got excited! I said, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up with you? Are we not gonna talk anymore or what?‚Äù
And he said, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre talking now.‚Äù
So I told him about my cat being sick and how sad I was about it. Then I mentioned, ‚ÄúHey, I sent you some messages,‚Äù and he replied, ‚ÄúOh, sit down and get back to work, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Since then, we haven‚Äôt talked.
I sent one final message, thanking him for his friendship, for everything he awakened in me, and told him that if he ever wanted to talk again, I‚Äôd be here because my friendship was unconditional. Of course, no response.

It really hurt to lose this friendship‚Äîeven if it was short, it meant a lot to me.
If you ever read this, I wish you all the best! I hope we can talk again someday.

To everyone else‚Äîwhat do you think? What could I have done for him to stop talking to me? I‚Äôm open to your thoughts.

Hi there!

I‚Äôd really appreciate your help figuring out why a guy from work stopped talking to me.

I recently started a new job, and it‚Äôs been pretty hectic from the start‚Äîprojects, meetings, creating things... I hadn‚Äôt even noticed this guy existed until my boss introduced us.
I still remember that day‚Äîit was super spontaneous: ‚ÄúHey, this is Jhon Doe, he‚Äôs quite the character!‚Äù
I was intrigued, and we started chatting. It turned out we had the same taste in music, hobbies, beliefs... It was such a great conversation, and I was genuinely interested!

For context, I‚Äôm married, and everyone at work knows that‚ÄîI‚Äôm always talking about my husband because I love him deeply.

That day we talked for a good while and had a great time, but that was it.
About two weeks later, he messaged me again. He said, ‚ÄúI wanted to show you this! I‚Äôm working on this project and thought you‚Äôd like it.‚Äù He showed me a video, and I said, ‚ÄúWow! That‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù
After that, we didn‚Äôt talk again, but I was left with a feeling... I thought, ‚ÄúThis person is really interesting! I‚Äôd love to get to know him better.‚Äù So I started wondering how I could strike up more conversations. I truly wanted to be friends‚ÄîI felt like we could really get along!

A few days later, I saw on his Instagram story that he was looking for tickets to a new museum that had just opened in the city and was already packed. As it happened, I knew someone selling tickets at a great price, so I messaged him: ‚ÄúHey, Jhon Doe is selling them.‚Äù We exchanged a few messages.
The next day at work, I stayed late to wrap up some projects. At one point, I checked Instagram and saw he‚Äôd gotten the tickets, so I turned to him and said, ‚ÄúHey, you got the tickets!‚Äù
After that, we ended up talking until 10 PM. It was such a deep and fun conversation! I was thrilled because it was the kind of chat you don‚Äôt often have‚Äîabout life, the universe, and your deepest thoughts.

From that point on, we chatted regularly on Instagram. There were a few nights we talked until 3 in the morning. I was so happy to have found a friend like that!
He would say things like, ‚ÄúHope you stay up with me tonight!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThanks for letting me steal a piece of your philosophy.‚Äù It all felt so beautiful‚Äînot romantic, but something more mystical, like soulmates... as friends.

One of the coolest things was that he reawakened a part of me I had left behind‚Äîwriting. I used to write a lot and loved acting too. After meeting him, I felt inspired to do it again. I created some beautiful things, and one day I shared a piece of my writing with him... and he turned it into a song! It was incredible‚ÄîI felt truly heard.

We agreed to hang out, and I was really excited. But before we went out, I told him: ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve said this is just a friendship, but I want to be clear‚Äîif I smile or give you a flirty look, don‚Äôt take it the wrong way! I‚Äôm only looking for friendship.‚Äù His response was really understanding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking for friendship too.‚Äù (In short.)

When we went out, it was amazing. We grabbed coffee and talked about philosophy, the economy, and China‚Äôs tariffs... Later, we went to a small bar and had a few drinks. I told him about my exes, he told me about his, we shared stories, even a few dark little secrets... It was such a fun, unique conversation for me.
When we left the bar, things were a little more relaxed. He playfully tousled my hair, offered me his arm like a gentleman, and gave me a hug.
Once I got home, I thanked him for the night and told him I had a great time. By the way, he paid for everything‚Äîeven though I offered to pay my share. I told him next time, drinks were on me.

We planned to hang out again that same week, and I was so happy‚ÄîI'd never had a friend like him before. But on the day of, he canceled. And that‚Äôs fine‚Äîthings come up. I wasn‚Äôt offended.
But after that, he started pulling away. We stopped having those late-night talks. It just didn‚Äôt feel the same. I gave him space. He still replied sometimes, but not like before.

One day I asked, ‚ÄúHey, is it just me or do you seem a bit distant? Let me know if I did or said something that bothered you‚Äîthis curiosity is killing me!‚Äù
He replied, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm just caught up in some projects. Everything‚Äôs good, chill.‚Äù
But things stayed the same‚Äîjust the occasional message.
One day I sent him a song and said, ‚ÄúThis song really reminds me of you, not sure why.‚Äù Left on read.
Another time I told him, ‚ÄúHey! I signed up for a theater course. I‚Äôm super excited!‚Äù Also left on read.

Honestly, that hurt. I felt like I was losing a really meaningful friendship‚Äîone that had excited me so much. But what could I do? I respected his space again.

One day, we crossed paths at the office and said hi. He smiled and ruffled my hair like he did on our night out, and I got excited! I said, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up with you? Are we not gonna talk anymore or what?‚Äù
And he said, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre talking now.‚Äù
So I told him about my cat being sick and how sad I was about it. Then I mentioned, ‚ÄúHey, I sent you some messages,‚Äù and he replied, ‚ÄúOh, sit down and get back to work, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Since then, we haven‚Äôt talked.
I sent one final message, thanking him for his friendship, for everything he awakened in me, and told him that if he ever wanted to talk again, I‚Äôd be here because my friendship was unconditional. Of course, no response.

It really hurt to lose this friendship‚Äîeven if it was short, it meant a lot to me.
If you ever read this, I wish you all the best! I hope we can talk again someday.

To everyone else‚Äîwhat do you think? What could I have done for him to stop talking to me? I‚Äôm open to your thoughts.

**Itinerary:**

* **2.5 Days in Lima**
* **1.5 Days in Cusco**
* **1 Day in Sacred Valley (stayed in Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu area)**
* **2 Days in Cusco**

**Lima:**

Lima is mostly known for their food. I found that 2 days was a perfect amount of time to explore the city's highlights.

* **Day 1:** I started my day by strolling through Kennedy Park, where you can see the famous cats. For lunch, I highly recommend Punto Azul for some amazing ceviche. In the afternoon, I walked it all off with a visit to Love Park and a pleasant walk towards China Park.
* **Day 2:** I took a city walking tour that included tickets to the Catacombs, which was very interesting. In the evening, I headed to Barranco for dinner and drinks (Clon is a must-try, so make reservations!).
* **Day 3:** Since I had some extra time before heading to Cusco, I visited the Huaca Pucllana ruins. While interesting, I wouldn't say it's a top priority if you're short on time.

**Cusco:**

For Cusco, I used CuscoPeru Travel Agency to book accommodations, tours, and transportation. While this was very convenient and didn't have to deal with the confusing process for Machu Picchu train/circuit tickets, it's worth noting that booking everything individually could be cheaper. You'd have to do at least a few months ahead of time to get Machu Picchu tickets or else you'd have to wake up earlier in Aguas Calientes to get day of tickets.

Cusco's high altitude is something to consider. Many people fly in and immediately head to Ollantaytambo (the train station for Machu Picchu). However, I chose to stay in Cusco to acclimate.

* **Day 1:** I grabbed a quick breakfast sandwich at the San Blas Market and then explored the city on foot. San Blas is a charming area with lots of stairs, art galleries, and stunning views.
* **Day 2:** I took an afternoon city tour and explored the surrounding areas. While this tour was enjoyable, it's not essential if your time in Cusco is limited.

**Sacred Valley and Aguas Calientes: En Route to Machu Picchu**

I spent one day touring the Sacred Valley, which helped me get closer to Ollantaytambo. I stayed overnight in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu.

* **Day 1:** I visited Pisac and Ollantaytambo. If I could do it again, I would skip Pisac and instead visit Moray and Maras before heading to Ollantaytambo. The train ride to Aguas Calientes from Ollantaytambo takes about 1.5 to 3 hours. Remember that you can't bring large luggage on the train, so you'll need to leave your suitcase at your Cusco hotel and bring a smaller bag or backpack for the night. All hotels are accustomed to holding luggage for travelers visiting Machu Picchu.

**Machu Picchu and Return to Cusco**

* **Day 1:** I took a 30-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu. I took the bus, unless you are in great shape and want to hike up. I did Circuit 2, which offers the classic Machu Picchu view and allows you to explore within the site. I spent about 2-3 hours at Machu Picchu. After returning to Aguas Calientes for lunch, I took the train back to Ollantaytambo and then a 2-hour drive back to Cusco. If I were to do it again, I might consider staying overnight in Ollantaytambo to break up the long travel day, depending on the next day's plans, as most tours depart from Cusco.
* **Day 2:** The next day involved an early 4 am departure from Cusco for Rainbow Mountain, which is about a 3-hour drive away. Breakfast and lunch were included in the tour. This hike was my biggest concern due to the altitude, but it was surprisingly easy. I strongly recommend taking altitude sickness pills! The views at Rainbow Mountain were absolutely worth it.
* **Day 3:** On my final day in Cusco, I relaxed and visited Three Monkeys Coffee (one of the top coffee shops in the world!) and ate at/explored the San Pedro Market. I also treated myself to a spa day at Antigua, which included a hot tub, sauna, and massage (highly recommended!).

Cusco has a wide variety of highly-rated restaurants (4.5 stars and up), making it hard to choose. I ended up eating at Local twice because it was so good!

**Tips:**

* **Safety:** I felt safe throughout my entire trip so it was nothing to worry about.
* **Cash/Tipping:** I tipped around 10% if it was great customer service. It‚Äôs not required but they will ask if every time if you are using card. It‚Äôs good to carry cash in Cusco/Aguas Calientes/Rainbow Mountain for water and little things.
* **What to Pack:** Bring layers, including a rain jacket or poncho, a hat, and sunscreen. The weather in Lima is warm, but it's much colder in Cusco and at Rainbow Mountain. May is the beginning of dry season, but it was still a bit rainy when we came early May so I recommend mid-May/end of May would be better. We were lucky that we had good days for Machu Pacchu and Rainbow Mountain.
* **Altitude:** Bring altitude sickness pills, and avoid drinking too much alcohol, especially the night before visiting Rainbow Mountain.",5,1747008598.0,PeruTravelTips,0,1.0,False

1kkf5oh,https://v.redd.it/uot39o5is80f1,What fascinated you the most when you watched your first K-Drama?,"For me, it was the importance given to food and cooking. 

I come from India, a deeply patriarchal society, and more often than not, our television reflects that. Even when the shows are made for women, you rarely see men cooking for their partners or families. Kitchen scenes are usually filled with drama. Sister-in-laws ruining each other‚Äôs dishes, the evil vamp trying to poison someone‚Äôs meal. 

I still remember how much it warmed my heart watching Ri Jeong-hyeok cook for Se-ri in Crash Landing on You, my first Kdrama. Be it the scene that I‚Äôve attached or the coffee he brews, the pork barbecue, the mussels, the potato he roasts by the fire after their train halts in later episodes, every single moment felt so meaningful. 

I was so fascinated by the fact that in K-dramas, cooking is just‚Ä¶ cooking. It‚Äôs a way of showing love, care, and comfort. No hidden motives. Just people putting their hearts into a meal for someone they care about. That was so wholesome to me. 

Whether it‚Äôs a late-night bowl of ramyun, mothers preparing banchans for their kids, or a simple meal shared in silence, it always feels like something more. I gradually realised how food in K-dramas isn‚Äôt just a plot device. It‚Äôs a language of love all on its own. It‚Äôs how characters connect, heal, and show their care, often without uttering a word.",28,1747008492.0,kdramas,22,1.0,False

I kept worrying about the >!wing being ripped off!< because I was sitting next to it so I had to close the windows. I was terrified of the engines shutting off randomly and my heart rate would speed up if I heard any change in the gear. I was scared of flying over mountains because if we had to make an emergency landing there wouldn‚Äôt be flat ground. 

And so on and so forth‚Ä¶ the first 15 minutes or so I was having an anxiety attack, I couldn‚Äôt stop bouncing my legs, I was shaking and my heart was beating out of my chest, my mouth was dry as a desert, I was nauseous and had digestive issues (but I was terrified of getting up) and I kept thinking that this would be the last flight of my life, that I‚Äôm okay with >!death!< (but then my mind said I still wanted to live) and wanted to tell the flight attendant to make an emergency landing.

Something has changed within me  
Something is not the same  
I'm through with playing by the rules  
Of someone else's game  
Too late for second-guessing  
Too late to go back to sleep  
It's time to trust my instincts  
Close my eyes... and leap!  
It's time to try  
Defying gravity  
I think I'll try  
Defying gravity  
Kiss me goodbye  
I am defying gravity  
And you won't bring me down!  
I'm through accepting limits  
'cause someone says they're so  
Some things I cannot change  
But till I try, I'll never know!  
Too long I've been afraid of  
Losing love I guess I've lost  
Well, if that's love  
It comes at much too high a cost!  
I'd sooner buy  
Defying gravity  
Kiss me goodbye  
I'm defying gravity  
I think I'll try  
Defying gravity  
And you won't bring me down!  
I'd sooner buy  
Defying gravity  
Kiss me goodbye  
I'm defying gravity  
I think I'll try  
Defying gravity  
And you won't bring me down!  
Bring me down!  
Ohh ohhh ohhhh!

Recently a very good friend passed away. This man was a very kind, thoughtful and generally upbeat person pretty much every day of his life. To know him was to want to be his friend. 

That said he did have one enemy, which most people who knew him would be surprised to find out. My finding out about this enemy is the occasion for our story today. 

Gary was a very talented carpenter, immensely skilled with his hands, and while still a young man he elected to build himself a nice cabin out in the mountains of Colorado. 

My then girlfriend from England Ann came to visit me and I took the opportunity to visit my good friend Gary and introduce him and Ann to one another. Of course they hit it off right away. Gary was a consummate host, and we all drank, and talked late into the night that first night. 

The next morning Gary, was up early as was often his way and we had coffee while Ann slept in upstairs. Suddenly without warning Gary sprung to his feet and grabbed a pistol. He charged up stairs, startling Ann awake. As always Gary was polite and said ""Good morning Ann, before throwing open the window sticking the pistol out and firing BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

As Ann was fresh over from England this made quite the impression on her as you can imagine. With his pistol emptied Gary simply turned and said.  ""Fucking woodpeckers."" ",2,1747007759.0,stories,0,0.75,False
1kkex0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kkex0h/my_husband_put_no_effort_into_mothers_day/,My Husband Put No Effort into Mothers Day,"As the title says, my husband put no effort into Mother‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôm just really needing a safe place to cry and vent. 

Just a little background info: I‚Äôm (25F) am a SAHM while my husband (26M) works 13+ hours shifts at his job to provide for us. He does a lot of overtime to help give us extra income so we can afford nicer things and not have to struggle on one income. I‚Äôm happy being at home with my kiddos, (5m and 3 month old F), but obviously I take on the brunt of the childcare and housework. 

Earlier this week he asked me which day I‚Äôd prefer he go in for overtime Friday or Sunday. Obviously I told him Friday, but then I asked if he needed the break Friday because the past few nights had been hell at work for him. He said yes, he did need that break so I told him to go in Sunday night then. I‚Äôd rather he not be burnt out from work and then be miserable at home while I‚Äôm trying to relax. 
He said he‚Äôd take the kiddos part of Saturday and this morning (Sunday) so I could get a break and relax before he goes in. 

Well yesterday he sleeps till 5 pm and then takes them for a couple of hours but is frustrated at our 5 year old for being rambunctious and wild and the baby is screaming and needing to be fed. So I take her for a bit at around 7:30pm and feed her so he can get some peace and I can relax and read my book. I give her back to him around 11 pm or so and then he takes her until 4 am when she‚Äôs needing to eat again (he gave her a bottle in between, but I still don‚Äôt like missing more than 1 feed since I‚Äôm breastfeeding). I then feed her and pump and read some more of my book until I‚Äôm tired around 7:30am. I go to give her back to him so I can rest a couple of hours and find that the door to our den is locked and he‚Äôs gone to sleep. I then just take her back to our room and try to sleep a bit, but of course our 5 year old wakes up. I just give up on even expecting anything today and just decide to go about my normal day. 

I get to deal with a messy house, a clogged sink, a 5 year old who‚Äôs wild and unruly because it‚Äôs been raining all weekend and he hasn‚Äôt been able to go outside, and a cranky 3 month old who is going through a leap and isn‚Äôt wanting to sleep unless she‚Äôs attached to me. I‚Äôve also been sick and dealing with a lot of joint pain that always flares up anytime I get sick or have allergies. So all in all a real shitshow of a day. No card, no coffee, no flowers, nothing to show that I‚Äôm appreciated as stupid and materialistic as that sounds. 

He finally wakes up at 4pm to get ready to go to work and sees that I‚Äôm pissed and upset. He asks me what‚Äôs wrong and says that he‚Äôll stay home tonight to help with the house and the kids. I tell him that it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and that it‚Äôs been just another day with a mess in the house and kids being crazy. He says he‚Äôs sorry and that he thought I‚Äôd go and wake him up and didn‚Äôt expect me to let him sleep all day. I tell him that he said he‚Äôd take the kids this morning so I thought he‚Äôd stay up and take them and then sleep. He says he‚Äôll make it up to me by cooking steak and whatever else I want and I say I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting the next book in my series when we go to the store to get stuff to fix. 

Well of course at 6 pm, the store is sold out of my book and most steaks. The only ones left don‚Äôt look like good cuts and I just pick some chicken instead. Oh and the 3 month old is screaming her head off the entire time because she‚Äôs overtired and it‚Äôs witching hour. He keeps saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying‚Äù because he can tell I‚Äôm disappointed from everything. 

I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but goddamn it I just want to feel pampered and appreciated this one day of the year. He doesn‚Äôt care about his birthday or Father‚Äôs Day, but I always go out of my way to get him something nice and make him feel loved and appreciated. I just want the same. I‚Äôm not expecting the world, especially since we‚Äôre still trying to get back on track after he was on leave after our daughter was born, but just some minuscule bit of effort beforehand.

I am seeking some business advice. My boyfriend‚Äôs family recently launched a food truck in a new location (East Austin off of MLK). Overall customers have given amazing feedback to the quality & taste of the food, and for a new food truck they have been doing reasonably well. We are hoping to build up the customer base, and to promote the business by putting flyers up in coffee shops, local businesses, and around UT campus. I was curious if anyone had any suggestions of businesses or communal spots (maybe coffee shops with bulletin boards, small businesses helping other small businesses, or other spaces) that would be good for hanging promotional flyers in the area? 

Any other advice to help promote a small family run business is welcome. We are doing our best with social media, but we know we have a lot of growing to do. We have considered applying for space at a farmer‚Äôs market but know food spots are competitive and limited.

The worst part is that, a week before he died, I brought up some things about our relationship that I thought we could continue to work on. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it at first, but my husband said he wanted to know what I was thinking, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. He insisted that it was ok to talk and I told him that I was so so very happy with our marriage but that I wanted to know that he would always be there for me emotionally in the future.

We had many years where he put his career before me. There were years where he wouldn‚Äôt eat any meals with me or our son, wouldn‚Äôt stop working from his home office to have a 5 minute cup of coffee with me, wouldn‚Äôt take lunch breaks, would barely acknowledge that I lived in the house, would have sex but not sleep in the same bed as me at night.

My husband finally got a new job in a new career, and the past 2 years have been so great, but even recently, when he was home, he often seemed to want to do projects or hobbies that took a ton of time. Like running on a treadmill for 6 hours in the basement, making pies for work for 12 hours on a Sunday, doing yard work all day, etc.

I was going to EMDR therapy to help with some childhood stuff. But going through the EMDR made me realize that I still didn‚Äôt always feel an ‚Äúemotional connection‚Äù from my husband. My therapist suggested I talk to him and so I did. I asked that he try to listen to the emotion or feelings that I had when I was talking with him and asked if he could be more emotionally available to me in return. I stressed how much I loved him and how much these past two years have meant to me and just asked that he never ‚Äúleave‚Äù me emotionally again.

Fast forward about a week and he started crying and said he wasn‚Äôt ok. He said he thought he was ‚Äúbroken‚Äù inside and couldn‚Äôt feel things like other people. He said there was a lot of things that he didn‚Äôt tell me about his childhood and his dad being abusive and leaving him when he was around 10. He NEVER talked to me about his dad except to say he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have one‚Äù or was an a-hole or something. So this was a lot of opening up on his part. My husband then held both my hands and said ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt worry, I made an appointment with an online therapist and I‚Äôm ready to talk now. I want to be the best dad and husband for us.‚Äù I told him I would sit with him during the appointment if he‚Äôd like. I was so proud that he made a counseling appointment on his own.

We never got there. Two days later (and two before his appointment), he came home from work and said he would come to our son‚Äôs art class with me. Usually only one of us goes since there is no seating and we just have to sit in the car in the parking lot. He looked so exhausted so I told him to stay home and relax. Plus it was cold and snowing and I thought he could just be comfortable until we got home. I said I‚Äôd make avocado toast for dinner.

When my son and I got home, there was a note on the hallway wall that said don‚Äôt go down stairs. I thought he had decided to surprise me with dinner in our finished basement because he is sweet like that. But then it turned into a note that said he now knew he was a narcissist and my son and I were better without him and that he loved us so much.

Never in a million years would I have thought that he would have ended his life. He had just told me how happy he was being with my son and me and how much he enjoyed our life together. He finally had a job and career that made him feel valued and said that he enjoyed it. We just got a new puppy at his request and booked a vacation the night before. He was an awesome dad and so close to our son.

Everyday that passes I miss him more and more. And I just keep blaming myself for talking to him about our relationship. It was meant to move us forward and make us stronger.

Also, if he was a narcissist, was any part of our relationship real?? I honestly thought he truly loved me, but he was so DIFFERENT and mean to me in the past year. Why? Why now after 23 years? What changed?

Please help me. I‚Äôm so grief stricken. I will always love him, but did he ever love me?

It's hard to believe we just celebrated our one-year anniversary a couple of days ago. The trip was supposed to be fun, but the chaos became overwhelming. It feels like she doesn‚Äôt care about me at all; it‚Äôs all about looking pretty and posting our pictures on Snapchat for her followers.

When we got home that night, she got sick and threw up, leaving the mess in trash bags without even closing them. I told her I couldn‚Äôt deal with it; if I touched those bags, I would throw up myself. She left them in the kitchen for at least two days before finally taking them out, but not without cussing me out for not doing it myself. Apparently, it's my responsibility, according to her.

The final straw was when I was making her breakfast. I asked her to please make me a cup of coffee, and she replied that she didn‚Äôt know how to use the espresso machine. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt know how to make coffee nowadays? When I expressed my disbelief, she exploded with anger, cursing me out.

Divorce, moving away, hard times and mental illness 

So I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should get back into and find a church near me. There is none. It‚Äôs two hours away across motorways. I couldn‚Äôt afford that amount of petrol every week, and I work most Sundays with no choice. So I looked on Reddit about how orthodoxy works without a church and wow the elitist opinions are shocking

People are like ‚Äúyes you can be a baseball player at home too but you won‚Äôt qualify unless you go to practice‚Äù. Or ‚Äúif you needed a kidney you‚Äôd drive across the country. So why not for liturgy?‚Äù. 

It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I could have a prayer corner, read and study every day , watch live streams of liturgy, connect with others online as if I was at coffee hour and generally live for the holy trinity. But it‚Äôs not physically there, so it doesn‚Äôt count and I‚Äôm going to hell?

And then there‚Äôs baptism. Every other denomination has a set rule or path of baptism but orthodoxy doesn‚Äôt? I thought it was supposed to be the most serious and organised denomination, but no one can agree on whether I‚Äôll go to hell or not 

And then there‚Äôs the church itself. When I used to go some people were doing way too much. Crossing themselves constantly to the point of insanity, kneeling on the floor in the way of everyone to show off, bringing the HUGEST bouquets for the idols and turning up late so everyone can see.  If you mention it to them they‚Äôll say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just the concert zeal‚Äù. Um no these are definitely not converts

Why the gatekeeping? It makes no sense

And then we have online guides on things you must do. if I crossed myself, prayed, and mentioned god as much as some of these lists say I would be diagnosed with OCD. It‚Äôs not normal behaviour. 

If I could go to church every Sunday I happily would, but I can‚Äôt. I just want to follow Christ in the way of the Orthodox Church as best as I can, but the church culture just seems bizarre and impossible to follow unless you‚Äôre obsessive

TLDR: Is it possible to suddenly become lactose intolerant? Is it possible to be lactose intolerant during a flare only (and then go back to tolerating it fine once back in remission)?

My husband has mild ulcerative proctitis. He rarely flares and when he does it‚Äôs just a little blood and no other symptoms. He is currently (hopefully) on the tail end of his worst flare yet. It‚Äôs been about 3 weeks - more blood than usual, urgency, going more than usual (only about 3x per day), etc.  he cut out dairy about a week into the flare (just trying everything and basically on the BRAT diet at that point). He went on budesonide about 10 days ago. On day 3, his symptoms started to improve. They have gradually improved each day since starting the treatment with the exception of 2 days. On around day 5 of the treatment, he had a yogurt, and his symptoms immediately regressed to the worst they‚Äôve been (extremely bloody diarrhea about 5x over the next 24 hours). Then he was pretty good again for a few days and yesterday (around day 9), he had a slice of pizza at our daughter‚Äôs birthday party (bad idea, we know!) and he had horribly bloody diarrhea about an hour later. He‚Äôs now pretty good again. We‚Äôre curious if the dairy caused these two regressions in the treatment. If so, is it possible that he‚Äôs suddenly lactose intolerant? He typically consumes a lot of dairy (milk in his daily coffee, yogurt every day, cheese and butter frequently) with no issue. Could this be a temporary flare thing that goes away once he‚Äôs hopefully back in full remission?

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/qTOZIaO)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

Today marked the end of the first week of Bradley‚Äôs new job at The Bean and Sickle and another new face walked in heralded by the bell‚Äôs jingle. it was a coin flip as to whether this new soul would make his day a little better or far worse. In that week, he‚Äôd both been reassured by humanity and deeply disappointed by it. Customer service was an education, and there was still so much more to learn.

The new customer made their way inside, almost gliding over to a table by the window where they seated themself and turned their attention outside. It had been a long week and the shift was nearly over. Bradley took a deep breath and put on his ‚Äòcustomer face‚Äô. The one that said ‚ÄúWe both know I have to talk to you now, and neither one of us wants that; but let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre enjoying it.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt automatic yet, but it came a lot more easily than it had nearly a week ago when he‚Äôd first tried it on. He forced himself to walk over to the table, comforted by the knowledge that in about twenty more minutes he could go home.

The new customer was almost nondescript. They were dressed in a simple black t-shirt with grey jeans. They hadn‚Äôt taken off their sunglasses, but it suited them. There was an elegance to them that seemed understated, but undeniable. Something about them and their still gaze out the window was peaceful.

‚ÄúHello! I‚Äôm Bradley! Is this your first time at The Bean and Sickle? What can I get you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôm a bit of a regular; though you‚Äôre a new face. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be seeing more of you! I think I‚Äôll just take a coffee for now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat obvious huh? It‚Äôs my first week here, but i‚Äôm happy to meet a regular. Would you like room for cream or sugar?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlack‚Äù

The word had a hollow darkness and deep tone to it that reverberated in Bradley‚Äôs mind. Something about it felt cold in his chest and he felt a sudden anxious tension cut through him. He wanted to run away as fast as he could. The silence, hardly more than a second, seemed to stretch on forever and he could hear the whole world invade his mind. The sunlight was a little too bright for his eyes. The chatter around him became an unbearable noise, and the sound of tires squealing outside cut through and momentarily became the entirety of his focus. As quickly as he‚Äôd been overwhelmed by sensation, the world returned to its dull rhythm. The sound of mugs tapping tables and spoons clinking replacing the momentary assault.

The customer continued:

‚ÄúYou know, make it two.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing. I‚Äôll.. get that for you.‚Äù

He turned to head back to the counter and walked as quickly as he could while still appearing casual so he could breathe and regroup, almost forgetting to get a name. He turned only a few steps into his escape and asked¬†

‚ÄúCan I get a name for the order?‚Äù

‚ÄúNate‚Äù
-----

Thanatos, god of death and son of Nyx hadn‚Äôt gone by his real name for centuries. Back when people knew who he was, they either wouldn‚Äôt believe him or they‚Äôd run away in terror. These days, they just got it wrong when he ordered and that was reason enough to use something more contemporary. He‚Äôd tried Than, but people tried to engage him in uncomfortable conversations about where he was from and he couldn‚Äôt just blurt out ‚ÄúI sprang fully formed from Nyx, mother of the night‚Äù. Not since his goth period at least. The modern one, not his actual gothic period which was entirely different. He‚Äôd tried Han as well, but everyone made the same three jokes about a popular movie; so he settled on Nate. No questions, at least in North America. There were other names for other places that garnered just as little attention, but here in Seattle he was Nate.

May is the busy season in the Pacific Northwest. Early spring and the humans who‚Äôd been cooped up in their homes all winter were outside doing all sorts of ill-advised things. Hopping on motorcycles they hadn‚Äôt touched in months and going entirely too fast. Hiking in forests without looking where they step. Touching spiders they don‚Äôt know anything about. Getting drunk and picking fights with strangers. Attempting home repairs that involved electricity or the roof. They are as creative as they are fragile.

For twenty minutes or so though, they are all safe. It was a quirk most mortals had. They generally didn‚Äôt notice when someone didn‚Äôt die, but when they did die it captured their full attention. If someone did notice, they‚Äôd chalk it up to chance when it all resumed. These shorter reprives always went entirely unnoticed. Well, there was that one guy that drew some attention, but Thanatos had planned these breaks a little more carefully since then.

The bell over the door sang its cheerful song and a new face peered in, looking over as soon as he was through the door. Late as always.

-----

Moros had been looking in the window while his brother Thanatos placed his order. He looked forward to these periodic chats with his brother and strode casually into the little coffee shop, turning toward the quiet table by the window in the far corner. He was glad he hadn‚Äôt loitered too long outside and annoyed his brother into leaving. He relished the chance to talk to other eternal beings. Being surrounded by mortals all the time was entertaining, but talking to another god was like finally getting to sit down with the other adults at a children‚Äôs party. It was someone he could relate to, with the context of their shared ages. He pulled out his seat and sunk into the chair with a sigh. Yes he was late, but his brother hadn‚Äôt left.

Thanatos tipped his head down and peered over his sunglasses, the sun lighting up the edges of blue-grey eyes that faded to a subtle lavender toward the pupil.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late. I almost left.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bluffing. You don‚Äôt even have your coffee yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs hardly because I haven‚Äôt been waiting. The new guy seems nervous, reluctant to come back with our coffee. I hope you don‚Äôt mind I ordered one for you too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh well that may be my fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Did you have to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI come for everyone brother, same as you. Just a little sooner, and sometimes‚Ä¶ I let them know you‚Äôre coming.‚Äù

Thanatos sighed and shifted in the seat. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked about this Moros. You may be the big scary god of doom, but do you have to try so hard all the time? I know you think it‚Äôs hilarious how fragile they all are, but I have my hands full with Ares as it is. I don‚Äôt need to deal with one-offs that could have waited too.‚Äù

Bradley finished making two cups of pour-over coffee. The slowest method he could think of had failed to run out his shift. He didn‚Äôt know why, but his skin was crawling and his heart was beating a little too fast. Putting his customer face back on, he picked up the coffees and carried them over to the corner table where a new person had joined. He didn‚Äôt know if it was the new company, or just him getting over whatever had gripped him; but as he approached he felt the tension release. By the time he sat the mugs down, his customer face was almost genuine. He felt peaceful. He attributed it to the coming end of his shift.

‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù

Thanatos looked up and forced some cheer into his own voice.

‚ÄúNo, thank you!‚Äù

Bradley just smiled again, turned, and walked back to the counter to start cleaning up his station before heading out.

-----

Thanatos looked back at his brother.

‚ÄúThere. At least he won‚Äôt be terrified when I see him again.‚Äù

Sipping the coffee Moros appreciated the extra smooth flavor of the coffee their server had spent extra effort making and had a twinge; almost like guilt if he‚Äôd ever experienced it. 

‚ÄúYou really are a killjoy sometimes you know that? Tell him it was me at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre not really as impressed with your work as you seem to think. Charon gets more than an earful about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe, but you need to visit them again later. They really do get over it after a few hundred years, and it might even take longer if you weren‚Äôt so good at what you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúFlattery will pay for your coffee. So, since you‚Äôre back topside, how‚Äôs mother?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh you know, darkness this and darkness that. She‚Äôs doing alright. Still has that on again off again thing with Phanes.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh, that will never stop giving me the ick.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where you draw the line? Have you even been to Olympus? They‚Äôre wild!‚Äù

‚ÄúFair, and at least Dionysus knows how to have a good time; though you couldn‚Äôt pry him away from Vegas these days.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh. There was this one guy out there. I let his pile of chips grow for a solid two hours at the craps table, then I gave the dice a little poke. You should have seen the look on his face when it teetered over to snake eyes and he lost it all. I really made sure he had time to savor that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt send him your way. I only doomed his accounts.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for that. Just do me a favor and dial it down a bit with all the foreshadowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises there! There‚Äôs just something so satisfying in reaching into their primate brains and making them understand just how royally and perfectly screwed they are. That moment when they realize there‚Äôs no way out. Someone else has the trolly lever. It‚Äôs like candy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes yes, you‚Äôve said, but then I get them and it‚Äôs all ‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs not fair!‚Äô and ‚ÄòI was set up‚Äô and ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs make a deal‚Äô. Exhausting. At least when it‚Äôs a surprise they don‚Äôt try to negotiate until somewhere after the Styx.‚Äù

-----

They sat for a moment, looking out the window and finishing off their coffee. The sun was getting low in the sky and it would be blinding people soon. Their coffee break would be over. Moros noticed Bradley looking over at them as he finished putting his cleaning supplies away and smiled, lifting the mug with the last dregs of his coffee an inch or two.

He looked at his brother and finished the last bit.

‚ÄúSame time next week?‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù

Moros stood and stretched, observing the room and all of the possibilities in it but thinking better of it under the glare from his Thanatos. Nodding, he made his way to the door and out.

-----

Bradley finished putting the last towel in the bin and followed up with his apron. He felt the energy return to him as he picked up his bag and threw it over his shoulder. He knew exactly what he‚Äôd be doing on his day off tomorrow! As he reached the door, the chime preceded him. Nate had opened it for him. He really didn‚Äôt know what had come over him earlier, but this Nate guy seemed like good people. Nate nodded at him, holding the door.

‚ÄúAfter you! Thanks for the coffee!‚Äù

1kkeacu,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kkeacu/recent_hire_issues/,Recent hire issues,"So I was recently hired at a smaller location as a shift supervisor. This is my first time working at Starbucks, but I have worked at Dunkin for over a year. My first day is tomorrow, and I can't help but feel super frustrated. When I was hired, I met the store manager. She seemed to like me a lot and called me the very next day to offer me the job. I accepted. Now, at my interview, I explained that I'd be available to work opening and morning shifts, maybe close if necessary. I was told that it'd be perfect because they had nights mostly covered. A week later, I was told I'd need to come in for a 2nd interview, which I found strange since I'd already completed all my paperwork, including payroll and whatnot. So I came in for the 2nd interview, under the impression I was simply meeting a different store manager or something. Turns out the original SM, the one who hired me, was quitting. Long story short, the interview was super strange; she asked about my availability, and I told her opening/mornings and nights as needed. She winced at that, saying she needs closers, so I conceded. Then the end of the interview comes, and she announces she'd maybe call me later that day with an offer. I spoke up, saying I was already hired, I had a schedule, and was already in the system. She was shocked and confused. She then asked what day I'd be starting. I told her the 12th, because I was in the process of moving. She tried so hard to coerce me to start sooner, but I was firm in my start date, as that's 1 the absolute earliest I could start, and 2 the date that I and the original SM agreed upon. i cant help but feel pretty screwed over, and lost. I feel like I'd accepted this job under a different pretense, and now what I'm working on is different.  Not only that, but I'm not even getting full-time hours like I had requested, yet I'm working 5 days a week. 

  
At this point, the only thing that's making it any better is the pay. I cant quit the job because i do depend on that money, but it sucks feeling like i accepted a job i would've turned down otherwise.

Sorry for the rant, if you have any advice, I'd be more than willing to hear it! Mostly just wanted to express my frustrations, see if anyone relates or knows an option of what I could do. I'm in a Starbucks-rich area, so I have plenty of other stores I could work at, but I know the transfer policy is that you have to work at a location for a minimum of 6 months before transferring.  I don't have much of an option working elsewhere entirely because I do still want to remain in coffee and management, and all other coffee shops in my area pay at best $13/hr.

Update 6.75 is out, and it might just be the most important one yet , unless you count the time I fixed that bug where the app randomly decided you didn't deserve music.

This time, I'm giving you *power*. Real power. Like... **add-your-own-radio-station** power.  
Yes, you can now hit the big shiny **‚ÄúAdd Your Own Station‚Äù** button and inject your favorite station straight into your favorites , without asking me, without begging, without sacrificing a goat under a full moon.

 Does it update live? No. Because Firebase charges more per read , than my kid‚Äôs kindergarten charges for ‚Äúoptional‚Äù art supplies. It'll update with each new app release. Be patient. Or send snacks.

So I‚Äôve talked about a lot of members of our staff, but I‚Äôve never talked about old Murray. Murray is our show‚Äôs head electrician, and he works in front of a big old circuit board, and you cannot believe this thing, and he is just integral to the show. Everything that uses power runs through old Murray, and he‚Äôs been working here forever. He worked on the first Carson show, when this was called the RCA building. Murray was there, and he‚Äôs just the sweetest guy. And I‚Äôm, you know, I hardly ever see him, but he came into my office the other day.¬†

He goes, ‚ÄúI done messed up! I did no good! I did a big mistake!‚Äù And I go, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúI got my coffee on the circuit board and then a little rat ran across and I went to move my coffee, I knocked it over. When I knocked it over, I hit the switch!‚Äù And I go, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúI hit the switch!‚Äù And I go, ‚ÄúOh, it doesn‚Äôt sound bad.‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand! I flipped it! From on to off!‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúWell, what did it even turn off?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúThe comment section on the Blake Lively interview.‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you understand this story.‚Äù¬†

We did manage to save those comments and print them out and it‚Äôs gonna be very cool. It‚Äôs gonna be available at the NBC store. We‚Äôre gonna print them out. It‚Äôs gonna be a book. And the book‚Äôs called ‚ÄúA Polite Discourse About the News of the Day.‚Äù¬†

So, we hang out for a little bit more at the theater, and then go to a little after-party ‚Äî mostly friends and family, maybe forty, fifty folks including my daughter, who just moved to L.A. last year, after college. Honestly, she was a big reason I wanted to do a show out here in the first place. So, we‚Äôre eating, we‚Äôre drinking, we‚Äôre laughing now about how close we came to having had no show at all. And that‚Äôs when our excellent editor Ellen Frankman comes up to me with a look on her face that I couldn‚Äôt quite figure out; in retrospect, she looked really ill ‚Äî¬† she was shaky, her face was pale. So I ask her what‚Äôs wrong. She tells me that, in addition to the audio failures we had earlier, there was another, even bigger failure: the show had not been recorded, she says. And I didn‚Äôt understand. I asked her to repeat herself. She said, ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt record the show,‚Äù and I still didn‚Äôt quite understand. I mean, I‚Äôve been recording stuff for many years now ‚Äî I was a musician and I used to work in all kinds of studios; I was a reporter and used to record all kinds of interviews; I‚Äôve been doing this show now for fifteen years, we‚Äôve recorded thousands of studio and live interviews and many other things, and not once have the people responsible for recording just failed to record it. But tonight, that‚Äôs apparently what happened. I am pretty sure we did do a live show with Ari Emanuel and R.J. Cutler and Luis Guerra‚Äôs band and Christina from the audience, but there‚Äôs no recording of it, so I‚Äôm not really sure.¬†

The next several hours were even more of a blur than the hour before the show. We thought about trying to partner with R.J. Cutler to make a forensic documentary of the show, trying to re-create it as best we could. Some friends who had been in the audience had already started sending in bits of video and audio they had recorded. At least one journalist had recorded the entire Ari Emanuel interview, but it‚Äôs iPhone-on-the-lap quality, not radio quality. So we ditched that re-creation idea.",11,1747005579.0,blakelivelysnark,1,1.0,False

1kke687,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1kke687/why/,Why?,"I posted a version of this in the Widow community, but would like advice here as well. Sorry, it‚Äôs kind of lengthy.

My husband died by suicide in early December and I have been absolutely shattered. We have been together for 20+ years and married for almost 16 years. We have a 7 year old son together. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck between two planes right now‚Ä¶ wanting to join him in the afterlife and needing to be on earth for our son. I have so much guilt that I had NO CLUE that he was suicidal (nobody did) and I feel like, as his partner and adult in his life, I failed to keep him here with us.

The worst part is that, a week before he died, I brought up some things about our relationship that I thought we could continue to work on. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it at first, but my husband said he wanted to know what I was thinking, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. He insisted that it was ok to talk and I told him that I was so so very happy with our marriage but that I wanted to know that he would always be there for me emotionally in the future.

We had many years where he put his career before me. There were years where he wouldn‚Äôt eat any meals with me or our son, wouldn‚Äôt stop working from his home office to have a 5 minute cup of coffee with me, wouldn‚Äôt take lunch breaks, would barely acknowledge that I lived in the house, would have sex but not sleep in the same bed as me at night.

My husband finally got a new job in a new career, and the past 2 years have been so great, but even recently, when he was home, he often seemed to want to do projects or hobbies that took a ton of time. Like running on a treadmill for 6 hours in the basement, making pies for work for 12 hours on a Sunday, doing yard work all day, etc.

I was going to EMDR therapy to help with some childhood stuff. But going through the EMDR made me realize that I still didn‚Äôt always feel an ‚Äúemotional connection‚Äù from my husband. My therapist suggested I talk to him and so I did. I asked that he try to listen to the emotion or feelings that I had when I was talking with him and asked if he could be more emotionally available to me in return. I stressed how much I loved him and how much these past two years have meant to me and just asked that he never ‚Äúleave‚Äù me emotionally again.

Fast forward about a week and he started crying and said he wasn‚Äôt ok. He said he thought he was ‚Äúbroken‚Äù inside and couldn‚Äôt feel things like other people. He said there was a lot of things that he didn‚Äôt tell me about his childhood and his dad being abusive and leaving him when he was around 10. He NEVER talked to me about his dad except to say he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have one‚Äù or was an a-hole or something. So this was a lot of opening up on his part. My husband then held both my hands and said ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt worry, I made an appointment with an online therapist and I‚Äôm ready to talk now. I want to be the best dad and husband for us.‚Äù I told him I would sit with him during the appointment if he‚Äôd like. I was so proud that he made a counseling appointment on his own.

We never got there. Two days later (and two before his appointment), he came home from work and said he would come to our son‚Äôs art class with me. Usually only one of us goes since there is no seating and we just have to sit in the car in the parking lot. He looked so exhausted so I told him to stay home and relax. Plus it was cold and snowing and I thought he could just be comfortable until we got home. I said I‚Äôd make avocado toast for dinner.

When my son and I got home, there was a note on the hallway wall that said don‚Äôt go down stairs. I thought he had decided to surprise me with dinner in our finished basement because he is sweet like that. But then it turned into a note that said he now knew he was a narcissist and my son and I were better without him and that he loved us so much.

Never in a million years would I have thought that he would have ended his life. He had just told me how happy he was being with my son and me and how much he enjoyed our life together. He finally had a job and career that made him feel valued and said that he enjoyed it. We just got a new puppy at his request and booked a vacation the night before. He was an awesome dad and so close to our son.

Everyday that passes I miss him more and more. And I just keep blaming myself for talking to him about our relationship. It was meant to move us forward and make us stronger. 

Also, if he was a narcissist, was any part of our relationship real?? I honestly thought he truly loved me, but he was so DIFFERENT and mean to me in the past year. Why? Why now after 23 years? What changed?

Please help me. I‚Äôm so grief stricken. I will always love him, but did he ever love me?

Once I leave Eero for FW, I won't need Eero's Secure+ anymore, which includes Malwarebytes on my computer. I've used MWB since 2018 and never *once* had any notification of a block or intrusion and there has never been anything in quarantine. Maybe that's because at home Secure+ has been good enough to block everything first, and threat and ad blocks do show up in the Eero app.  

MWB also has never blocked anything using my laptop outside the home, which isn't a lot -- occasional trips to coffee shops and some travel. I'm thinking about keeping it though for when my computer and phone aren't on the home network. In addition, while away from the home network, I'd have my laptop firewall enabled, use the router VPN for both laptop and phone, and use Brave browser (or may change to Firefox) for browser protection. Is keeping Malwarebytes for away use overkill? And if I keep it, do I need to always remember to turn it on when I leave home, or can I just leave it on alongside the FW features running.

His mom‚Äôs apartment wasn‚Äôt always moldy, but has been visibly moldy in the past few years. He hasn‚Äôt lived there since 2021, but we don‚Äôt know if the building had mold that wasn‚Äôt visible when he lived there.) (Also my partner has a history of randomly blacking out, and has seen neurologists that have given him no answers as a kid/teen/young adult.)

So anyways, around 2021, we moved into an apartment of our own. It was a shitty basement apartment in the Bronx, and the first year living there was fine despite the hundreds of roaches. We were broke, young 20 something‚Äôs so we tried our best to make it work despite our fears about basement apartments. At one point though, he gets an ear infection. The ENT tells him he got some water trapped behind his ear, likely when showering, and it had grown mold. So the ENT had to go in and scrape it off his ear drum, this made him have a seizure every appointment. The ENT said it wasn‚Äôt common, but not unusual for a seizure to be the pain response to that as touching the ear drum is very painful.

Well, the second year living in the basement apartment things took a turn. The main building pipes are, of course, in the basement. They were located in a small hallway next to our unit, so when they burst, our apartment flooded. It was never anything too crazy, and they would come and mop it up for us. We didn‚Äôt know they were supposed to take additional measures via vacuuming the water and bringing in large fans and de-humidifiers. One of his several trips, a plumber, who the building regularly hired, told us we should move. He said his company had been hired to consistently come out to this building several times for the same issues again and again. We didn‚Äôt have any plumbing issues our first year, so we didn‚Äôt listen. Even then, I‚Äôm wondering how bad the mold must‚Äôve been. My partner was home 24/7 as he‚Äôs an introvert and works from home. I worked two jobs outside of the home and really was only there to sleep most days. We called 311 and tried to get the city to test for mold, but no one wanted any part in it. One guy told us no one wanted to touch ‚Äúthe mold subject‚Äù because if they did, both my partner and I as well as every other tenant in the building would be homeless immediately. No ‚Äútake 30 days to gather and move your things‚Äù, it‚Äôs out on the street within 10 minutes so the city doesn‚Äôt get sued. 

At one point in all this mess, my partner goes to his parents apartment and fell down a flight of stairs. A NYCHA employee mopped the floor and didn‚Äôt leave a wet floor sign. He sued, and NYCHA settled. His doctors said that he has some damage to his lower spine, and he experienced some knee pain for a long time afterwards. They said his knee pain was correlated to his spinal injury via a pinched nerve, aka Nerve Damage. They said it could stay forever, or just vanish one day, but they wanted to remove it via surgery, which he declined. 

A few months later, we eat takeout from a Mexican restaurant. He enjoyed his burrito but woke up the next morning nauseous. We assumed some sort of food poisoning. He had some vomit and some diarrhea, but it was mostly just a nauseous feeling and dry heaving. Then it worsened to the point where he expressed cramping in his abdomen, and an extreme loss of appetite (not because he wasn‚Äôt hungry, but because he was scared of feeling sick). This went on for weeks, with doctors mostly just prescribing him with medicine for nausea.

In this time, our building had changed management, our building seemed like it was improving. It had gone about 4-5 months without flooding at this point, so we agreed to re-sign the lease. Again, stupid, broke 20 something‚Äôs. At one point, we noticed the walls towards the backyard were so wet we could make handprints and the wall would crumple inward. But we needed something and prices are only going up these days. Literally a week after finding that, we wake up to our entire apartment being flooded with sewage water. There was floating shit, everywhere. My cat was sitting up high on the counter, our dog was on the ground. Unfortunately for us, our dog loved water like crazy, and more than likely ingested it before we woke up and took them out of the apartment. He died a week and a half later. 95% of our belongings were destroyed, thankfully we had insurance. We ended up getting the building to let us break our recently renewed lease and assume no damages to the apartment. They agreed to do that and give us our deposits back on the condition we never reached back out to them to sue. We had no money to sue and we wanted to get the heck out of there so we agreed. 

We ended up moving to Texas shortly after. Meanwhile, this stomach issue is persistent. On and off and on and off and on and off. Weeks where he gets really bad, he‚Äôs losing 15 pounds at a time due to not eating. Then a few good weeks where he is being ULTRA careful of what he eats. He cut out coffee first, as that seemed to agitate him a ton. Then all caffeine aside from home-brewed tea. Then anything dairy, as he was already lactose intolerance and that made things worse. Then he cut out tomatoes and lemons, etc, anything acidic. Nothing really solving the problem but makes eating a little more bearable. During this time he saw his primary physician, ER doctors, and a Gastroenterologist. He did an endoscopy and colonoscopy, both came back clean. Blood and urine tests were clean, as well as x-rays, CT-scans, and MRI‚Äôs. All clean. At one point, an ER doctor told him his had some mild inflammation in his upper intestine, but just prescribed him some pills and wasn‚Äôt able to pinpoint why.

Good thing is his knee pain mostly went away, he says it bothers him sometimes but not all the time and not as intense as it once was. The stomach issue is consistent but no real answers. His new primary physician wanted to start with a simple allergy test and what was he allergic to you ask? Mold. Mold and mold and different kinds of mold but all mold. Not allergic to cheese, not allergic to tomatoes, just several different kinds of mold and also corn. He also has been experiencing lots of migraines. He can‚Äôt stand the sun, his jaw hurts all the time, upper neck tension too. He often will turn his head to look at something and instantly wince at his neck hurting him. He said it‚Äôs like little sharp pains in his neck when he turns to look at something. They believe he has TMJ, but they‚Äôre testing that theory with a mouthguard at night. It‚Äôs only been a few nights, but hasn‚Äôt helped much so far.

Now about 5 days ago, he had a really odd seizure. If it even was a seizure. I‚Äôve seen him black out several times before, and saw him seize that one time at the ENT. But this was different. He was sitting at his computer, something he does all the time and has never blacked out while sitting. I was walking around our home office, cleaning, about to head to the bank, when I heard him slam on his desk 4 times. I thought maybe he lost in a game or something, but when I turn around his eyes are shut tight and he‚Äôs clenching his face. His hands are clenched into fists, and his whole body is so tense that he‚Äôs shaking. It wasn‚Äôt a harsh body shake like normal seizures. It was a shallow shake, like he was shaking because his body was just so tense. This lasted about 30 seconds before I grabbed him and started asking what was wrong. One I grabbed his shoulders, he kinda stopped shaking and his whole body just relaxed in a slump kind of way. He didn‚Äôt come out of his chair, still sitting there, but his eyes are opening and closing rapidly and he‚Äôs looking in all directions. He just wasn‚Äôt responsive at all. I ran out of the room and called to our housemates. One called 911 and went to open the property gates and make room for an ambulance. The other and I looked at my partner. His face was going pale and his lips instantly went purple. I breathed into his mouth for a second, his color returned and then faded again quickly. I began to worry he wasn‚Äôt breathing, so my second housemate helped me lay him on the floor and check his pulse. Being flat on the ground helped his breathing and his pulse was consistent. At this point he is looking at us, but not moving. We each held a hand and asked him to squeeze it if he could. He could squeeze his hand. So we asked him questions and asked him to squeeze for yes. You can hear us? Squeeze. Can you see me? Squeeze. Do you know who I am? Squeeze. Can you talk? No squeeze. Can you move any body part? No squeeze. Are you in pain? No squeeze. Are you numb? Squeeze.
During this time, his eyes kept rolling to the back of his head and we would have to keep talking to him to get him to stay with us while we waited for the EMT‚Äôs. Then a neighbor came over and asked a lot of the simple questions we did, then she asked if he could try moving his mouth for us. Once he started trying to move his mouth, everything else started to come back. Very slowly, but he was able to move his upper torso by the time the EMT‚Äôs got to us. 

His account of it was his head started hurting him, he reached up to touch his temple and he felt a sharp pain. Everything after that was blank until he was on the floor and we were asking him to squeeze our hands. He seemed easy going afterwards but said it felt like his body had a hard reset. He felt like he had been unplugged and then plugged back in. The ER doctor said it could be a form of seizure, but what I explained to him didn‚Äôt sound very seizure like or last very long. There was no diagnosis, just told to see a neurologist and to not drive for the next 6 months. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far in the story, bless you! It‚Äôs long, very detailed, and might not all correlate but idk I‚Äôm hoping someone has some idea or inkling of what we can try or what we can try to get him tested for. Anything! He‚Äôs 31, we have no kids but we do want them. We have a whole life ahead of us. I‚Äôm worried no one‚Äôs taking his symptoms serious and something worse will happen to him. Thanks to anyone reading this story. God knows it‚Äôs more than most doctors have done for him.",1,1747004722.0,medicalmysteries,0,1.0,False

1kkdtev,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kkdtev/new_grinder_300600/,New Grinder [300-600],"Hi All, been reading on the forum here about my next steps. I‚Äôm new to espresso at home and I do have the time to learn and dive into it - that all part of the fun. I don‚Äôt drink a lot of espresso or coffee at home, so expecting to start small.

I do have a few different machines for milk foam and latte art I have been using with a variety of Nespresso machines and others.

My plan is to start at the cheaper end with an espresso machines like the Bambino. I don‚Äôt expect to get the plus as I don‚Äôt need the additional for milk. Is there another alternative in that range or should I get a slightly more expensive machine?

The big question is the grinder. I looked at DF54 but it seems no longer really for sale here in the US, so looking at something else. I don‚Äôt need to grin a lot for brew, mainly espresso shots. Also expecting single dose, price range 300-600, prefer something that last a long time rather than buying cheap.

Input is appreciated.
