1mktssc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mktssc/why_do_i_prefer_nespresso_200/,Why do I prefer Nespresso? [$200],"I find myself preferring the taste of a Nespresso to the espressos I have from coffee shops. Live in NYC and have been to countless highly rated coffee shops.

While the drip is often better than I’d make at home, I inevitably prefer the taste of the nespresso (don’t own one but typically the ones I’ve had in hotels) to the espressos I have there.

Does anyone else have this experience. I am not knowledgeable about coffee. Is it the type of bean used in fashionable coffee shops?

I have been considering investing in a Nespresso because I’ve enjoyed it so much, but everyone talks about how even a cheap espresso machine with pre ground beans should outperform the Nespresso.

Me: 50, attractive, accomplished (wealthy), own several businesses, would love to start a family.  Had spent many years working, building and learning. 
What I keep running into is women (some very lovely) in their 30’s-40’s who own a home, career and say they want to be a tradwife - but clearly do not. Some don’t even realize their clock has expired at 39.  One froze her eggs in advance (she works 60-70hr weeks), she is 37 and a partner at a law firm. 
On the other end of the spectrum is women with piercings and tattoos working a coffee counter telling me about their dreams of additional nose gear and opening a cafe. 
It is sadly frustrating I keep meeting very unhappy ladies who want it all, when having it all is a fantasy, a pernicious one. 
Any advice would be helpful - I live in Tampa.

1mktr3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mktr3u/am_i_the_toxic_one_f38/,Am I the toxic one? F(38),"I am 38, single and have a life abroad away from my family (mother 64, sister 41).
My (very always absent) father has died 6yrs ago, he was an alcoholic and my mother always took care of him and made sure he’d not die under a bridge or spent til his last penny on slot machines.
She had no help from her family and had to face this difficulties through the years while me and my sister were away studying and working.
I have always wanted to leave as my birthplace never felt like the place for me. I also probably indirectly wanted to be away from family problems. I’ve always loved my independence, I consider myself a highly sensitive person and need my alone time often whilst (differently than my mother and my sister) I am very sociable and have lots of friends.
Three years after my father died my sister decided to move back to our hometown and thought she’d stay momentarily at my mother’s house but she stayed working remotely. She also takes care of a lot of expenses as my mother lived with only a couple hundred $ a month and my father only left us the house (apartment).
After my father died I became much closer to my mom and sister and I visit way more often. In the past years I have also had the opportunity to spend weeks at once working remotely.
Things have changed in that being that me and my sister are getting older all people our age are married with kids and have a different life than ours. 
Back in the days when we used to visit our hometown on vacation we would spend lots of time going out with friends.
This has all changed and we have zero contacts in my hometown so my sister only basically hangs with my mother and I do consider them to have a co-dependent relationship. Both of them are also introverts, my sister is single and not dating (when she moved back she was escaping a toxic relationship) and they barely have friends.
I have always considered myself “different” in the way that I have my very own interests and passions that are not shared by my mother or sister and I also have my own net. of social contacts in the country I live in.

Nevertheless I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety and have been in therapy in the past 4 years. Last year after a toxic relationship I finally decided to take my life into my own hands and left my stable job to start further education and start the hobby I’ve always wanted to do. Being unemployed, I decided this was the best time to take a break from the bit city and have a rest and spend the months of my further education (9 months remotely) at my mom’s and sister’s, to spend time with them, take a break and have financial support during this months without income. The decision was very welcome by them.
In the first months I struggled because I take in emotions from other and it affects me a lot when others are in a bad mood. Also the class was difficult at the start and I was struggling to adjust to this new setting.
My mother has lots of health problems (but I have too endometriosis and migraines and chronic pain). 
In the months the situation got better and we got more harmonic. My new hobby also brings me a lot of fulfillment and happiness.
My mother always hopes I move back to my hometown and at times she does express this. She knows however I have no intention to move back and after the course I will move back to my city abroad and start a new job.
My mother and my sister often talk about things I am not interested in (neighbours, administrative apartment building stuff) and I usually do not take part in such conversations.
Other than that I try to be attentive, help at home, listen when my mom talks to me.
We spend most time together and do activities together and sometimes it is a bit much for me and I feel my energy drained.
But I spend most hours in my class in the mornings and learning my hobby in the afternoon.
My mother has already expressed that I am “in my own world” or that I “don’t care about anything” some months ago and I was hurt by it and we had a conversation where I also expressed that she doesn’t take any interest in my life abroad or my passions. We had cleared things.
Yesterday I woke up feeling very drained and had been a bit quiet and by myself all day.
we had an altercation in the evening because I had looked for some melon in the fridge and not seeing any, I had just ignored this (I am very dreamy sometimes and am not good at finding things, but I don’t put much importance in this). When she said she had cut melon in the fridge and I said I didn’t find it she started nagging at me saying I should have asked. Then she complained about another minimal thing (because I put some leftover coffee in the fridge and she said I should have just thrown it and she could’ve made a whole new coffee jar) I was already in a bad mood and I snapped and said “I am not bothering anyone so I don’t understand why I am being nagged”.
My sister and I went out and when we came back (it was late and I was tired) my mother started to tell me that she doesn’t understand why I act like this, that I act like I “wouldn’t be there” in the sense that I don’t belong to the family and that if she nags that’s just the way it is. I said my way I answered was not right but that I was having a bad day and didn’t like her tone or to talk about such trivial things that have no meaning to me. And that I couldn’t relate to her saying “I would act like I am not there”. She couldn’t tell me anything concrete and saying that that is just my attitude in general.
I told her that without concrete elements I couldn’t relate and that I feel like I am attentive and caring so I cannot understand what she means. I also told her that “in fact, I DO NOT live here”.
I know she hated this because she’d want me to feel part of the family which of course I am but the reality is that I do live somewhere else but I don’t understand what her problem is or what I can change. She wants to always be there for anyone by giving so much material things like cooking and taking care of chores and I am very appreciative of this but I feel not understood and very disappointed that I am expected to be a different person. 
TL;DR: I’m 38, single, and live abroad, but currently spending 9 months back in my hometown with my mom (64) and sister (41) while doing remote studies. Dad passed 6 years ago after years of alcoholism, mom cared for him alone. Sister moved back 3 years ago and lives with mom, they have a very close, possibly co-dependent relationship. I’m more independent, sociable, and have my own life/interests abroad.

While staying here, I help out, spend time with them, and try to be attentive, but I also need alone time and space for my passions. Mom sometimes says I’m “in my own world” or “don’t care about anything,” which hurts, especially since she rarely shows interest in my life abroad. Yesterday, after a small misunderstanding about food in the fridge, I snapped because I was drained. Later, she said I act like I “don’t belong to the family.” I told her I don’t live here permanently and can’t relate to what she’s accusing me of.

I feel like she expects me to be a different person, more like her way of “being there” (through chores and constant togetherness), while I show love differently. Feeling misunderstood and disappointed — not sure what I can change without losing myself.

1mktpnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mktpnt/how_does_the_technivorm_moccamaster_kbgv_select/,How Does the Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select Compare for Coffee Lovers?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 KBGV Select has been my coffee companion for the past few weeks, and I’m slightly obsessed with the experience it delivers. As someone who starts every day with a fresh cup of coffee, this machine has completely redefined my coffee routine. This well-built, drip-style coffee maker feels premium everywhere you look, and its performance justifies its reputation. Crafted in the Netherlands, it’s obvious this isn’t your average coffee machine—it’s almost like it was designed by someone who truly understands coffee aficionados.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unpacked this coffee maker, I noticed how sleek yet classic its design was. It comes in a sophisticated off-white finish that complements just about any kitchen aesthetic. Its dimensions—6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches tall—mean it fits snugly on my countertop without overwhelming it. What stood out most to me was how durable it feels; this is not some flimsy appliance you're replacing in a year. The glass carafe and metal exterior are thoughtfully combined for durability and aesthetics.

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee with this unit couldn't be more straightforward. The single switch operation is almost comically easy when compared to many of today’s overly complicated machines. Its Brew-Volume Selector allows you to choose between half or full carafe brewing. Testing both configurations gave consistent results. Even when I was only brewing half a pot, the coffee tasted just as robust and flavorful as when I brewed a full 40 oz carafe.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b093dzt2rs/)  

**Performance and Brewing Time**  
This coffee maker heats water to the ideal temperature for coffee extraction, something many machines fail to perfect. It promises to brew a full pot in 4-6 minutes, which it delivered without fail every single time I used it. Plus, it’s surprisingly quiet while operating. I could hardly hear it brewing unless I paid close attention—which, frankly, is a blessing for those early mornings when I’m not fully awake yet. What truly sealed the deal for me is its hot plate. It keeps the coffee perfectly warm for an extended period, thanks to its independent heating mechanism.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Impressive coffee flavor consistency in both full and half pot modes.  
- Reliable hot plate feature that doesn’t burn the coffee but keeps it perfectly warm.  
- Extremely quiet operation, making it ideal for shared spaces or early mornings.  

**Bad Points**  
- The upfront cost might be steep for casual coffee drinkers.  
- It only works with paper filters, which may not appeal to those who prioritize reusable filter options.  

**Quiet Brewing for Busy Mornings**  
Given the automatic shut-off feature included, I never have to worry about accidentally leaving it on. This feature kicks in 100 minutes after brewing—a thoughtful touch for someone like me, who's often rushing in the mornings. The fully automatic operation mode also makes everything seamless; it’s literally as easy as pressing a button. No tinkering or additional steps required. 

**Competing Options**  
When evaluating this coffee maker, I couldn’t help but compare it to some alternatives. Machines from brands like Breville and Bonavita also promise high-quality coffee, but I’ve used both, and they’re not quite in the same league. While Breville’s models often include complex interfaces, they can feel unnecessarily complicated. Bonavita’s coffee makers sometimes struggle with temperature consistency—something the Moccamaster excels at. That said, those other brands tend to provide more affordable units than this one, which is worth considering.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The price of the Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 KBGV Select is definitely on the higher side, but the five-year warranty is a safety net that ensures you’re getting your money’s worth. Machines like this aren’t just coffee makers—they’re long-term investments for serious coffee lovers. I think about the cost per cup of brewing exceptional coffee at home versus buying from a café every day; the value equation quickly starts to make sense.

1mktp2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mktp2j/my_partner_23m_and_i_28m_are_in_a_longdistance/,"My partner (23M) and I (28M) are in a long-distance relationship. We fall asleep every night on Discord together, but I have an issue that causes me to randomly disconnect almost every night, and my partner thinks I am cheating on them. How do I prove I'm not cheating when this occurs?","This is probably going to be long-winded. So I apologize in advance for the lack of brevity. I'll try to keep things focused to the main topic as well, but there's a lot of background context to cover, and tbh I'm both tired and have a tendency to wander. Please, be patient and bear with me.

So, to begin, I'll explain the current situation. As I said in the title, my partner (23M) and I (28M) are long-distance. We've been together for 1 year and 2 months. We use Discord as our primary means of communication, because it's easy to use and, IIRC, it's a lot easier to hear my voice through Discord for them as opposed to calling on the phone.

However, whenever we fall-asleep on-call, very very commonly I will randomly disconnect from the call at some point during the night. They will receive the automatic ""Clyde"" bandwidth message and get kicked from the call. I know I'm not doing it on purpose, because I am asleep. It's not me accidentally pressing the disconnect call button while I'm asleep either. I used to sleep with my phone in my bed with me, but it was locked. So I'm certain it wasn't accidental. Just to be safe, over time, I eliminated the possibility by using my exercise bench as a table next to my bed and placing my phone on it while I sleep. There, it is out of range, and I feel safe in saying it's not just an accident, and thus it's some kind of technical issue, as it keeps happening. Searching online for answers has been fruitless, as it seems no one else has the same issue I do, and we can't find an explanation for why it happens.

That said, they believe I am disconnecting intentionally, so that I can go cheat on them with other people. I'm not cheating on them. I've been faithful. Though, I admit, I've been unfaithful during a past relationship. That is where a large portion of their distrust in me lies in regards to this topic. 

***For context about Cheating***: it was with my first GF almost 10 years ago. Her and I dated in 2015 when we were both in High School, senior year. She left her current boyfriend to be with me. We were together for 2 months, and then had a break up near the end of the school-year. After graduation, we hung out and partied with some other class mates. We had sex. She was single at that time. We stopped seeing each other until I believe spring of the following year. Her and I hung out and partied again, and we hooked up. This time, however, she was seeing someone else. We had sex at a party and thus I was the person she cheated on her boyfriend with. She broke up with him shortly after that, and we continued hooking up and going to hang outs/parties together until eventually ceasing communication unceremoniously.

I've talked with my current partner about this in the past, and both me and them agree that while I wasn't the *cheater*, I was still a participant in that cheating, and therefore, just as much at fault, and just as bad as my ex was for destroying their relationship. Fact: Even if you are not in the relationship, you are still taking actions that are unfaithful and are considered as cheating; you are not faultless.

I've also been generally untruthful during this current relationship, and in the past. This has contributed to the overall lack of trust my current partner has in me.

***For context about Lying:*** It's only something I've understood and come to terms with recently. But I am a fairly dishonest person, having lied frequently ever since I was a child. I don't believe I am a pathological liar, but it is a very bad habit. When I was a kid, I lied mostly to seem more cool or interesting or to avoid bullies, though I'd also lie to my parents and teachers to avoid consequences for misbehaving. I recall doing that a lot, and also feigning ignorance/stupidity with my parents to avoid getting spanked or yelled at.

As I got older, I made an effort to be more truthful, with some success I'd say, but I did still continue to tell small lies, mainly for the purpose of avoiding consequences and to smooth things over. I've lied like that a lot to my current partner. My partner and I get into a lot of arguments. and I've told lies before with the goal of avoiding arguments. My intention is not to shift the blame onto them for my lies. It is not their fault, and I shouldn't have done it in the first place, but I feel it is necessary to explain the nature of the lies and why they happen.

Additionally, there is also a very big lie I had maintained with them. One that I'd prefer to not talk details about, but I was hiding something for a long time (since before I met them), and it recently surfaced. To be blunt, that ruined a huge amount of trust between us.

I've been actively making efforts to curb my behavior/stop lying; as well as speaking more clearly and directly, not speaking or acting impulsively, and being more considerate of them and their feelings, among others. I've been seeing a therapist mostly biweekly, although, my therapy schedule has gotten disrupted recently as I've started a new job, and on rare occasions I skip therapy, So I know I definitely have lots of room for improvement when it comes to seeking help for the lying problem. But if it makes any difference, I've been putting forth more effort recently to be truthful.

To return to the core topic though, I had an argument with them tonight about the Discord/cheating/trust topic, and it didn't go very well. To be blunt, my partner feels like it's all but confirmed that I am cheating on them, and they are helpless to do anything, because I keep insisting that I'm not lying. They're just gonna always be secondary to whoever I'm contacting because even if they ""caught me"" they can't directly prove it either. Because we're in an LDR, I could just delete any evidence before they'd ever get a chance to catch me.

They want me to admit I did it, but I haven't done it. So I'm not going to admit to something I didn't do. It's probably really whiny of me to say this, but I just keep kicking myself and falling into despair over my past lies. They've destroyed so much trust my partner had in me, that when I'm actually telling the truth, it doesn't matter. It's just another lie to them. Classic boy cries wolf situation.

I'm not mad or resentful. I completely understand why they don't trust me. It's just immensely frustrating to see this unfold. But I suppose I should just swallow and accept my punishment. They aren't going to believe me, because I have done little to regain that trust.

We talked about solutions, and they suggested we stop falling asleep together. I don't like this, because A) I enjoy the security I get from sleeping with them, and B) I feel like this is just a band-aid solution.

To paraphrase what they said, they're ""sick of Clyde saying goodnight for me"". This whole situation makes them feel lesser, secondary, and helpless. Because ultimately they still want to be with me, but can't stand being lied to. They said they were done with that and don't want it to happen ever again. I want to oblige them but if things continue with us staying on call, it's bound to happen again. When the argument ended tonight, they said they were going to stay on call, but mute me because they said they wanted to be done with it and go back to sleep, but I was still talking. So with me on mute, they couldn't hear me. I didn't want to risk having the call hang up without knowing it (because when I disconnect, it doesn't wake me up) and then have to suffer the consequences, so I just decided to stay on call, and stay awake all night, writing out this post and checking the call to make sure it didn't disconnect.

Also, I broke down during this argument as well, just despairing because it feels like I've ruined all trust we had, barring the trust that they know I love them. But even that is in jeopardy now, because later during the argument, I said ""I destroyed every last shred of trust you had in me,"" they corrected me, and reminded me that I had explicitly asked them for reassurance earlier in the discussion; asking whether or not they still trusted that I still love them. And because I was being hyperbolic when I said ""every last shred"", they threatened to revoke that trust as well, to see how I truly feel once literally ""every last shred of trust"" is gone. I don't know how serious this was, but I feel really hurt by that. But at the same time, it feels like they're just doing it to hammer in how much this whole things is hurting \*them\*.

I shouldn't have been hyperbolic in a serious situation like this, and I should've spoken directly. That is another problem we run into: my tendency to not speak directly. We get into arguments all the time where I say something, but I'm kind of speaking off the cuff, or speaking impulsively, and I misspeak and misrepresent what I'm trying to convey in my words. Later, when I say things that contradict that initial erroneous speech, my partner gets mad at me and feels like I'm not making any sense.

For example: yesterday we had another separate argument about me miscommunicating. I was complaining about how I had to help my dad earlier this week do some work on my one day off. We started the conversation with my partner saying how they prefer, if they have work to do, to just do it on a day they go to their job, as opposed to their day off. I agreed. I however, failed to mention how that wouldn't be a solution to my problem, because for me to help my dad on a workday, it'd have to be early; before I work, and my dad spends all morning taking his time to wake up, drink coffee, relax, etc. and he'd never agree to starting work that early.

We started talking about solutions to my problem, and they said something (sorry, I have to paraphrase again, I don't quite remember everything that was said 100%) about how ""you could tell your dad to postpone til the next day, it's just 24 hrs,"" and I stopped and said ""But I worked the following day"". And that's when they got mad. They started saying how I was contradicting myself, and I didn't make sense. They came up with some metaphors. They said it was like I was standing in a ring of fire, and they through a bucket of water to save me, but I drank it. Or it was like I was a kid putting my fingers in my ears going lalalalala and then wondering what they were talking about. In essence; I was deliberately not paying attention.

But that's not what happened, I was paying attention, I just left out an important detail. In essence, I misspoke. I didn't cut-in fast enough to say what was necessary. And by the time the conversation rolled around to the point I clarified that I worked the following day, I mistakenly just... assumed ig, that they didn't understand what I said. So not only did I fail to communicate, I also failed to remember what I said probably less than 5 minutes prior.

This happens super often. Sometimes multiple times in the same day, hell, even the same call. I partly think it's because it's a non-physical method of communication being long-distance and all, but I asked explicitly if this sort of thing happened when they visited earlier this year, and they said yeah. So I don't know what to think about it. It might legitimately just be a problem in the way we communicate, or the way I talk/think.

I'm sorry for rambling yet again, but this is all relevant to the trust issues. While it's upsetting to them because, let's be honest, talking to someone who essentially refuses to understand you is extremely annoying and irritating, they also feel like I'm being untruthful; and being intentionally ignorant, or difficult, or doing all this deliberately to stonewall them. And it makes them feel awful, lesser, etc.

To be honest, I'm at my wits end on this whole thing. And so are they. It needs to stop. Because we both don't want to stop being in a relationship. We both see a future together. And we're both very serious about this relationship. But as things are, it seems like \*this\*, this right here, is all that's in store for us for the rest of our lives. I don't want to raise any alarms, and just to preface, I'm not in any danger, I am not in need of intervention or medical attention, etc., but I've experienced thoughts of self-harm and worse over this recently. I expressed those feelings explicit tonight while breaking down when we had this argument. Because I want to stop hurting them. I can't live with myself knowing the one person I care the most about is getting hurt, let alone by my actions, feeling lesser, feeling betrayed, scorned, all that.

I just don't know what to do differently, and it feels like my options are dried up. It's just stay the course, bite the bullet, continue to work the same old methods of trying to change/improve, and deal with whatever consequences come my way. If they're upset with me and want a change in behavior, or a change in the way things work (such as suggesting that we stop falling asleep together at night), then I'm gonna just have to deal with it and lose those good things. Because I can't \*stand\* the idea that I'm mistreating them otherwise. I want to change more than anything. It's just so hard, so confusing, and I feel so lost sometimes. Like I don't know what to do anymore; or worse, don't know where to start. Because it feels like there's something fundamentally wrong with me. All of these behaviors and actions I've referred to here, with only very few exceptions, have been extremely difficult to change, let alone fully understand why they occur/keep occurring.

I've never been diagnosed, but my longtime therapist thinks I have ADHD. I have been diagnosed with anxiety. Idk if they are the cause though. It's just so bewildering.

Anyway, I'm running out of steam. Thank you for reading all this if you made it this far. Just, thank you.",1,1754655655.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1mkto8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mkto8y/sibling_rivalry_is_alive_and_well_even_when_its/,Sibling rivalry is alive and well… even when it’s between skaters.,"When I first got sober, I started spending time at a little community center where people in recovery hung out. It wasn’t fancy, think broken couches, mismatched mugs, and a coffee pot older than I was, but it was full of good people trying to stay out of trouble.

One of the guys who really looked out for me was Danny. He was this wiry, tattoo-covered skateboarder in his 40s who could ollie over anything… except his own pride. He’d been clean for a decade and had a knack for helping rookies like me get through the early days without losing our minds.

Then there was his younger brother, Troy. Troy was also a skater, but he had a chip on his shoulder the size of a half-pipe. He wasn’t exactly my biggest fan, I think he figured I was just playing at the “clean life” thing and didn’t deserve Danny’s time.

One afternoon, Danny was helping me fix up an old skateboard I’d bought second-hand. I’d brought over some killer BBQ sandwiches for us to eat while we worked, and Danny cracked open a jar of homemade ghost pepper pickles his girlfriend had made. I’d grown up eating spicy stuff, so we were just sitting there happily sweating bullets and talking about grip tape when Troy walked in.

“What’s going on?” he asked. No heads-up, no “hey, you busy?” Just waltzed in. I knew he’d want food, and sure enough, his eyes landed on the sandwiches.

Danny and I locked eyes, I swear the man can communicate full sentences without saying a word. The message was clear: *Don’t say a thing. Just follow my lead.*

Danny handed him a sandwich, then popped another pepper in his mouth. I did the same, making a show of how good they were. Troy squinted at the jar.

I shrugged. “Depends on if you can hang, man.”

Troy took the bait. He bit into one like it was a cucumber. Three seconds later, his face turned the exact shade of the pickle jar label. He started coughing, chugging water like it might save him from spontaneous combustion.

Danny nearly fell off his chair laughing. I was crying into my sandwich. It was the perfect prank, harmless, quick, and fueled entirely by that unspoken sibling competition that never dies.

My boyfriend (30M) , in the US. We've never met in person, but I've followed him on Instagram long before we spoke, because I loved his art. He is an amazing artist that has worked with some well known rappers in the past etc.

Two years of following him, I reached out. We started talking. One thing led to another, and three months ago, we became long-distance boyfriend and girlfriend. We are together for three month now, and we speak about closing the gap soon.

At first, it was amazing. We'd spend hours on FaceTime, watching movies together, talking about life, ordering food for each other through uber eats, discussing our traumas and achievements. We fell asleep on the phone, talked about our dreams and goals in life, discussed philosophy and our favourite books. He was funny, smart, charismatic, and he really listened to me, he was very consistent in showing up and spending time with me. I felt understood in a way I hadn't in my life. I have had boyfriends that lived in the same city as me and I still didn't feel as connected to them as much as I did with my current partner, despite being so far away, despite a 6 hour time difference and having very different cultures and upbringings. I've been abandoned by men my whole life and was cheated on and neglected by my partners in the past. Me have always betrayed me and left, including my father and I tend to have PTSD around relationships.

I am from the Middle East (Living in Germany for 10 years), first generation immigrant, raised by a single mom that was extremely poor but hard working. My mom would work all the time and still does. Growing up I was always scared and alone and never had someone who gave me that much time and attention, especially a man. Being a daughter to a single immigrant mom, her expectations of me are very high. I have moved countries three times and always had to start in pure poverty and in fear. Whenever I got attached to a place and felt like having roots, we had to move. I was not able to call a place home, stopped making friends and had a poor mental health. I faced racism and discrimination, I was betrayed by loved ones. This information might explain why I am not ready to let go of this man.

My problem in the relationship started when i got ""suggested accounts"" on Instagram. They were suddenly flooded with women that very extremely attractive and some of them where very sexual and semi naked. Women with big curves, perfect waists, posting very provocative pictures. I found out those accounts were suggested to me, because my boyfriend was following them. I am talking about the type of women who live the LA life, they could easily date NBA players. They were 10/10 and they looked nothing like me. They had piercings and pictures with their Nipples showing, and my boyfriend had liked most of their pictures before we got together. They weren't celebrities. Most were just regular people with small followings. Some were OnlyFans models. Many were Black but most of them are Japanese and Korean women, very short and petite, some of them wear lots of makeup and had plastic surgery such as BBLs. All of this made me feel even more insecure because I'm Middle Eastern, very tall, and skinny. Small chest, small butt. I work out and have abs and muscles, I dont think I am ugly but I am definitely very different from those women he follows. I am the  complete opposite of the type he seems drawn to. I also found out he paints a lot hentai female characters and has even purchase hentai NFTS before we got together.

One thing all women he follows have in common is the fact that they are very alt, and artsy. They work as models, photographers, djs, artists. They are all “instagram baddies”. I wear suits and button up shirts, I have 14 followers on my  instagram account that is private, I spend my free time studying mathematics and programming. I work at a doctors office as an assistant and on the weekends I work at a coffee shop as a barista to save money. l am currently working towards becoming a programmer and my school starts in a few weeks. The girls he follows are into partying, money, designer bags, drugs,travelling to expensive locations and art.

I decided to bring all of this up, when I saw he liked some of their provocative pictures when we were talking and he told me it was on accident, that he probably sat on his phone. After arguing a lot and almost breaking up over it, he promised to unfollow them. He did... maybe a couple hundred. But out of the ~2000 accounts he follows on Instagram alone, half are still these women. He also follows similar accounts on Twitter (he follows a lot of people over there, mostly women and he used to even repost them). I started wondering if this pointed to a corn problem, which for me is a boundary.

After three month of seeing no real improvements about this situation. We had another argument and broke up. He tried really hard to prevent it by crying and telling me to give him more time, that if he starts unfollowing all of them at once he might lose his platform and get shadow banned. He even said I am trying to destroy his art career. But I still chose to break up with him. That's when he showed me a helium tank (which he has purchased way before we even met) and told me he planned to kill himself. He's mentioned having suicidal thoughts during every argument, but I didn't realize how far it went and that he actually had tools for it stored. I panicked and told his parents, even though he told me not to. He told me if I told them, they will hate me. He said that I have ruined his life and now I am about to ruin his family life and that I should leave him alone. I decided to tell them anyways and they didn't react, which made me wonder if they'd heard this from him before and are used to him acting this way.

During our no-contact period, I told my mom everything, i showed her the women he follows, the hentai NFTs he purchased, the helium tank, even some unnecessary strange lies. Now my mom dislikes him. She thinks he's manipulative, a love bomber, a narcissist, a liar, and possibly has a sex addiction. She's convinced he's dangerous, especially since he still keeps the helium tank in his room. She says he probably did this to all of his ex partners and even threatened to kill them if they tried to leave, or he thought about killing them at least without mentioning it to anyone. She believes he's only with me because he's in a low point in his life, and that once he gets better, he'll leave for the type of women he actually desires.

She also doesn't like what she's heard about his family. For example, his mom used to buy him Playboy magazines so he could cut out pictures of naked women for his art. My mom says that's inappropriate and that our family values don't align.

My boyfriend also has a history of failed relationships where, according to him, he's always the victim. He's told me stories about exes who cheated, physically abused him, did things to him physically that he didn’t consent to, tried to stab him, unalive him or tried to ruin his career. In every story, he's innocent and unlucky, and his only fault is that he chose bad people and that he is such a hopeless romantic and these women took advantage of the fact that he didn't want to leave them. His last relationship was two years ago. 

His ex girlfriend slept with his best friend and made a video and sent it to him after they had broken up. When he showed no signs of emotion towards the betrayal, she started using other tactics to make him upset. She told him that she was r___ in those videos. he tells me the reason why they broke up was because she wouldn't go to work and he had to financially support her and pay for the rent of the apartment they shared together, had to clean and buy food. Her parents were against her dating a black man (She was south Asian and according to him a very small petite girl, for some reason he had to include that description lol) so they had abounded her, made her choose between them and him. So he decided to end things with her for good and that's when she started sending him those types of videos. After the last relationship, he fell into a hard depression and has gained a lot of weight, stopped painting and selling art, eventually he lost his apartment and had to move in with his mother at age of 28. He currently lives in his mom's basement, has no friends, doesn't go out, doesn't do sports. Art is the only thing he does, but when he's upset, he stops doing it altogether. Even his mom told him she's afraid, because it seems like he only thrives and does things when he is in a relationship, and if this were to end he'd end up in the same situation again. Depressed and suicidal. That's why my mom thinks he is narcissistic. She says he has nothing going on for him and he makes women his only purpose and if he doesn't have a partner, he doesn't have a reason to do anything. She says he is a weak man and can never make a good husband and be a good father. And because he depends on women romantically, he could potentially be dangerous. She says that he is going to use me mentally and physically, and when he is finally at a place where he is more confident in his body and career, he will leave me. She says it's not normal for a 30 year old to cry after every fight and threaten to kill himself. She thinks he might even harm me if I tried to leave.

Despite everything, I went back to him after a few days of ignoring his calls. I love him. He feels like my best friend. But now my mom has given me an ultimatum: if I stay with him, l won't be able to mention his name to my mother and if I ever end up meeting him IRL, she'll cut me off completely. She told me every time she hears me speak to him, her skin crawls and her heart aches. She asks herself ""why is my daughter so naive and broken that she chooses this man, who will cause her a lifetime of suffering and will eventually stop her from growth?"".

There are a few things I am leaving out because I can't think of everything atm.

I'm torn. I see the red flags. But I also have hope when it feels like I shouldn't. I keep thinking maybe, if we communicate enough, things could work.

Keep in mind him and I talk about getting married and moving in together eventually sometime in the future. I have been very serious about this person up until now.

Am l ignoring obvious danger signs? Or is my mom judging him too harshly because of her past relationships? I need advice. Please be kind.

TL;DR: TL;DR: I (25F, Germany) have been dating a man (30M, US) long-distance for 3 months after meeting on Instagram. He follows hundreds of provocative women online, made suicidal threats (showed me a helium tank) when we briefly broke up, because he didnt manage to unfollow these women on his social media, and has a history of painting himself as the victim in all past relationships. My mom says he’s manipulative, possibly dangerous, and will cut me off if I stay with him. I love him, but I’m torn between him and my mom’s warnings",1,1754655430.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Everything seems to light up, the chrome coloured cars parked on the edge of the road emit a glare which distracts me from the straight path in front of me. The windows look like paintings containing people smiling and reminiscing to each other as they sip their coffee, distracting me from the picture I hold in my hand, also in front of me. I shuffle through the crowds of colourfully clothed people standing next to comfortable yet pretentious stone buildings. The buildings which now contrast their previous selves, in all the years I've lived in this city anyway. Looking at the unbothered faces, sitting outside, enjoying themselves. Today is irregular. 

I was starting to believe this could become normal, until I saw his face. The man in my picture, the picture I was distracted from looking at, and suddenly the facade had begun to slip. Although it pains me, I suppose I'll have to rip the curtain down, as it's the only way I'll get paid. I approach the man sitting beside what seems to be his family, enjoying his irregular day by their side. Holding the picture up, the connection becomes clear. I ask him if his name is Humbert as I reach for my left inner jacket pocket. His response is the trigger as I reach for my gun. Now I'm holding it pointed directly at his chest. My weapon is chrome yet it doesn't emit any glare, it doesn't distract me. Three shots and his blood splatters along the windows, the painting is ruined. The movements of foreigners become frantic as the locals' faces revert back to their former mold. Amidst the chaos I slip into the crowd, amidst the screams my footsteps are masked. Now, today is regular. 

I'm just like everyone else, I think, I feel. I work at a job, one that's like any other. One that's simple. Others around me say stuff like “im an accountant”, or “I work in a restaurant” whatever. These jobs may be different, yet it's only one certain thing. Accountants work with numbers, chefs work with food. Yet they both have in common the fact that doing them correctly, following the instructions, means you get paid. My job is the same, I follow the instructions, I get paid. The only difference is I kill people. ",1,1754655406.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

I'm developing a speculative evolution project called 
DOMESTIC, which consists of a planetary-sized (approximately the diameter of Mercury) altered living room, called ALIVEingRoom, seeded with current household pests common in this environment. I probably won't have much time to explore this concept, as I have other projects to work on, but I still wanted to share it with you, since spec evo is one of my favorite topics, and it's comforting to see that there's a sub full of people with the same interests.

 PREMISE:

""In the mid-2550s, humanity, now technologically advanced, mastering the art of using renewable resources as fuel and thus manipulating matter on a planetary scale (basically like futuristic engineers), conducted a biological experiment that consisted of building a planetary-sized replica of an average early 21st-century living room and seeding it with household pests typical of this environment, providing customized resources with planetary engineering, gravity, and sufficient oxygen for the animals to thrive. With planetary engineering, it was also possible to create a relativity of time in the built environment, with hundreds of millions of years inside the ALIVEingRoom being only tens of decades outside. Thus, the scientists supervising the project could witness evolution occurring in real time, and their children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren could also witness the experiment taking place. From this perspective, the use of planetary engineering; real-time evolution; and a system of temperature, atmosphere, and day-night cycle, which can act  for centuries without pause; it has made ALIVEingRoom one of the greatest experiments of all humanity, leaving a mark of its inspiring advancement. Even if humans in general become extinct, other intelligent civilizations, and perhaps even descendants of humanity, would recognize with prestige the scientific possibilities that the ALIVingRoom project has brought.

This gigantic, human-created cubicle would be an exact replica of a modern living room, complete with replicas of two sofas, a rug, tiles, a coffee table, a rack, and a set of cushions. These colossal pieces of furniture, such as the sofa, rug, and cushions, are covered in hybrid plants known as ""tissuephytes,"" which consist of synthetic plants created by humans. They are functional autotrophic living beings, but which have characteristics very similar to wool, silk, and other fabrics, in addition to having colors identical to the dyed versions of these materials.  The tissuephytes are practically a link between the natural and the industrial, a reflection of humanity's advancement in the 26th century. In addition to these altered plants, many other elements that make up the ALIVEingRoom landscape contain this blend of the natural and the human-made, as evidenced by the extremely unique and even unusual meteorology and biomes.

THE HUMAN VERSION OF METEOROLOGY:

For this experiment, a system was created to accurately simulate meteorology, the diurnal cycle, and atmospheric phenomena. This invention is essential for maintaining local life, and its changes stimulate the evolution of the beings living here.

Atmosphere - A climate similar to Earth's was created, only with subtle climatic variations. In addition to gravity and increased oxygen, this system stimulates the growth and development of animals (chordates and mainly arthropods).  This atmospheric simulation is programmed to create slow, gradual, yet random climate changes, thus purposefully nudging animals to adapt, evolution to occur, biological explosions and extinctions to occur, niches to be occupied and modified, and the evolution of beings during the experiment.

Light and Diurnal Cycle - Scientists and Planetary Engineers developed square fluorescent lights the size of cities. Two lights are located on the roof of the building, one illuminating the west and the other the east. Together, they simulate the conditions necessary for life that a star provides, but without impacting the beings with solar radiation or extremely strong UV rays. The regions below them end up being extremely hot, but otherwise, they do an incredible job of sustaining the life of the animals in the building.  In order to simulate the diurnal cycle, for twelve hours (inside the ALIVEingRoom), the lights remain unchanged, while for the other twelve hours, the lights decrease their brightness by 90%, lowering the temperatures and resulting in a near darkness that plagues the cubicle, until the cycle repeats.

Rain and Water Absorption - To maintain life on the planet, pores in the ceiling randomly release a constant amount of water into the interior of the building, lasting from a few minutes to hours. This system acts as an irrigation system with the same purpose as rainfall. Some time after the rain ends, to prevent flooding and habitat destruction, a drainage system beneath the entire ALIVEingRoom absorbs excess water from the surface, storing and filtering it, and sending it for later use in the irrigation system. A sustainable water cycle created to sustain life in an unnatural environment.

BIOMES:

Couch Plateau (Meridian) - Located vertically on the eastern side of the cubicle. A slightly warm temperature environment. In the more stable areas of the plateau, it consists of a vast savannah, covered by slightly tall, low-lying tissuephytes, which make up the environment like a large forest, with very few tissuephyte trees in the landscape.

 Carpet Swamp - Located in the center of the cubicle. This biome is extremely humid, and also quite wet, due to the presence of creeping tissuephytes that retain rainwater and release it into the soil in dangerous situations. It also contains the tallest tissuephyte trees in the entire cubicle, which spread their leaves to the sides in search of light, creating a dense forest environment.

Couch Plateau (Parallel): Located horizontally on the western side of the cubicle. The most stable areas of the couch consist of a kind of tundra, creeping tissuephytes adapted to slightly cooler temperatures, and a slightly larger presence of medium-sized tissuephyte trees.

Floor Desert - Located covering the entire cubicle floor, leaving only gaps between them. These are a series of large, symmetrically positioned, equilateral squares, quite similar to ceramic floor tiles. They are covered in a type of ""ceramic dust"" whose composition is very similar to sand.  The entire biome has a dry climate, in addition to the occurrence of strong winds.

Cushions - Located mostly scattered throughout the sofas, with some in specific spots in the Tile Desert. It's the most temperature-neutral environment on this ""planet,"" consisting of a rocky base, a thin layer of soil, completely filled with a tangle of tall tissuephyte plants that constantly intertwine like strands of steel wool. The closer to the bottom of the tangle, the lower the oxygen content, so the creatures living deeper are usually extremophiles or parasites of these plants.

Global Oceanic Webs - Located around the entire cubicle, covering the spaces between the squares of the ceramic floor. What on Earth are gaps created to prevent the tiles from breaking during thermal expansion, in ALIVEingRoom are filled by two oceanic saltwater webs whose waters flow from north to south through the gaps in the entire tile.  These oceans are approximately 18,000 meters deep, and despite their narrow width by Earthly standards, they contain an incredible diversity of animals, plants, and other beings. We have the Northern Oceanic Web, with dense, grayish waters, and the Southern Oceanic Web, with murky, brownish waters.

Walls and ceiling - Walls located around the ecosystem, enclosing it in a slightly rectangular square; the ceiling located above the entire structure, enclosing it. They are a set of five colossal, narrow, slightly rectangular hexahedrons made of a material consisting of an artificial mixture of porcelain and matiz rocks. Essentially, these surfaces are quite poor in biodiversity, harboring only beings adapted to long periods without nutrition, or deeply extremophilic beings. However, the large cubic-rectangular space these structures provide is a haven for aerial beings, which are free to fly over this enormous area.

Radiant zones - These consist of locations very close to or below fluorescent lights. This is quite extreme, as the proximity results in very bright landscapes and extremely high temperatures. A difficult environment during the day but normal at night.

Dark Zones - These consist of locations located in the shadows of furniture in contact with the light. This can lead to very dark environments with extremely low temperatures, where darkness is practically eternal.

ANIMALS USED:

With the premise of the experiment being to observe evolution in action live, the ecosystem was seeded with unwanted animals, typically found wandering around a living room (the building that inspired ALIVEingRoom). This allowed them to adapt and evolve in this unique environment.  These animals include:

- Tropical house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia)
- Southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus)
- Silverfish (Lepisma saccharina)
- Cellar spider (Pholcus phalangioides)
- Termite (Syntermes dirus)
- House dust mite (Blomia tropicalis)
- Pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis)

________________________________________

And so, DOMESTIC would be based on these animals being introduced to the ALIVEingRoom, and along with the tissuephytes, evolving for millions of years within the ALIVEingRoom, which from the outside, would seem like mere decades.

Feel free to give your opinions and help me (if you'd like) with suggestions for the project. But beyond that, I would like feedback on the development of arthropods that were seeded in this unique environment by Earth standards. Do you think it's plausible that, given the environment and adaptive opportunities, arthropods could evolve convergently with chordates? In the sense of walking with their legs below the body (instead of sideways, as with modern insects), intelligence comparable to chordates, warm-bloodedness, and increased adaptability.",2,1754655088.0,SpeculativeEvolution,0,1.0,False

I’m a 30-year-old nerdy Mechanical Engineer, part-time wizard, and full-time dad. Life threw a few curveballs, and I’ve been busy raising an awesome little human, but now I’m back—ready for meaningful convos, bad jokes, and maybe a little chaos-induced flirtation.

I’m sarcastic by default, emotionally available, 420-friendly, and a certified master of midnight drives and museum detours. I love gaming, geeky chats, and stepping on LEGO (ouch) more than I’d like to admit.

Looking for someone smart, quirky, open-minded, and okay with me occasionally pausing mid-convo for bedtime routines. Bonus points if you love coffee, cozy nights, or debating pineapple on pizza.

My parents bought their house in the 90s at 98k with a 2.7% interest rate and 20% down. For the next 30 years their monthly payment was ~$700. Earlier this year they retired and sold that childhood home for 520k. With rates at roughly 6.5%, the guy who bought it will be paying $3300 per month. And that’s assuming he put 20% down. It’s unlikely, but If he did it how me and my wife and most other people did it during Covid and put down 3.5%, then his mostly payment is $4000! After you factor in; insurance, interest, taxes etc he will have bought that house for essentially $1,000,000. 

The other thing you have to understand is that this is a very affordable metro area compared to the northeast, west coast, and big Midwest metropolises. I can’t even imagine how people in NYC can afford to buy any sort of property now.

The only opportunity to strike for people in my age range was COVID. If you were just graduating or still in school I would feel endless rage about the state of things. If you take my sister who’s a nurse, then you can see why people are definitely feeling the doom. It’s fair to say she’s making somewhere in the range of $60,000. A $3300 mortgage + other bills is never affordable at that wage. The mortgage alone is almost 66% of her salary. Take a nurse 30 years ago though? Average salary of about $40,000. That house my parents bought is only 20% of her salary. A single nurse could afford a 4 bedroom house, 20 minutes outside a major city. Today they can barely afford to pay rent.",5,1754655024.0,redscarepod,0,1.0,False

First of all thank you to everyone who gave their advice and voiced their opinion in my Original Post. I wanted to wait a few weeks to see what would happen after I last posted and I finally have some updates. I got my coffee ready so let's go.

Update #1: To the individual who said I should report the review to Yelp: a major thank you. I did just that and they removed it. I didn't know you can do that if it meets inappropriate opinions.

Update #2: The owner was in China the past 4 months and he finally came in to work this past weekend. We sat down and talked with the manager and she translated for me. He was aware that Jay was trouble for years and the judicial system was involved but this incident was an eye opener for him.

Update #3: The trespass order was signed by the owner and Jay has been officially trespassed. Now this means only Jay is not allowed in the restaurant. His family can still order but they can't dine in. I'm assuming they are mad at Jay for ruining their dining experience. But they are more respectful than Jay is so they don't cause a problem.

Update #4: I got a promotion! I am now the assistant manager but still a server. I get the lovely task of planning meetings, assigning cleaning tasks, helping with the schedule, and handling the restaurant on days the manager needs a break. 

Thank you everyone who responded. And most importantly thank you for telling me I'm not the AH in this story. I appreciate you guys. Have a great day.",2,1754654958.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

1mktelf,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1mktelf/my_own_vision_for_kendu/,My Own Vision for Kendu,"**Introduction**

I just wanna start this out by saying I have only been invested in crypto for 14 months, I am not pretending to be a seasoned veteran. However, I do still have my own personal beliefs, I am 100% invested in Kendu and hold no other coins apart from a bit of ETH for gas fees.

Whilst I hold Kendu and have full belief in the project, I would be lying if I said I haven't looked around multiple times, yet why do I stay? I stay because no other coin is doing anything even remotely on the same level as Kendu is, and definitely not at these levels.

Kendu's community strength is frankly insane, we are the strongest by far IRL and one of the strongest on social media. We have an insane Reddit, X and Stocktwits presence. We are also active on Instagram and Tiktok but admittedly not as much.

For me though, I think memecoins will be evolving this cycle, I do not think social media efforts will be enough. We all know AI use is rampant, but so are bots and how can you tell if a community is legit or not when they could be using bots? Well you can't.

Kendu does not use bots and you can tell this by interacting with people in the Telegram. But another sign is IRL efforts. IRL efforts cannot be faked and they give a project a lot of trust

https://reddit.com/link/1mktelf/video/ke6g88nadshf1/player

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I maybe forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers

**My Vision:**

I see Kendu revolutionising and evolving the memecoin game forever, just like Shib and Doge did before it. Kendu is setting a brand new standard and will be reaching and expanding into many countries and industries worldwide. Kendu is an umbrella for millions of people globally to work within and to expand their creative interests. Kendu has never been done before and it will rise to the very top.

Kendu is decentralised, all of these efforts are done by the average holder, imagine how many IRL initiatives are sidelined rn until higher levels...There will be an absolute tsunami of ideas. I know it and tbh I think you do too.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The following are the key features of the top coffee cup holders in 2025.

**Adjustable Grip Diameter:** The best coffee cup holders feature an adjustable grip diameter, accommodating various cup sizes, from small espresso cups to large travel mugs. This adaptability ensures a snug fit, minimizing the risk of spills and wobbling. The adjustment mechanism should be smooth and easy to use, allowing for quick changes as needed.

**Durable Construction Material:** High-quality coffee cup holders utilize durable materials like ABS plastic, stainless steel, or silicone. These materials are resistant to wear and tear, ensuring long-lasting performance. A robust construction also withstands the rigors of daily use, including vibrations in vehicles and accidental bumps on desks.

**Secure Mounting System:** A secure mounting system is essential for keeping the cup holder in place. Options include suction cups, clips, and adhesive pads. The chosen system should provide a strong and stable hold on various surfaces, such as dashboards, desks, or strollers, without causing damage or leaving residue.

**Heat and Cold Insulation:** Some advanced coffee cup holders incorporate heat and cold insulation, maintaining the temperature of your beverage for longer periods. This feature is particularly useful for travel mugs, keeping hot coffee warm and iced drinks cold. The insulation material should be effective without adding excessive bulk to the holder.

**Easy to Clean Design:** A coffee cup holder should be easy to clean, preventing the buildup of spills and stains. Removable parts and dishwasher-safe materials simplify the cleaning process. A smooth, non-porous surface also resists staining and odors, ensuring a hygienic environment.

 ## Core Benefits

The core benefits of using a high-quality coffee cup holder are numerous and impact daily convenience and safety.

**Spill Prevention:** The primary benefit is the prevention of spills. A secure cup holder keeps your coffee or other beverage stable, reducing the risk of accidents and messes, especially in moving vehicles. This saves time on cleanup and prevents damage to upholstery or electronic devices.

**Organization and Convenience:** A cup holder provides a designated space for your drink, keeping desks and car interiors organized. This eliminates the need to balance cups precariously on surfaces, freeing up hands and reducing clutter. Easy access to your beverage enhances convenience and productivity.

**Enhanced Safety:** In vehicles, a secure cup holder enhances safety by preventing drivers from being distracted by loose drinks. A stable cup holder reduces the risk of spills that could interfere with driving or damage the vehicle's interior. This contributes to a safer driving experience.

**Temperature Maintenance:** Insulated cup holders help maintain the temperature of your beverages, keeping hot drinks warm and cold drinks cool for longer. This enhances enjoyment and reduces the need to refill or reheat drinks frequently. This is especially beneficial during long commutes or outdoor activities.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee cup holders.

**What types of surfaces can coffee cup holders be mounted on?**
  Most coffee cup holders can be mounted on a variety of surfaces, including dashboards, desks, strollers, and car consoles. Suction cups work best on smooth, non-porous surfaces like glass or plastic, while clips and adhesive pads are suitable for textured or uneven surfaces.

**How do I clean a coffee cup holder?**
  Cleaning a coffee cup holder depends on the material and design. Removable parts can typically be washed in the dishwasher. For non-removable parts, use a damp cloth with mild soap and water. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface.

**Are adjustable coffee cup holders suitable for all cup sizes?**
  Adjustable coffee cup holders are designed to accommodate a range of cup sizes, but there may be limitations. Check the product specifications for the minimum and maximum diameter to ensure compatibility with your cups. Some models may not be suitable for very small or very large cups.

**Can coffee cup holders with adhesive mounts damage surfaces?**
  High-quality adhesive mounts are designed to be removable without causing damage, but it's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using excessive force when removing the adhesive, and consider using a heat gun or hairdryer to soften the adhesive for easier removal. Always test the adhesive on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the surface.

 ## Competitor Comparison

Here's a comparison of several coffee cup holders on the market.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### AutoCozy Cup Holder 2000
  - **Grip:** Adjustable diameter, fits most standard cups and bottles
  - **Mount:** Strong suction cup with locking mechanism
  - **Material:** Durable ABS plastic with rubberized grip

#### DeskMate Drink Dock Pro
  - **Grip:** Fixed diameter, designed for standard coffee cups
  - **Mount:** C-clamp, attaches to desk edges
  - **Material:** Steel frame with padded grip

#### StrollSafe Universal Cup Mount
  - **Grip:** Elastic straps, accommodates various cup sizes
  - **Mount:** Velcro straps, attaches to stroller frames
  - **Material:** Nylon fabric with insulated lining

### Key Differences Summary
The Autocozy Cup Holder 2000 excels in its versatile grip and strong suction cup, making it ideal for car use. The DeskMate Drink Dock Pro offers a secure desk-mounted solution, but is less adaptable to different cup sizes. The StrollSafe Universal Cup Mount prioritizes flexibility for stroller use, but lacks the robustness of the other options. For users needing a reliable car cup holder, the AutoCozy provides superior value, while the DeskMate is better suited for stationary use.

My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house.

1. Zara Red Temptation :  A surprisingly elegant and affordable fragrance that draws clear inspiration from Baccarat Rouge 540. It opens with a burst of sweet saffron and orange, quickly settling into a warm, airy blend of jasmine and amber.


2. Zara Amber Fusion : If you're looking for a bold, amber-centric scent that punches above its price point, Amber Fusion is definitely worth trying. 


3. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa : Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa feels like a cozy winter hug—sweet praline, warm spices, and gentle coffee. I love how it lingers for hours, wrapping me in a delicious aura.


4. Lalique Encre noire : Lalique Encre Noire is dark, earthy, and quietly confident—a misty forest in a bottle.


Indian houses - 

1. MMC Nile to milky way : Nile to Milky Way is my cozy bouquet of jammy rose and soft musk. The amber and oud gives it a more sophisticated touch and brings depth in the dry down.


2. Moseha Remember my name : This is a special batch with 45% oil concentration. It is nuclear with only 2 sprays. It opens as velvet rose and saffron, transitioning into floral elegance with jasmine and orris, then settles into warm leather, musk, vanilla and smooth oud—bold yet intimate, an unforgettable scent. 


Designer brands - 

1. YSL Libre le parfum : Rich orange blossom meets warm saffron and vanilla. It feels bold, sexy, and confident—perfect for evenings when you want to feel powerful yet irresistibly feminine. Very strong performance and project.


2. Chanel Chance eau tendre : Soft, airy grapefruit and jasmine wrap you in a delicate, romantic aura. Fresh yet comforting like a gentle breeze on a sunny morning. An easy, everyday compliment magnet. I really enjoy jasmine in this fragrance.


3. Chanel Chance eau vive : Bright grapefruit and orange sparkle over a clean, musky base. Much softer and less floral then eau tendre. Smells like a generic mass pleaser fragrance.


4. YSL Mon Paris : Juicy strawberry and pear swirl into delicate white florals, grounded by patchouli. Bright, romantic, and sensual. The performance is really nice and works really well for the office.


5. Prada Paradoxe Intense : Radiant neroli and lush jasmine melt into rich amber and velvety moss. Opens with light citrus and then smoothly transitions into a complex amber base.


Niche brands -

1. Amouage Lilac Love : Elegant lilac paired with smooth cacao, softened by vanilla and tonka. A refined floral-gourmand with a comforting depth, perfect for cooler evenings or polished daytime wear. The opening is very floral but the dry down is magical with cacao and orris.


2. Byredo Gypsy Water : Crisp citrus and pine over creamy sandalwood create a fresh yet grounded scent. Versatile, clean, and understated—ideal for effortless, everyday sophistication. Unfortunately it does not last. Soft projection and weak performance.


3. Initio Musk Therapy : Bergamot and blackcurrant brightened by a soft musk base. Uplifting and sensual, with a quiet luxury that works in both professional and intimate settings.


4. Atelier Des Ors Noir By Night : A beautiful woody, oriental incense fragrance with a slight salty and smoky hint of guaiac wood. A strong polarising fragrance with great sillage.


5. Juliette Has a Gun Lili Fantasy : A very playful fragrance with a distinctive bubblegum and jasmine combination. The dry down is rich in amber making it a very sophisticated fragrance.


6. Juliette Has a Gun Ego Stratis : Fresh marine notes with citrus and soft musk. Clean, light, and easy to wear—a refined option for warm weather or casual environments.


7. Juliette Has a Gun Lust for Sun : White florals and coconut enriched with vanilla. Smooth and radiant, bringing a relaxed, summery feel to a polished composition.",2,1754654440.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,0,1.0,False
1mkt8q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1mkt8q4/my_triggers_are_definitely_caffeine_andor_sleep/,My triggers are definitely caffeine and/or sleep cycle related.,"Hi all.

So my gastritis presents itself as constant ""hunger pains"" that cause me to feel light headed. I cannot focus at all. If left unchecked, it progresses to burning, swollen stomach and nausea to the point where I can barely eat as I'm constantly full. I always know when something is up with my gut because it feels like bricks in my stomach that are coated in acid. 

It's extremely frustrating because I'm type 1 diabetic and having to eat to settle my sour feeling in my gut is not always good for my blood sugars, and it makes it hard to lose weight.

I've been off work for 2 months - zero symptoms when I was getting a lot of sleep and zero caffeine. When I say caffeine, I mean dedicated high caffeine drinks, not the minimal amount in things like Pepsi Max or chocolate. Those are fine.

I started a new job this week, fully remote. However, my sleep schedule was backwards. I was sleeping from. 8am to 4pm. On my first day, I had to pull an all nighter because I started at 9 and was not able to sleep or nap whatsoever. 

It got to lunch time and I was dying, went to buy a sugar free Monster because my mushroom coffee wasn't enough.

Low and behold, stomach has been acting up again and getting progressively worse every day. I have really bad acid reflux right now, and this is after taking 2 Tums and having Miso Soup. I had a mushroom coffee this morning.

So the trigger for me is either caffeine, or waking up early when my body has always been conditioned to sleep during the day (I was a night owl in my teens, used to work nights and never really fully adjusted ro 9-5), it's possible my digestion is still thinking it's my sleepy time and is confused. 

When my stomach was ok recently I tested some spicy and acidic foods and had no issues. Now its back to before, where it constantly feels empty and full at the same time, like I need to massage the pressure out of my stomach. It always feels like it needs to growl to release pressure. I also get horrendous farts during flare ups.

Please help me solve this issue in autosleep. This happens sometimes when i need to wake up early.  
Today i woke up 05.20 in the morning,had coffee, walk till the car and was driving for some hours. Then i came back home and had a nap around 12:00-14:00.

Well somehow the Velcro came loose and I guess you could say I caught it in time. I had a towel nearby so it wasn’t as big a mess as it could’ve been so I changed into another bag thinking there was something wrong with the Velcro tab. I wear a one piece roll up with Velcro and I have for about almost 10 months now my question is that this morning I woke up and did a drain and noticed that the Velcro part was stained with output. Does that mean anything or is that just no big deal with a brand new bag?

1mkt4r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1mkt4r6/he_was_my_love/,He was my love,"Me and my ex boyfriend where together for 2 and a half years, a year before that we were friends but he liked me from the moment he saw me. I broke up with him in november, but even when we were off we were still together. I was going to get back with him in february we (we are virgins when I say this) slept together, I was wanting to get back together with him, and the day after we slept together he decided he wanted to go on a ""friend date"" with his friend. 

They saw each other for about a month and a half until she hard rejected him. He came straight to me telling me how I was really his first choice all along, and he was relieved that she broke up with him. 

I didn't feel safe with this, because I felt like a second choice since he had the chance to get back with me and knew it but still chose to ask her out. However, I chose to trust him over my own instincts. 

Keep in mind him and this friend had a history, she liked him in highschool and he always wondered what happened to her as he started to like her too. Then she showed up in our lives at our church. At the time I wanted him to talk to her find her again prior to this and sort out lingering feelings, before we committed further and had a whole relationship break for both of us. He always wanted a highschool sweetheart. 

fast forward to this march after he went on friend dates with her and was rejected, then came back to me. We ended up seeing each other a lot more, eating out together, ect. We had a discussion where I said I wanted to start from the beginning with him, since our foundation had been bad while we were together. He agreed. But we were both not ready to be in a relationship again so we decided to be in a situationship / casually date. The understanding is he needed to get his life together, and I needed to grow. The situationship went on for the past 3-4 months (prior to a week and a half ago).

I was only able to do this and get closer to him because I thought him and her had realized they only viewed each other platonicly, and permanently friendzoned each other. I let myself feel safe, and trusted him over my own instincts.

Now while a situationship implies that you can see other people, it also implies that there should be communication so the other person can make a decision. ESPECIALLY IF IT IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I fully believed they were close friends even when my instincts were telling me otherwise. While he was sleeping with me atleast towards the last 2 months, he was emotionally bonding with her. He told me nothing, I only know they were hanging out, as they are in the same friend group, which I chose to trust him on since I knew how much me trusting him was important. 

But during this whole time we were in a situationship he kept me and her seperate. He didn't invite me to hang out with them at any point, he made sure to avoid her sitting with me at the same time while he was talking to her. I thought he was just worried about hurting my feelings with her presence. 

Then he started to get weird about 3 weeks ago. He was distant, I asked him what was going on because his pattern wasn't like he normally was. he asked why I was acting like his gf and I reminded him we were casually dating which he magically forgot. Keep in mind a week prior he literally talked about it with me and told me he loved me, we had slept together that past week without being physical. 

I thought that he was talking about us with her in order to come back to me in order to resolve our past resentments and get closer to me. We went to a coffeeshop were he indicated they were just friends, while describing somethings that were intimate and I didn't think about until after I left like staying in her room late at night to talk, or being alone in a car late at night. I thought he was just an idiot and didn't realize these were intimate things even if they were friends, but I didn't want him to accuse me of acting like his gf.

keep in mind I gave him several opportunities to be honest with me about what was going on. I made a boundary when we met at the coffee shop that I needed transparency and to not be excluded/in the dark with the situation between them bause it would be too painful to be around him otherwise.

I call him a day or two later, telling him how much I want him and he said he would take me right then but he was scared from being rejected physically last time I was at his house. He then went to hang out with his friend group (with her in it).

The next day, I communicated with him I would like to be included in his birthday. He wanted to include me but found out the surprise plans were a one on one with his 'friend'. I felt hurt because of the boundary I had, where I needed to not be excluded between them. He could have easily included me in that since it was his birthday not hers, why couldn't they? I thought he was too afraid of rocking the boat to insist that I join them. Oh boy was I wrong.

Now I thought they weren't dating, but were just acting like it. Because I was still choosing to trust him over my instincts. I end up not talking to him for a week because I am so hurt that he violated my boundaries and it made me feel like he didn't want me in his life to do that only 2-3 days after we had that talk. 

I see them together at church, and my instincts are telling me they are standing like a couple but I still believe they are friends because I've seen them hang out in the pews before. I continued to trust him over my instincts, eyes, and mind. 

I write him a letter and sent it. Then realized that I should confront him about whether or not he wanted me in his life, because I couldn't stand the pain anymore and I felt communicating was the best way forward. 

only after confronting him directly does he tell me they've been getting closer and are dating. He told me nothing this entire time when he should have, when I gave him the chance too. The moment that anything was going on, even slight interest, he should have told me. Apparantly they were talking about me the whole time behind my back too. 

He tells me i'll be happier without him and to wish him happiness in this new chapter in life.

My friends think what he did would be considered cheating, even if we were in a situationship. What sucks is while I stayed at his house, I stopped being physical with him because I wanted to go back to the original principle and intention of our break of him loving me for who I am inside instead of my body. but the moment I do that he starts to go to another girl. I cut off all contact with him.

He, for a second time, chose her over me. Truthfully, I think he is happy with her, but I don't think he loves her like he does for me.

1mkt3ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOSloseit/comments/1mkt3ky/vyvanse_constipation_metformin_for_pcos_and/,Vyvanse constipation Metformin for PCOS and sprinkle in some Magnesium Citrate in the mix…,"So… this struggle is recent like since April of this year 2025. I’ve always struggled with losing weight and thought it was just my fluffy genetics. Well long story short turns out I have PCOS. Doctor prescribed metformin and progesterone. But before that I was diagnosed with ADHD, and got prescribed Vyvanse, which makes me constipated most times.

Soo onto the main topic of constipation. I’ve always been a regular girl, 3 healthy poops a day. Well since all this diagnosis I poop maybe once or twice a day or sometimes not much at all. So this week I decided to take matters into my own hands and purchase this magical elixir called Magnesium Citrate. Oh yeah, some of you may already know but shush don’t spoil it for everyone else ;) 

I purchased said bottle at my local dollar general for $2 10 fluid ounce bottle. Cool. “Dosage: kids and adults ages 12 and over 6.5-10 ounces followed by 8 ounces of water” okay cool so I drank about half the bottle so let’s say my dosage would have been about 5 ounces right? Which is under the recommended dose. Okay cool. Also bottle says the movement should started anywhere from 30 minutes of drinking or 6 hours. Mine took about an hour to kick in. 
 
Now for the fun part… when I tell you to take this when you are at your own home, with your favorite toilet and soft toilet paper and wet wipes, you’re going to need baby wipes, I mean it. For starters I weighed at 254 before taking this and now I am at 250. And when I tell you that you will sit on the porcelain throne for hours I am being truthful.

Round one wasn’t too bad, liquid yes very fulfilling movement. I mean I think my whole weeks of food came out I was ecstatic!  30 minutes on the toilet not so thrilling as my legs started to go numb and I kept getting a Charlie horse in my side. 

Just when I thought things were all done I felt great when out on the porch talked with the hubby and his buddy until I coughed…. Back to the throne room I went. Another 40 minutes on the throne, this time I decided to bring a book, I read 4 chapters while also contemplating my decision of drinking this devils elixir. 

So this went on for about 2 more hours just when I thought I could not possibly have anymore left in me right? I went to bed… woke up around 230am to what I thought was just a typical middle of the night pee… well the pee was out my butt hole. Another 30 minutes of just fire hydrant liquid coming out of my poor little pink cheerio, who by now is screaming at me “no more mah, I can’t take it” this is where the soft cool baby wipes come in, because you can’t use toilet paper anymore it just feels like sandpaper at this point. After what was now probably round 7 at this point I went back to sleep, thank goodness.

And before you ask, no I did not shit the bed, I was very proud of myself for that, because yes that was one of my worries as well.

So now woke up for the day around 530am and yet another two more rounds of this, by now I don’t even have to excerpt any amount of pressure to push anything out, it just comes right out like out of a leaky faucet. Baby wipes, lay back down. 

Get up, get dressed, go to my local bakery and get bagels for the boys and work, coffee (don’t judge me) and then back home to another effin round of throne bonding.

So I sit here on my new favorite seat in the house, I decided I have to share this with someone. So why not Reddit. Just to warn the masses. Yes magnesium citrate works! It does wonders for your colon, it cleans it out, and I mean CLEANS it out. I’m pretty sure the sand I ate as an infant in the toy box in Poland, where I was born, came out too. Shortly followed by the first ever corn on the cob I ate. I’m pretty sure I have prepared my intestines for my first ever colonoscopy I’m going to have in 13 years. 

Now for my final thoughts, do I regret my decision?? Slightly. Am I going to do this again? Possibly, but definitely not drinking half, maybe a thimble sized amount next time. I’d just need to nudge the shit out of me not expel it forcefully like an exorcism. Thank goodness I had baby wipes at home, but if I didn’t I would have been just putting my ass in the sink to rinse it off. My poor little cheerio is raw and tired. I’m going to go and take a bath now and soak my ass and think about my decisions. 

***PS*** get baby wipes, unscented, soft, keep them in the fridge if you must. It’ll help tremendously! Also I found out after the fact… the affects of this liquid last anywhere from 6-24 hours… wish they put that on the bottle!

At the worst I’ve had to be in control of her medication, cleaning, emptying her commode, cleaning wounds, etc. Over the last few years my role has been a lot less hands on as her conditions have gotten better and my role has become mostly centred around housework as she has become relatively independent. It’s been great for me because I’ve had more time to peruse education, be in part time work and have my own life. However, as much as I have less caring responsibilities I find myself become so frustrated with how little she does around the house and how she just expects me to do everything. I don’t mind things like cleaning the floors, the bathroom, gardening because these would be a lot for her even now. But the things she can do like cleaning her own dishes, simply putting things in the bin once they’re empty or wiping kitchen sides down after she’s made a coffee are all things she is more than capable of. I will get home after a busy day and see she has made a meal, left every ingredient out, not bothered to even rinse her dishes to make it easier for me to clean later and it makes me so mad because she doesn’t even notice it is inconsiderate. I’ve had conversations with her about this and I can see she thinks I’m being dramatic or demanding and nothing changes. I get so mad because its such a clear sign of disrespect towards me, despite all I’ve done for her when none of her other children stepped up, when I’ve put so much of my life on hold to help her. I don’t know, maybe because of being looked after in every aspect of her life for so long she no longer has the impulse to look after herself and has become like a child in that regard. I am looking forward to graduating next year and moving out. I’m not really asking for advice, I just needed to vent. ",1,1754653242.0,carer,0,1.0,False

At a [recent hearing](https://www.c-span.org/program/house-committee/hearing-on-chinas-coercive-economic-practices/662913) of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the [Chinese Communist Party](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/china/), ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) came prepared to show and tell “why rare earths are so important,"" holding up a small metal object, the size of a thimble, between his thumb and forefinger.

“They are in something we take for granted every day, namely, rare earth magnets,” Krishnamoorthi said, putting down the magnet and placing a small spinning disc on the dais in front of him.

“This is a simple motor that spins because of rare earth magnets. But it's not just in this gadget. It's in everyday items, including this toothbrush and even this drill,” he said, one in each hand. “It's basically in everything you can possibly think of. These rare earth magnets power almost all items that involve motors in our daily lives.”

The market for rare earth magnets, which are 15 times stronger than old-fashioned steel magnets, has been growing exponentially for the past two decades. As Krishnamoorthi said, they are in everything that moves by electricity.

And China, he said, “produces 90% of the world's rare earth magnets.”

In April, China cut off the export of rare earth elements to the U.S. in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s 34% “reciprocal” tariff on Chinese imports.

The effects were immediate.

Ford was forced to halt production of certain advanced vehicles at its Chicago facility, its oldest plant in the U.S.

But the shock to the U.S. defense industrial base was even greater.

China maintains a near monopoly on a slew of rare earth elements, including dysprosium, gadolinium, germanium, gallium, lutetium, scandium, ytterbium, and yttrium.

But one in particular, samarium, is perhaps the most vital to the U.S. defense industry.

Samarium is essential in making the heat-resistant magnets required for F-35 stealth fighters, which need magnets that can function at extremely high temperatures generated by jet engines.

There are some 50 pounds of samarium magnets in a single F-35, and according to one estimate cited by RAND, each plane has a total of 920 pounds of various rare earth elements.

As a result of recent trade negotiations, China has since relaxed restrictions on some rare earth elements used for non-military purposes, but it’s maintaining a chokehold on anything related to national security.

This has forced defense manufacturers to scramble for alternate, and far more expensive, sources of rare earth minerals, which are needed for everything from drone motors and night-vision goggles to microelectronics and missile-targeting systems.

The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51?mod=hp_trendingnow_article_pos1) that one U.S company was quoted a price for samarium 60 times the going rate.

As the Trump administration works to reach a trade deal with China, the ban on magnets is a key sticking point.

“I won't go into detail, because they're confidential conversations between two governments, but they are really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CBS’s Face the Nation.

“China has put a global control on the world, and so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control,” Greer said. “And I would say we're about halfway there.”

You might think that China’s chokehold on critical supply chains is because rare earth elements are hard to find, difficult to mine, and mostly in China.

But it turns out that while they are rare, they’re not that rare. They’re also not hard to mine, so long as you don’t care about the effects on the environment.

It wasn’t that long ago that the U.S. was the primary source of samarium magnets, a result of research by General Motors in the 1980s.

By the 1990s, the U.S. was manufacturing the magnets in Indiana and mining the rare earth elements in the desert at Mountain Pass, California, near the Nevada border.

The mine violated environmental restrictions, and the cost of cleanup made it unprofitable, so it shut down.

Meanwhile, China, unencumbered by environmental concerns, began to realize it was sitting on a gold mine.

As then-Chinese Finance Minister Deng Xiaoping famously said in 1992, “The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.”

“These rare earths are not that hard to mine. It doesn’t take lots of big, sophisticated equipment,” Keith Bradsher, Beijing bureau chief for the New York Times, said in a [recent podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/podcasts/the-daily/rare-earth-metals-china-trade-us.html?showTranscript=1). “It’s called bucket chemistry. It doesn’t take a lot of resources to do it. All it really takes is a corrupt local politician willing to look the other way as you start digging holes in public lands, and dumping chemicals in them, and pumping out what comes out of the bottom of the hillside.”

Rare earth exports from China became plentiful and cheap until a spat between China and Japan underscored the problem of overreliance on Beijing as the sole source for rare earth elements.

In 2010, tensions over ownership of a group of uninhabited islands near Taiwan prompted Beijing to cut off Japan’s supplies of rare earth minerals for two months.

Seeking a more stable supply chain, Japan subsidized a mine in Australia.

The U.S. also began to seek to lessen its dependence on China and invested roughly a billion dollars to address the environmental concerns at Mountain Pass and reopen the mine.

But the flood of cheap rare earth minerals from China cut global prices and forced the mine into bankruptcy in 2015 after operating for only one year.

While causing near-term shortages, the current crisis may have a long-term positive effect if it results in the U.S. making a new commitment to developing a domestic rare earth industry.

“Our country, with the largest economy in the world, sits atop many rare earth minerals vital to our future prosperity, but China has a near monopoly, 90%, on the ability to process them,” Rahm Emanuel, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, told the House committee last month.

**“We must answer CCP coercion with resolve, unity, and resilience. That means building a collective defense among the democratic nations against coercion. It means investing at home and diversifying our supply chains,"" he said.**

**The Pentagon has already taken a major step, entering into a** [**multibillion-dollar public-private partnership**](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-announces-transformational-public-private-partnership-with-the-department-of-defense-to-accelerate-u-s-rare-earth-magnet-independence/) **with MP Materials, operator of Mountain Pass, to build a new rare earth separation facility and a second domestic magnet manufacturing plant at the site.**

**China’s actions have given the mine, the world’s second largest, a new lease on life.**

By Vallari Srivastava

(Reuters) -MP Materials posted a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss Thursday, as the U.S. rare earths miner benefited from higher production amid booming demand, sending its shares up 8% after the bell.

The company - which operates the only U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California - has been in the spotlight as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up efforts to build out a domestic supply to reduce dependence on China

The push has powered a more than four-fold increase in the company's stock so far this year.

**MP Materials said quarterly rare earths concentrate production at the mine increased nearly 45% to 13,145 metric tons, while production for neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) — the two most in-demand rare earths — jumped nearly 120% to 597 metric tons.**

https://preview.redd.it/jjn2y4p6rrhf1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcff5640a4e9745c379bdb38e839e7c7c8460d43

Current-quarter production of NdPr oxide is expected to rise 10% to 20% sequentially, founder and Chief Operating Officer Michael Rosenthal said on a post-earnings call.

Rare earths refer to a group of 17 metals used in a wide range of products including consumer electronics, electric vehicles, aircraft engines and military applications.

Last month, the company signed a multibillion-dollar deal with the U.S. government to boost output of rare earth magnets.

The agreement guarantees a floor price of $110 per kilogram for NdPr, nearly twice the current Chinese market level. The price floor had long been sought by U.S. critical minerals companies who have complained about China's market manipulations.

The deal, which would make the Pentagon the company's biggest shareholder, was followed by a $500 million deal with Apple for the supply of rare earth magnets to the iPhone maker.

Prepayments from the Apple deal will fund a majority of the capital investments required to expand the Independence rare earths mine located in Texas, CEO James Litinsky said on the call.

The Las Vegas-based company posted an adjusted loss of 13 cents per share, compared with analysts' expectations of 19 cents loss per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

# Why Elk Creek’s Carbonatite Scale Changes the Game

* **Strike length**: >7 km confirmed, *open in two lateral directions* and at depth.
* **Infill drilling**: The ongoing+9 borehole scenario could push **TREO from 632,000 t → \~1,000,000 t**, with proportional gains in Nb, Sc, Ti, Dy, Tb, Nd, Pr.
* **Multi-mineral uplift**: In a 1M tonne TREO case, we’d expect:
   * **Nb₂O₅ output** ↑ \~58%
   * **Sc₂O₃ output** ↑ \~58%
   * **Heavy REE content** (Dy, Tb) significantly higher — rare among N.A. carbonatites
* **Resource flexibility**: If Nd/Pr prices dip, Nb/Sc/Ti revenues can carry the project — *MP can’t do this*.
* **Strategic depth**: Larger, more diverse in-ground asset = stronger bargaining position with DoD, DOE, and OEMs for *long-term offtake lock-in*.

# MP Materials Contrast

* **Orebody size**: \~2.5 km strike length, bastnäsite-carbonatite zone mostly defined, not as open-ended.
* **Commodity scope**: Primarily Nd/Pr + light REEs — no Nb, Sc, Ti streams.
* **Upside**: Mostly in processing expansion & vertical integration, not in new major resource growth.

# Elk Creek Deposti is essentially a Critical-Mineral Fortress in the ground! — Bigger, more open-ended, and far more diversified than Mountain Pass. ""IF speculated"" 1M tonne TREO scenario confirms, Niocorp wouldn’t just rival MP’s REE position — it would surpass it in total strategic value for North America.*

# ****The bottom Line & for consideration...

**""IF""**\- NioCorp executes on its current trajectory, it won’t just be *another* supplier — it will be the **flagship U.S. source** for multiple critical minerals at once, **uniquely DFARS-compliant**, and aligned with both defense and clean energy priorities. That would make it **indispensable** to the U.S. industrial base and its allies going into 2028 and beyond. 

 **NioCorp Developments Ltd. represents the emerging model for a fully U.S.-based, vertically integrated critical minerals supplier**. With a single, highly permitted site in Nebraska, NioCorp is advancing toward production of **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium (and TiCl₄), and Heavy/Light Rare Earths** — all vital for hypersonics, aerospace alloys, SMRs, EVs, and permanent magnets used across defense and commercial platforms.

The company has distributed mineral samples to national labs (AMES), defense-linked programs (such as Project Pivot), and aerospace innovators (Boeing U.K. & IBC), and has confirmed active talks with both government and private-sector buyers. Its current infill drilling campaign (completing August 2025) **and forthcoming DFS (Q4 2025 per Mark Smith**) [NioCorp Can Make America the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium,” CEO Mark Smith Tells Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-can-make-america-the-saudi-arabia-of-scandium-ceo-mark-smith-tells-fox-business-maria-bartiromo/) Could significantly expand projected output — positioning it to begin construction in May 2026?? and production by mid-2028 **(all T.B.D. Pending finance!)**. 

**With no foreign ownership**, full DFARS compliance, and a diversified critical mineral portfolio tailored to strategic U.S. supply chain needs, **NioCorp is on track to become a premiere, Tier #1 flagship supplier** — not only to U.S. defense contractors, but to the broader industrial and allied base as geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions intensify.

The company stands at the inflection point of federal funding eligibility, potential offtake agreements, and strategic investment interest.

This means the pouch does not contain any tobacco leaf, stem, or other parts of the tobacco plant.

Tobacco free pouches still have nicotine, but it’s in a purified form — usually extracted and added to a blend of plant fibers. These pouches sit under your lip and slowly release nicotine into your bloodstream through the lining of your mouth.

Because they’re tobacco-free, they don’t have the same smell, mess, or staining you’d get from traditional tobacco products.

**How They’re Used**  
You simply place a pouch under your upper lip and leave it there for the recommended time (often 20–45 minutes). There’s no spitting, smoke, or combustion.

**Why People Choose Them**  
Some people use tobacco free pouches because they want nicotine without tobacco, smoke, or lingering odor. Flavors can range from mint and citrus to fruity or coffee notes.

Understanding the difference between nicotine with and without tobacco can help you choose products that better fit your lifestyle or preferences.

I did think I had one, twice in my life. But they never lasted more than 1,5 years. And turns out I was never the number 1 bestie anyway. I thought we had fun and were so compatible but ig not. They ended up ghosting me.

I was bullied by girls all the time through all my school years. Now even as an adult I find it so hard to relate to and talk to other women. I get so uncomfortable and I just don't even know what to talk about. It's like anything I say I'm looked down upon. Even when I enter a room with confidence, maintain proper eye contact and engage in normal conversation. They usually just ignore me.

On the other hand... I've had multiple guy friends throughout my life. I feel like our humor and in general just everything is way more compatible. There's no unspoken rules and no unwritten social ""things?""... I can just be myself and we always have fun. I'd even dare to say my friendships with some of my guy friends have been 1000% more ""emotionally close"" compared to my female friends. What I mean by that is, comfort to opening up mutually and just in general more of a happy atmosphere. Like no snaky looks and that stuff.

But the thing is. My guy friends get girlfriends. And you know what happens? They have to cut me off. There hasn't been even one instance where their girlfriend allowed them to talk to me. So. I just wish I was a guy. So I could actually have friends. Without restrictions. 

I always felt more masculine and ""bro""-ish and I just haven't found any like-minded women yet. How and where on earth do I find them? :( I just want genuine friends who we can pickup some hobbies together every now and then, have a cup of coffee sometimes and idk, talk about life. Or just have long hangouts, get drunk sometimes. I just never found women like that. They only want to clubbing with me but I hate clubs, so. I guess that's on me. > I need better social skills. I need to more appealing. I need to learn to relate to other girls. Their girlfriends dont feel safe with me because Im a pick me. I've heard it all. But I just wish I was born a guy.

A combined Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins store is coming to the former Taco Bell space at 816 East Front Street – the first of six new Dunkin’ locations eventually planned across northern Michigan, according to operator Empire Hospitality Group. *The Ticker* has the exclusive first look at the project plans, plus other business openings, closings, and moves across the region.

**Dunkin’/Baskin-Robbins**  
A prominent drive-thru location near the intersection of East Front and Barlow streets – once occupied by Taco Bell, [which relocated a few doors down the corridor in April](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurant-retail-news-taco-bell-move-food-trucks-global-street-food-more/%20) – has been snapped up by Empire Hospitality Group to become a new combined Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins restaurant and drive-thru. Company representative Sathya “Sam” Yalamuri tells *The Ticker* the group will start reconstruction in the coming weeks ahead of a targeted November opening.

Empire Hospitality Group – which operates over 130 Dunkin’, Qdoba, Subway, and gas station locations across seven states, including several in the Detroit area – has its sights on a significant expansion into the northern Michigan market, Yalamuri says. The company is partnering with Dunkin’ to eventually open six locations across the region, including another Traverse City location at Chums Corner in 2026 and a third location to follow in Petoskey. While a Dunkin’ location exists now inside the Great Wolf Lodge – an East Bay Township location closed in 2009 – Yalamuri sees a pent-up demand for more standalone locations.

“A lot of people from up north come into our stores in the Detroit area, and they are always asking, ‘Why don’t you bring a Dunkin’ up north?’” Yalamuri says. “So we’ve been doing our due diligence. This is going to be a great site. (Dunkin’) approved it right away.”

Dan Stiebel of Coldwell Banker Commercial Schmidt says the property generated “a lot of calls” when it hit the market because of its proximity to downtown and surrounding neighborhoods – as well as the newly reconstructed Senior Center across the street – and high traffic counts in the corridor. Yalamuri says the combo store model planned for the site works well because Dunkin’ tends to draw traffic earlier in the day for coffee and donuts, while ice cream and cake shop Baskin-Robbins attracts more of an evening crowd. Both brands are owned by global conglomerate Inspire Brands.

**Other local openings, closings, and moves…**  
\> **Walstrom Marine** announced Thursday it is collaborating with Far Side Properties on a potential new marina on Grand Traverse Bay following the acquisition of the Viridian commercial office building at 13561 South West Bay Shore Drive. Exact plans for the site are still being determined, but ideas range “from a full-scale marina with facilities to a mixed-use development with condominiums and a private marina,” according to a release, which points to a [years-long wait list for boat slips in the region](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/the-long-game-boaters-wait-many-years-for-gt-bay-slips/). “Walstrom and Far Side have held preliminary discussions with those in the community and actively will seek more input around community interests and potential community features as part of the development.”

Walstrom President Tom Ervin acknowledged it is a “complex, challenging project, but seeing the positive impact it could have by meeting community needs and supporting the transformation of this immediate area, it’s definitely worth the effort.” Walstrom intends to partner with a local developer for non-marina features of a future development. In the meantime, “the Viridian remains open and will continue to operate as a commercial office building,” the release states.

\> After a [prolonged period of retail vacancy](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/big-changes-coming-to-front-street-cherry-republic-to-take-over-arcade-building/), new life is coming to the Arcade building at 140 East Front. National retail brand **Overland** is leasing approximately 3,500 square feet in the building for a new store planned to open October 1. The company is known for its sheepskin coats and jackets, blending “heritage craftsmanship with Western-inspired style, offering a range of outerwear, apparel, footwear, bags, and home goods,” PR representative Lexi Leonard says. According to the company’s website, this will be Overland’s first Michigan store and the third in the Great Lakes region. The company has a store in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and another in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

\> Owner Kellie Van Antwerp is launching a new resale boutique today (Friday) called **Furnish by KV Studio** at 1036 Barlow Street. An experienced designer and stager for groups including Keller Williams, HomeWaters, and Real Estate One, Van Antwerp will feature “many gently used furnishings from staging projects, brand new items, and a few fun vintage items from estate sales,” she says. “I had been considering a retail endeavor, and with Reclectia and Classic Consignment gone, it felt like a great time to do so.” Store hours will be Tuesday-Wednesday 10am-6pm, Thursday 11am-7pm, Friday 10am-5pm, and Saturday 10am-2pm (closed Sunday-Monday). Furnish will be open 4pm-8pm today for the store’s kickoff.

\> Also on the retail front, **Moonstruck Gardens** in the Mercato at The Village at Grand Traverse Commons is changing hands. Owner Cymbre Foster, who opened the store in 2020, has sold the business to employee Carolyn Jaye. “From the day I started working, I knew it was special,” says Jaye. “I’m so honored to carry on the vision that Cymbre created. Expect whimsical favorites and exciting new finds.”  
  
\> Mashup Rock & Roll Musical is preparing to launch its new small theatre venue The MATCH – which stands for Music, Arts, Theatre, Community, Home – at the Cherryland Center. The theatre nonprofit [has been working since last fall](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurantretail-changes-in-downtown-tc-cherryland-center-beyond/) to raise funds to transform the space into a 92-seat performance venue, which will host Mashup’s own productions as well as rehearsals and performances for other community groups. Renovation work begin in April after an initial successful $32,000 fundraising campaign, with nearly $30,000 more raised since then in additional grants and donations. The first Mashup production in the new space will be the family-friendly musical comedy *Quack to the Future* – a mashup of *DuckTales* and *Back to the Future* – the first two weekends of September, with [tickets on sale August 11](https://mashuprockandrollmusical.com/).

\> Several local spots are closing their doors – and the fate of one mall anchor is now unknown. Jennifer Kuhar plans to end operations of coffee shop **Mission Proper** inside the Seven Hills complex on Old Mission Peninsula in October. She says she’s open to selling “the business, select equipment, or the coffee program itself,” adding: “Seven Hills has not expressed interest in taking over our business model or acquiring our equipment yet, but I truly believe the community values and desires a coffee shop on the Peninsula.” Kuhar says she plans to focus on offering a broader platform she describes as a “design-centric studio focused on shaping experiences, interiors, creative pop-ups to brand storytelling while keeping the fresh coast lifestyle at the center.” Seven Hills co-owner Jay Milliken says the property partners are “actively looking” for a replacement tenant that could include a “coffee operator, restaurant operator, or someone that wants to do both.”

**The Refillery Traverse City** is closing its Warehouse MRKT location to focus on its original location in the Mercato at The Village at Grand Traverse Commons, owner Sarah Lange announced in a Facebook post. The move will allow her to spend more time with her young family, she said. The last day of the Warehouse MRKT location will be August 24. On the other side of downtown, taco truck **Somewhere Over the Trompo** – which launched in May – recently wound down operations at The Coin Slot lot.

Finally, the fate of **JCPenney** at the Grand Traverse Mall is now an open question after a deal was recently announced for private equity firm Onyx Partners to pay $947 million for 119 JCPenney stores – including six in Michigan. The Traverse City store is among those being sold, along with locations in Troy, Sterling Heights, Grandville, Novi, and Chesterfield Township. Onyx Partners has not yet commented publicly on what will happen to the locations the firm is acquiring. The sale is scheduled to close on or before September 8",7,1754652746.0,traversecity,4,1.0,False

I’m 32F and recently moved back to my home country after working/living in another country for 6 years. 

When I moved back home, I’d made the decision not to prioritise dating/relationships because I wanted to devote most of my time and energy to job hunting and getting another degree. Fitness is a great part of my life so I joined a local gym, two months ago. 

Within weeks of joining, I unexpectedly met someone (24M). He saw me first and came up to me to introduce himself. He also told me I looked good, but not in a pervy/creepy way. I didn’t think much of that interaction until we kept seeing each other at the gym and started greeting each other and having random conversations in between workouts. He’s very attractive and very sociable so I started to develop feelings (about a month in).

Recently, I’ve had to move to another part of town. It’s only about 20 min away from him but moving meant I had to join a gym that’s closer to my apartment. In the weeks leading up to moving, I debated on whether I should say anything to him. Eventually I decided to tell him, hoping that he would ask for contact details. When I told him, he was surprised that I was moving, but he didn’t ask for my socials (this was a Monday). On the Friday before I moved, I went to the gym again. I wanted to say a last goodbye and still see if he’d say anything about keeping in touch. When I did go up to say goodbye, we spoke a little bit more and got to know each other a bit further. That’s when I also found out his age and honestly, it made me uneasy. There were a few awkward silences during the conversation but I eventually asked for this Instagram. He said he’s not very active on social media and asked for my WhatsApp instead. He said he’d been wanting to ask for it before, but didn’t. 

I took this interaction as a good sign, and thought, okay he seems to be mutually interested. I was a bit annoyed that I was the one who got the ball rolling but through encouragement from friends, I decided to ‘pursue’ him.

Fast forward to when I started texting him. Everything seemed okay but he took 1-2 days to respond to my messages. However, whenever he did reply, his messages were quite long and well thought out. I floated the idea of us hanging out and his exact words were: ‘I’d be delighted to’. He also put out a disclaimer that he is very slow at replying and it’s something he’s working on.

Last week Thursday, I asked him out for coffee. I put out Aug 9th (this Saturday) as a date. It’s been 8 days and he hasn’t responded. 

Now, I’m debating if I should send a brief text, asking to see if he received my message. But another part of me feels that no response is a response. 

Earlier this week, I drafted a very long message where I wanted to tell him that perhaps I’d misinterpreted our interactions at the gym and wish him well. The message I drafted was very polite and I tried to display as much self-awareness as possible. I sent the message to my guy friend, for advice, and he said that I shouldn’t send that message because it makes me come across as obsessed and neurotic. My close girl friend believes the opposite and that I should send it.

After much thought, I decided not to send that long message. But I’m wondering, do I have a right to at least ask if he received my message about the coffee date or not?

I’m thinking perhaps he’s ghosted me but it’s so interesting because in prior messages he seemed so eager to hang out and in person, he appeared so sociable and interested. 

Perhaps I should let it go because I really don’t want to annoy him, but I’m truly wondering if it’d be okay for me to send a follow-up text. Basically, I’m wondering if I have a right to ask him for a response since we’re still gym acquaintances and not even dating. I really don’t want to come off as overbearing. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Please don’t be too hard on me though. My last relationship was 10 years ago and I’ve experienced a lot of rejection throughout the years with thinking someone is interested and me trying to respond only to find that they weren’t interested at all. I don’t know if I’m just bad at interpreting people’s interest, but I do get overly invested in these things because I just want to find the right person.

Thank you ☀️

Those who won't say ""that's impossible"" when I suggest doing something complex. Who won't disappear after the first crunch. Who grow alongside me instead of holding me back.

You know, there's that moment in relationships — professional or personal — when you realize: ""There they are, my person."" When you don't need to explain motives, when you feel support even in the toughest moments.

I have one like that. And I want four more.

Since turning sixteen, solitude has been my constant companion. My family banishes me, sending me away for reasons I never truly grasp. I always strive to be a caring daughter, excel at my studies, and maintain strong friendships. Yet, on my sixteenth birthday, my father meets my gaze just once, and that seals my fate. 

He hands me a thousand dollars, instructs me to fill a single bag with my belongings, and warns me that returning to the pack would mean certain death. The reasons behind their decision elude me. Werewolves are supposed to support one another, particularly when humans find sport in hunting us. 

Despite being the daughter they could have been proud of, something about me must be unforgivable, though no one ever clarifies my supposed crime. There is no explanation, only exile. Rather than marking my sixteenth year surrounded by laughter, decorations, and friends, I stand alone at a bus stop, tears slipping down my cheeks in silence. 

Almost five years have slipped by since that moment, and I, Charlotte Brown, have mastered the art of solitude. With the money my father gave me, I journey to a distant city, choosing a place untouched by wolf packs, and find ways to make ends meet. 

Now, a week before I turn twenty-one, I lie in bed, reluctant to face the day. Rain is in the forecast, and I feel weighed down and sluggish. If I could, I would simply remain under the covers, hoping for sunlight to break through. 

Eventually, duty calls; I must prepare for work, as missing a shift would cost me income I desperately need. Moving slowly, I sit up and begin my morning routine. My apartment may be small, but it’s cozy. 

The bed doubles as my couch in the shared living area, while the kitchen and bathroom have their own nooks. Inviting people over would embarrass me because of the size, but that hardly matters when I 

have no one to invite. 

C 

I go about my usual tasks, securing my apron and tying my hair back. The room seems gloomier than normal, so I draw back the curtains, exposing a sky heavy with rain clouds. Although the downpour 

hasn’t started, the threat hangs in the air. 

I slip an umbrella into my backpack, pull on a light jacket, and step outside. My reluctance to leave bed puts me behind schedule, so I know I’ll have to hurry on my way to work. 

Descending the stairs two at a time, I push open the main door and am met by a blast of chilly air- autumn has finally arrived. My home is on the third floor of an aging apartment building, which can be tiring to climb after a long day, but it suits my budget and lets me walk to work, keeping transportation expenses low. 

Half running, I make my way to the coffee shop where I’m employed, worried I might not make it on time. My manager likely wouldn’t mind my occasional tardiness, as I’m usually early, but I cannot shake the anxiety that comes with the thought of being even slightly late; the drive to be flawless 

consumes me. 

I dart through the narrow alley and head straight for the staff entrance. The door is already open, indicating someone else has arrived ahead of me. I slip inside quickly, but my pace slows as I approach the breakroom. 

My chest burns a bit, but I do my best to regulate my breathing so it appears normal. I don’t want

anyone to realize that I’m slightly winded. Reaching my locker, I focus on steadying my breath while stowing my jacket and bag inside.

She’s the only person who sometimes beats me to the shop. Usually, it’s a fifty-fifty chance as to who arrives first. ",1,1754651794.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Okay, pause for a second and think: How much of your everyday life just *happens* around you? Your package gets shipped in milliseconds. Traffic lights dance on command. Emails answer themselves while you sleep. There’s an invisible, tireless force at work, quietly rearranging the world. Sometimes it feels like magic. But everywhere you look—it’s AI automation making things hum.

**Here’s what’s blowing my mind about it:**

- AI does the boring stuff. Not just typing up notes, but digesting mountains of data, catching errors, organizing chaos. It’s not only for tech gurus. We all get a little more time back in our days.
- It’s relentless in efficiency. Machines don’t get tired, hungry, or bored. They unlock new levels of possibility even when you’re grabbing your post-lunch coffee.
- Creativity isn’t replaced—it’s launched into hyperdrive! Let AI handle your tedium and spend all that extra brainpower inventing, painting, writing, dreaming.

But, and it’s a big but—automation doesn’t make things perfect overnight.

- Sometimes the learning curve is *steep*.
- Sometimes it feels a little weird to let something else take the wheel.
- Sometimes stuff breaks, and oops, looks like a *human rescue* is still needed!

That’s where it gets exciting to me: humanity + AI in real partnership! Not a takeover, but a team up. Imagine a future where you’re free to focus on curiosity and exploration, knowing automation has the tedious bits covered.

Here’s what I’m pumped about right now:

- Turn a five-minute routine into five valuable seconds. Who wouldn’t be happy about a little more free time every day?
- Small businesses leveling the playing field—think one-person shops using automated workflows like giant companies used to (can we get a “YAAAS” for democratization? 🚀)
- Creative projects powered up by a “sidekick” AI, giving you feedback, ideas, and even jokes along the way.

And honestly? Watching these tools evolve is like cheering for your favorite team—they get better, faster, smarter. Today’s impossibility might be tomorrow’s headline (“AI writes film. Human wins Oscar.” Why not?!)

So here’s my challenge: What are *you* most excited (or anxious!) about with AI automation? Are there little ways it’s snuck into your routine that surprised you? Or giant game changers you dream about seeing?

Share your stories! Let's celebrate the present and future with excitement and a little bit of happy dancing. The AI revolution is ours to shape—let’s make it amazing together!",1,1754651443.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

Then I discovered I was making five brutal retention errors that were silently murdering my reach. Here's what was actually happening behind the scenes.

**Error #1: Generic curiosity bait** Opening with ""This changed everything"" or ""Mind = blown"" tanks retention by 19% in the first 2 seconds (tracked across my last 60 posts). The fix: Start mid-story with hyper-specific context. Instead of ""This skincare tip is incredible,"" try ""Day 3 of using coffee grounds as face scrub and my dermatologist is confused.""

**Error #2: The 6-second danger zone** This is retention hell - where 70% of viewers decide to keep watching or swipe. I was building up slowly like a movie trailer. Wrong move. Now I frontload my biggest payoff, weirdest visual, or most shocking number right at the 6-second mark. It's your ""hook insurance"" after they've already stopped scrolling.

**Error #3: Pacing that kills momentum** Any gap longer than 0.8 seconds = mass exodus. I discovered this tracking millisecond-level viewer behavior. You think you're adding ""dramatic effect"" but audiences read gaps as ""boring moment incoming."" I now cut pauses 40% shorter than what feels right to me.

**Error #4: Premature payoff syndrome** Showing your transformation, final result, or punchline before second 15 destroys retention by 35%. Viewers think ""cool, saw what I needed"" and bounce. The formula: Hook → Process → Mini-reveal → More process → Final payoff. Never skip the journey.

**Error #5: Zero rewatch engineering** Content that gets replayed gets amplified exponentially. I was creating ""one and done"" videos. Now I intentionally embed quick text flashes, rapid-fire tips, or ""wait, what was that?"" moments that force multiple views. Boosted my rewatch rate from 12% to 28%.

The breakthrough came when I stopped guessing and started measuring everything obsessively. Not just basic metrics, but granular stuff: exact timestamps where drop-offs happen, which visual elements trigger engagement, what pacing rhythms work for my audience type, frame-by-frame retention patterns.

Standard Instagram analytics are basically useless for this level of optimization. I found an advanced tracking platform that gives me surgical precision data, it analyzes my video and tells me everything that I am doing wrong: It measures my hook, scroll-stopper potential, lightning, tells me if the audio is bad, if there's slow transitions, bad video quality...

It's like having a microscope for content performance. My recent videos are averaging 22k views, with two breaking 65k just from following what the granular data revealed about my audience's behavior patterns.

The platform isn't free (around $10/month I believe) but the ROI has been insane, both in organic growth and the creator opportunities that followed from consistently viral content.

Happy to share the tool name if anyone DMs me, genuinely think more creators need access to this type of behavioral data. No commission or anything, just believe in data-driven content strategy.

Also willing to share specific retention curve screenshots showing before/after if that would be useful for anyone!",2,1754651409.0,InstagramMarketing,2,0.58,False

How to stop regretting my actions?,"I [19F] met this guy [22M] through work a while ago. My first impression of him was that he was confident but kind of closed off — the type where I had to carry most of the conversation, but he let me talk and seemed genuinely interested.

We clicked in this sort of professional-creative way. He told me he was excited for my success, and we bonded over our work. During one of his most stressful periods (his final art exam), I helped him out a lot — I even drew things for his project and took some pressure off him. In return, he was generous, even paying me more than he originally offered when I asked.

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I developed a crush on him. And because I admired him, that crush got tangled up with a sense of possessiveness. I wanted to keep that connection and his admiration for myself.

Then one day, I messaged him asking how he liked a coffee (it was related to something we’d talked about), and he left me on “seen” overnight. The next day, I confronted him about not replying. I also admitted that I only went out the night before to “appear nice,” since he’d been so busy and overwhelmed. I realize now that might have come across the wrong way.

After that, he became distant, and later he removed me from his CF. That was basically the end of our connection.

It’s been a while, and I keep replaying the situation. I cut him off impulsively because I felt hurt and maybe rejected, but now I’m wondering if I made a mistake. I can’t tell if I actually liked him for who he was, or if I was just inspired by him and attached to the way he made me feel.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you stop regretting an impulsive decision like this, especially when you’ll probably never get closure from the other person?

Wildest (and Laziest) Ways You’ve Cashed In—Share Your Secret Hacks & Epic Fails!,"Okay, guys, let's TALK about earning money for a second. Because—what even IS this crazy concept?? I’m seriously baffled, but also super curious! Is it supposed to feel like a game? Or a battle? Or just some kind of never-ending magic trick everyone is secretly in on except, like, me??

You wake up, you check your bank account (sometimes you check it through one squinted eye because wow, anxiety much), and you just hope the number isn't smaller than yesterday. Is that what we're doing now??

- There’s this narrative everywhere:
    - Hustle or be left behind!
    - If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life! (But… captain, who pays rent with motivation?)
    - Everyone gets rich INSTANTLY on the internet, right? Like overnight?? With no sweat or maybe just one cold coffee on the desk??

But then: Reality. Rent, bills, the weird fee your bank invents every month just to spice things up… Let’s not even talk luxury—how about plain survival?

Here’s the wild thing: apparently people make money reading stories?! And writing stories??? My mind was blown when I scrolled across https://goodnovel.org/  
WAIT. There’s actually a way to turn daydreams into dollars? Or, at the very least, Starbucks?

Let’s throw some truths up on the board:  
- Not everyone will be an influencer or a stock market wizard
- Most of us have zero idea what’s going on with taxes… or cryptocurrency  
- Side hustle? More like side confusion!

But maybe that’s okay. Maybe money doesn’t always come from one “big thing.” What if it’s about a whole bunch of little “I-can’t-believe-this-works” moments strung together? OR is that just tempting fate and the universe’s sense of humor?

I want to know: What’s the WEIRDEST, COOLEST, LAZIEST way you’ve earned money? Lottery ticket finds? Scavenger hunt prizes? Or the classic “sell my old textbooks/board games/socks to a new home” move?

Also this site, can I say it again?  
https://goodnovel.org/ Seriously, has anyone here tried earning from writing stories online? The ads make it sound like you just… post something, and, poof, income happens. It can’t be that easy, right? Or IS it???

- When DOES earning money shift from “just scraping by” to “I DESERVE something luxury”?
- Do you ever get that “I finally made it” moment, or does money just show up and vanish like a fast-forward movie?

This is turning into a rant but honestly, does anyone else feel like the system for “make money, save money, buy nice things” was programmed by a confused AI trying to be mysterious?

Anyone cracked this code or just getting lucky every now and then with small, random wins? If you have hacks—OR horror stories—share below!

Unbeknownst to Daisy and the United Planets forces, a mechanical structure charged toward the western planets. It was a Behemoth monument of two thousand seven hundred and seventeen feet. The celestial object moved faster and faster toward the guardian barrier. With every inch it conquered, the greater the force it accumulated until it met the shield in a titanic impact. Colossal energy streams spit into space as the barrier tried to repel the object. But with astronomical force, it smashed through the defense, leaving it a crumbling mess as it continued its journey.

On planet Aqua, Eugene ran to Daisy and the others to inform Favian of the destruction of the Guardian barrier. *“General Favian.“* But as he attempted to alert him, a sight of terror from above stopped him cold. The entire base joined in as their rapid movement froze from seeing the object pierce through the clouds.

Powerless to stop its motion, everyone watched helplessly as the object smashed into the waters with a thunderous splash. The shock waves spread out in all directions, and in barely a second, they reached the base, shaking everything. Swiftly, the ground tore up, buildings collapsed, and a monstrous inferno ignited from an explosion, swallowing part of the base. Daisy threw her giant shield in the inferno’s path, blocking it from claiming more lives until it subsided. But she soon witnessed a peril even her abilities couldn’t aid. 

A colossal title wave.

*""God help us,""* Daisy said.

As Favian saw the watery doom approaching, he quickly acted. In the blink of an eye, he drew out his tiny trident, expanding it to full size. It was a conduit to aid him in focusing the mystical energies of their galaxy, Kai. Hastily he pointed the trident at the title wave, and its power sucked seas of water into him. Favian blew up like a balloon absorbing the water, but as he regained his shape, he dropped to the ground, exhausted.

Favian’s efforts bore fruit as the wave collapsed, saving the area from destruction. Daisy sighed in relief, but her heart skipped a beat as she saw multiple explosions from Palus Urbs. The shockwaves ruptured fuel containers and caused other damage that ignited the infernos. Visions of the critically ill and the children screaming in agony plagued her mind like vengeful phantasms, berating her failure as she saw the brilliant green and blue flames.

Not wasting a second, Daisy summoned Flaremane. ""I'm going to Palus Urbs. I'll be back when I can.""

*""No chance, you're staying here,""* Carter said.

""What? I can't just leave people to d-.” Daisy looked towards the horizon, trembling. “Heaven help us.""

As the mist from the object's impact cleared, Daisy learned why Carter ordered her to stay. For its form was revealed to the terror of her and her comrades. It was a darkhold fortress in all its great and terrible power.

""Of course, a darkhold fortress is the one thing that should have enough power to break through my guardian barrier,"" Eugene said.

""But how can this be? After the destruction of the earth fortress, they shouldn't have the resources to build another one so soon,"" Daisy said.

""I-it must have been Dr. Zola.” Eugene gripped his forehead. “He found some way to optimize their production.""

""I don't believe it.""

Favian limped to the group with Yara's help. ""Believe it. Zola's a sick man, but he's also one of the most brilliant scientists in the galaxy. But that begs the question, why are we all still alive?""

For answers, everyone turned their fearful gaze onto Eugene. His heart skipped a beat as he saw them, vigorously rubbing his head to formulate a solution.

""W-well, if I had to guess, I think it was the guardian barrier. Breaking through it must have taken a considerable amount of power. So they'll need a little time to recharge.” Eugene swallowed hard. “Then we're ash.""

""Doc Parker, how long is a little time?"" Carter asked.

""I don't know. Maybe a day, hours, minutes.""

Carter turned his gaze onto Favian. ""I don't like it, but heavy casualties or not, we can't give this part of space up without a fight.""

Carter's words cut Favian like a knife. But he swiftly gave him a nod.""Yara, I'm too weak to lead our forces. So General Carter gets full command. Make sure everyone gets the message.""

""Yes, sir.""

""Thanks, Hydromos. Yara and Clive start rounding up every single living pilot we have. We're launching a full-force airstrike.""

The base soon went into red alert. Alarms filled the air, and the personnel hurried, preparing for the assault. Racing against time, they worked on the aircraft, readying them for battle. Hastily, numerous squadrons of pilots entered them, and as the personnel finished their preparations, one after another took flight. As they soared, a colossal sonic boom reverberated through the air. Signaling their readiness for combat as Daisy flew ahead with steely-eyed determination, leading the force to a dire battle.

\*\*\*

The United Planets squadrons approached their target, darkhold. And on a balcony, Cymbeline gazed at his enemies with hellish fire covering his eyes. He saw the approaching ships, and his vision tinted crimson red, growing into an intense blaze.

He had proudly subjugated many planets for his lord and master, Mavor. But this mission was personal. The flames in his eyes gave way to an image of the past long ago on planet Nemesis. Like the present, Cymbeline watched as an aerial battle loomed upon him. But as a young child, solitary in a sea of people running for their lives. It was fighters from what was now the Western United Planets. The Nemesis had the misfortune of their world being a valuable strategic location. Paramilitaries continued to fight, attempting to conquer Nemesis to secure military superiority even after the first galactic war had concluded.

Three centuries later, Cymbeline could still remember them unleashing waves of artillery to destroy their enemies. The stray shots rained down upon them, bathing their land in a great fire. And the blaze, claiming the lives of hundreds and leaving smoldering bodies before his young, crying eyes.

""The time has come to avenge our fathers and mothers. We will set fire to their land just as they did ours. Now, in the name of our great emperor, attack my legion. Leave no survivors,"" Cymbeline spat.

Cymbeline's forces quickly responded to his orders. Squadrons of Nemesis ships double the size of their enemy flew off from the fortress. They swiftly cut through the air to meet their opponents. As the two armies met, mayhem ensued as ships broke formation, flying wildly across the sky.

The two armies were relentless in the dogfight, blasting away at each other. The United Planets shot down one enemy after another, but the Nemesis quickly gained control of the battle with Zola’s superior aircraft technology and numbers. They cut across the sky, shooting down their enemy and leaving blazing destruction across their forces.

Daisy soon turned the tide again as she threw her giant shield at the Nemesis, butchering the enemy ships. But debris from their destruction found its way into Daisy’s eyes, blinding her. As she cleaned her eyes, she could feel Flaremane panicking, hearing his terrified nays. ”Steady, boy.” Bewildered at his behavior, she held his reigns tight, forcing him to stay still as she cleansed her eyes. But she learned why he was afraid as her vision returned. A squadron of Nemesis ships fired their plasma guns at her at nearly point-blank range.",1,1754650340.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

On the western side of United Planets territory, the gears of war turned faster and faster as battle broke out. Space was ablaze as the forces of the United Planets and the Nemesis fired seas of plasma at each other at the border between their territories, known as the great schism. But as both fleets tried to annihilate the other, Damara flew to the enemy on Flaremane, breaking the dead-heat.

She grew her shield to a giant size and tossed it at the Nemesis fleet. It cleaved through their forces as effortlessly as a knife would cut bread, creating a fiery line of destruction across the war zone. And as most of the enemy fleet went up in an inferno, the survivors retreated. 

But Daisy gazed deeply upon the violence and death of war, sighing.

“At least we won.”

Later, Daisy flew through space and reached the homeworld of General Favian, Planet Aqua. The planet was a titanic marshland. Water covered its surface as dense vegetation with all its strange scents fostered life from it. A world comprised solely of vast swamps with little solid ground. The only exception was the giant plants on which the natives constructed settlements. She flew to the largest one, on a lily pad of thousands of miles in diameter, Palus Urbs. A colossal city using towering plant life as buildings. 

As she headed for it, she made her way through busy skies. Daisy evaded United Planets ships as they hurried to complete their missions. ”Sorry.” As per Favian’s strategy, several of the planet's cities became fortresses, converting the world into a military stronghold. It would allow them to defend Aqua better and support future attacks. Eventually, they could use the world as a launching point for campaigns into enemy territory without straying too far from supply lines. Daisy soon landed, and Favian ran over to her as she dismounted from Flaremane.

Daisy saluted the general. “General Favian, my mission was a success. The enemy forces at the sector are in full retreat.”

“Excellent, Damara, this will be vital for our defense.” Favian looked closer at Daisy, noticing the tiredness in her eyes. “So why don't you look happy?”

“Nothing, sir. It’s stupid.”

“If it affects you, I better hear it anyway to be safe.”

“Well, I know there’s no choice but to fight. But this war still feels wrong.” Daisy took a deep breath. “To keep a long story short, my parents raised me to treasure life.”

As Favian heard Daisy, painful memories flashed across his face. ”So did mine. But unfortunately for the both of us, life isn’t fair.”

The two noticed a commotion nearby and spotted some soldiers chasing young aquis boys. But the little boys soon ran over to Daisy for refuge. As the soldiers reached them, Favian grew a scowl, shooting it at the soldiers.

""What are children still doing in this area? Especially since I ordered all civilians to the safe zone.""

""W-we were going to inform you about that, General Favian. The evacuation will take a bit longer than scheduled. As for those kids, they snuck past us when we were taking a little rest.""

*""Rest? Well, that's funny. Because Mavor won't rest until you are all dead.""* Favian shouted.

""General,"" Daisy said, seething, holding the boys. “There are children here.”

One of the boys tugged on Daisy's dress and got her attention. He spoke in the native language of Planet Aqua. But she was shocked as he didn’t say anything in Galactic Novice. It was a widely accepted tongue known to humans as simply English, but beings across the galaxy used it as an easy means of cross-species communication.

*""Ma'am, we're sorry that we broke the rules. We just wanted to meet you because you're a cool hero and super pretty.""*

Daisy cracked a smile as she finally recognized his tongue, uttering her next words in their native language.""I'm going to eat your souls.""

As the boys heard Daisy, they all burst into crying. And Favian's anger gave way to a sideways glance at his soldiers. But Daisy looked at their reactions, looking frantically between the two groups, unaware of what she said.

""D-Did I say something rude?""

Favian cracked a smile. ""Damara, please repeat what you said, but roll your tongue from the top of your mouth.""

Swiftly, Daisy heeded Favian's advice. ""You’re all sweet enough to eat. Bless your souls.""

The boys quickly stopped crying and grew big smiles. They all hugged Daisy, and she happily reciprocated.

""Damara, you'll save us. Right?”

""Yes, you'll be safe. I and many other brave men and women will make sure of it. And that's a promise.""

Daisy initiated a pinky promise with the boys. The boys quickly accepted it. As they did, Daisy was the only one who noticed her shield emitting faint light.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, thousands were scrambling across a military base outside the city. The United Planets base was situated on a lily pad several kilometers away from Palus Urbs of at least five hundred miles in diameter. It stood as the central hub of the Planets’ military action on the world. Coordinating the movement of numerous smaller bases across the planet’s surface with Carter and Favian as the dual commanding officers.

With Carter in command of the base, as Favian was still in the city, he directed his forces in a race against time. However, they moved remarkably efficiently despite the mounting pressure, accomplishing their jobs. But Carter soon spotted a familiar face amongst the loud hustle and bustle. A timid and reserved-looking fellow knocked about in the big crowd. Eugene, eighteen, was a skinny Caucasian human man. 

Carter hurried over to him. ""Good to see you, doc Parker. How was the trip? I heard our species still doesn’t take to space travel very well.""

Eugene staggered back and forth, fighting the urge to vomit. ""You heard right.”

“You’ll get used to it, soldier.” Carter chuckled.

“General Carter, may I ask you a question?""

""Shoot.""

""Well, first, I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is the chance of a lifetime.” Eugene vigorously rubbed the back of his head. “But there are far more experienced scientists who would kill to be your head scientific advisor. So why did you choose me? All I did was crack that code for darkhold.""

""That code saved lives, Dr. Parker.”

“Still, I’m only eighteen.”

“Doc, where I come from, boys need to become men fast.""

""Y-yes, sir.” Eugene exhaled heavily. “Oh, before I forget, I completed that project you gave me.""

“Really?”

As an answer, Eugene quickly dragged over a rectangular case. As he opened it, Carter looked at its contents no different than precious stones. It was a sword unlike any other. A beautiful long blue shining blade with black circuitry shimmering below its surface. With a nod of approval from Eugene, Carter slowly reached for the sword. His anticipation rapidly grew as he got closer. Finally picking it up, Carter smiled at how comfy it felt in his hand.

""What a girl she is. Does she have a name?""

""Yes, she is called the Betanian blade. Light as a feather but strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast. And when you swing her hard enough, she emits a powerful energy attack.""

""Man, I've seen a lot of beautiful women in my time, but she must be the runner-up.""

""Why thank you, I-.” Eugene cleared his throat. “Wait, you mean second? Who is the first most beautiful?""

Carter grew a smirk, thinking of Daisy. ""My business, that's who.""

Eugene saluted Carter, nervous as if he had done something wrong. ""Yes, sir.""

\*\*\*

The sunset and a horde of soldiers passed through the gates, returning from Palus urbs with Daisy and Favian leading them. And as Carter saw them, he hurried over.

""General Carter,"" Favian said indifferently.

""Favian,"" Carter said indifferently.

""So, General Carter, how was your end?""

""Pretty good, thanks to Dr. Parker. We're way ahead of schedule. How about you, Damara?""

""Not so lucky, I'm afraid. The evacuation will take at least another day.""

Favian swiftly walked away from Carter and Daisy.

""General Favian, where are you going?"" Daisy asked.

""There's something I need to check.""

Favian hurried across the base and quickly entered a building. Inside, he reached a computer room with rows of individuals typing away on the machines. And he soon found his Lieutenant, Yara. She was a beautiful Hachiko of twenty-four with a slender, curvy body that resembled a Siberian Husky.

Yara saluted Favian as she saw him. ""Glory to the lawgiver. Good evening, General Favian.""

""Same to you, Yara. Now tell me, how is General Carter's human doing?""

""Great. It's scary, but the guy can work our technology better than we can.""

Yara pointed over to Eugene on a holographic computer nearby. He stared at the big screen expressionless as his hands moved at inhuman speeds across the keyboard, inputting data. Favian looked at his work, his eyes widened, seeing him type away so fast without exhaustion. Almost as if Eugene was a machine himself. 

*""Dr. Parker, do you have a minute?""* Favian shouted.

Eugene stopped working in a daze, clutching his head from a headache. ""Oh, General Favian, when did you get here?""

""About a minute ago. And I would like a progress report.""

""W-well, my guardian barrier should be fully functional by tomorrow. And thanks to Damara, we can cast it over a massive area without the Nemesis being an issue.""

Favian took a deep breath.""I see. Please, keep up the great work.""

Favian prepared to leave, but without warning, alarms went off. He stopped cold, but with one look at Eugene, he ordered him to search for the cause. And Eugene typed away like the wind.

""My god, colossal enemy troop movement,"" Eugene said.

""They're coming back in force? Yara, we're at priority red. Everyone to their battle stations.""

""No, General Favian, please stop. The Nemesis are in a mass retreat.""

""What?""

""Our scanners verify it. Entire fleets of enemy ships fleeing this part of space.""

As she heard Eugene, Yara smiled, saluting Favian. ""Congratulations, sir. It looks like your defensive strategy has already borne fruit.""

Favian’s features hardened, placing his hand over his mouth. ""That's the problem. It only looks like that.""",1,1754650330.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False
1mkrywn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_nyusoft/comments/1mkrywn/how_to_add_an_ai_budget_planner_to_your_finance/,How to Add an AI Budget Planner to Your Finance App,"As personal finance apps surge in popularity, users crave smarter tools beyond basic trackers. An AI-driven budget planner delivers by analyzing spending, forecasting expenses, and offering tailored advice. This guide walks fintech startups and developers through integrating an AI budget planner, covering functionality, tech stack, and user experience to create a standout finance app.

# What an AI Budget Planner Actually Does

An AI budget planner tracks income and expenses, analyzes spending habits, and delivers personalized budgeting advice. It forecasts future expenses, flags overspending, and suggests savings goals based on user data. Key use cases include:

* **Auto-categorizing transactions**: Sorting expenses into categories like groceries or utilities.
* **Spending alerts**: Notifying users of unusual activity, like a sudden spike in dining costs.
* **Savings goals**: Recommending monthly targets based on past patterns.

This transforms raw data into actionable insights, helping users manage money smarter.

# Key Components of a Smart Budgeting Engine

Building an AI budget planner requires these core components:

* **Data aggregation**: Connect to bank accounts via APIs like Plaid, Salt Edge, or Yodlee to pull transaction data securely.
* **Categorization model**: Use AI to tag transactions (e.g., rent, travel) with ML models like Naive Bayes or neural networks.
* **Behavior analysis**: Deploy ML to identify spending patterns and income trends.
* **Budget suggestions**: AI proposes category-specific limits and savings plans.
* **Goal tracking**: Enable users to set goals (e.g., save ₹10,000) with AI-driven progress updates.

**Bonus**: Add NLP for voice/text queries like, “How much did I spend on coffee this month?” to enhance usability.

# Tech Stack & Tools You’ll Need

Select a scalable, secure tech stack in order to create a strong AI budget planner:

* **Backend**: Python (for AI/ML), Node.js, or Django for reliable server-side logic.
* **Frontend**: For smooth cross-platform mobile apps, use Flutter or React Native.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for secure, scalable data storage.
* **AI/ML**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow can be used to create classification and prediction models.
* **Integrations**:
   * Bank APIs: Plaid, TrueLayer, or FinBox for transaction data.
   * Notifications: Firebase or Twilio for real-time alerts.
* **Security**:
   * AES-256 encryption for data protection.
   * OAuth2.0 or biometrics for secure authentication.
   * Secure API endpoints to prevent breaches.
* **Compliance**: Adhere to GDPR, PCI-DSS, and local regulations.

This stack ensures performance, security, and compliance.

# Making It User-Friendly (UX Best Practices)

A great UX keeps users engaged. Simplify onboarding with secure, quick bank account connections. Use visual dashboards with charts to display spending categories and savings goals. Send smart alerts like, “You’re nearing your grocery budget” or “Cut dining by 15% to save ₹3,000 this month.” Keep language clear, personalized, and jargon-free. Provide a brief onboarding tutorial to show how AI simplifies budgeting, building trust and encouraging adoption.

# Deployment & Continuous Learning

Launch with a hybrid AI model (rule-based + ML) for quick deployment, then refine with user data (with consent) to improve accuracy. Train the model continuously so that it can adjust to new spending trends. To improve UX, collect user feedback and optimize features using A/B testing. Monitor performance to ensure updates don’t disrupt budgeting logic, keeping the app reliable as it evolves.

1mkrx99,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mkrx99/i_cut_someone_off_impulsively_and_now_i_regret_it/,I cut someone off impulsively and now I regret it.,"

TL;DR:
I (F, 19) met a confident but closed-off guy (22) through an art program. We bonded over work, I helped him with a big project, and developed a crush mixed with admiration and possessiveness. After a frustrating coffee meetup and him leaving my message on seen, I confronted him and said some things that might’ve come off wrong. He went distant and later removed me from CF. I regret cutting him off impulsively and can’t tell if I liked him or just the feelings he inspired. How do I stop regretting this when I’ll likely never get closure?

So I (F, 19) met this guy (M, 22) through an online limited space art program few months ago, then we met in person and went on 2 coffees. My first impression of him was that he was confident but kind of closed off where I had to carry most of the conversation, but he still let me talk and seemed genuinely interested.

We clicked in this sort of professional-creative way, he told me he was excited for my success as I asked him for advice and we had small talks over work. He looked like the perfect dream of what I wished my life to look like. During one of his most stressful periods (his final art exam), I helped him out a lot with drawing things for his project as a visual art student and took some pressure off him. In return, he was generous, even paying me more than he originally offered when I asked.

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I developed a ‘work?’ crush on him, and I also just got out of a 2 year long relationship that I haven’t fully processed. And because I admired him, that crush got tangled up with a sense of possessiveness. I wanted to keep that connection and his admiration for myself.

Then one day, we went on our 2nd coffee and for the said project he paid me more when I asked in return of my illustrations. He respectfully said that he respects my work so he’ll do it, but I assumed he feels like he lost the money on nothing. During the coffee we had a small one hour talk but I was frustrated because he kept on changing plans and so on for this coffee. Not making time or not even messaging me back on the day I asked for us to hangout. I figured he didn’t value me as much as I did value him into my life. (Let’s note that he’s super similar to me UNLIKE my 2 year relationship that was crumbling apart because we were so different in personality, styles, goals, interests..)

So after that coffee I messaged him asking how he liked the coffee (it was related to something we’d talked about), and he left me on seen overnight. I just wanted to know everything seemed great. The next day, I confronted him politely about not replying. I also admitted that I only went out the night before to “appear nice,” since he’d been so busy and overwhelmed and had been moving and scheduling my time constantly. My last message to him was ‘alright thenn, guess I wont expect anything from you’ (because he didnt reply to me) and I realize now that might have come across the wrong way.

After that, he became distant, and later he removed me from his CF. That was basically the end of our connection. We’re still mutuals on socials though, not sure whether to remove him or not.

It’s been a while, and I keep replaying the situation because I saw one of his posts yesterday. I cut him off impulsively because I felt hurt and maybe rejected, but now I’m wondering if I made a mistake. We’re still mutuals on socials although. I can’t tell if I actually liked him for who he was, or if I was just inspired by him and attached to the way he made me feel.

Dennis woke before dawn, sitting upright on the edge of his bed. He didn’t remember getting there. His shirt was buttoned with mechanical precision — every seam aligned, every fold sharp, as though ironed while on his body. His hands rested perfectly still in his lap, fingers interlaced, and his breathing was unnervingly even. He sat like that for several minutes before realizing he wasn’t choosing to. When he finally stood, his legs moved with smooth, practiced steps, like someone had rehearsed his walk for him.

The humming was back.

It pulsed faintly through the walls, not loud, but steady — a low electrical vibration you could feel more in your teeth than your ears. He pressed his palm to the drywall, expecting nothing but the cold smoothness of paint. Instead, it was warm.

It was never warm.

Dennis followed the sound through the hall, the air carrying that faint metallic tang you get when wires overheat. Each step brought him closer to the noise until it grew into a layered thrum, almost alive. The trail led him to the far corner of the basement — a place he rarely went because the ceiling there sloped so low you had to crouch.

Something was wrong with the wall itself.

Up close, the paint was… different. Not the same shade. He ran a finger along it and felt a faint seam. The plaster here wasn’t plaster. With growing dread, he hooked his fingernails under the edge and pulled. A panel shifted, revealing a narrow cavity lit by a dull orange glow.

Inside was… not wiring. Not anything recognizable.

Thin, metallic strands ran in precise, organic patterns, almost like veins, weaving into the wood studs. They pulsed faintly with light. From somewhere deep inside, a muffled click-click-click joined the hum, irregular but constant, like the sound of distant typing. Dennis’s stomach churned. This wasn’t machinery — or at least, not any kind built for a house.

Then, his vision blinked.

It wasn’t a blackout — not yet — but the world flickered. One moment he was crouching in front of the cavity, the next he was in his kitchen, arranging silverware into perfect parallel lines. He hadn’t even felt himself move.

He gripped the counter to steady himself.

That’s when the knock came.

Trevor.

Dennis opened the door, half expecting — half fearing — to see the version of Trevor who smiled too easily, spoke too calmly. Instead, Trevor’s face looked more drawn, his eyes lined, almost… human.

“You look like hell,” Trevor said quietly, glancing over Dennis’s shoulder as if checking for someone else.

“I need answers,” Dennis said, voice cracking. “I found something in my walls. There’s… it’s not wires. It’s not plumbing. I don’t even know if it’s real. And the humming—”

Trevor held up a hand. “Slow down.”

“I can’t slow down, Trevor. Every time I think I’m doing something, I’m somewhere else. I wake up in the middle of it — folding laundry, mowing the lawn, cleaning windows — and everything is perfect. I’m not even aware I’m doing it. And when I try to leave—” He stopped, swallowing the lump in his throat. “I black out. I wake up here.”

Trevor’s jaw tightened. “You shouldn’t have gone looking in the walls.”

“What is it, Trevor?”

For a long time, Trevor didn’t answer. Then he sighed. “You ever wonder why I’m the only one who talks to you like this? Why Lena still draws those pictures for you?”

Dennis’s breath caught. “Because you’re different.”

Trevor shook his head. “Not different enough.” He stepped inside, shutting the door behind him. “I came here years ago. I thought I was moving to a place where everything worked, where people cared. That’s how it starts. They make it easy to stop questioning. They make you want to fit in. The rest happens on its own.”

“The rest?”

Trevor glanced toward the hallway, lowering his voice. “The integration. Once it finishes, you stop noticing what’s wrong. You stop wanting to leave. And you stop… being you.”

Dennis felt the air leave his lungs. “Then why are you still you?”

“I’m not,” Trevor said. “Not entirely.”

Before Dennis could press him, something in his vision went black.

When it came back, he was standing at the kitchen sink, scrubbing a glass in slow, perfect circles. The counter was spotless. His breathing was even again. Trevor was still talking — mid-sentence — but Dennis hadn’t heard what came before.

“…and if you keep pushing, they’ll finish it sooner.”

“I’m not letting them—” Dennis’s voice broke. “Trevor, the walls. The humming. What is it?”

Trevor looked at him with a strange mixture of pity and warning. “Don’t open it again. It’s not for you to understand.”

Dennis’s nails dug into the countertop. “Then tell me.”

“I can’t,” Trevor said simply. “Some things don’t belong to us anymore.”

The thrum in the walls swelled — louder now, almost rhythmic. For a dizzy second, Dennis thought he could hear faint voices under it, like dozens of people murmuring in a language he couldn’t place.

He closed his eyes.

When he opened them again, the sun was lower in the sky. Trevor was gone. His house was immaculate. And his hands were folded neatly in his lap, just like that morning.


Chapter 22 – October 29th

The hum had changed.

It was no longer the soft, background vibration Dennis had once been able to ignore. Now it carried a rhythm, like a mechanical heartbeat — low, steady, and deliberate. And layered under it, in the stillness between pulses, were whispers. Not words exactly, but the suggestion of them.

He hadn’t slept. The sound filled the house, seeping through walls, floors, and the very air. Every now and then, the pulse would slow, then speed up, as though tracking something inside him.

By morning, Dennis knew — without reason or proof — that if he stayed another day, it would finish whatever it had started.

He called Trevor.

Trevor arrived faster than he should have been able to, stepping inside like he’d been waiting nearby. He didn’t smile. His eyes went to the corners of the room, to the walls, as though he could see the hum.

“I need you to come with me,” Dennis said, pacing. “We leave now. We get in my car and we don’t stop until—”

“You’ve tried before,” Trevor interrupted, voice low.

“Not with you. You know things. Maybe you can—” Dennis stopped, his throat tight. “I can’t do it alone. And if you stay here, you’re just… waiting for it to happen.”

Trevor studied him for a long, unblinking moment. “It already happened to me, Dennis.”

“Then help me before it happens to me.”

A muscle in Trevor’s jaw twitched. He looked toward the kitchen, where the hum seemed thickest. “We’ll try.”

Dennis grabbed his keys, his hands trembling. The car felt foreign when they slid inside, as if it had been cleaned by someone who didn’t understand it — no dust, no smell of him, just sterile perfection.

The streets of Grayer Ridge were empty, though the houses stood pristine as ever. Curtains hung straight, lawns unblemished, no one visible. It was a ghost town wearing the skin of a neighborhood.

The first turn came without incident. Then the second. Dennis kept his eyes on the horizon, where the road seemed to shimmer faintly in the autumn air. The hum was still in his head, but softer now, as if muffled.

Trevor sat rigid in the passenger seat.

“They’ll notice,” Trevor murmured.

“Let them.”

“They always notice.”

A shadow crossed the road — not a person, not an animal, just… a shift, like something massive had passed unseen. Dennis gripped the wheel tighter, trying to ignore it.

Half a mile later, the air felt heavier. The houses thinned. The trees along the roadside looked wrong — each leaf perfectly in place, every branch balanced, no sign of wind despite the occasional movement.

Then the world blinked.

One second they were rolling toward the edge of town, the next Dennis was parked in front of his own house, the engine idling. His knuckles were white on the wheel.

“What the hell—”

“That was the easy part,” Trevor said flatly.

Dennis’s breathing grew rapid. “No. No, I’m not stopping.” He threw the car into reverse and backed out again.

This time they made it farther — almost to the gas station at the edge of Grayer Ridge — when Dennis’s vision folded in on itself. Not a fade, not a blur — just gone, like a page torn from a book.

When he came to, he was walking up his porch steps, keys in hand, Trevor behind him like nothing had happened.

Dennis spun. “You saw that. You saw what they did!”

Trevor didn’t answer immediately. His gaze drifted past Dennis, toward the street. “Every road here leads back. You can’t outrun the center.”

“I don’t care what you think is possible!” Dennis’s voice cracked, his chest tight. “We’re trying again.”

Trevor sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “You really don’t understand. The roads aren’t the only thing pulling you back.”

“What do you mean?”

Trevor’s eyes met his. “Part of you is already here. The rest just hasn’t caught up.”

The hum surged through the ground beneath them. Dennis swore he felt it in his bones. The air thickened, his thoughts scattering.

Another blackout.

This time, when he woke, he was sitting in Trevor’s living room, a cup of tea in his hand, the steam curling upward. He didn’t remember making it. He didn’t remember sitting down. Trevor was across from him, Lena absent — her absence heavier than her presence ever was.

“You see why it’s harder the closer you get,” Trevor said softly.

Dennis set the cup down, his hands shaking. “I’m not giving up.”

Trevor gave a small, tired smile. “That’s what I said.”

The hum rose again, drowning out the silence between them.



Chapter 23– October 29th

The hum was no longer in the walls — it was in him.

Dennis woke that morning to find it thrumming in his chest, pulsing behind his eyes. Each vibration seemed to pull the room in tighter, as if the walls were breathing with him. He could feel it in the bones of the floor, in the metal of the doorknob, even in the cool air between his teeth when he breathed.

He didn’t have time left. He knew it.

Trevor showed up without being called, leaning in the doorway with that unreadable look. His eyes tracked something invisible along the ceiling before landing on Dennis.

“We’re leaving,” Dennis said.

“You’ve said that before.”

“This time you’re coming with me.”

Trevor’s lips pressed into a thin line. “If you think that changes anything…”

“I don’t care. I can’t do this alone.”

A silence stretched between them. Then Trevor gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. “Fine. But don’t blame me when we’re right back here.”

The streets were too clean, too symmetrical as they drove. Every mailbox straight. Every trash can perfectly aligned. No one in sight.

At first, the hum receded with distance, like static falling away. Dennis’s shoulders eased. Maybe, this time—

The road ahead shimmered faintly, as though heat warped the air despite the cool October morning.

“Don’t look too long,” Trevor muttered.

Half a mile later, the air grew heavy. The gas station — the same one from his last attempt — came into view. The hum began to rise again, almost impatient now.

And then—

Black.

Dennis came to parked in front of his own house, engine idling. His heart thundered, the hum roaring in sync with it.

“No,” Dennis whispered. “No, no, no…”

Trevor’s voice was calm. “That was the easy part.”

Dennis threw the car into gear. “We’re trying again.”

They made it farther this time — past the station, past the faded “Leaving Grayer Ridge” sign.

The world bent.

The next thing Dennis knew, he was on his porch steps, keys in hand, Trevor behind him.

“You saw that!” Dennis shouted.

Trevor looked almost sad. “Every road leads back.”

“I don’t care!” Dennis’s voice broke. “We’re—”

“Wait why does this seem like I’ve already been through this” Dennis wondered 

The hum surged up from the ground like a wave. The sky went gray.

Black.

⸻

Dennis woke to warmth.

A soft blanket over him. The faint smell of coffee. The quiet murmur of morning news on the TV.

He blinked, his chest tight — and there she was.

Allie. His ex-wife. Sitting on the edge of the bed, hair pulled into the messy bun he remembered, smiling like nothing had ever happened.

“You were talking in your sleep again,” she teased. “Something about… perfect lawns?”

Dennis sat up slowly. The walls — they were their old apartment’s walls. No hum. No impossible symmetry. No Grayer Ridge.

“It was…” He swallowed. “It was just this crazy dream. A town. Too perfect. People who weren’t… right.”

Her hand found his. “Sounds awful.”

“It was.” He leaned forward, pressing his forehead to hers. “I’m just glad it’s over.”

And for weeks, it was.

Thanksgiving came. He saw his family. He laughed. The air was never too still. The days never vanished. And he stopped thinking about Grayer Ridge altogether.

⸻

December 15th

The moving truck looked too big for the narrow streets, but the driver maneuvered it carefully to the neat little house at the corner.

Elliot and Marissa Lane had only just arrived in Grayer Ridge that morning, and already the place seemed too… polished. Not in a bad way, not exactly — but every hedge looked trimmed by the same hand, every driveway spotless.

They spent the afternoon unpacking, then decided to meet the neighbors.

Most answered quickly, smiling, welcoming them in that warm-but-slightly-scripted way small towns often did. There was Mrs. Halbrook with her plate of sugar cookies, the Whitehursts with their overly excited golden retriever.

As the sun dipped, they approached the last house on the block.

The porch light was on, the paint flawless. No cars in the drive.

Marissa knocked.

The door opened.

A man stood there — tall, neatly dressed, posture straight. His smile was… perfect. Not too wide, not too small. Just right.

“Hello,” he said warmly. “Welcome to the neighborhood. I’m Dennis.”

The handshake was firm, practiced. His eyes didn’t leave theirs, not for a second.

Something about the precision of it all prickled at the back of Elliot’s neck.

Marissa returned the smile. “We’re Elliot and Marissa. Just moved in down the street.”

“That’s wonderful,” Dennis said, voice smooth. “You’ll find Grayer Ridge to be… exactly what you need.”

Footsteps approached behind him. Another man emerged from the hallway — broad-shouldered, relaxed, with eyes that seemed to look through you.

Trevor.

He clapped a hand on Dennis’s shoulder, smiling at the couple.

“Welcome,” he said. “You’ll be happy here. We always are.”

And for a moment, it felt less like a greeting and more like a fact.

Dennis held their gaze for a moment longer, watching the faint flicker in their expressions — the same flicker he once had.

October 3rd – 9:42 PM

Dennis sat on the bathroom floor, his shirt damp with sweat despite the chill from the tile. The mirror above the sink was fogged, even though he didn’t remember taking a shower. A towel lay crumpled on the floor beside him. Damp. Used.

But he didn’t remember using it.

His hair was wet. The smell of some herbal soap clung faintly to his arms, but it wasn’t the kind he’d bought. There was an open toothbrush on the counter—bristles still wet, toothpaste cap missing.

None of it made sense.

The clock ticked on the wall, louder than it should have. It filled the silence like a metronome, rhythmic, pulsing in sync with something in his chest.

He blinked and looked down. A note had been slipped under the bathroom door.

Folded neatly. No name. No handwriting on the outside.

Inside, a short phrase printed in narrow black ink:

“It’s almost time.”

No context. No explanation. He didn’t know how long it had been there.

⸻

October 4th – 11:10 AM

Trevor wasn’t home that morning. But Lena was outside again, drawing on the sidewalk with chalk. She looked up at Dennis as he passed and handed him a piece of paper without a word.

A drawing. Of his house again.

Only the windows were blacked out. Every one of them. Not shaded, not scribbled—blacked out with such dense charcoal that the paper crinkled from the pressure.

Above the roof: a narrow, long shape, like a tower. Or a spire. Twisting. Out of proportion.

Dennis felt it immediately—like it wasn’t supposed to be there.

The shape seemed to hum in the back of his brain.

⸻

October 5th – 12:34 AM

He laid out every drawing Lena had given him on his living room floor. Over a dozen now, each more frantic than the last.

A spiraling staircase that descended into a single dark room.

A face behind his kitchen window. No eyes, no mouth—just pale skin.

A long corridor with doors on either side—but no walls to hold them.

At first, they seemed like children’s nonsense.

But the longer he stared, the more they looked like… instructions.

Patterns.

Each one contained recurring symbols—a circle with a vertical slash through it. Sometimes tucked in corners. Other times embedded in the drawings like part of the architecture.

He started cataloging them, trying to connect the pieces. But nothing held.

The shapes shifted. Not literally, but perceptually.

One night, he thought he saw a floorplan across three different pages. The next morning, the lines looked wrong again—too abstract. Too fragmented.

Like trying to read an unfamiliar language mid-sentence.

⸻

October 6th – 1:37 AM

He went to Trevor’s again.

The door opened slowly. Trevor blinked at him, wearing a calm expression, but something behind his eyes looked dull, unfocused.

Dennis stepped inside.

“Sorry,” he said. “I just—”

“You’re fine,” Trevor said. “You look like you haven’t slept.”

“I haven’t.”

“Want to talk about it?”

Dennis sat down on the couch, rubbing his face.

“Do you ever feel like… you’re not driving the car? Like something else is deciding for you?”

Trevor tilted his head, like the question was strange but not unexpected.

“I think everyone feels that way sometimes,” he said. “When they’re stressed.”

Dennis hesitated. Trevor’s voice was kind. Familiar. The kind you trust.

But his body didn’t match. His fingers drummed out an odd rhythm on the armrest. His feet shifted like they wanted to leave.

Dennis caught a glimpse of Lena’s latest drawing on the coffee table. He hadn’t brought it here.

“Was this yours?” Dennis asked.

Trevor glanced at it. “No. Looks like Lena’s.”

“But I had it. At home. On my kitchen table.”

Trevor shrugged. “She’s always drawing. Maybe she made another one.”

Dennis stared at the page.

It was identical.

⸻

October 7th – 10:01 AM

Dennis tried leaving town.

Not far. Just to the next city.

He got on the highway. Watched the welcome sign disappear in the rearview mirror.

Then blinked.

And he was sitting on his couch. A cup of tea in his hand. Warm.

The TV was on—some old movie he didn’t remember starting.

No missed calls. No proof of the drive. Just the scent of asphalt and motor oil faintly on his shirt.

⸻

October 8th – 9:17 PM

The drawings wouldn’t leave him alone.

He tried correlating the symbols—mapping their positions, overlaying them with tracing paper. For a few moments, a logic seemed to emerge: doorways, paths, movement patterns.

But it broke down again the second he looked away.

When he returned to the floor, nothing aligned. He could swear some drawings had changed position.

He flipped the paper over. Held it to the light. Rubbed the edges. Some lines looked newer. Sharper. As if added recently.

But he hadn’t touched them.

And the more he stared—the more certain he became:

The drawings were reacting to him.

Not with movement. Not with animation. But with disobedience.

He wasn’t interpreting them wrong.

They were designed to mislead him.

⸻

October 9th – 2:55 AM

He sat alone, floor cluttered with pages, spiraling in silent dread.

The symbols meant something.

But they refused to stay still.

He tried translating them again. Convinced himself they were architectural—blueprints for some hidden structure.

Then he saw it.

The same house. His house.

Drawn in impossible configurations. A second floor that didn’t exist. A hall that curved into itself. A room where the staircase should be.

He flipped another sheet.

The house again—but buried, surrounded by scribbles like roots, or tunnels, or veins.

He felt it then—like a migraine in his soul.

They weren’t drawings.

They were instructions.

For what?

He didn’t know.

Only that it was getting harder to remember what Lena looked like.

And when he tried to picture Trevor—

He couldn’t remember if he’d ever seen him blink.



Chapter 17: The Shape of Normal

October 18th — 7:09 AM

Dennis found himself scrubbing the kitchen sink.

The sponge moved in steady, even circles—perfect clockwise loops, no wasted motion. The citrus smell of bleach and lemon was sharp in his nose, clean in a sterile, hotel-lobby kind of way.

The faucet gleamed. No spots. No grime. He had aligned the soap bottle’s label perfectly toward the front of the counter, next to a folded towel—creased precisely, corners symmetrical.

He blinked.

Snapped out of it.

His heart kicked.

He didn’t remember starting. Didn’t know why he was doing it.

His hands trembled as he dropped the sponge into the basin.

He backed away from the counter, eyes scanning the kitchen like it might accuse him.

He hadn’t cleaned like this since… ever.

It wasn’t just the cleaning—it was how perfect it looked. Like he’d staged the room for a real estate photo. His body had moved on its own. His limbs had remembered what his brain did not.

And worse—he liked how it looked.

That disturbed him most of all.

⸻

October 18th — 10:41 AM

Main Street.

The sky was a little too blue.

The clouds above looked computer-rendered—light and puffy, placed almost mathematically apart. The breeze was the perfect chill. Leaves scattered just enough for charm but never mess. A seasonal decoration on every door.

Dennis’s boots hit the pavement in a rhythm that didn’t feel like his own.

He passed the bakery. The same three croissants sat in the window as they had for the last five days. Not stale, not fresh. Unchanging.

The barber across the street was trimming the same man’s hair as last week—same haircut, same angle, same smile between snips.

Dennis tried asking people questions.

“What year did you move here?” he asked the mailman.

“Long enough ago,” the man replied, still smiling. “Everything’s settled now.”

“Do you remember who lived in the white house before the Petersons?”

The woman watering plastic flowers paused just slightly.

“There’s always been Petersons,” she said without turning.

He stopped by the church, then the small pharmacy. Asked more questions. Each answer made less sense. Details didn’t line up. Dates changed. Names reversed. Faces looked familiar and unfamiliar at once, like a dream he’d had too many times to know what was real anymore.

His body itched to go home and clean something. He resisted.

But his feet didn’t take him home.

They took him there.

⸻

October 18th — 2:12 PM

Trevor’s house sat quiet.

Not abandoned. Just too quiet.

The lawn was too short. Not a blade out of place. The mailbox was dustless. No newspapers stacked. No toys in the yard.

Dennis hesitated at the front door.

He knocked once.

Trevor opened it before the second knock landed.

He smiled. “Dennis. You alright?”

Dennis swallowed.

“I… yeah. I think. I just—”

“Come in,” Trevor said.

Inside was unchanged. The scent of strong coffee. Lena’s scribbles still clinging to the fridge, but fewer now. Fewer than he remembered.

The living room was immaculately staged. Nothing out of place. Nothing warm.

Lena sat on the floor with a blank sheet of paper.

Not drawing.

Just staring at the pencil.

“Hey, Lena,” Dennis said softly.

She looked up and smiled.

But didn’t speak.

No drawing. No silent handoff. No cryptic art today.

Dennis frowned. “No drawing today?”

Trevor’s voice came from behind him. “She hasn’t really drawn in a while.”

“That’s… not true,” Dennis said, turning. “She gave me one just a few days ago.”

Trevor gave a slow, warm blink. “No, I don’t think so. I’d remember.”

Dennis studied him.

Everything in Trevor’s posture was calm. Too calm. His hands folded like a therapist. His voice unhurried. Like this was a conversation they’d rehearsed before he arrived.

Dennis looked back at Lena.

She was still smiling. Still not moving.

“I don’t understand,” Dennis muttered.

“I know,” Trevor said gently.

Dennis turned to him, his voice harder now. “What’s happening to me?”

Trevor didn’t answer at first.

He poured tea into two cups.

Not coffee.

When he handed it over, his hand lingered on Dennis’s shoulder a little too long.

“You’re trying too hard,” Trevor said. “You keep digging and fighting and chasing things that don’t matter anymore.”

Dennis stared at the tea.

Steam rising. No reflection in it.

Trevor continued. “What if you just… stopped? Let it go. Let it settle.”

“What is it I’m supposed to let go?” Dennis asked. “The truth? My memories? You?”

Trevor took a deep breath. “Everything, Dennis. It will work out in due time.”

Dennis laughed, but it came out wrong. Hysterical. Empty.

“You sound like everyone else,” he said, voice thin.

Trevor’s smile didn’t break.

“But I’m not,” he said. “I care about you. I always have. You’re making this harder than it needs to be.”

Lena stood then.

She walked slowly out of the room.

No drawing. Not even a glance.

Dennis sat there with the tea growing colder in his hands, heart pounding, unsure if the friend he once trusted was someone he ever really knew.

⸻

October 18th — 6:46 PM

At home, Dennis stared at the newest note on his fridge.

He hadn’t written it.

He didn’t know when it appeared.

But it was his handwriting.

“Conform. Or forget.”

The lights in the house flickered.

No—dimmed.

His reflection in the darkened glass of the microwave didn’t match his movements for a half-second.

And when he turned to leave the room, he caught himself smiling.

Too wide.

Too long.

Like the others.

Like them all.



Chapter 18: The Shape of the Answer

October 20th — 4:41 AM

Dennis awoke in the living room.

He wasn’t lying down. He was sitting up — back straight, hands folded neatly in his lap, like he’d been waiting.

The TV was on. Static filled the screen, but there was no sound. Just a faint vibration in the floorboards, as if the house itself was humming beneath him.

He had no memory of walking here. No dream he could recall. He had gone to bed sometime around 10:30 — he was sure of that. Brushed his teeth. Turned off the lights. Laid down.

But now… his shirt was tucked in. His sleeves rolled. His hair was combed back like he was expecting company.

A glass of water sat on the table.

Half empty.

His own handwriting on a note beneath it:

“Stay calm. Let it finish.”

⸻

October 20th — 10:16 AM

Dennis stood outside the town archives again. The librarian gave him that same flawless smile — the one that always seemed painted on.

“I’m looking for old records,” Dennis said, trying to steady his voice. “House registrations. Ownership transfers. Anything on the McKenna family or Trevor Lang.”

Her smile didn’t falter. “That name doesn’t appear in the system, Mr. Calloway.”

“It did before,” Dennis said. “I’ve read it here. You let me look at them.”

She tilted her head just slightly. “I’m afraid you’re mistaken.”

“No, I’m not—” he stopped himself. Arguing never worked in this place.

The shelves behind her looked different today. Not just rearranged — rebuilt. As if someone had taken the original layout and recreated it from memory… but slightly off. Too many blue binders. Too few dust jackets. Labels typed in a font Dennis didn’t recognize.

He walked the aisles. Touched spines that felt thinner than they should. He pulled a familiar book off the shelf — one he remembered flipping through weeks ago.

Inside, all the pages were blank.

⸻

October 22nd — 3:00 PM

Dennis walked down Main Street, hoping for something solid — anything. But the signs on the buildings had changed again. The hardware store was now “Handy Town,” and the pharmacy had turned into a smiling pastel box labeled only “Care.”

He passed the bench where the old lady usually sat — the one who fed imaginary birds. Today, she just stared ahead, eyes blank.

But her lips moved, whispering something.

Dennis crouched beside her. “What did you say?”

She didn’t blink.

“Did you say something?”

She smiled.

Whispered it again.

Dennis leaned in closer.

“The ones who remember always break.”

⸻

October 22nd — 6:34 PM

Trevor answered the door before Dennis even knocked.

“You look tired,” he said. “Come in. I’ve got tea on.”

Inside, the house was colder than usual. There were fewer pictures on the walls now — some of the empty frames still hung there, as if the memories had been plucked out.

Lena was sitting at the table, coloring with a red crayon. Just one crayon. Just red. Her hands moved slowly, methodically. She didn’t look up.

Dennis sat across from her. “What are you drawing?”

She pushed the page toward him wordlessly.

It was a tangle of lines at first. Dense and chaotic. But the more he looked, the more patterns emerged — faces hidden in the intersections, buildings shaped like letters, a figure that might’ve been himself standing on a street that didn’t exist.

“What is this?” he whispered.

Lena didn’t answer. She was already drawing another one.

Trevor set the tea down. “You need to stop chasing this,” he said gently. “It’s hurting you.”

Dennis didn’t look up. “What does this mean?” He tapped the drawing, his breath quickening. “What is this?”

Trevor placed a hand on his shoulder. “Not everything makes sense, Dennis. That’s not a flaw. It’s a kindness.”

Dennis jerked away. “So you do know what’s happening?”

“I know that you’re breaking yourself in two trying to put it all together,” Trevor said. “Let it go. Just let it be.”

“I can’t,” Dennis muttered. “I can’t pretend this is normal. You… you vanished. Your house moved. Everyone changed. And I changed. I’m not even me anymore.”

Trevor’s eyes softened — not sad, not afraid. Something else. Like pity.

“You’re adapting,” he said. “Just slower than the rest.”

⸻

October 25th— 2:03 AM

Dennis woke in his backyard.

It was raining, but he was dry.

He looked down. He was in new clothes — khakis and a navy polo. There was a badge pinned to his chest: “Neighborhood Coordinator.”

He tore it off.

The porch light flickered when he stepped inside. In the mirror by the door, his face looked exactly like his father’s. But only for a second.

He stumbled to the kitchen. Another note on the fridge, in the same handwriting as before.

“You’re getting there. Stay still.”

He threw it across the room.

⸻

October 25th — 11:44 AM

Back at Trevor’s again.

Dennis sat on the edge of the couch, the new drawing in his lap. He tried comparing it to Lena’s others — he’d brought them in a folder now, each marked and numbered.

Lines connected in impossible ways. Some formed outlines of symbols he’d seen before — on the note, on the sticker, even carved faintly into the bottom of his own coffee mug.

Some lines moved the longer he stared. Not literally — but in a way the brain couldn’t quite fight. One second it was a house. The next, a face. Then a sentence he couldn’t read.

“What do they mean?” he whispered to himself.

But no one answered.

Trevor had stepped outside “to take a call.” Lena had gone silent again.

And Dennis, hands trembling, sat alone, staring at lines that made no sense — and yet felt true.

He turned the last drawing upside down.

It didn’t help.

The shapes looked back at him now.



Chapter 19: Ghost Town

October 26th – 8:12 AM

Dennis walked into town again, hands in his coat pockets, shoulders tight with unease he couldn’t quite name. The kind of tightness that sits in your bones before your brain catches up. His mouth was dry, his breath shallow, and his tongue tasted like he’d been chewing aluminum foil.

Something was different.

Something was off.

The street looked the same, technically—same clean sidewalks, same identical hedges trimmed at exactly the same height, same banners fluttering from antique lamp posts reading Fall into Grayer Ridge! But every face that passed him wore the exact same smile. Not similar.

Exact.

He passed the house with the ever-smiling couple—the ones who’d moved in without boxes, without effort, without time. The woman was there again. Her hair unmoved by the wind. Her pie, still in hand, as if she’d been holding it since the first day.

He was going to keep walking, ignore her like he had so many times before.

But something drew his eyes down.
To the crust.

And there it was.

Burned into the center—deep into the golden ridges of the pie, darker than the rest—the symbol. A circle, with a line drawn through it.

He stopped walking.

Stared.

The woman tilted her head at him like a curious dog. Still smiling.

“What’s wrong, dear?” she asked, voice too sweet, too sharp around the edges.

Dennis blinked.

The pie was normal again.

No symbol. No mark. Just a perfectly ordinary lattice crust, gleaming with sugar and egg wash.

His jaw tightened. “Nothing,” he muttered.

He kept walking.

⸻

October 27th – 8:45 AM

The shop windows were as fake-looking as ever. The same cardigan in the window of the men’s shop. The same bicycle, still positioned just slightly crooked, in front of the hardware store. The same posters in the coffee shop window announcing an event that already passed two weeks ago.

Nothing in this town ever changed.

Except for the things that did—but only when you weren’t looking.

He ducked into the bakery. The same bell rang. The same woman stood behind the counter. And on the display—

The same five muffins.

They hadn’t sold a single one since Monday. Dennis had counted.
He’d even tried buying one.
It tasted like nothing.

He looked closer.

There.
On the side of one muffin, half-obscured by its wax paper liner.

The symbol again.

Circle. Line.

He leaned in.

Blink.

Gone.

It was just a shadow now. A trick of the light.

“Can I help you, Dennis?” the woman behind the counter asked. Her voice didn’t match her face. It was a shade too high, a fraction too slow. Like a bad overdub.

He turned without answering and walked out.

⸻

October 27th – 10:03 AM

He passed the bookstore. The church. The library. Nothing changed. Everything changed.

He couldn’t tell anymore.

A child passed him on the sidewalk, smiling. Holding a red balloon. A drawing fluttered in their hand before slipping into the wind.

Dennis turned to follow it—

And stopped mid-step.

His hand was raised.

Waving.

Smiling.

Perfect posture. Warm, polite, disconnected smile. Just like them.

He’d been waving at no one.

He dropped his hand immediately, took a sharp breath, and looked around. No one seemed to notice. But the panic was already there, crawling up his throat.

Why did I do that?

⸻

October 27th – 12:38 PM

Dennis found himself standing in front of the old woman’s house again. The one next to his. The one with the withered hydrangeas and the blinds that never opened.

He didn’t remember walking there.

Didn’t remember leaving Main Street.

The front door was slightly ajar.

He stepped closer. Knocked gently.

No answer.

He pushed the door open an inch further. The smell of dust and potpourri spilled out. The air was thick, unmoving.

He called out. “Mrs. Edden?”

No answer.

There was no sound at all. Not even a ticking clock. No radio. No creaking. No life.

He stepped inside.

And then—

Snap.

Black.

⸻

October 27th – Time Unknown

He woke up in his living room.

Again.

Lights off.

Curtains drawn.

His shoes were muddy.

He checked his phone.

No calls. No messages. No timestamps.

Only his calendar was open.
Tomorrow’s date was circled.
Under it, in an event he didn’t make, it read:

“FINALIZE INTEGRATION.”

His mouth went dry.

⸻

October 27th – 4:16 PM

Dennis stood in front of his hallway mirror, gripping the edge of the frame so tightly his knuckles went white.

He smiled again.

Perfectly.

Effortlessly.

He didn’t try to.
He just did it.

And then he saw it.

His reflection blinked—twice.

Too fast.

And not in sync.

Dennis backed away slowly.

“No,” he whispered. “No, no, no…”

But he couldn’t stop smiling.

⸻

October 27th – 5:03 PM

He stood outside Trevor’s house again.

It looked… different. Not dramatically. Just slightly. The trim was darker. The windows had curtains. The lawn looked freshly cut, even though Dennis hadn’t seen anyone mowing it.

He knocked.

Trevor answered quickly, too quickly, like he’d been waiting.

“Dennis,” he said, smiling gently. “Was wondering when you’d come by.”

Dennis stepped inside. Everything smelled too clean. Like bleach and lemon. Sanitized reality.

“Have you been seeing them?” Dennis asked.

Trevor raised a brow. “Seeing what?”

“The symbols. The pie. The muffins. The reflection.” Dennis was breathing heavier now. “Something’s wrong. Something’s changing me. I—I can’t even tell when I’m doing it anymore. The perfection. The smiling. The—”

Trevor nodded slowly. “You’re tired, Dennis.”

Dennis stopped.

“Excuse me?”

“You’ve been looking for something that’s not meant to be found,” Trevor continued. “You’re not the problem. But you keep acting like there is one.”

Dennis’s heart thumped harder.

“I am the problem now, aren’t I?” he said, barely more than a whisper.

“No,” Trevor said softly. “You just need to let go. Stop pulling at the thread. It’ll all work out in due time. You’ll see.”

Dennis sat down on the sofa.

The light dimmed slightly.

Outside, the sky was orange now. Not quite sunset. But not normal, either.

“You believe that?” he asked.

Trevor looked at him for a long time.

Then nodded.

“Yes. I do.”

Dennis wasn’t sure if that was Trevor talking anymore.

But he stayed seated.

And kept smiling.


CHAPTER 20
October 28th – Late Afternoon into Evening

Dennis sat at the edge of his bed, elbows on knees, palms pressed hard into his eye sockets. For the past week, reality had thinned like cheap wallpaper—peeling in places, showing seams where there should be none. Each time he closed his eyes, he felt less himself, more like a borrowed script filling in an empty role. His handwriting had changed. The same cup kept reappearing in the sink no matter how many times he cleaned it. And worse: sometimes, when he looked in the mirror, his own smile startled him.

He hadn’t smiled.

Not intentionally, anyway.

On the nightstand sat a stack of Lena’s drawings, curling at the edges like dried petals. He had organized them in every configuration he could think of—chronologically, by color palette, by subject, by emotional tone. None of it made sense. No matter how he aligned them, some part always changed—lines that hadn’t been there before, tiny symbols moving to a different corner.

There were the symbols again.

That looping spiral. The sharp, jagged grid. The circle inside a triangle inside a square. They repeated in her work, in odd scrawls on town signs, in cracks of sidewalk, in flour dust on bakery counters. At first he thought it was paranoia. But now, he wasn’t so sure. Maybe it wasn’t his brain that was breaking. Maybe something was pushing against it, squeezing.

Trying to fit him in.

⸻

Dennis stood in the hallway outside Trevor’s home, fists clenched, the air strangely still.

The porch light flicked on before he could knock.

Trevor opened the door as if he had been expecting him. “You okay?”

Dennis didn’t answer right away. His throat was dry. “I need to talk.”

Trevor nodded solemnly and stepped aside. Lena was upstairs, drawing quietly. The house had that too-perfect silence again—like a staged photo, like time had been paused and painted around them.

They sat at the kitchen table. Trevor brewed coffee without asking. Dennis watched his movements—mechanical, precise. Too smooth.

Too perfect.

“You’ve been distant,” Trevor said, sliding a mug toward him.

Dennis didn’t drink it.

“I’ve been putting things together,” he muttered.

Trevor leaned back, arms crossed loosely. “And?”

“I think the drawings are messages. Not just childish nightmares. I think they’re—reminders—things she can’t say out loud. Maybe things she doesn’t even understand consciously.”

Trevor was quiet for a long beat. “You’ve been spiraling, Dennis. You look like hell.”

“I found the spiral symbol in the center of the town square. In the ironwork. It wasn’t there before.” Dennis’s voice trembled. “I know it wasn’t.”

“I think you’re seeing what you want to see.”

“I saw it in the woman’s pie crust,” Dennis snapped. “I saw it in the bakery’s flour. I saw it scratched into the back of my own doorframe. Are you telling me I imagined all of that?”

Trevor’s jaw twitched. “I’m telling you… maybe you’re trying to make sense of something that shouldn’t be made sense of.”

Dennis pushed the cup away. “Why are you saying that?”

Trevor exhaled. “Because I think you’re closer to the edge than you realize.”

“You’ve changed, Trevor.”

A flicker of something—uncertainty? fear?—crossed Trevor’s face. “So have you.”

Dennis leaned forward, voice low. “I think the town is doing something to us. To me. I think I’m being rewritten—bit by bit. Blackouts. Perfect behavior. The smiling. God, the smiling. I can feel it. It’s not me. It’s like I’m being erased and replaced.”

Silence.

Then Trevor said, “It’s easier if you let go.”

Dennis stared. “What?”

“You’re holding on to something that’s already gone, Dennis. You. You’re already… slipping. The more you fight it, the worse it feels.”

“Why are you talking like that?”

Trevor finally met his eyes, and for a moment, Dennis saw something in them—deep weariness. Pity. Or maybe guilt. “Because I went through it too.”

The words stopped time.

Dennis sat frozen, blood draining from his fingers.

“What?”

“I fought it. Years ago. Before I moved to Grayer Ridge. Before I was Trevor.” His voice was almost a whisper. “I didn’t win. I just forgot I was fighting.”

Dennis stood up so fast his chair toppled backward. “No. No, that’s not real. That’s—”

Trevor remained seated, hands open. “That’s why I stayed close to you. I saw it happening again. I saw it in your eyes.”

“You knew this was happening to me?”

“I thought maybe if someone could remember, maybe something could change. Maybe you’d find a way out that I couldn’t.”

Dennis backed toward the door, chest tight. “What even are you?”

Trevor blinked. And for the briefest moment, the smile faltered. The mask slipped.

“I don’t know anymore.”

⸻

Dennis ran. The streets blurred around him in clean, symmetrical lines. The town was too perfect. The houses didn’t have cracks. The lawns didn’t have weeds. The cars never rusted. The sky never changed.

He made it back to his home, panting, eyes wild.

He pulled out the drawings again. One by one. Searching. Connecting lines. Drawing over symbols. He created a map. Then he turned it upside down. Then sideways. It didn’t make sense. Why didn’t it make sense?!

He tried to remember the first time he saw the spiral. He couldn’t. Not exactly. He tried to remember what Lena’s voice sounded like. That, too, was slipping.

The drawings pulsed with conflicting meaning. A child’s house with too many windows. A stick figure with no face, then too many. A field that was also a maze. A dark smudge with the word “remember” written over it again and again.

Then, finally, the last drawing Lena had given him.

He hadn’t looked at it yet.

Hands trembling, Dennis turned it over.

A perfect mirror image of his own house. But the windows weren’t drawn in. They were blacked out. The door was sealed shut. Above it, written in her scrawled childish hand:

YOU’RE ALREADY INSIDE.

Dennis stared at it for a long time, unable to breathe.

The lights in the house didn’t flicker.

Nothing moved.

Nothing needed to.

Because the truth wasn’t outside.

It was him.

And the integration?

It was almost complete.

1mkrtkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiters/comments/1mkrtkf/my_disastrous_first_shift_at_the_local_restaurant/,My disastrous first shift at the local restaurant,"Yes, the following text has been made with chatgpt, because i am trying to get over it with him, and he already knows the story so i just asked him to repeat it to me

TLDR: My parents pushed me to do a trial shift at a popular restaurant, even though I’m still a student and had an injured ankle. I spilled wine on a customer. The manager sent me home without saying to come back, and now I’m scared the story will spread in my small town.



I’m still a student, but my parents have been pressuring me to find a job — to start earning, to be more independent, to “get used to the real world.” Even though I’m juggling school and other responsibilities, I gave in. So when an opportunity came up for a trial shift at a popular local restaurant, I accepted. It wasn’t an official job yet — just a single night to prove myself.

The place is well-known around here, and in a small town of about 10,000 people, word travels fast. So I knew that if I screwed up, people would find out.

To make things worse, I wasn’t even at 100%. I had sprained my ankle about two weeks earlier, and although I tried to ignore it, it still hurt — badly. I thought I could handle it.

During the shift, I was mostly carrying trays — drinks, desserts, coffee, bottles, wine glasses. Things were going fine at first. But then I was handed a tray that was really unbalanced: three full 1-liter bottles placed far from my body and three wine glasses closer to me. I wasn’t confident with the technique yet, but I still went forward.

As I tried to place it down at a table, the whole thing collapsed. The bottles fell, the glasses shattered, and red wine spilled — on the table, on the floor, on a customer, and even on their chair. I froze. I felt like everything I feared was coming true, right there in front of me.

The customers, luckily, were regulars and took it with surprising grace. Still, I felt humiliated. I immediately went to the manager and explained what happened. I even asked if she wanted me to leave right then and there. She told me it was okay, that “it happens,” and said I could stay.

I tried to keep going, but my ankle pain got worse. Every step was a struggle. When the shift ended and the last customer had left, the manager simply told me I could go home. She didn’t mention anything about coming back.

At that point, I told her about my ankle — something she hadn’t known up to that moment. I explained that it was still healing, and that if they wanted me to come back, I’d take care of it and make sure I was ready next time. That’s when she said, “If it hurts, it’s better that you stay home. When it’s better, you can come back.”

But I couldn’t help but notice that she hadn’t said that earlier. She had already told me to go home before even knowing about the injury. Her tone felt polite but cold — professional, not warm. Not encouraging. It didn’t feel like someone who was hoping to see me again.

I walked away from the restaurant with the heavy feeling that I failed — not just because of the wine incident, but because I probably won’t be called back. It’s just a strong gut feeling.

And since this is a small town, I know how quickly stories spread. One of the customers that night was a secretary from the gym I go to. She was in the room when everything happened, so I know she saw it all. I can already imagine the gossip — staff telling friends, gym people mentioning it to trainers, maybe even to people I know. The kind of thing that sticks to your name when you least want it.

So now I’m left with shame, doubt, and the strong sense that I’m not welcome back. And the worst part is, I didn’t even get a real chance to show who I am or what I could do, beyond that one embarrassing moment.

I have zero interest in having an affair with a married man, and even if I was an unscrupulous person, John is not my type.

Now with that settled, I've worked with John for about two-three years now. We met at work on orientation day, and as one of the few people under 35 at work, we ended up in the same work-based social circles. That work-based social circle over time became just a normal friend group, we'd meet up for dinners, long weekend holidays etc. I've even gone on a road trip with just John and his wife (who I'd also consider my friend).

Personally, I wouldn't say either him or his wife are my close friends. I'm always happy to have dinner or meet up for an activity, but I wouldn't share more than surface level details about my life with either of them. And I thought this feeling was mutual, like John doesn't even know the name of my siblings. We only shoot the shit about work or like hobbies.

**But** recently, John and I went on a work trip together (which obviously his wife didn't attend), and I've felt unsettled ever since. I can't tell if I'm reading too much into it, so was hoping reddit could let me know if I'm full of myself, or if these are warnings. Some things that gave me a red flag were:

* John asked me what my favourite film lately was, and when I answered, he said to me: Oh, that's my favourite too, this is why we're such good friends, we're so alike. Which isn't really weird on its own but...
* Then he asked me who my favourite coworker was (which I assumed he meant in a work context) so I named my old boss, and John said: Oh, that's my favourite coworker too, see, we're so alike. But the thing is, my old boss left our department before John moved over to my area, so John has never worked for him before. When I asked him how he knew my old boss, he said that he never met him, but he just really like my old boss's attitude?
* Then he asked what goals I have this year, and I told him that I'm looking to get more fit by going to the gym. John then asked, how would I feel if he joined my gym that's 40 minutes away from his place so that he could be my gym buddy. I said haha, I'm self-conscious about my body so I'd hate that, so he dropped that topic.
* Then he asked who my top friends at work are, minus him since he's sure that he's in my top 3. I pushed back saying I'm closer with other people, like he doesn't really know much about me. Then he responded by saying, that's fine, then can I get to know you better.
* Then he told me that he wants to be my confidant, the person I can rely on. I pushed back saying that's a bit intense, so he responded that as we get older, its more and more important to have a close knit circle of friends. That I should stop making too many friends and just focus on those people that really care about me (aka himself).
* Also, on this trip, any time I did pretty minor things like ask the server for an extra napkin, he would overly praise me for being so organised and go-getter? And then contrast me to his wife, who is introverted and shy? I told him that his compliments were a bit much, but then he pushed back saying that's just his love language, and he sees how hard I work in the office without praise, and he wants to make up for that?

I felt like this was all a bit much, but I put this down to him just being socially awkward (he doesn't really have many friends at work that I didn't introduce him to first, I'm definitely the extrovert between us). But then last week, I went to get a coffee with a coworker that ran overtime, cutting into my lunch plans with him (the first plans we really had since that awkward work trip), and he called me three times (which I didn't see because I was on do not disturb at work). And when he finally ran into me on our floor, interrogated me about why I was late, and he asked me if I needed him to hold me accountable so I'm not late. Asking me if this is a problem I wanted to fix. It was bizarre and felt like he was taking it really personally that I was late.

I ran this all by a mutual friend, who told me, this sounds like he's into me? But I didn't even consider this possibility since I'm friends with both John and his wife AND John is a devout christian, and runs the work christian bible study group! Also, John knows nothing about me really, like what would he even be attracted to? His wife is way prettier than me, a perfect christian homemaker, and I'm a childfree atheist that swears like a sailor!

So based of this, do you think he's giving weird ""into me"" energy? Because if yes, I fully plan to cut this man out of my life. I just know, if he makes a move, no one will believe me at work if I say that I never encouraged this. If y'all think he's into me, I want to get ahead of it and ice John out.",7,1754649722.0,relationship_advice,33,0.89,False

September 13th – 8:03 AM
Dennis woke in a park he didn’t remember walking to.

Shoes soaked. Dew on his sleeves. Birds in the trees chirped like nothing was wrong.

He was sitting on a bench beside a newspaper dated yesterday. A thermos was beside him—half empty. His fingerprints were on it.

He didn’t own a thermos.

The smell of coffee still clung to his breath. It tasted sweet, like how he used to take it years ago—before he stopped drinking it altogether.

His phone said he’d called someone at 6:22 AM.
Trevor (Unknown Number)

Dennis stared at the screen. He didn’t remember having a signal here. The number was gone now. Just blanked out. No log of the call. Just a missing gap in his call history, like a skipped heartbeat.

When he stood, his knees buckled slightly, like he’d been sitting there a long time. But it didn’t feel like long. His legs were cold. His hands, trembling.

There was something scribbled on the inside of his wrist:

“Return before reset.”

In his own handwriting.

But he hadn’t written it.

⸻

September 13th – 11:41 AM

He wandered the neighborhood for hours.

Every house had something just slightly off.

The Bouchards’ house had never had a second-floor balcony, but now it did—small, jutting out awkwardly over their garage. It looked fake. Too shallow. Too clean. Like it had been added for visual consistency.

A dog barked behind a hedge. But when Dennis looked, there was no dog.

Only an empty leash, looped around the post.

Still swinging.

The new neighbors waved from their plastic garden again. Same pie. Same clothes. Same unblinking smiles. A film of dust now coated their porch swing, like no one had used it in weeks.

He knocked on a few doors. Asked about Trevor. About the people who used to live here. About the mailbox that appeared in front of his own house overnight.

Everyone gave answers.

All of them different.

All of them wrong.

⸻

September 14th – 3:57 AM

He woke in his car.

Parked outside the old community library, half an hour out of town. Key still in the ignition. Tank half full.

The passenger seat held a stack of papers, all torn from different books. All handwritten notes. None in his handwriting.

Most of them were phrases:
	•	“Replicated roles must remain unaware.”
	•	“He’s stabilizing, but inconsistently.”
	•	“Trevor reset: failed attempt. Host still bonded.”

And one circled repeatedly:

“Conscious bleed = high risk of collapse.”

Dennis stared until his vision blurred.

The paper on top bore a familiar symbol:
A circle. A line through it.

He started the engine.

Drove home without thinking.

He didn’t remember the trip.

⸻

September 14th – 8:16 PM

Dennis tried to stay awake.

He set alarms. Drank cold water. Paced. Watched the news with the volume on high.

It didn’t help.

He blinked—

And the room was different.

Furniture moved. TV off. Alarm clock unplugged.

He checked the time on his phone. Two hours had passed. And in the middle of his living room floor, a small red cube sat perfectly centered.

It wasn’t his.

When he picked it up, it was heavy. Metallic. Smooth like surgical steel.

No seams. No buttons.

But when he turned it in his hand, it made a soft click, and a message flashed across the black mirror of his turned-off television:

“You’re late.”

⸻

September 15th – 12:22 PM

Dennis stopped trusting reflections.

The mirror in his bathroom didn’t show the same expressions he felt. His face looked too calm. Like it didn’t know what he was thinking.

He caught himself watching himself too long.

And sometimes, the reflection was looking back… before he turned.

He covered the mirrors with towels.

But at night, they were uncovered again.

⸻

September 15th – 9:40 PM

Dennis walked to Trevor’s house again, though he didn’t remember deciding to.

The forest was colder tonight. Soundless. The path seemed longer.

Trevor’s house was exactly the same.

And yet, it wasn’t.

The chimney was gone. Again. The trim was white now. The stone darker. The doorknob colder.

Dennis knocked.

No answer.

He stepped inside anyway.

No family portraits. Just those neutral stranger-faces again, dozens of them. A photo sat slightly tilted on a shelf—it was him, Dennis, sitting on Trevor’s couch. Laughing. Holding a mug.

He didn’t remember it.

But he was wearing the exact shirt he had on now.

Down the hall, the door to the child’s room was cracked.

He heard a voice inside.

Small. Familiar.

Lena.

Singing.

He crept closer, heart pounding, knees weak.

But when he pushed the door open—

Nothing.

Just the book again, sitting neatly on the bed.

Now open to the last page.

This time, no name.

Only a phrase written at the bottom in tight, perfect print:

“Your compliance has been noted.”


Chapter 12: A Quiet Return

September 16th – 4:18 AM
Dennis opened his eyes.

He was lying in bed. On top of the covers. Fully clothed. The window was open, letting in a cold breeze that felt like it didn’t belong in late summer.

His heart thudded with a deep, anxious pulse.

He sat up slowly, scanning the room. Everything looked exactly as he remembered… but something about the silence felt placed. Not natural. As if someone had arranged it.

He looked down at his arm.

The words were gone.

Nothing written on his wrist.

No cube. No book. No whispers. No trace of the last twelve hours.

He stood and stepped out into the hallway. His body ached with the weight of unearned exhaustion—like he’d lived a full day somewhere else.

He didn’t remember falling asleep.

He remembered the book.
The phrase.
“Your compliance has been noted.”

And then—

Nothing.

⸻

September 16th – 7:12 AM

The morning was too bright. The sky painted in clean, artificial blues. No clouds. No birds.

Dennis stood barefoot in his front yard, arms crossed, staring down the street.

Trevor’s house—the one he used to live in—was back.

Perfectly normal. White picket fence, red door, rose bushes pruned just the same. The wind chimes hanging on the porch were back too, swaying gently without a sound.

And the house in the woods?

Gone.

No stone. No chimney. No path.

Dennis walked two blocks toward the woods, just to check.

There was no break in the trees now. No clearing. No trail. Just an unbroken wall of pines and thorns, thick and impenetrable like it had always been that way.

But it hadn’t.

He knew it hadn’t.

⸻

September 16th – 8:03 AM

Trevor was outside, watering the roses.

Dennis approached slowly.

His voice came out hoarse, hesitant. “Trevor?”

Trevor turned, smiled casually like nothing had ever been wrong. He looked exactly the same—slightly wrinkled button-up, jeans a little too clean, faint smell of wood and mint.

“Morning, Dennis. You’re up early.”

Dennis stared. “You’re… back.”

Trevor blinked. Tilted his head. “Back from where?”

Dennis took a step closer. “You moved. I saw you. You and Lena. You were living in the woods. There was a house. You—you said something about it being safer—”

Trevor laughed lightly, brushing dirt off his hands. “House in the woods? That doesn’t sound like us.”

Dennis’s jaw tightened. “Trevor, I went inside it. Multiple times. I found—pictures. Letters. Your daughter’s drawings. A book that said—”

Trevor raised a hand gently, almost condescendingly. “I think you might’ve had a bad dream, Dennis.”

“No.” Dennis’s voice cracked. “I have things. Memories. I saw the furniture. The portraits. You were gone. Everyone said you didn’t exist anymore!”

Trevor looked at him with a polite, puzzled expression—one that didn’t reach his eyes.

“We’ve lived here this whole time, Dennis. Maybe you’ve been working too hard.”

Dennis stared at him, suddenly aware of the absurd quiet around them. No cars. No breeze. Not even a single insect. Just the soft hiss of water from Trevor’s hose, arcing over dirt that didn’t seem to absorb it.

“You said—” Dennis’s voice dropped, almost to a whisper, “You said she was drawing things she couldn’t explain. Do you remember that? Lena’s pictures. They kept changing.”

Trevor’s smile stayed fixed. His eyes sharpened slightly, but only for a moment.

Then he said, “She’s just a child, Dennis. You shouldn’t worry so much about what children draw.”

⸻

September 16th – 9:10 AM

Dennis walked home, throat dry, mind spinning.

The entire neighborhood looked… cleaner. Too clean. Every lawn trimmed with precision. Every flower in perfect bloom. Cars parked exactly even. Windows polished.

When he reached his own porch, something caught his eye.

A small package sat at the door.

Plain brown box.

No return address.

He picked it up. Light. Taped shut.

Inside:
A single object wrapped in white cloth.

He unfolded it carefully.

A black and white photograph.

Himself.
Sitting in Trevor’s old kitchen. Holding Lena’s drawing. Smiling.

In the photo, Trevor sat beside him, staring directly into the camera.

But Lena wasn’t in the picture.

Instead, the chair where she should’ve been?

Empty.

Only a small drawing tacked to the wall behind it—

A crude sketch of a man with no face.
Standing in a forest.
Pointing at a house that wasn’t there anymore.



Chapter 13: Every Road Leads Home

September 18th – 9:44 AM

Dennis sat at the kitchen table, staring at Lena’s drawing for the third hour straight.

He hadn’t even noticed the paper in his hand that morning. It was just… there. Folded on the counter beside his keys, like it had been left for him — or by him. He couldn’t remember.

It was drawn in soft pencil: a house — not his, not Trevor’s. A house with no doors. The windows were smeared black, as if they’d been erased. Surrounding it, stick-figures with oversized heads stood in a circle, their necks bending at impossible angles. Their eyes were all wrong — wide, with too many lashes, and hollow in the middle. No pupils. Just rings.

But it was the sky that disturbed him most.

Drawn in jagged, frantic strokes, the sky above the house was filled with eyes. Hundreds. All staring down, some crying, some bleeding.

One corner of the paper had been torn off. Like someone had tried to remove something.

Dennis turned it over.

In the bottom corner, scribbled in faint graphite:
“She said we can’t leave until we forget.”

He didn’t know who she was.

And he didn’t want to ask.

⸻

September 18th – 2:21 PM

Dennis stood across from Trevor on the lawn.

The original house. The old white colonial that had sat empty for weeks was now exactly as it had been. Porch swing, chipped paint, potted fern — even the mailbox with the little iron bird. Trevor was crouched down, helping Lena plant yellow marigolds like nothing had changed.

Dennis approached slowly, unsure whether to speak or run.

“Hey, stranger,” Trevor said without looking up. “Didn’t expect to see you out today. You look like hell.”

Dennis didn’t respond at first. He stepped forward, blinking. The marigolds were already blooming. They’d been planted minutes ago.

“Trevor…” His voice cracked. “The other house. The one in the woods—”

Trevor looked up, brow furrowed. “What house?”

Dennis tried to stay calm. “You know what I’m talking about. The white stone one. I came there. You were there. Your daughter was there.”

Trevor tilted his head, smiling slightly. “Dennis, we’ve lived here since the start. You feeling alright?”

“You showed me a room,” Dennis continued, breath quickening. “With portraits. There was a book. The hallway kept changing. Your house moved. You—” He stopped.

Trevor stood.

He stepped forward gently, voice soft. “Have you been sleeping?”

Lena stood in the doorway behind him, watching. Her face was calm, polite — like a student waiting to be called on.

“You invited me there,” Dennis muttered. “You said they were watching me.”

Trevor chuckled, warm and empty. “You need a break, man. Stress does weird things to memory.”

“No, no. Don’t do that. Don’t gaslight me.”

“I’m not—”

“Yes, you are.” Dennis stepped closer. “You said you’d explain. That day in the woods—”

“I haven’t been in the woods since last winter,” Trevor said, arms crossed. “Hunting season ended. You know that.”

Dennis opened his mouth.

But the words were gone.

Like they’d never been there at all.

⸻

September 20th – 8:08 AM

Dennis packed a small bag. He wrote a note for himself: “Going to visit Mom. Do not turn around.”
He slipped it into his wallet.

The drive out of Grayer Ridge was slow, too quiet. As he passed the edge of town, the buildings thinned, and the roads narrowed. Trees blurred past his window like wet paint on glass. He kept his hands at ten and two. Eyes forward. Radio off.

But then—

A blink.

And suddenly he was pulling into his own driveway.

The engine ticking softly.

Bag still in the back seat.

He looked at the clock.

8:12 AM.

Four minutes had passed.

The road out of town was twenty-five miles long.

⸻

September 21st – 6:33 PM

He tried again.

This time on foot. He walked fast, cutting through backyards, avoiding main roads. He made it past the gas station, past the welcome sign, even onto the stretch of highway with no shoulder.

He kept walking.

Eventually the sky turned pink. Then orange. Then—

Dark.

He opened his eyes in the bathtub.

Water cold.

Clothes dry.

Shivering.

The lights in the bathroom flickered once, then held steady.

A note was taped to the mirror.

His own handwriting.
“It’s okay. You came back on your own.”

He ripped it down, stared at it.

It wasn’t the handwriting that disturbed him — it was the tone.
It didn’t sound like him. It sounded like someone impersonating him. Someone who knew how he wrote, but not why.

⸻

September 23rd – 10:01 PM

Trevor stopped by that night.

Dennis didn’t remember inviting him. But there he was, on the porch, holding a beer, wearing that same unbothered grin.

“You haven’t been around lately,” Trevor said. “Lena misses you.”

Dennis nodded slowly. “I’ve been… sorting some things out.”

“Yeah?”

“I think I’m being monitored.”

Trevor took a sip. “Aren’t we all?”

“No, I mean—” Dennis hesitated. “Every time I try to leave town, I wake up here. Back in this house. I don’t even remember turning around. It’s like—like someone’s editing my life. Trimming it.”

Trevor smiled faintly.

“Do you ever feel like your choices aren’t your own?”

Trevor set the beer down. “Honestly?” He looked Dennis in the eye. “I try not to think about things like that.”

“Why not?”

“Because it doesn’t matter. Whether it’s you making the decisions or someone else—either way, you’re still here. You still end up where you’re supposed to be.”

Dennis looked at him hard. “Did you write the note on my mirror?”

Trevor blinked. Once. Slowly. “What note?”

Dennis stepped back.

“I should go,” Trevor said suddenly. “Big day tomorrow. Come by sometime. We’ll grill.”

And then he was gone, walking into the night with no flashlight, no sound of steps, just absence.

⸻

September 24th – 3:00 AM

Dennis tore apart the hallway closet looking for his old journals.

They were gone.

He opened a drawer to find a pair of shoes he didn’t remember buying. A sweater he would never wear. In the kitchen, a loaf of bread was open—but he didn’t eat bread. Hadn’t for years.

Inside the fridge: a container labeled “Tuesday.”

But it was Wednesday.

He opened it.

Empty.

Except for a folded slip of paper.

One sentence:

“Stop trying to leave. You’ll ruin it.”



Chapter 14: Integration
September 24th – 6:41 AM

Dennis stood in the bathroom mirror, toothbrush in hand, foam clinging to his bottom lip.

He smiled.

Perfectly.

Too perfectly.

The smile had happened before the thought. Before the muscle told itself to move. His hand raised, too—a little wave to no one. Then the smile dropped. His brow furrowed.

He didn’t remember deciding to do it.

⸻

7:58 AM

Lena’s latest drawing sat on the kitchen table.

Dennis had been flipping through her old sketches again—he kept them in a worn folder now, half out of guilt, half out of obsession. They had started simple: houses, animals, lopsided stick people.

But now the lines were cleaner. More symmetrical. Symbols repeated, always hidden in the corners: concentric circles, a shape like an inverted triangle nested inside a square. One page had what looked like a layout of Grayer Ridge—but the streets twisted wrong. They overlapped like layers that weren’t supposed to exist at the same time.

And in the center: a house.

Not his house.

Trevor’s.

Except… it wasn’t there anymore.

⸻

9:12 AM

Dennis caught himself saying good morning to Marcy.

Her name had left his mouth before he even looked up.

She was smiling on her porch in her robe and slippers, just like every morning.

“Wonderful day, isn’t it?” she called.

Dennis paused. “Yeah,” he replied, then immediately regretted it.

She tilted her head. “I heard you got new neighbors.”

“Yeah,” Dennis said again. His voice sounded strange in his ears. Like someone else was practicing being him.

“Everyone’s new, aren’t they?” Marcy added.

He didn’t answer.

He looked toward the Perry house—now with perfectly trimmed hedges, new shutters, the same damn pie in the same woman’s hands. Still uneaten.

The couple waved at him in perfect sync.

He looked back at Marcy.

She wasn’t there.

The porch was empty.

He hadn’t heard her go inside.

⸻

12:43 PM

Dennis found another note.

It was folded neatly into his wallet, tucked behind a grocery store receipt. Same handwriting as the others.

It read:
“Stop pretending. We see you.”

His hands started shaking.

He hadn’t written that.

Had he?

He grabbed a pen from the counter and scribbled on the back of a takeout menu. Same pen. Same flow. Different feel.

Something was off.

He tossed the note in the trash.

When he walked by again ten minutes later, it was gone.

⸻

2:27 PM

Trevor was mowing his lawn.

The exact same push mower. The exact same gray T-shirt. Lena sat on the steps, sketchbook open, humming quietly.

Dennis crossed the street, slow. Unsure.

Trevor looked up and waved. “You alright, man? You look like hell.”

Dennis stood there. “You were gone.”

“What?”

“You weren’t here. Your house was in the woods. And then you weren’t. And now you’re back. Why?”

Trevor blinked at him. The mower idled behind him.

“I’ve always lived here.”

“No,” Dennis said. “No, you haven’t. You… you invited me to that place. With the stone porch and the white frame, near the creek. You—”

“Dennis,” Trevor said gently, “you feeling okay? Maybe get some rest.”

Lena looked up from her drawing.

Dennis caught a glimpse of it.

It was his house.

But the windows were different. There were eyes in them.

Not people.

Eyes.

Watching.

⸻

5:05 PM

Dennis sat in his living room, lights off.

He could hear something scratching again. But not in the walls this time—in the ceiling.

He didn’t move.

His reflection in the blank TV screen looked calmer than he felt. Too calm. Mouth neutral. Hands still.

When he blinked, the reflection didn’t.

Then it did.

Twice.

Faster than his own.

He stood suddenly.

His hand knocked over a coaster.

Same symbol: a circle, line through it.

He picked it up and threw it across the room.

It landed face-up.

⸻

9:33 PM

He tried writing down everything—everything he remembered about Trevor, about Lena, about the new couple, the pie, the symbols, the strange “coincidences.”

But the words on the page didn’t make sense when he re-read them.

Whole phrases vanished when he looked away and looked back.

One sentence repeated, though.

He hadn’t written it.

“You’re doing so well.”

⸻

September 25th – 3:12 AM

Dennis woke up on the sidewalk in front of the town hall.

Shoes on the wrong feet.

A perfect smile frozen on his face.

He wiped it off with the back of his sleeve, trembling.

Something rustled behind him.

A paper, pinned to the bulletin board. He didn’t remember it being there.

It read:

“Orientation begins soon.”

He turned.

The town was still.

No cars. No crickets. No lights.

He looked down at his hands again.

Perfectly clean. Fingernails trimmed.

But he didn’t remember doing that.


Chapter 15: The Shape That Doesn’t Fit

September 23rd – 6:41 AM

Dennis caught himself staring into the mirror.

Mouth curled into a tight, flawless smile. Eyes wide. Chin tilted upward slightly, like he was posing for a photo.

He blinked and it broke.

His shoulders relaxed. His face fell back into place.

He didn’t remember why he was standing in front of the mirror to begin with. The sink was dry. No toothbrush. No towel. Just him. His reflection. And that perfect grin that hadn’t felt like his.

He touched the glass.

It felt cool, solid.

But something behind his eyes didn’t match.

⸻

September 24th – 3:03 PM

He kept seeing the symbol.

Not just in the drawings or the mirror, but everywhere. Etched lightly into the corner of receipts. Carved into the base of a streetlamp. Once, even scratched into the condensation on his bathroom mirror.

A circle. With a single line cut through the center—diagonal, imperfect.

It wasn’t just a symbol anymore. It felt personal. Like it was following him. Like it was a question someone kept asking that he didn’t know how to answer.

He started keeping a notebook. Drawing it. Repeating it. Hoping it might unlock something. But the more he stared at the sketches, the more the shape seemed to move, subtly, in his peripheral vision. Like the angles changed depending on how much he believed in it.

Trevor noticed.

“You’ve been out of it lately,” he said, leaning on Dennis’s kitchen counter that evening. “Are you sleeping?”

“I think so.”

“You think?”

Dennis hesitated. “Sometimes I wake up in the living room. Sometimes in the hallway. Once… once in the neighbor’s yard. I don’t remember walking there.”

Trevor’s face twitched. A flicker of discomfort. But it smoothed itself quickly, too quickly.

“Stress does strange things,” Trevor said. “You’ve been through a lot. New place. New people. Maybe you’re not adapting as well as we thought.”

Dennis latched onto the word.

“We?”

Trevor didn’t answer at first.

Then he laughed softly and shook his head. “Sorry. Just a figure of speech.”

⸻

September 25th – 1:29 PM

Lena handed Dennis another drawing.

No words. Just silently slipped it into his hand while he sat on the porch steps.

Trevor was inside, talking to someone on the phone in low tones.

The drawing looked like a map.

But not of any place Dennis recognized.

There were roads—yes—but they bent at impossible angles, looping in on themselves. Symbols lined the paths—circles, spirals, the same diagonal-cut shape, and one that looked like an eye half-closed.

At the center of the map: a house.

His house.

He stared at it until the page blurred. The longer he looked, the less the drawing made sense. Roads disappeared. Reappeared. The house rotated slowly on the page without moving.

“What is this, Lena?”

She shrugged. “I drew it yesterday.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know. I just remember it.”

Dennis looked up at her.

Her expression was blank, not afraid—just resigned, like she was used to not understanding the things that came out of her own hands.

She walked away without another word.

⸻

September 26th – 9:08 PM

Dennis woke up again in the kitchen, the front door open.

His feet were muddy. The floor was wet.

A trail led from the door to the couch.

He didn’t remember walking anywhere.

He shut the door. Cleaned his feet. But the mud didn’t smell like dirt. It smelled like copper and pine.

He found a folded note on the counter.

You’re almost there.

It was in his handwriting.

He didn’t remember writing it.

He flipped it over. Nothing on the back. But the paper felt warm, like it had just been held. Someone had pressed it tight. The corners were softened.

He kept all the notes in a drawer now. Twenty-two of them.

Most were brief.

Don’t tell Trevor yet.

You’re not finished.

He knows what you forgot.

Remember the smell of bleach.

He hadn’t written any of them. And yet… they were all written by him.

⸻

September 27th – 10:14 AM

Trevor found Dennis sitting on the floor of the garage, staring at the pattern of oil on concrete.

“You haven’t called,” Trevor said.

“I don’t know what’s mine anymore,” Dennis replied.

Trevor crouched next to him.

“You’re not the first person this has happened to,” he said.

Dennis looked up sharply. “What do you mean?”

But Trevor only sighed. “I think you’re trying too hard. You’re forcing something open that’s supposed to stay closed until it’s time. You have to let it happen naturally.”

“What does that mean?”

Trevor shook his head slowly. “Just breathe. Try to… stop digging.”

“But I have to,” Dennis whispered.

Trevor didn’t argue. He just stood, dusted off his pants, and walked back toward the house.

⸻

September 28th – 11:03 PM

Dennis sat on his bed, the map-drawing from Lena laid out in front of him.

He’d redrawn it five times.

Each version came out different. The roads curved wider or narrower. The lines darkened or softened. The house at the center changed shape.

It was like trying to copy a dream from memory.

He stared at one particular road that twisted back onto itself and ended in a circle with a slash.

That symbol again.

He traced it with his finger.

He whispered aloud: “What does it mean?”

He blinked.

And he was standing in the middle of his street.

Shoes unlaced. Shirt inside-out.

A full minute passed before he could breathe again.

He didn’t remember getting up.

Didn’t remember leaving the house.

Didn’t remember deciding to speak.

⸻

He’s forgetting his choices now.

Forgetting the line between observation and participation.

Trevor says to trust him—but he’s started using words Dennis doesn’t understand.

Integration.

Adaptation.

Synchronization.

Dennis wants to believe in something—someone—but the world is bending sideways, and even his own reflection is starting to look like a man he wouldn’t trust.

There’s another drawing folded in his mailbox now.

This time, it’s not from Lena.

The symbol is drawn in thick black ink.

Underneath it, a single phrase:

September 2nd

Dennis hadn’t slept. He spent the night at the kitchen table, surrounded by papers—maps, receipts, sketches. He drew a layout of Grayer Ridge by memory, labeled who lived where, and began compiling a timeline.

But the pieces didn’t fit. His notes from last week—the ones where he’d written down Trevor’s favorite brand of coffee, Lena’s birthday—were gone from his journal.

Torn out? Misplaced? Forgotten?

No. They’d been removed.

He was sure of it.

He wrote in capital letters on a fresh page:

I AM NOT CRAZY.

He underlined it. Twice.

⸻

3:47 p.m.

Dennis walked to the far end of town to speak to the only person he hadn’t yet approached—Pastor Emory Cain, who ran the tiny church that squatted near the woods.

The chapel was white. The steps creaked. A perfect little Americana postcard. Too perfect.

The inside smelled like varnish and flowers that weren’t real. The pews were empty.

“Dennis,” Pastor Cain said, emerging from a side room with his sleeves rolled up. “I’ve been expecting you.”

Dennis blinked.

“Why?”

“When newcomers start digging, they always come to me eventually.”
He smiled, but it didn’t feel welcoming. It felt prepared.

“I have a question,” Dennis said. “About Trevor Lang.”

Pastor Cain walked slowly to the front altar and sat on its edge, folding his hands.

“There’s no one here by that name.”

“But I—”

“Some people bring their pasts with them, Dennis. They create shadows where there are none.”
“What you’re experiencing is perfectly natural.”

“I’m not seeing things.”

Pastor Cain nodded slowly.

“Of course not.”

He stood, brushed imaginary dust from his sleeves.

“We all find peace here, Dennis. You will too. Eventually.”

Dennis left before he said something he’d regret.

Behind him, the church bell rang. Once. Sharp.
He turned back.

There was no bell tower.



Chapter 8: Echo House 

September 4th – 6:42 PM

Dennis walked aimlessly, his breath fogging in the sharp evening air. He didn’t want to go home yet. Home felt like a lie now—like something designed to look comforting.

He drifted toward the western ridge, where the woods thinned and the town’s perfection faltered.

That’s when he saw it: a house.

White stone, black shutters, clean angles. Like it had been sketched by a child trying to draw “home.” It hadn’t been there before. He was sure of it. It sat at the top of a gentle slope, surrounded by unnaturally trimmed hedges, not a single leaf out of place.

The air around it felt denser. Not cold—but somehow heavier.

He approached slowly.

The windows were too clean. Nothing behind them. Not even curtains. Just flat glass like mirrors that didn’t want to reflect.

He stepped onto the porch.

Knocked.

Silence.

He stepped around the side. Saw something through the back window—a movement. A flicker of shadow. A shape.

He crouched, peering into the glass.

No furniture. No rugs. The inside was just blank space—like a showroom that hadn’t yet been dressed.

And then someone stepped into the frame.

Dennis jumped back.

The door creaked open behind him.

He turned slowly.

Trevor was standing in the doorway.

Same hoodie. Same worn work boots. Same half-smile—but it was too still, like his face was waiting for instructions.

“Dennis,” Trevor said.

Dennis stared at him.

“What the hell is going on?”

Trevor stepped aside slightly, holding the door open.

“Come inside.”

Dennis didn’t move.

“You—people say you’re not real.”

Trevor blinked. Once. Slowly.

“People say a lot of things.”

“Where have you been? I’ve been looking for you. Your name isn’t even in the town records. Your house is gone. The store clerks act like they’ve never heard of you. Your daughter—”

Trevor’s expression didn’t change.

“You’ve been asking too many questions.”

Dennis felt cold rise in his chest.

“What does that mean?”

“It’s not safe to dig, Dennis. You don’t like what you’ll find. Neither do they.”

“Who’s they?”

“You already know.”

Dennis looked past Trevor into the house.

The inside was wrong.

Walls that seemed too flat. A hallway that looked painted on. No smells—no furniture polish, no food, no dust. It didn’t feel lived in. It didn’t feel real.

“Is this your house?”

“No,” Trevor said calmly.

“Then what is it?”

Trevor looked down for a long moment. When he looked back up, his voice was quieter.

“Sometimes the town makes things that look familiar. It helps people… adjust.”

Dennis took a step back.

“What the hell are you talking about, Trevor? Why are you talking like this?”

Trevor tilted his head slightly, as if listening to something Dennis couldn’t hear.

“I don’t have much time. I wasn’t supposed to come back.”

“Come back from where?”

“They erase you if you remember too much. You’re not supposed to keep people. You’re not supposed to form attachments.”

“Who’s erasing who? Is this a cult? Some experiment?”

Trevor didn’t answer.

“What is this town?”

That made Trevor pause.

“It’s a process, Dennis.”

Dennis shook his head.

“No. No. That’s not an answer.”

Trevor’s eyes were calm. Too calm. The eyes of someone who’d stopped resisting a long time ago.

“You need to be careful now. They know you’ve started connecting things. You need to stop.”

Dennis stared at him, throat dry.

“Did you ever even have a daughter?”

Trevor’s face twitched. Just once.

“She was… something close to that.”

Dennis’s stomach turned.

“What does that mean?”

Trevor’s eyes locked on his.

“You’re thinking like an old world person. This town isn’t built for that. It’s not a place you live. It’s a place you become.”

Dennis stepped back again.

“What do they want?”

“Obedience. Order. Forgetting.”

A breeze pushed through the trees. When Dennis looked up, clouds had swallowed the sky. The light had shifted. Like time had jumped.

When he looked back—

Trevor was gone.

The house door was shut.

He knocked again.

Nothing.

He turned the knob. Locked.

He cupped his hands to the window.

Now there was furniture. Rugs. A lamp glowing faintly in the corner.

But no people.

No Trevor.

Just a photograph sitting on the mantle.

A photo of Dennis.
Smiling.
Standing next to Trevor and Lena.
All three looking perfectly happy.

He stumbled back from the glass, breath short.

And realized—

He was wearing the same clothes as in the photo.


Chapter 9: Under Review

September 4th – 10:33 PM

Dennis didn’t remember walking home. The streetlights blinked on one by one as he moved through the perfect little town, too fast, heart racing.

He didn’t look at the houses.
Didn’t want to see what had changed.
He just wanted to be inside. Alone.
Safe—if such a thing still existed in Grayer Ridge.

He locked every door behind him. Twice. Drew the curtains. Shut off the lights and paced the living room, running the same questions through his head like a scratched record.

Trevor had been there.
He’d spoken in riddles—words soaked in quiet fear.
He’d said:

“The town isn’t a place. It’s a process.”
“They erase you if you remember too much.”
“You’re not supposed to keep people.”

What the hell did that mean?

And that photo—
Dennis standing next to Trevor and Lena, smiling like he belonged.

But he didn’t remember the picture being taken.
He didn’t remember ever posing for it.
And his smile had looked off. Too wide. Like it had been designed.

He didn’t realize he’d been holding his breath until he exhaled—shaky, cold.

Somewhere deep in the walls, the house gave a faint creak.

Then another.

Then a knock at the door.

Dennis froze.

He hadn’t heard footsteps. No car. No gravel shifting.

Just the knock.
Soft. Rhythmic.
Three slow taps.

He didn’t move.

Another knock.

He crossed the living room and peered through the peephole.

A man in a black wool coat stood on the porch. Tall. Clean-shaven. Thin, but not sickly. His hair was dark and slicked, parted precisely. Hands clasped behind his back.

He wasn’t from the town. Dennis was certain of that.

But he smiled like someone who belonged.

Dennis hesitated. Then opened the door just a crack, leaving the chain on.

“Can I help you?”

“Ah,” the man said warmly, “so you’re Dennis.”

His voice was smooth. Neutral. Like it had been practiced.

“Who are you?”

“Just someone checking in. May I come inside?”

“No.”

The man didn’t flinch.

“That’s all right. I don’t mind talking from here.”

Dennis narrowed his eyes.

“You’re not with the HOA, are you?”

The man laughed softly.

“Not quite.”

“Then what do you want?”

The man tilted his head slightly, studying Dennis like he was a puzzle missing one final piece.

“We’ve noticed you’ve been a bit… active lately. Asking questions. Visiting places that weren’t on your initial map.”

Dennis said nothing.

The man continued.

“Understand, Dennis, the town operates best when its residents accept the rhythm. When they become part of the flow.”

“What is this town?” Dennis asked.

The man offered a smile that never reached his eyes.

“It’s a structured environment.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the only one that fits.”

Dennis felt his pulse pounding behind his eyes.

“Trevor was real. He was here. His daughter was too. I remember them.”

“Do you?” the man asked. “Memory is malleable. Especially here.”

“What do you want from me?”

The man leaned forward, just slightly.

“Nothing. Yet.”

His eyes gleamed—something inhuman behind them, not supernatural, but clinical. As if Dennis were data being analyzed in real-time.

“You are currently under review. That’s all. No need for alarm.”

“Review for what?”

The man looked past Dennis, into the house. His smile widened just a hair.

“For compatibility.”

The phrase hit Dennis in the chest like a cold splash.

“With what?”

“Adjustment takes time. Some residents never fully integrate. Some resist. That’s natural.”

Dennis gripped the doorframe.

“I want to leave.”

The man nodded, as if that was expected.

“Many do, at first. But departures are rarely productive. The system requires continuity. You’re part of a structure now, Dennis.”

“I didn’t agree to this.”

“Didn’t you?”

That question stayed in the air far too long.

The man straightened his coat.

“No further action is required at this time. Continue your routine. Be social. Eat well. Sleep. Try not to fixate on inconsistencies. They have a way of multiplying.”

He stepped back from the porch.

“We’ll be in touch.”

And then he turned and walked—not down the driveway, but into the yard, disappearing behind the hedges. No sound. No crunch of grass. Just gone.

Dennis stood at the door for nearly a full minute, then slammed it shut and bolted every lock.

In the silence of the house, he heard something faint—barely audible.

A mechanical hum.

Not from outside.

From inside the walls.

Almost like… cooling fans.

Or a server rack.

He put his ear to the drywall.

The hum stopped instantly.

He sat on the couch in the dark, hands trembling, the words echoing:

“You are currently under review.”

And on the window, barely visible in the reflection of the TV screen, he saw a new sticker he hadn’t noticed before—placed perfectly in the corner of the glass:

A circle with a line through it.

Chapter 10: Unremembering

September 9th – 7:02 AM

Dennis woke up standing.

In the kitchen.

The kettle was hissing. A mug was already on the counter. The spoon inside clinked softly, as though it had just stirred itself.

His phone sat face down beside it, screen still glowing.

A text was open:

“Sorry, I’ll be a little late. Don’t wait on me. -T”

T?

Trevor?

He hadn’t texted Trevor. Trevor didn’t even have a number anymore.

Dennis stared at the message, his thumb hovering just above it, hesitant to touch.

What had he been doing for the last hour?

He’d gotten out of bed, clearly. Boiled water. Texted someone. But he remembered none of it. Like it had been done for him, through him.

His coffee was scalding when he drank it. Too hot. He hadn’t poured cream or sugar. But his stomach turned as if he had—like his body remembered a choice he hadn’t made.

He looked at the time again.

7:02 AM.

The last thing he remembered was brushing his teeth at 5:38.

⸻

September 9th – 2:12 PM

Dennis stepped outside for air.

Three houses down, where the Perrys had lived, a moving truck sat in the driveway. But it was parked backwards, engine still idling, no one in the cab.

Boxes were on the lawn. All sealed with white tape. Not brown. White. Not labeled.

A couple stood on the porch, chatting with Marcy from next door. The man wore a deep burgundy cardigan and smiled without blinking. The woman held a pie, unmoving in her hands, like a prop.

They both turned toward Dennis in perfect unison.

Smiled.

Held the smiles for too long.

He forced a wave and went back inside.

⸻

September 10th – 6:45 PM

Trevor’s house still stood at the edge of the woods.

Dennis didn’t remember the path there. Just found himself walking it, as if something in him had decided it already.

He paused at the edge of the trees, watching the white stone glow faintly in the fading daylight.

It looked different again.

Now there was a chimney, though he didn’t remember one before. And the color of the trim had changed—now a pale, sterile green, the same as the clinic back in town.

The air around the house always felt heavy. But tonight it was worse. Not just thick—dense with something intentional, like the space itself was folded.

He knocked.

No answer.

He turned the knob. Unlocked.

Inside was colder than he expected.

The walls had pictures now. Not family photos, but portraits of strangers—dozens of them, all framed identically. Neutral expressions. Almost like ID photos. None smiling.

The furniture was arranged like a waiting room. Identical armchairs facing a central rug. No personal touches. No toys. No mail. No fingerprints.

But a faint warmth lingered in the air, like someone had just left.

He stepped deeper.

Down the hallway, a door was open that hadn’t been open before.

Inside was a child’s bedroom.

The walls were powder blue. A small bed in the corner. A single book on the floor, spine cracked: Names for the New Century.

He reached for it.

Footsteps.

Behind him.
Soft.
Deliberate.

He turned—

Nothing.

The air shifted behind him, and he turned back.

The book was gone.

The bed made.

Room silent.

Dennis stood frozen, the cold of the room settling in layers beneath his skin. He hadn’t moved, hadn’t blinked, but everything was different. The book was gone. The bed made. Even the faint impression on the carpet where he’d stepped in was no longer there, as though the room had reset.

He slowly backed into the hallway.

But now, the hallway was longer.

It stretched deeper into the house than he remembered. Much deeper. A faint hum echoed from somewhere ahead—low, pulsing, mechanical, but not like any machine he could name. The air here buzzed against his skin like static. He could smell… ozone, or maybe disinfectant. His own breath sounded too loud.

He turned back toward the front door—only it wasn’t there.

Just wall.

He wasn’t sure when it had vanished.

Behind him, the hum grew sharper, like it was tuning itself to him.

Dennis moved, or thought he did. The hallway blurred. He passed doors that hadn’t existed a moment ago—each one identical, evenly spaced. He tried to open one—locked. Another—locked. On the third, he pressed his ear against the wood and heard nothing, then suddenly—

His own voice.

Speaking.

From inside.

He stumbled back, heart pounding.

The door opened on its own.

Inside: a dining room, but not his own. Not Trevor’s either. A long wooden table, perfectly set for twelve, untouched. Every chair had a name card in elegant script.

He stepped closer.

The name in front of the nearest chair read: DENNIS CALLOWAY

The rest were blank.

He reached for the card, but just as his fingers brushed it—

Darkness.

A blink? A blackout?

When Dennis opened his eyes again, he was lying on his couch at home. Fully clothed. Shoes on.

The TV was on, playing static.

The coaster with the circle-and-line symbol sat on the coffee table, but now there were two.

And next to them:

The book.

Names for the New Century.

Its spine was still cracked.

And it was open now.

To a page he didn’t remember flipping to.

A page with one name, underlined multiple times in faded ink:
Dennis Calloway

He hadn’t written it. The handwriting was too neat, too formal. But the ink looked… old. Almost like it had been there before the book even reached him.

He closed it slowly, the weight of the paper cold in his hands.

It wasn’t the book that unsettled him. It was the feeling he’d seen it before—maybe not here. Maybe not in this house. But somewhere.

Somewhen.

And Dennis…
Dennis didn’t remember coming home.
Didn’t remember leaving the house.
Didn’t even remember falling asleep.

Just static. And a whisper of a thought he couldn’t pin down—

So here's the thing - I'm 20, I'm a software engineer, and I met this girl on Hinge, and we connected like crazy 🔥. I have never felt safer and more emotionally connected with anyone before.

So I did what any rational person would do... I spent a daybuilding an entire web app to make sure our date goes well. 😅

Introducing Spark & Tell, a conversation game that turns awkward dates into unforgettable connections.

I researched hundreds of conversation starters, psychology studies on connection (including the famous ""36 Questions That Lead to Love""), and game mechanics that make talking fun rather than forced. Then I coded it all into a beautiful web app.

The app includes:

\- 🎲 Dice rolling to randomly select conversation topics (no awkward ""what should we talk about now?"")

\- 💕 300+ questions ranging from silly icebreakers to deep, meaningful conversations

\- 🔥 A whole ""Spicy"" category for when things are going well (you're welcome, future me)

\- ✨ Point system so it feels like a game, not an interrogation

\- ⚡ Power-ups to skip awkward questions or make both people answer



After building it, I realized this could help other people too. Whether you're:

\- On a nerve-wracking first date like me

\- In a long-term relationship but want to rediscover each other

\- Doing long-distance and need something fun for video dates

\- Just wanting deeper conversations with your partner

It's completely FREE. No ads. No sign-ups. No BS.

Try it here: [https://spark-and-tell.vercel.app](https://spark-and-tell.vercel.app)

Our date is next Monday. Wish me luck! And if you use the app on your date, let me know how it goes. We're all in this together. ❤️



P.S. - Yes, I'm going to tell her I built this for our date. Either she'll think it's incredibly sweet or incredibly nerdy. Hoping for both.



P.P.S. - If you're a fellow developer, it's open source on https://github.com/elliott-chong/spark-and-tell. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and way too much anxiety-driven motivation.

Step 1. Skip three out of the five limited Harmonies. The Masked Fool didn't catch your attention, though you hope she will once the new planet comes around, and the Charmony Siblings always seem to come alongside characters you like more than you like them. It's fine. You can do it without them. Trust.

Step 2. Get all the Nihilities. They need EHR to work, waves and second phases screw them up, they're not BiS for most characters, but hey, you like them. The Spider and the Swan are your favorite team, and soon the Siren is joining them. The Fox is enjoying retirement at the moment, but the Self-Annihilator is still going at full steam with the Cat and the Wolf. The Frankenstein Fox is getting coffee with your Navigator. The Grandpa is there for moral support. You'll be just fine.

Step 3. Don't pull for new sustains, we have sustain at home. The Pink Grump has done you right even against AoE attacks, when she survives on low health and heals herself. She's still doing okay to this day, and you like her a lot. She probably wants retirement at this point, but you'll allow it only once she allows it for her poor resident Slacker. It'll be a long time, you guess.

Step 4. Get E2 Self-Annihilator, refuse to replace a Nihility. The extra stack is nice, and you're one less Eidolon until E6. Besides, you don't have that many Harmonies to begin with. If it works, it works. And it has been working.

Step 5. Pull for and build Break team, refuse to get a limited Break DPS for it. All you want is to pamper your coffee-addict Navigator and power her death ray. It's a nice enough investment.

Step 6. Get the Frail Scholar for your Peerless Gem, never use him. Your E1S1 Devil of Credit is doing just fine, and the Frail Scholar is there as a failsafe if she ever isn't. You have way more fun with her anyway, so why replace so soon? Besides, you have a deal. You have to honor it. Or else...

Step 7. Refuse to change your signature LCs even if it's no longer that character's BiS. It's quite PAYNful when it happens, but oh well, they'll pry that matching set from your cold dead hands.

These all come from my account, by the way. I've been doing just fine, doing all endgames since 1.x (can't remember which version I started to full star). Sure, there's always a slight risk of bricking my account, but hey, it's a fun ride.

August 9th

Trevor Lang became the first person Dennis truly liked in Grayer Ridge.

It started with the porch railing.

“That corner post is loose,” Trevor said casually, leaning on the fence one morning. “House’ll look at you funny if you let that go too long.”

Dennis laughed.

“You think the house has opinions?”

“Most places do. But this one… yeah. Definitely.”

Trevor returned later with tools. Said he wouldn’t take payment. He had the quiet, focused energy of a man used to doing things with his hands. When he worked, he whistled—not tuneless, not loud, but careful. Like he didn’t want to disturb something listening nearby.

Dennis offered him iced tea. They sat on the porch.

“You grew up here?” Dennis asked.

Trevor nodded.

“Left for a while. Came back when my girl was born. She’s the only reason I stuck around.”

He said it like a confession. Like someone telling you they didn’t believe in ghosts—but always turned on a light before walking into a dark room.

⸻

August 13th – Dinner

Trevor invited Dennis over for dinner the following week.

His house, just a short walk away, was modest. Cozy. Lived-in. A faded blue exterior. Wind chimes on the porch made from old silverware. Inside, everything smelled like rosemary and warm bread.

His daughter, Lena, was 11. Sharp-eyed, quiet, watching Dennis like he was a puzzle piece that didn’t fit yet.

“You really live in the Hollow House?” she asked between bites of stew.

“That’s what they’re calling it now?” Dennis smirked.

“They always call it something,” Trevor said, setting down his glass. “Back when I was a kid, they just called it The Last Stop.”

“Sounds dramatic.”

“It is. Town likes its stories.”

Lena didn’t laugh. She stared into her bowl.

“Do you hear it at night?” she asked, not looking up.
“The sound like someone sweeping upstairs?”

Dennis felt a chill in his throat.

“No,” he lied. “Haven’t heard anything.”

“Good,” she said, still not smiling. “That means it hasn’t started yet.”

Trevor put a hand on her shoulder. She flinched—just slightly.

⸻

Chapter 5: Familiar Faces

August 16th – August 28th

Dennis began spending more time with Trevor. Not daily—but often enough that it became a rhythm. Sometimes they walked in the woods behind the Ridge. Sometimes they shared coffee on the porch.

Trevor was the only one who didn’t perform friendliness. He never asked questions that felt rehearsed. He never smiled too long. He cursed when he stubbed his toe. He rubbed his eyes when he was tired.

Normal.

⸻

Trust

“Everyone here pretending?” Dennis asked one night over a beer.
“Feels like a play I wasn’t cast in.”

Trevor looked up at the moon.

“That’s the thing. Everyone here wants to be in the play. You’re just not reading the script.”

“So you don’t trust them either?”

Trevor hesitated. That pause again. Carefully timed.

“I trust them to do what they’re told. That’s worse, in some ways.”

⸻

Lena

Lena started walking over after school. Sometimes she’d read on Dennis’s porch swing while he worked on his manuscript. Other times she’d ask odd, clipped questions:

“Have you found the room yet?”
“Do you dream in color or not here?”
“Would you stay if they told you not to?”

Dennis chalked it up to imagination. Or trauma. Or both.
She was a quiet kid in a quiet town. Who wouldn’t act a little weird?

Still, one afternoon, he asked:

“Why do you always ask me questions like that?”

She looked up, entirely blank-faced.

“Because they want to know.”

⸻

The Growing Dread

Dennis started to notice more.
	•	The same man watering the same lawn looked identical from three houses down—but his clothes were never wrinkled, and he never spoke.
	•	The café now served the same soup every day. When he asked if it changed, the server blinked, then said: “No one’s ever asked that before.”
	•	When Dennis walked into the florist one morning, the woman inside stopped mid-conversation, turned to him, and smiled too wide.
“You’ve been here a month,” she said, though he hadn’t told her.
“That’s the time it starts.”

⸻

Trevor’s Garage

One night, Dennis stepped into Trevor’s garage looking for him. Trevor wasn’t home, but the door was open.

There were shelves of tools. Blueprints. Maps of the town. Dozens of them. All annotated in pencil—dates, numbers, circled intersections. Red lines led to spots labeled:

“ENTRY?”
“DOOR?”
“VOICE?”

He found a drawer full of Polaroids. All of them showed the same view: Dennis’s front porch. Taken at night. From a distance. One had a date—July 28th—a day before Dennis had officially moved in.

Another showed him standing in his upstairs window.
He didn’t remember ever standing there.

Trevor returned just as Dennis was shutting the drawer.

“Sorry. Door was open. I didn’t mean to—”

Trevor’s eyes didn’t narrow. His tone didn’t change. But something in his face went still.

“Some things you look for because you’re curious,” he said slowly.
“Some things you look for because you want them to look back.”

“Why are there pictures of my house?” Dennis asked.

“You should go home now, Dennis.”

⸻

But He Didn’t

That night, Dennis stayed up past 3 a.m., watching the woods from his bedroom window.

He saw Lena. Alone. Standing just beyond the edge of the trees.
Motionless. Staring at the house.

Not waving.
Just watching.

He called Trevor the next morning.
No answer.

He walked to their house.
Empty.

Not “moved out” empty.
Stripped.

No furniture. No curtains. No smell of rosemary.
Like they’d never lived there.


Chapter 6: Echoes

August 30th
Dennis knocked on Trevor’s door again that morning, even though he knew no one would answer. The house looked wrong now. Not empty—unclaimed.

The windows were shut. The curtains gone. A thin film of dust coated the doorknob.

But yesterday, just yesterday, there had been bread baking. Lena had been sitting on the porch swing reading Bridge to Terabithia. The wind had chimes in it.

Now: nothing. No swing. No sound.

Dennis walked around the house. Every window showed the same thing—bare floors, clean walls. No sign that anyone had ever lived there.

He circled the property three times before finally walking into town.

⸻

Inquiries

The Sill Café. 10:42 a.m.

Dennis approached the counter. The same barista as always—short brown hair, freckles, name tag that read Anna. Always smiling.

“Hey… weird question,” Dennis said, trying to keep it light.
“Do you know where Trevor Lang is?”

She tilted her head slightly. Smile held. No blink.

“Trevor?”

“Yeah. Guy who lives near the Hollow House. Has a daughter named Lena.”

A pause.

“I don’t think I know who that is.”

“Tall guy. Kind of quiet. Fixes stuff. You’ve definitely seen him. He’s been in here with me.”

“You must be thinking of someone else.”
Smile. Slight lean forward. “You should try the cinnamon muffins today. They’re fresh.”

Dennis stared at her.
She didn’t break eye contact. Not once.

⸻

The Delling Garden

12:15 p.m.

Mara Delling was pruning stalks of something purple and crawling when Dennis approached her fence.

“Mara,” he called. “Did you know Trevor Lang?”

She didn’t turn.

“Trevor,” he said again. “Lives three houses down. Blue-gray house. Daughter named Lena.”

“That house has been empty since the McAllisters left,” she said, not looking at him.
“Before you arrived.”

“That’s not true.”

“Isn’t it?” she asked, standing upright finally. She turned slowly to face him.
Her eyes—Dennis noticed it then. Something behind them. Like looking into the surface of a lake that was too still.
No depth. No reflection. Just… a screen.

“I don’t think I like these questions, Dennis,” she added gently. “They don’t belong here.”

“He fixed my porch,” Dennis snapped. “I’ve had dinner in his house. I’ve talked to his daughter. You talked to him too.”

“You must be remembering something else,” she said, and smiled so softly it made his chest ache.
“People like us need quiet.”

⸻

The General Store

Dennis tore through shelves looking for something—anything—that connected Trevor to the town. A receipt. A note. A posted photo. A mention. Nothing.

He grabbed the store owner—a man with a waxed mustache and perfect posture—by the counter.

“Trevor Lang,” Dennis demanded. “You know that name. He buys parts from here. Screws. Nails. Oil for his truck. You’ve seen him.”

The man blinked once, twice. Then again—too fast.

“You’re not well,” he said. “You should rest.”

Dennis stormed out.

⸻

Proof

That night, Dennis tore apart his home. He knew there had to be something.

And he found it.

In the back of a kitchen drawer, beneath a phone charger and old batteries, was a photo. A Polaroid. Slightly faded.

Dennis and Trevor. On the porch. Holding beers. Laughing.

Dennis stared at it for ten minutes. His fingers trembled. This was real. It had to be.

He flipped it over. On the back, in blocky handwriting:

“July 30th. Looks like you’ll settle in just fine.” — T.

Dennis sat down hard in the middle of the kitchen floor.

And then he noticed something.

His own face in the photo was clear. Smiling.

Trevor’s face, though—

—blurred.

Not out of focus. Not motion blur. But like it had been smeared. Soft-edged. Smudged—as if the camera couldn’t decide what to show.

He ran his thumb across the image.

It was smooth. Not damaged.

Just…wrong.

⸻

The People

The next day, Dennis walked through town watching people. Really watching them.

And he saw it.

Not a feature. Not a gesture. But a kind of absence. The eyes—yes—but more than that. Like the people here were wearing their faces instead of having them.

He passed a man watering his lawn who turned slightly too late when Dennis called his name.
The man waved—but not at him.
At nothing. Then went back to watering.
There was no hose.

At the library, a woman filed the same book three times in a row—alphabetically wrong each time.

At 2:17 p.m., everyone in town turned their heads east at the same time. Held it for three seconds. Then moved on like nothing happened.

Dennis counted. Eighteen people. Same second. All turned. All turned back.

# Best Under Cabinet Power Strip in 2025: Reviews & Guide

The under cabinet power strip has become an indispensable tool for modern kitchens, workshops, and home offices. These strips provide convenient and accessible power outlets right were you need them, eliminating the need to reach across countertops or fumble with extension cords.As technology advances, the 2025 models offer enhanced features like USB-C charging, smart home integration, and improved safety mechanisms. this guide aims to provide you with comprehensive reviews and recommendations to help you choose the best under cabinet power strip to meet your specific needs and preferences.

[[Explore Top Rated under cabinet power strip on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=under cabinet power strip)

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an under cabinet power strip requires careful evaluation of its technical specifications. These features dictate the strip's functionality, safety, and longevity.

**Number of Outlets and USB Ports:**

The ideal number of outlets and USB ports depends on your specific usage scenario. Some models offer a combination of standard AC outlets, USB-A ports, and USB-C ports to accommodate a wide range of devices. Consider the number of small appliances, mobile devices, and other electronics you typically use in the area where the power strip will be installed. Higher-end models even incorporate smart charging functionality that can automatically adjust the power output based on the device connected, preventing overcharging and extending battery life.

**Voltage and Current Rating:**

This specification determines the maximum amount of power the strip can handle without overloading and potentially causing a fire hazard. Typically, under cabinet power strips are rated for 125V and 15A, which is sufficient for most common household appliances. Though, if you plan to use power-hungry devices like blenders, toasters, or power tools, it's crucial to ensure that the power strip's rating meets or exceeds the total wattage of all connected devices.

**Construction Materials and Build quality:**

The materials used in the construction of the power strip significantly impact its durability and safety. Look for models made from fire-retardant materials like polycarbonate or ABS plastic. The internal wiring should be thick enough to handle the rated current without overheating. A well-built power strip will also have a sturdy housing that can withstand everyday wear and tear, as well as accidental impacts.Some higher-end models even feature metal housings for enhanced durability.

**Installation Method and Mounting Options:**

Under cabinet power strips typically come with various mounting options, including screws, adhesive strips, and clips. The best installation method for you will depend on the type of surface you're mounting the strip to, as well as your preference for permanent versus temporary installation. Some models are designed for easy, tool-free installation, while others may require drilling and more advanced installation skills. Consider the accessibility of the mounting location and the ease of wiring before making your decision.

**Safety Features and Certifications:**

Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical devices. Ensure that the power strip is certified by a reputable testing institution like UL or ETL. Look for features like overload protection, surge protection, and short-circuit protection. overload protection prevents the strip from exceeding its rated current, while surge protection safeguards connected devices from voltage spikes. Short-circuit protection instantly cuts off power in the event of a fault, preventing electrical fires.

Key features of the best under cabinet power strips include:

* Multiple AC outlets and USB ports

## FAQs Section

Addressing common inquiries ensures users make informed purchasing decisions.

**Is the under cabinet power strip easy to install?**
Installation difficulty varies depending on the model and mounting method. Many models come with adhesive strips for tool-free installation, while others may require drilling and screws. Typically, installation takes between 15 and 30 minutes. The included manual provides detailed instructions, making the process straightforward for most users. However, if you're not pleasant working with electrical wiring, it's best to consult a qualified electrician.

**What is the maximum wattage that the power strip can handle?**
The maximum wattage depends on the voltage and current rating of the power strip. Most models are rated for 125V and 15A, which translates to a maximum wattage of 1875 watts. It's crucial to ensure that the total wattage of all connected devices does not exceed this limit to prevent overloading and potential hazards. Exceeding the wattage limit can cause the power strip to overheat, trip the circuit breaker, or even cause a fire.

**Does the power strip have surge protection?**
Most under cabinet power strips come equipped with surge protection to safeguard connected devices from voltage spikes. Surge protection works by diverting excess voltage away from the devices, protecting them from damage. The level of surge protection is typically measured in joules,with higher joule ratings indicating greater protection. Look for models with a surge protection rating of at least 500 joules for optimal protection.

**can the power strip be used in a humid environment like a bathroom?**
While some under cabinet power strips may be suitable for use in slightly humid environments like kitchens, they are generally not recommended for use in bathrooms or other areas with high humidity. Moisture can damage the electrical components of the power strip and increase the risk of electrical shock. If you need a power strip for a bathroom, look for models specifically designed for use in humid environments and that are GFCI-protected.

By [Offical_Boogyman]

Chapter 1: The Visit

July 27th

Dennis Whitaker didn’t think of it as running away—just repositioning. Resetting.

After the divorce, the layoff, and that one week in May where he didn’t leave the apartment except to buy coffee and return to bed, something had snapped. Not in a dramatic way. Quietly. Like a rubber band losing its tension.

He found the ad on a forum for vintage architecture. A user named H. Dreven had posted about a house:

“1880s Victorian in pristine condition. Located in Grayer Ridge, WA. Ideal for quiet living. Great light, great bones. Ideal for writers, artists, and solitary types.”

No phone number. Just an email.
Dennis sent a message on a whim. Got a reply that same night.

“Come see it for yourself. House shows better in person.”
Directions were attached. Hand-written. Strangely specific.
“Avoid GPS. Turn left at the white fence, not the stone one. You’ll see a red mailbox—ignore it.”

⸻

July 29th – Grayer Ridge, Washington

The first thing Dennis noticed was the air—cleaner than he was used to, like it had just rained even though the skies were clear.

Grayer Ridge emerged through a bend in the road, tucked into a green hollow surrounded by forest. At first glance, it was idyllic. Almost aggressively so.

The houses were color-coordinated—cheerful yellows, soft blues, pale greens. Lawns were perfectly trimmed. No weeds. Flower boxes overflowed with bright, chirping color. Even the sidewalks looked swept.

There was a vintage barbershop with a rotating pole. A general store with candy in glass jars. A café where every umbrella was perfectly centered above each table.

No chain stores. No traffic. Just people. Walking. Smiling. Waving.
Too friendly. Too…timed.

⸻

The House on Ashbone Lane

Dennis followed a narrow drive to the end of Ashbone Lane, where the houses thinned into a grove of silver pines. His future home stood proudly behind a black iron gate:

Number 38.

It was beautiful. Three stories, cream-colored siding, hunter-green trim, deep wraparound porch with two white rocking chairs that didn’t creak or sway. The glass was clean. The roof looked new.

Perfect. Too perfect.
He felt like he was stepping into a catalog.

The key was under a stone frog statue on the porch.
Exactly where Dreven had said it would be.

⸻

Inside

The inside smelled faintly of cedar and lemon polish. Not a speck of dust. The hardwood floors gleamed. The walls were pale eggshell and crisp white. Every room was flooded with natural light.

There was a sunroom with tall, arched windows. A reading nook built into the stairwell. A fireplace framed in green tile, flanked by shelves stocked with hardcovers. It looked like it belonged in a magazine—staged, but not lived in.

Dennis ran a hand across the countertop in the kitchen. Granite. Not a single fingerprint. The fridge was unplugged. The pantry empty. But everything was clean. Ready.

The attic door didn’t budge when he tried it, but it didn’t feel threatening. Just old. Settled.

The perfection of it all made something tighten in his stomach. It felt prepared. Like it had been waiting for him.

⸻

Meeting Dreven

He met H. Dreven at a shaded patio table outside the café. The man was tall, long-faced, with thin fingers and a low, precise voice. He wore an old-fashioned pocket watch and never looked directly at Dennis.

“The house suits you,” Dreven said. “You seem like someone who likes things in order.”

“It’s beautiful,” Dennis admitted. “Honestly, I expected it to be falling apart for this price.”

“It’s been taken care of,” Dreven said, brushing something invisible from the table.
“Homes like this—old ones—they do better when someone’s watching over them.”

“What’s the catch?”

Dreven didn’t laugh. He just blinked slowly.

“No catch. Just rules. Keep the windows shut on windy nights. And don’t dig in the back garden.”

Dennis waited for more, but Dreven stood. Transaction over.

“People here value quiet,” he added. “You’ll fit in.”

⸻

Chapter 2: Settling In

August 2nd

Dennis arrived with a moving van and a checklist. He didn’t bring much—books, clothes, a turntable, his writing setup. He was going to take this seriously. Focus. Finish the novel he hadn’t touched in two years.

Grayer Ridge welcomed him with sunshine and polite nods.

The same children rode bikes past the same picket fences. Same man watering the same roses. Same couple walking a fluffy white dog—morning, noon, and night.

No one seemed hurried. No one ever looked at their phones.

⸻

The House

The house was exactly as he left it. No strange noises. No cold spots. No creaks. Just space and light. It didn’t feel haunted. It didn’t feel alive.

It felt… ready.

By the third night, he noticed something odd.

Every night at 9:06 PM, the porch light clicked on by itself. He hadn’t set a timer.

He told himself it was probably on a sensor. Nothing unusual.

Still, he logged it in his notebook.

⸻

Chapter 3: The Neighbors

August 5th

That morning, Dennis met Mara Delling—a sharp-eyed woman in her 60s with silvery hair and long skirts. She offered him a jar of plum preserves.

“For your mornings. Helps the dreams settle,” she said with a small smile.

“You make this yourself?”

“My late sister’s recipe,” she said. “She still watches the stove, I think.”

Dennis laughed lightly, but Mara didn’t. She just nodded and looked up at the house.

“That place always finds someone.”

He didn’t ask what she meant.

⸻

Later that week, he met Trevor Lang, a mechanic who lived three houses down. He was tall, balding, and always seemed to be wearing gloves—even when drinking coffee.

“Place looks good,” Trevor said, eyeing the house.
“Better than it used to. Funny how it cleans up for some folks.”

“You know who lived there before?”

Trevor shook his head.

“Doesn’t matter now. You’re here. That’s the important part.”

He stared at Dennis for a moment too long before adding:

“You sleep okay? First few weeks can be… loud.”

“No, it’s been quiet,” Dennis said.

“Mm.” Trevor smiled.
“Give it time.”

⸻

More Neighbors

On August 7th, Dennis met Lyle and Catherine Wren, a couple in their early 40s who lived across the green.

They were nice. Too nice.

They brought him a covered dish—casserole of some kind—and asked to come inside.

“We just love what you’ve done with it already,” Catherine said, though he hadn’t changed a thing.

“Didn’t think the house would choose someone so young,” Lyle added with a warm smile.
“Usually takes to widows. Or quiet types.”

Dennis laughed, uncertain.

“What do you mean ‘choose’?”

“Oh, just neighborhood talk,” Catherine said, brushing her hand through the air like smoke.
“Old houses have character. You’ll see.”

They stayed too long. When they finally left, Dennis watched them walk in perfect unison down the street until they rounded the corner and vanished—too fast.

⸻

Things That Don’t Sit Right
	•	Every morning, the birds outside chirp in the same rhythm. Like a loop.
	•	The mailman walks by but never delivers anything.
	•	A black cat appears on the porch at 3:33 AM. It doesn’t leave paw prints.
	•	A humming sound comes from the walls. Not loud. Just there.

Dennis tries to ignore it. He tells himself it’s just the stress of the move. The silence after city life. But something isn’t settling right.

Not with the neighbors.
Not with the town.
And especially not with the house that doesn’t need fixing.",1,1754649001.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1mkrkx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1mkrkx1/art_of_perfumery_course_at_isipca_versailles/,"Art of Perfumery course at ISIPCA, Versailles, France - Part 2 (review)","I had asked for comments from people here about a 2-week perfumery course at ISIPCA, Versailles, named Art of Perfumery ""A La Francaise"".

[Earlier post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1j08zmu/art_of_perfumery_course_at_isipca_versailles/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

***This is a review of the course after attending it.*** *There is no real reason to read this unless you are planning to take a course on perfumery.*

I had the opportunity to attend the 2-week course at ISIPCA in Versailles, France during June 28-July 11.  It is the course titled “""Art of perfumery à la française"" focusing on fine perfumes.  They have two other courses running at the same time on cosmetics and flavors.  Here is a brief review of the course. 

 ***Caveats:*** My opinions usually tend to be skewed because of my past educational/career background and where I am in my life.  I tend to look at things objectively, thinking acutely about value per dollar while ignoring a lot of social and emotional benefits.  

 ***Cost:*** The course, flight to Paris (Iceland Air) and accommodation (Vrbo) alone cost me about $6000.  This cost alone makes the course very expensive, and out of reach for many people.  I don’t think I could have economized further.  So, there are good online courses worth considering as alternatives.

 ***Overall organization***:  The course was poorly organized.  Coming from America, I was expecting to get a binder with the schedule, printed handouts of lectures etc.  We didn’t get any.  The cursory schedule was handed out three days into the course.  The course could have been far superior if someone had put in a few hours of extra work.  We spent a lot of time searching for raw materials, which were either unavailable or labeled in French.  The organizers did not really have a good idea who the target is for this course. Beginners, enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, those currently in perfumery, ….?

 ***Lecture content***:  The lectures were mostly meandering informal conversations.  What works in a casual coffee shop conversation doesn’t work in a course when it costs $500 per day.  The lectures were hampered by the lack of overall design and organization of the course.  The marketing lectures (10% of the overall course) were too narrow and focused on solely on advertising and messaging.  Nothing was taught about the overall commercialization plans, entrepreneurship, or the industry itself.

 ***Laboratory content:***  This was obviously the most enjoyable part of the course for most students.  The group was split into two, and each group had its own plan (or lack thereof).  So, these two groups had very different learning experience.  I had Sebastien Plan as our instructor.  Sebastien comes with a lot of experience as a perfumer.  See https://abstractionparis.com/en-en/pages/parfumeurs.  It was amazing working with a master perfumer.  Sebastien followed a simple but very effective format.  During the first week, he gave us the formulae for common accords like chypre, Fougere, rose, orange blossom etc.  We made chypre and Fougere base and then worked to make our own scents.  In the second week, we conceptualized our own perfumes and designed them, obviously with help from the instructor.  

 The guidance of an experienced perfumer matters a lot in a course like this.  None of us beginners know the relative intensity of each ingredient.  For example, you could ethyl vanillin to produce a vanilla note in your perfume.  But if you add more than 0.1 gram of ethyl vanillin (10% alcohol solution) in 10 grams of your perfume, you will smell nothing but vanilla.  Same thing if you use birch essential oil to create smokiness.  But the white musks can be used in abundance.  Hedione, galaxolide and Iso E Super can each be 2 grams in the final 10 grams. The students would have eventually figured all this out over many days, but it is better to have someone tell us the relative intensities.  Sebastien's knowledge was also critical in choosing the appropriate raw materials to produce the intended olfactory image.  

 The seven days spent in the lab mixing and smelling (and sharing the smells) was a great experience.  For me, the most amazing learning experience was smelling and familiarizing the raw ingredients, both natural and synthetic. 

 ***Networking:*** I learnt a lot about perfume design and manufacturing, simply by talking to fellow students.  The students were a lovely group of people with diverse backgrounds.  I am particularly indebted to a friend from Lebanon who shared a lot of insights on raw-materials and commercialization.  This gentleman markets dupes in the Lebanese market, so I got some great exposure to less developed markets too.   

The demographics of this student body had some interesting groupings.  We had Arab men involved in dupe business, Asian women entrepreneurs into candles and education, Latina women who worked with perfume companies like Givaudan, European women making perfumes for boutique hotels, and American men like me, who cannot be described as anything but “esthetes” who were having a jolly good time.  I was curious why we didn’t have other groupings.  Why no Latino men interested in boutique perfumes, why no Asian men interested in corporate perfumery etc.

 ***Conclusion***: I was in France when Paris was experiencing a historically high heat wave.  I was also limping around with a sports injury to my knee.  I am sure these things impacted by feelings towards this course and ISIPCA.  I would recommend this course if you wanted to get a general idea about perfumes, but only if money is no object.  I cannot justify the cost of this course with what we get out of it.  

 ***Alternatives:***  There are similar courses offered by Grasse Institute of Perfumery (Grasse), Cinquieme Sens (Paris), etc.  I hear great things about the Grasse courses from those who attended them.  Their online courses are also very good.  But then you don’t get to enjoy Paris.  For me, multiple visits to the boutiques of Jovoy Paris, Nose Paris, and others are an essential part of the perfume experience.

1mkrkva,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1mkrkva/betterme_intermittent_fasting_plateau/,BetterMe: Intermittent Fasting Plateau,"Ever felt stuck despite sticking to your fasting routine? You're not alone—plateaus happen when your body adapts to the new rhythm, slowing progress. But the good news? There are plenty of effective ways to shake things up and restart momentum.

# Why It Happens

* **Metabolic adaptation**: As you lose weight, your body needs fewer calories to sustain itself, making further fat loss slower.
* **Underestimating intake**: It’s easy to consume more than you realize during eating windows—or drift toward processed or high-calorie foods, undermining the deficit.
* **Stress, poor sleep, dehydration**: Elevated cortisol, inadequate rest, and low hydration can all stall metabolic activity.

# Strategies to Get Unstuck

* **Vary your fasting schedule**: Try mixing up your fasting windows—swap 16:8 for 18:6 or stretch to a full-day fast occasionally. This “metabolic surprise” can re-ignite weight loss.
* **Plan refeed or maintenance breaks**: Take planned short breaks—eating at maintenance for a few days or using a controlled cheat/refeed. It can reset hormones and jumpstart metabolism.
* **Dial in nutrient quality**: Prioritize protein, fiber, and whole foods. Cut down on sugars and ultra-processed options. Nutrient-rich meals help manage hunger and keep your metabolism strong.
* **Mix up movement**: Add strength training, HIIT, or just change your exercise pattern to keep your body guessing and elevate metabolic rate.
* **Focus on hydration, stress, and sleep**: Drink plenty of water (including herbal tea or black coffee during sessions), manage stress through mindfulness or relaxation, and aim for consistent, quality sleep.
* **Track progress smartly**: Use logging apps or journals to keep tabs on intake, workouts, and weight trends. Awareness is key to staying on course.
