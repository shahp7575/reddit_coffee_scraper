1jxznnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jxznnv/there_is_something_in_my_house/,There is something in my house,"There is something in my house. 

This started about a month ago when I started hearing things, at first I had though I was experiencing auditory hallucinations from being alone so often. Since I barely leave my house, order groceries to my door and barely have friends to invite me out. So my house is my dome.

But because of the frequent hearing door opening noises or walking above me upstairs, noises that weren't mine, I'd gone to investigate where it came from. So walking from the kitchen to the upstairs bathroom, I noticed that my shampoo bottle had been on my bathroom sink instead of the ridge in the shower. 
  I know that I wouldn't do that, I spend a lot of my alone free time organizing and reorganizing. So I would never have put the shampoo there.

After 2 weeks of those small noticings they had gotten bigger my pots and pans would be splayed out on my living room floor, I would find my TV on my dining room table. This drove me incredibly insane, everything unorganized and out of place. 
I had looked in so many place where this thing could have been hiding. 

One night, I had seen a tall thing out side my upstairs bedroom window. A tall, white thing. Running to the barn just behind My house. I had been creeped out beyond All physical belief. Now i had known there was something in my house, or near it like my barn. 

 Now, in this past week. Things have gone missing instead of out of place, with the biggest thing being 2 of the chairs around my dining table or coffee table in the middle of my living room. 
 I hadn't known where these things had gone, and I was way to stupidly scared to check the barn where that thing had ran off to.

Now as I am writing this, I am in my basement. One I've never dared to step foot in since I've bought this house, I was walking down to get a snack from my kitchen fridge, as scratching came of the wooden basement door. As if a dog had been doing it, a very big dog. 

I made a stupid decision to open the door. The door, opening towards the basement flung open as I leaned against it to force the build up and debris on it to open. 
I fell down a flight of stairs, I just woke up from banging my head so hard I passed out. Looking in front of me, a small light hung from the ceiling. My 2 chairs, my coffee table and a old 70s TV on a dresser from my childhood home which both I stored in my barn had been splayed out in front of me as if someone was making a living down here. 

 The only thing that seems more off than the objects is the non-human like face I see in the mist of darkness that the light bulbs stingy light just can't reach‚Ä¶ my hands are shaking horribly as I right this. I do not know what this thing wants, but I feel drawn to walk towards it.

Last year, he confessed his feelings. He never pressured me‚Äîhe just said he‚Äôd wait and hoped I‚Äôd eventually feel the same. We went on one date, but then he made a joke that didn‚Äôt sit well with me. It wasn‚Äôt intentional, but I felt disrespected enough to cut ties with him around April or May.

Then this January, we randomly ran into each other at a coffee shop. It was a casual ‚Äúkamusta,‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt feel any anger anymore. He apologized sincerely, and we slowly reconnected. The closeness came back. He invited me to hang out again, introduced me to his parents. Even if we were ‚Äújust friends,‚Äù it was obvious he still had feelings.

Eventually, he told me he had accepted that I didn‚Äôt like him back. And I was honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have feelings for him at the time. But I told him I didn‚Äôt want to lose him again. After that conversation, things changed. He slowly pulled back. We stopped talking as often. And I didn‚Äôt realize until then‚Ä¶ I had already fallen for him.

At first, I didn‚Äôt like him physically. He wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äútype.‚Äù But he was kind, respectful, helpful, and genuinely a good person. Now I see all the green flags I used to overlook. I think the connection built over time through real friendship and presence. I started missing him. Not for the favors or help‚Äîjust for him.

Now I‚Äôm the one catching feelings. And maybe it‚Äôs too late.

But now that he‚Äôs slowly disappeared from my life, it stings. Some days I feel like I want to cut him off mentally just to move on. But emotionally? I still care. I still love him. I miss him every single day. And yeah, it hurts.

I know I showed him I wasn‚Äôt interested, so I can‚Äôt blame him for stepping away. But I can‚Äôt pretend this doesn‚Äôt leave a heavy weight in my chest.",1,1744518724.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1jxzfon,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxzfon,Hiding Things From My Husband (not like that),"So my husband and I have been together for almost 10 years, and have recently (finally) been on a ‚Äúweight loss journey‚Äù.  We‚Äôve both lost a fair amount of weight and I‚Äôm extremely proud of us, but we have a lot more to go. We‚Äôre both doing the keto diet (no, not ‚Äúdirty keto‚Äù) and it‚Äôs working great for us. 
However, like everyone, we have individual needs and issues with food. I have a problem with not wanting to eat full meals, and just grazing throughout the day. My husband, on the other hand, has a problem with self-control. We‚Äôve had discussions in the past about how I feel that he should work on that issue instead of accepting it, but I just want what‚Äôs best for him at the end of the day (but that‚Äôs another topic). So in the meantime, I have agreed to hide certain food from him. 

We have these keto chocolates, and while I might eat one or two a day, if he has full access to them he will eat them until he is full. I found this fake book and began hiding all of the chocolates in there, and I divvy out one or two a day into a candy dish. It has worked great so far! Also it gives my apartment a haunted house/secret study vibe lol. 

The fridge, however, is a lot more challenging. I find that I can have a hotdog every once in a while if I am too tired to make dinner, and it keeps me from just eating snacks. (Before you say it, they are a good brand with clean ingredients and I use a keto bun). My husband really didn‚Äôt want me to buy them, because he said that he will eat them for every meal if he knows that they‚Äôre in the fridge (because they‚Äôre quick and yummy). I told him I would hide them. My first attempt was just to see if he would actively look for them. I put them in a baggie inside of a brown paper bag and put them in the very back of the fridge. We have a lot of fresh food in our fridge so they weren‚Äôt even visible. But he still found them! And I only found out because they‚Äôre almost all gone üò≠üíÄ. 
So here is my current idea (pictured). I‚Äôm mostly posting this because the absurdity of it has me laughing every time I see it. There‚Äôs a super low chance he would ever grab the coffee creamer specifically, since I like to make us our coffees when we have them, and the creamer kinda sucks anyway haha. But picturing him accidentally dunking a wiener into a cup of coffee is killing me üòÜ

IBS symtoms or I just have IBS?

I cant remember exactly but i started experincing bowel issues around the time i started med maybe few months after Im not sure if i just deveoped bc of poor diet (ive now changed that diet so prob not) or if i developed it geneticly my father has diberticulitus (idk how to spell) my uncle has colitous and my mom had IBS temporarally bc of stress. so who knows. I never struggled with it before only until about a ffew months after i started the meds but deffinetly not right away. my symtoms primaraly consist of consipation, painful bloating, gas burping and the other one, as well as having trigger foods such as fried foods and carbs. Somtimes if i even eat all the right foods I still get the symtoms! its so frustrating!

Docter changing doseage?

I am thinking of going to the docter to lessening my doseage to maybe lessen the symtoms. it did get so bad where i had to go to the hospital once and the pain was so bad they thought it was my apendix. turned out it was just a very bad bowl flare up and ive had a few in the past maybe 5. this is starting to affect my daily life. its so hard to choose over my mental health or my physical health. as well as not being able to afford therapy.

1jxzea1,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1jxzea1/aita_was_just_told_at_work_that_im_bossy_and_that/,AITA? Was just told at work that I‚Äôm ‚Äúbossy‚Äù and that other people have been annoyed with me. I literally had no idea.,"So I (30F) work at a hotel, at the front desk and was taking a break with my boss (who is a friend) and we were talking about the possibility of me becoming a supervisor. It‚Äôs not a definite thing, just a position that management‚Äôs thinking about opening because no one wants to work nights and they want someone available to assist with guests or night audit. I‚Äôm the only team member who‚Äôs completely flexible in my schedule and is willing to cover people. 

So basically she was saying that if I wanted the job I‚Äôd need to step it up with my performance( no more little mistakes)which I don‚Äôt make often, but I always take accountability for when I do and do my best not to make again. But then she said ‚ÄúOh and you need to work on your bossiness. It‚Äôs pissing people off.‚Äù Um, what??

I was so shocked, I was like ‚Äúwhat do you mean? Bossy? What did I do?‚Äù Because as far as I knew everything was fine and all my coworkers liked me. I always say hello to everyone and they say hi back, no one ignores me so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm being excluded. In fact everyone jokes with me and communicates with me about what I need to know to do my job. And just to be clear I don‚Äôt make jokes about people at their expense. That‚Äôs rude and mean and also one of the easiest ways to get fired. 

So she just says ‚ÄúYeah, you know, sometimes you can be bossy. Just bossy.‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúI actually didn‚Äôt, can you please give me an example? Because if I was rude to someone and didn‚Äôt realize I don‚Äôt want to do it again so I need to know what the specific behavior is.‚Äù 

And she said she couldn‚Äôt tell me who complained just that it was multiple people. And I said ‚Äúno I get that, but what behavior is it specifically? I won‚Äôt know what to correct if you don‚Äôt tell me.‚Äù 

So basically she tells me that sometimes when I‚Äôm talking to my coworkers, I don‚Äôt always say please and thank you. And that sometimes I interrupt conversations. And that it comes across as me telling people what to do. Ok fair, that wasn‚Äôt my intention but that‚Äôs not what matters, impact is. But then she goes on to say that when the idea of me becoming a supervisor was floated to other managers there were some hard no‚Äôs because they were worried that I‚Äôd become a TYRANT if given that position. 

And I was just shocked. I told her ‚Äúok I hear you on all the other stuff, that‚Äôs me being a little socially inept, and I will definitely reflect on that but a tyrant? What do you mean telling people what to do?‚Äù 

She said ‚Äú you know like when you‚Äôre telling people about an issue sometimes you say (hey x is broken) instead of ( hey y can you fix x? It broke again)‚Äù and I just said ‚Äúyeah I definitely do that, it‚Äôs mostly after I‚Äôve already done the second version and I‚Äôm just updating the person on a situation again and I also say please and thank you just as much.‚Äù 

She said ‚Äúno I‚Äôve heard you do it before. And it pisses people off.‚Äù She then told me that I just pissed off a manger yesterday(who has never mentioned or even hinted that I‚Äôve been inappropriate or rude with him and is on a joking basis with me)
 
And that I was rude to him at the end of the day when I came into the back office and told him about a situation with a room. All I said  was ‚ÄúHey room 224 didn‚Äôt get cleaned today. I already talked to the guest and they‚Äôre ok. I just brought them some towels and coffee. Just wanted to let you know.‚Äù That‚Äôs it, I didn‚Äôt raise my voice. I wasn‚Äôt disrespectful to him or accusing him of anything. I was just telling him about an issue with the room and that I‚Äôd handled it, but apparently when I left the room, he was just like ‚Äúwhat the fuck?!‚Äù 

And that earlier in the week I had interrupted a conversation that he was having in his office, but I remember the incident and it was with his door half open so I couldn‚Äôt see that he was talking to anyone and I was just saying hi as I was clocking in and then I said oh sorry for interrupting, and then left? 

I just told her thanks for letting me know and I‚Äôll work on it.

My biggest thing is why was this never brought up? So that I could be aware of how I‚Äôm coming off and have time to correct myself. Especially when we‚Äôve been talking about the supervisor position for AWHILE. And I‚Äôm not angry that certain people don‚Äôt like me. That‚Äôs just going to happen at any job you have, but it was never my intention to come off like I think I‚Äôm better than others. 

And I‚Äôm mortified that people would perceive me that way and I‚Äôm going to be more aware of how I‚Äôm interacting with my coworkers. 

But this new knowledge is also bringing up feelings of resentment because not only am I the only person who‚Äôs willing to work odd hours and cover people(and they call out a lot) but I‚Äôm also the only person who does not claim my meal and rest break penalty‚Äôs when I don‚Äôt have someone to cover me( happens multiple times a week, because all the managers like to leave at 5 or earlier). Money that I could really use. Which I was asked to do to be seen as a team player and with the understanding that it would make me look good for the supervisor position. And it‚Äôs been months. 

I know that these are two separate issues, but now I‚Äôm thinking that I don‚Äôt want the drama thats clearly going to come with the position and I just don‚Äôt know what to do next. And the fact that I‚Äôm friends with my boss just makes this even more difficult. So, do you guys think that I‚Äôve been acting inappropriately and that I‚Äôm an asshole or do you think that I‚Äôm just direct? Either way I‚Äôm just gonna keep my head down and keep working, but fuck man I did not expect that.",4,1744517815.0,managers,5,0.75,False

I love collection designer stuff. I have a hand full of designer and niche stuff. But you‚Äôll notice a lot of my frags are cheapies or clones. There‚Äôs a few I want to talk about considering how good they are in my opinion. But will never be like the OG as I completely understand.

Vamos leather and Opulence Leather (Ombr√© Leather TF Clone 

Both of these smell extremely close to TF but vamos wins the race in this one. I got vamos completely random in TJ max and was surprised on how identical it smelled to ombr√© leather. Even my neighbor who‚Äôs also a big fraghead said it smells identical and he has TF.

I love memo Paris I dream of eventually having one of every fragrance in my collection. But for now African leather and Russian leather are my two in my collection.

Lataffa Khamara and just lataffa fragrances in general never miss. They aren‚Äôt always exactly on their take on fragrances but a lot of them smell similar to a lot of popular fragrances and have a unique vibe as well. I plan to buy more from that house.

Prada you can‚Äôt go wrong. I only own carbon but it‚Äôs my summer scent for sure. The summer heat makes the sillage very intense. 

Sauvage EDP is great, my wife loves it, can be a little strong though in certain situations. I sometimes spray my wife‚Äôs pillow with it before I leave for work because I work long hours and she says smelling my cologne makes her happy. I come home after a 10 hour shift and the room smells like Sauvage üòÇ

The rest are just some of my favorites and cheapies I‚Äôve acquired over the years.

I just found this group. My mom is currently in the last days of her life after making the best of a degenerative challenge. It's been four years since my father and I adjusted the family home to meet her wishes and help her be comfortable as things ran their course. We've had tremendous aide from the county with nurses and equipment. 

I thought I was processing well until I went to work today and broke down within an hour. My managers gave me the day to spend with my parents, and I, knowing that I needed to process my emotions, went on a hike and just let myself exist. 

Regardless of giving myself the time, of course, the time to cry ceased, and I have just been in grief all day. I am trying to make the best of the remaining time and be around her. I am familiar with mental health and work in the field. I feel at odds because I have the tools, yet I cannot process and come to terms with everything. I know this is going to take time. I cannot understand what is happening, even though my dad and I have been through this with her.

I have been spending the night while she rests in coffee shops, soaking in the environment and working on schoolwork. I know I am doing my best, and there is no timeline. I'm not looking for advice; I just need to get these words out into the world and be in a constructive environment while everything runs its course.

I never saw myself as the kind of person who would have feelings for someone else once I was committed. But that changed in August 2019 when I started a new job and met Margaret (35F). I still remember the exact date, August 17. That was the first time since meeting my wife that I felt completely smitten with someone else.

Margaret and I worked at the same school. I played it cool, but from day one, I was drawn to her. Over the school year, we became good friends. During COVID and into the summer, we grew even closer. We texted constantly. I‚Äôd leave her little things like coffee, candy, or sticky notes. She‚Äôd sometimes send me a ‚Äúü•∫‚Äù text early in the morning, and I‚Äôd show up with her favorite coffee order like some lovesick teenager.

I knew she was dating. And I was married. But it didn‚Äôt stop me from floating every time I was around her. I thought I was losing it until I noticed she seemed to go out of her way to be around me too.

That Christmas, I gave her gifts and a letter explaining how I felt. She didn‚Äôt say anything that night, but when I called her about it later, she was very clear that we were just coworkers and it couldn‚Äôt be more. After that, she stopped talking to me. Blocked me on Instagram, unfriended me on Facebook, and avoided me at work.

Eventually, we started talking a bit again, but it was never the same. She kept things strictly professional. Still, our connection felt strong under the surface. That spring, we would sometimes text a lot and then stop for a while. On and off. And I was still just as into her.

Then one of her friends told me Margaret did have feelings for me, but she didn‚Äôt want to do anything unless I had officially separated from my wife. She didn‚Äôt want to feel like it was her fault.

So I left my wife. Got a divorce. And even then, Margaret didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I did everything I could to show her that none of it was her fault. Eventually, I gave her space. Later, I found out she was back to dating and had me blocked on everything, including my number.

Now I‚Äôm remarried to a wonderful woman. Margaret is married too, to a good man who seems to be doing really well for her.

And yet, I still think about her. I still have the texts, the silly pictures, the voice notes. I love my wife, but I still catch myself imagining what life could have been like with Margaret. Everything I wanted with her is just impossible now. We‚Äôre both too far along in different lives. I‚Äôll never be the man she grows old with.

I‚Äôve heard it took her a long time to get over what happened between us. It hurts to think maybe we could have had something real if I had handled it all differently. I know I‚Äôm lucky in so many ways. I know many people would love to have the life I do now. But I still miss her.

That‚Äôs where shit gets weird. They are so good to me, in fact, I‚Äôm lacking bringing up my needs for compensation for a job I do all too well (managerial rolls I‚Äôve never been paid for such as inventory, employee management and  deep cleaning that no one else does.)

I‚Äôm the only person doing any kind of deep cleaning or care for their business. When I first started with this (very small) business in a rural town (I‚Äôm talking the most rural you can get in WNC) I was pregnant and I felt like more care was taken to me then than now. I had more help, more resources etc.

There is another person doing ‚Äúmy job‚Äù aka the job I did before I had my son‚Ä¶ who worked for a corporate chain (Starbucks) for many more years before me doing a similar job (barista) and they think the sun actually shines out of her ass. They are deeply in bed with this person who is slowly driving their business into the ground day by day. I‚Äôve had regulars tell me they no longer patronize us while she‚Äôs there because ‚Äúx‚Äù reason, but still the owners think she is just the best. So much so she makes more than me, and anyone else, plays DND at their home and seems more like a friendship than a working relationship. Me? I‚Äôve spent hundreds of dollars of my own money training to be a *good* coffee maker and customer service sales person for the company. I‚Äôm not treated as such at all. 

Now? I‚Äôm not even being paid on time. Honestly 1/3 of my checks are going to overdraft fees from my bills coming out when I‚Äôm not being paid on time. 

I‚Äôve tried to get up the nerve to say something but I‚Äôm neurodivergent and standing up for myself is hard. I tried to today before my boss just happened to bring me my check (2 days late) and my husband can cover our bills until I get paid but I should be getting paid every week on Friday. This (being paid on time) has happened maybe 5 times since I started working there almost 2 years ago? 

I‚Äôm very close with the wife side of the ownership. I feel like I could tell her anything. But she‚Äôs not the main voice (or pocket) of the business. It‚Äôs the man of the situation who ‚Äúruns everything‚Äù while being too busy to run a business he opened. 

There has been many other things to make me ornery here- I asked for a regularly open shift (as a struggling parent) and they originally told me no. They needed to leave the shifts open for high schoolers during the summer. 

Ok. Cool. I‚Äôll look for other jobs in the area during those times where I could make some money. I got a serious offer, asked the owner for a good reference. What do you know? Suddenly that Saturday shift is open for me now. 

I‚Äôm just at my wits end here. I don‚Äôt want to beg to be paid, but my options being severely rural are limited.

Strategies for Repairing a Marriage: Steps You Can Take When You Feel the Need to Fix Your Marriage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you feel your marriage is faltering, it can be overwhelming. You might think, ""I need to fix my marriage,"" which is the first step towards improvement. Acknowledging the need for change is crucial, and taking action can breathe new life into your relationship. Here are practical strategies you can implement right away.

### Open and Honest Communication

Effective communication forms the backbone of any healthy marriage. Begin by sitting down with your partner in a calm environment. Share your feelings without blaming or criticizing. Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel hurt when‚Ä¶"" This approach opens the door for your partner to understand your perspective and vice versa. Make sure to actively listen without interrupting. This mutual exchange fosters empathy, strengthening your connection.

### Spend Quality Time Together

Life gets busy, and it's easy to put your relationship on the back burner. Prioritize time with your spouse, doing activities you both enjoy. Whether it‚Äôs a weekly date night, cooking together, or taking a walk, these moments build memories and connection. Focus on your partner during this time, putting away distractions like phones or TV. This attention reassures them of your commitment.

### Address Underlying Issues

To repair your marriage, it's essential to address any underlying problems head-on. Reflect on patterns or issues that have caused friction, whether it be finances, parenting styles, or intimacy. Create a safe space to explore these topics. It may feel uncomfortable, but identifying these issues is crucial to moving forward.

### Seek Professional Help

Sometimes, getting outside help is necessary. Consider seeing a marriage counselor or therapist who specializes in relationship issues. A neutral party can provide valuable perspectives, tools, and techniques to help you navigate challenges together. Therapy offers a structured environment to discuss feelings and issues cathartically.

### Increase Emotional Intimacy

Rekindling emotional intimacy can go a long way in repairing your marriage. Share your dreams, fears, and everyday experiences with your partner. Engage in deep conversations where you explore thoughts and feelings beyond surface-level discussions. Be vulnerable and encourage your spouse to do the same. This practice can forge deeper connections and understanding.

### Set Goals Together

Working towards shared goals can strengthen your bond. Discuss what both of you want for your future, be it travel, family, or career aspirations. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. These shared objectives create a sense of unity and purpose, reminding you both of why you fell in love in the first place.

### Practice Forgiveness

Holding on to past grievances can be toxic to relationships. To fix your marriage, consider the power of forgiveness. Letting go of past mistakes, both yours and your partner‚Äôs, is essential for healing. Understand that no one is perfect. Talk through the issues that hurt you, and once you express those feelings, work towards forgiving and moving on together.

### Show Appreciation Regularly

Taking the time to acknowledge the efforts of your spouse can have a significant positive impact. Express gratitude for small things they do daily‚Äîmaking coffee, doing chores, or just being there. Simple acts of appreciation can reignite positivity in the relationship and remind each other of your love.

### Be Patient and Committed

Remember, fixing a marriage takes time and effort from both partners. Stay committed even when the path seems tough. Celebrate small victories along the way and understand that setbacks may occur. Approach these moments with openness and patience, and continue to communicate honestly.

In closing, the journey of repairing a marriage may not be easy, but with dedication and effort from both sides, it‚Äôs entirely possible. Embrace the process, and by doing so, you‚Äôll not only fix your marriage but also strengthen the bond you share.

Communication Techniques That Strengthen Relationships and Help You Overcome Challenges
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective communication is the cornerstone of any strong relationship. When you understand how to express yourself clearly, listen attentively, and respond with empathy, you open pathways that foster deeper connections. If you find yourself facing challenges in your marriage, implementing specific communication techniques can make a significant difference. Here are several strategies to help you enhance communication and strengthen your bond.

### Active Listening

Listening is more than just hearing words; it involves engaging fully with your partner. Here‚Äôs how to practice active listening:

- **Give Full Attention:** Put aside distractions, such as your phone or television. Focus completely on your partner.
- **Clarify and Reflect:** Repeat back what you heard to clarify understanding. For example, ‚ÄúWhat I hear you saying is‚Ä¶‚Äù
- **Avoid Interrupting:** Let your partner finish their thoughts without interruptions. This shows respect and value for their feelings.

- **Body Language:** Use open and inviting body language. Lean slightly forward to show engagement.
- **Eye Contact:** Maintain eye contact to convey attentiveness and sincerity.
- **Facial Expressions:** Ensure your facial expressions match the message you want to convey.

### Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù Statements

When discussing issues, using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements can drastically reduce defensiveness. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúYou never listen to me,‚Äù try saying, ‚ÄúI feel unheard when you look at your phone while I‚Äôm talking.‚Äù This approach leads to a more constructive dialogue because it expresses your feelings without blaming your partner.

### Practice Empathy

Empathy helps you connect with your partner‚Äôs feelings. Here‚Äôs how to practice it effectively:

- **Put Yourself in Their Shoes:** Try to understand things from your partner‚Äôs perspective. What might they be feeling?
- **Validate Their Feelings:** Acknowledge your partner‚Äôs emotions. Statements like, ‚ÄúThat sounds really tough,‚Äù can help them feel understood.
- **Respond Supportively:** Offer help or encouragement to show you care about their feelings and experiences.

### Set Aside Time for Open Dialogue

Scheduling regular ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù meetings with your partner creates a safe space for open communication. During these discussions, ensure to:

- **Choose a Comfortable Setting:** Select a relaxed environment free of distractions.
- **Be Honest:** Share your thoughts and feelings openly, but also invite your partner to speak up.
- **Stay Positive:** Focus on solutions rather than just problems. Celebrate small victories together.

### Agree on Conflict Resolution Strategies

Every couple faces conflict. Establishing agreed-upon strategies can help you navigate disagreements. Consider these techniques:

- **Take Breaks:** If discussions become too heated, take a break. This allows both partners to cool off and gather their thoughts.
- **Focus on the Issue:** Avoid past grievances. Discuss only the current situation to prevent the argument from escalating.
- **Use a Timer:** Give each person a set amount of time to express their thoughts without interruptions. This ensures each viewpoint is heard.

### Engage in Positive Reinforcement

Another effective way to improve communication is by recognizing and praising positive behaviors. Regularly acknowledge when your partner communicates well, and express appreciation for their efforts. This could be as simple as saying, ‚ÄúThank you for listening to me today.‚Äù Such affirmations build a more supportive and loving atmosphere.

By adopting these communication techniques, you will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of your relationship. Remember, both partners should commit to using these strategies consistently for the best results. Over time, you will notice a significant improvement in how you relate to each other, ultimately transforming the challenges you face into opportunities for growth.

### Conclusion

Repairing a marriage often requires a committed effort from both partners, but it can lead to a deeper connection and a stronger relationship. By adopting specific strategies to fix your marriage, you can create a solid foundation that weather any storm. Remember, taking small, consistent steps can significantly impact your relationship‚Äôs health. Whether it‚Äôs setting aside quality time for each other or showing appreciation through gestures, every effort counts.

Whenever I look back on how I met you, it never fails to make me smile. It felt like the Universe conspired to put me there‚Äîto see you, to make my heart race in a way it hadn‚Äôt in a long time.

It wasn‚Äôt just any wedding. A super typhoon had suspended work and classes, and somehow, I ended up tagging along with my cousin to one of her best friend‚Äôs weddings. I didn‚Äôt expect anything from that day‚Äîcertainly not you.

I first noticed you in the preparation room. My cousin was part of the entourage, so we had to arrive early. You must‚Äôve been part of the groom‚Äôs party, because you were chatting with the groomsmen when you walked in. Our eyes met for just a second. You gave a small, unsure smile. I nodded, almost instinctively. That was it‚Äîthat brief moment that made me aware of you. And somehow, I was filled with this nervous excitement I couldn‚Äôt explain.

At the church, I saw you again‚Äîacross the aisle, focused on the ceremony, holding the arras so gracefully. You were seated just two rows ahead, and I couldn‚Äôt stop glancing your way. Tall, dark hair, kind eyes, and that gentle smile‚Äîyou had me completely captivated. I kept trying to look away, but my eyes always found their way back to you.

Later, during cocktails, I caught myself searching for you in the crowd. A friend of my cousin‚Äôs introduced us, and I remember feeling so relieved‚Äîlike finally, I got to know your name. You greeted me with a firm handshake and that same warm smile. You told me you were just visiting from overseas, and suddenly I felt a quiet urgency. This might be the only time I get to see you.

We were seated apart during dinner, and as the night wore on, I started to accept that maybe that brief hello would be all we‚Äôd have.
Then came the afterparty.

I spotted you at the bar. My heart was racing, but I walked over like it was no big deal. You turned, smiled, and asked, ‚ÄúDo you want a drink?‚Äù

I wanted to say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you I want,‚Äù but instead, I just said, ‚ÄúYes, please.‚Äù
Your drink had just been made, and you handed it to me without hesitation before ordering the same for yourself. That simple gesture‚Äîit made me smile like a kid. I stayed beside you, and we talked. I asked how long you‚Äôd be around, and you shared your travel plans‚ÄîCebu, Siargao, just until the first week of the next month. I nodded, trying to stay cool, but inside I was already wishing for more time.

We chatted a little longer, until it was time to say goodbye.
‚ÄúNice meeting you, ...‚Äù you said, then gave me a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek.

As we walked away, I smiled. But my heart ached a little too‚Äîbecause I wasn‚Äôt sure if our paths would ever cross again.

Back at the hotel, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about you. Hope and regret tangled inside me. I blamed the drinks for what I did next‚Äîbut really, it was just me wanting more of that moment. I searched your name on Instagram. Scrolled through users until‚Äîfinally‚ÄîI found you. And before I could second-guess myself, I hit that follow button and fell asleep.

The next morning, I was barely awake when my cousin shook me‚Äîreminding me we had another event to go to. Still half-asleep, I scrolled through photos from the night before when suddenly, a notification popped up.

‚Äú... accepted your follow request.‚Äù
‚Äú... requested to follow you.‚Äù

I let out a high-pitched squeal and nearly dropped my phone. My cousin looked at me like I was crazy, and I just kept kicking the bed, grinning, telling her between squeals that you followed me back.

I waited a while before accepting your request‚Äîdidn‚Äôt want to seem too eager. But of course, I dove into your profile. You hiked. You traveled. You‚Äôd been to Japan, Vietnam, Machu Picchu, Patagonia, Spain. Your stories from the wedding were still up, and yes‚ÄîI watched them more times than I should probably admit.

The more I saw, the more I liked you. You were funny, clearly close to your family and friends, loved life, loved food. Just... genuinely good. And I found myself more drawn to you.

So I thought‚ÄîI have to ask him out. Even just for coffee.

It took me hours. I rewrote that message so many times. I was overthinking everything. But eventually, I sent it:
A quick message saying how great it was meeting you, and asking if you‚Äôd like to grab coffee before you leave.

A few hours later, you replied. You told me you were busy touring with your siblings and had a packed schedule. Coffee sounded great, but it might be tough. You said you‚Äôd let me know if you had any free time.

It wasn‚Äôt quite a yes‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt a no either. And I held on to that hope.
I watched every story you posted, seeing how full your days were. It looked like you were having so much fun with your family. I told myself that was enough‚Äîfor now.

Then I saw your IG story at the airport.
Just like that, your trip was over. We never got that coffee.

Strangely, I wasn‚Äôt crushed. I just... accepted it. It was what it was. And maybe, that was all it was ever meant to be.

Then your message came:
‚ÄúSorry we didn‚Äôt get a chance to grab coffee. I‚Äôm back in the States now, but it was nice meeting you!‚Äù

That message meant more than you probably knew. You didn‚Äôt owe me anything‚Äîbut you still reached out. It was kind. Thoughtful. So very you.

Looking back, it all feels a little magical. We only had a few hours‚Äîbut they stayed with me. Maybe we were just meant to cross paths briefly. Or maybe... this isn‚Äôt the end.

For now, I‚Äôll just be here, watching your stories. And that‚Äôs enough to make me smile.",24,1744515855.0,OffMyChestPH,3,0.93,False

I‚Äôve been working remotely for a while now, and I usually default to CBTL or Burning Brownie in F6 when I want a change of scene from home. Both have a decent vibe and are laptop-friendly enough, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like I need some new options to keep things fresh.

But now I‚Äôm starting to feel the need for a change of scenery and would love to discover some new places around Islamabad that are laptop-friendly and work-friendly.

I‚Äôm mainly looking for places that have:

* Reliable WiFi
* Comfortable seating and a chill vibe
* Power outlets (not a dealbreaker, but helpful)
* Staff that don‚Äôt mind if you stay a while
* And of course, good coffee/tea is always a plus

1jxyspx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jxyspx/why_i_dont_want_cafe_quality_espresso/,Why I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúcafe quality‚Äù espresso,"A lot of people seem to use ‚Äúcafe quality‚Äù as the ideal standard for how your coffees should taste. I‚Äôve never really understood this mindset however because a lot of cafes don‚Äôt have that great of coffee. 

Most cafes are mainly focused on speed and efficiency. They do have high end grinders and machines which obviously does help but at the end of the day they‚Äôre generally not spending time on things like weighing the coffee or doing good puck prep. Also a lot of times the workers don‚Äôt care about getting level tamps or cleaning the machine and portafilter between shots. Most people get sugary milk drinks that mask the taste of bad coffee anyway. 

There‚Äôs also the issue of the actual coffee being served. Some shops may just not serve what you like, which is not issue on their end. Personally I mainly only drink medium roasts but a lot of shops will only serve dark or light roasts. 

Whats great about home espresso is that you have control over pretty much everything in the process. You can pick from a variety of beans to fit your preferences. You can spend time on perfect puck prep to get the best possible shot pull. You can make the milk as textured as you want (assuming you know how to.) Also, there obviously are some specialty shops that put in much more effort and let you choose which beans are used, but those tend to be the exception and not the norm.

No recipe to give out, because I used a mishmash of multiple recipes. 

Used instant yeast to make and bloomed it first in warm milk before adding the rest of the ingredients. 

Double rise method for the dough, then baked for 40 mins at 350 degrees, rotating the pans around halfway through. 

Then let cool completely before frosting. 

This turned out really good. Especially for a first attempt.

The only improvement I can think of is to add more frosting on top. It didn't seem quite enough while eating.

I‚Äôm 18 now, but back when I was in 8th or maybe 9th grade, I used to talk to this girl. I had just learned what a relationship really is, so my hormone-fueled self decided to propose to her. But right after doing it, I fumbled, and before even seeing her reply, I called her sister and said I was just joking‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask me why, I still ask myself that.

After that, I was watching Snapchat shorts ‚Äî yeah, I was dumb, I thought only cool people used Snapchat ‚Äî and I found this video explaining the meaning of ‚Äú143.‚Äù I thought it was funny (again, don‚Äôt ask why), and I sent it to her. I don‚Äôt even remember if she saw it or not.

In 10th grade, I got into a relationship with another girl. Me and the first one used to talk normally ‚Äî just exchanging notes and all that. After 10th, I changed schools and stopped talking to her.

Then in 12th grade, around December 25th, my old school randomly decided to host a reunion. (Like seriously, who does a reunion after 10th grade?) I saw her there, but we didn‚Äôt talk. She just called me once asking where I was‚Ä¶ no idea why. After the reunion, I apologized to her for everything I had done in the past, and she just said ‚Äúokay.‚Äù

Now, we talk maybe once every four months or so.

Should I completely stop? Or should I try to build a healthy friendship again?


Some of you may think why do you wanna be friends with her cause I feel nice after talking she's like day maker.. radiates positivity is one way to say it.. over all she's amazing person..

1. I have no intention of getting into a relationship or anything like that.

1jxyg08,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jxyg08/theres_something_wrong_with_the_late_night/,There's Something Wrong With The Late Night Broadcast,"I work the night shift at a small local TV station in rural Montana. It's one of those jobs where you mostly just make sure nothing goes wrong with the automated broadcast system while everyone else is sleeping. Twelve hours of mind-numbing boredom punctuated by occasional technical hiccups‚Äîat least that's what it was supposed to be.

Three weeks ago, I started noticing something strange happening during our 3:00 AM broadcast slot. We run old public domain movies during that time‚Äînobody's watching anyway, and it's cheap content to fill airtime. I was half-asleep in the control room when I noticed something off about the black-and-white western playing on the monitor.

There was a figure standing in the background of a scene where I could swear there hadn't been anyone before. It was just a silhouette, barely visible behind the main actors. I rewound the digital file, thinking maybe I just hadn't noticed it the first time through. But when I played it again, the figure was gone.

I chalked it up to fatigue and too much coffee. Night shifts mess with your head, and I've seen weirder things while sleep-deprived.

But then it happened again the next night. This time it was during an old noir film. A woman was delivering a monologue in her apartment, and in the window behind her, I saw a face peering in‚Äîjust for a second before the camera angle changed. I jumped up and rewound the footage. Nothing there on the second viewing.

I started recording our broadcasts on my phone, thinking maybe there was some kind of transmission issue that was causing these glitches. The recordings showed nothing unusual, but I kept seeing these anomalies on the live monitor‚Äîfleeting shapes in the background, strange distortions in people's faces, background extras staring directly at the camera when they shouldn't be.

Last week, things escalated. The 3:00 AM slot was playing ""Night of the Living Dead""‚Äîand halfway through, one of the zombie extras turned to face the camera and spoke. This wasn't part of the movie. I know because I've seen it dozens of times. The zombie's mouth moved, and though there was no audible sound, I could read the lips clearly: ""We see you watching.""

I nearly fell out of my chair. I grabbed my phone and started recording, my hands shaking. When I played back the clip I'd recorded, the zombie was just shuffling around mindlessly like it was supposed to. But I know what I saw on the monitor.

I tried telling my supervisor, but he just laughed it off. ""Classic night shift paranoia,"" he said. ""Take some vitamin D supplements. The lack of sunlight is getting to you.""

Maybe he was right. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived and imagining things. I considered requesting a schedule change, but the weird part is... I didn't want to. Something kept drawing me back to those late-night broadcasts. I needed to know what was happening.

Four nights ago, I made a discovery. I noticed that these anomalies only appeared on broadcast signals, never on the digital files themselves. Something was intercepting or altering our broadcast between the station and the transmission. I set up a second monitor connected directly to our antenna feed to compare with our studio output.

That night, the differences between the two feeds were undeniable. While ""The Maltese Falcon"" played normally on the studio monitor, the broadcast version showed subtle but unsettling differences. Background characters moved differently. Scene transitions lingered a beat too long. And Humphrey Bogart's eyes‚Äîthey were solid black, like empty sockets.

I started documenting everything, taking photos of both screens side by side. The photos showed the differences clear as day, so it wasn't just in my head. Something or someone was hijacking our broadcast signal.

Last night, I decided to stay after my shift ended at 6:00 AM to talk to the morning crew about what I'd found. That's when I made the most disturbing discovery yet.

When the morning shift manager arrived, she looked at me strangely.

""What are you doing here, Alex? You're not scheduled until tonight.""

I told her I had just finished my shift, but she shook her head and showed me the schedule on her tablet. According to the official record, I hadn't worked last night. Or the night before. Or any night in the past two weeks.

But I had been here. I had the photos on my phone to prove it.

Except when I checked my phone, the photos were gone. The recordings were gone. Everything was gone.

The only evidence I had was a single text message I had sent to myself at 3:17 AM last night that simply read: ""IT'S REPLACING US ONE BY ONE.""

I don't remember sending that message.

I went home in a daze, convinced I was losing my mind. When I arrived at my apartment, my key didn't work. After several attempts, my neighbor came out and asked if I needed help.

""Hey, are you looking for Alex?"" she asked, not recognizing me. ""He moved out about two weeks ago. Are you a friend of his?""

I stood there, unable to speak. How could she not recognize me? I've lived next door to her for three years.

I managed to mumble something about having the wrong apartment and walked away. I'm writing this now from a motel room, using a laptop I bought today. I don't know who or what has taken over the broadcast, but I think it's spreading beyond the signal now.

Tonight at 3:00 AM, every TV in this town will be airing our public domain movie slot. I don't know how many people might be watching‚Äîinsomniacs, night shift workers, people who fall asleep with their TVs on. But I know something will be watching back through those screens.

I'm going back to the station tonight. I need to find a way to stop the broadcast. If you're reading this and you live in a small town with a local TV station, do me a favor‚Äîdon't watch anything that airs at 3:00 AM.

And if you see someone who looks exactly like you walking around... run.",24,1744514305.0,nosleep,0,0.94,False

Okay, we talked about our issue but did we resolve it? No. One of you was passive about it: sinabi mo na kung gusto pa naming maging friends pa sa inyo, you will just wait for us to come back. Girl, we ain't coming back. 

When you gave us the burden to decide kung babalik kami or hindi, that's already a dead giveaway that you didn't mind losing us. Sabagay, di naman kami kawalan sayo. But sana stop mo na yung pagsto-story ng old pics natin. It's not helping. Hindi nakaka-touch. Ni isang chat  mo nga after our talk wala kaming natanggap, tapos sinasama mo pa kami sa story mo? Plus, nagkasalubong tayo noon sa mall. I knew we locked eyes kase mga ilang seconds yun. Pangiti na ako sa'yo but you looked away and continued talking to your new friend. I looked at you nung magkasalubong na sana tayo I was preparing to say ""hi"" once you look at me pero iniwasan mo ako. You pushed your friend further to your side kaya lumawak yung distance natin when we're about to walk past each other. And you have the audacity to post us like you're longing for us? Yeah, hindi nga kami babalik sa inyo. 

Yung isa naman, go with the flow lang pero halata naman how you always wanted to be the center of attention. When I initiatiated our talk para mapag-usapan yung sama ng loob ko sa inyo, it ended up being about your sentiments. That night din nung nagkagulo na tayo, what was your first response? Di ba mag-story? Nagstory ka ng something cryptic  in the midst of our fight and when I confronted you about it, hindi ka makasagot. These months din, puro ka story ng patama. Kahit sabihin mong they weren't about our friendship but how do you expect me to be with you again kung konting inconvenience lang sa buhay mo, ipa-publicize mo na agad? What if we become friends again tapos may napansin ka lang na ayaw mo sa'min, instead i-communicate mo, isto-story mo? Ganyan ka naman ever since pero inintindi ka namin. Ngayon, ayoko nang intindihin ka. 

No wonder na after isang repost ko lang ng isang quote sa X, mukhang natamaan ka. I was just testing you kung about sa atin nga ang story mo. Pinatulan ko yung pagpaparinig mo. And boom! I got responses from you. Kase after non, sunod-sunod na ang IG and FB stories mo about losing friends, losing your circle, and other things. Girl, ang tagal ko na kayong ni-let go. You just can't read the room. And how does it feel to na ikaw rin ang natamaan ng cryptic post? Feeling artista tayo no? May pa-cryptic hahaha.

Buti na lang talaga, I didn't meet up with you kase napansin ko na bigla kang nag-aya lumabas kase yun pala gusto mo rin istory na kasama mo kami kase flinex pala nung isa yung new circle niya. You know that I have always been against reconciling kung may maiiwan na isa but you attempted to do that. Tapos ngayon, you're sticking with her again kase I refuse to meet up with you for coffee or whatever. 

In the first place, alam niyo na nagkaroon ng issue kase nagtampo kami sa inyo pero ang unfair kase noon, pag kayo ang nagtatampo, inaayos naman natin ah. Ineeffortan namin kayo noon kase kayo lang meron kami. Pero nung kami na, like once lang na nagtampo kami over your behavior, you handled us like we're just one of your many friends.

So please, stop na. Let's go on with our lives without each other. I hope masabi ko sa inyo ito before the year ends para matuldukan na talaga natin ang kung anong meron tayo. ",3,1744514235.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1jxyf5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jxyf5a/my_boyfriend_29m_and_i_25f_just_moved_in_together/,My boyfriend (29m) and I (25f) just moved in together and now he plays video games more than ever,"tldr: My boyfriend (29m) and I (25f) just moved in together and now he spends more time gaming than before we lived together - because he feels like he sees me every day. I feel so lonely and neglected that I‚Äôm considering ending things.

My boyfriend and I moved in together at the beginning of March, after having dated for a little over one year. The idea was that if we lived together, we could spend more time together, because we both work full time (I usually work over 40 a week) and I am in college part time. But now I feel neglected because he plays games with his friends from his hometown every night after work and both Saturday and Sunday instead of really making an effort to hang out with me. 

Prior to us moving in together, when I would go over to his place, he might‚Äôve taken the time to finish whatever match he was in with the homies but he would hang up as soon as it was done. I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it because after 20-30 minutes I would get undivided attention the two or three nights a week I was over there. He never came over to my place because I had moved back home after some medical expenses piled up. 

Now that we live together, if I complain, he will make time for me for about an hour so we can eat together. But when I get home from work (he works from home) he will already be gaming with his friends (while he‚Äôs supposed to be working), and after dinner he‚Äôll get back on. 

I have been very stressed with work and school and the now added stress of our relationship made me break about a week ago. That day  came I home to him on Discord with his friends and he barely looked up from his desk to greet me. When I walked over to sit by him on the couch, I tried to tell him about my day, but he didn‚Äôt even bother to take his headset off so we could talk uninterrupted. As soon as we were done talking I cried. I couldn‚Äôt help it, I couldn‚Äôt stop it. He got up to comfort me when he noticed but he still had his fucking headset on. I kept crying and cried harder and I left to go cry in the bedroom and he continued playing games with his friends. Later he got up to make dinner and made me a plate, and when he noticed that I hadn‚Äôt stopped crying after I had gone to bed, he told his friends he had to go. He held me as I cried until I fell asleep. The next day I went to work puffy eyed and exhausted, and in the evening I told him how I was feeling. 

I told him that I didn‚Äôt feel close to him right now. I told him that I don‚Äôt feel attractive because he doesn‚Äôt have any interest in sex right now. I told him that the person I want attention from is him, and that when I get attention from the guys at work it only makes me sadder. I told him that when I ask him to come to bed a little early and snuggle, and I end up sleeping alone until 2am it makes me miserable. I told him that, I felt lonely, and that when he tells me he ‚Äúspent time with me‚Äùinstead of ‚Äúdoing the thing he wanted to do‚Äù it hurts me because‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt I be a thing he wants to do? Or be included in it in some way? The only reason I was invited to their Discord was because they started a Wordle chat and I asked to play too. He didn‚Äôt get angry or upset or anything, and he admitted that he has a hard time sharing his feelings. But other than that I didn‚Äôt get much from him.

I enjoy video games, but I can‚Äôt justify the cost of building a PC because I have to pay for bills, classes, and save. I also don‚Äôt exactly have the free time to set aside so that I can game for multiple hours at a time. Yes, I have hobbies and friends. But my friends and I can only get together once every couple weeks due to work, school, kids, etc. And I am pretty introverted anyway! I enjoy reading, watching anime, drawing, and other things. But sometimes, I just want to spend time with the person who says he loves me. 

I ask him if we can do things, but he never picks activities for us to do. Today (Saturday) I got up to go to a hair appointment, and called him on my way home to see if he wanted a coffee - I could hear him clicking his mouse and keyboard - he was already online with his buddies. When I got home I asked if we could go out since it was nice out today, and he said ‚Äúsure let me just finish watching my game‚Äù and that took over an hour. But eventually he got ready and we went looking for some furniture for our place. He was fine shopping, pretty pleasant, until he got hangry around dinner time. So we called it quits and got food and went home. We ate together but he was more interested in watching esports than investing in a conversation with me. And after dinner we took a short nap on the couch. Then he got up, and logged in to Discord to hang out with his friends again. Did I mention that they all spent 6 hours playing DnD last night?? 

When I got together with my friend (60f she‚Äôs like my aunt basically) the other night for dinner and complained to her about it, she asked me if he was otherwise a good guy. If he cared about me and was gentle. She said that if this (and his uncleanliness) was the worst thing about him that maybe it‚Äôs worth staying. 

But how do I tell him that I can‚Äôt handle being ignored to this degree? That I‚Äôve been considering ending things because I feel so unimportant to him? I love him but now I feel neglected‚Ä¶

At the end of the day, surviving cruise season is a *Pacific Northwest art form*. Sure, we grumble about the crowds and the antics (we‚Äôll be telling the tale of the tourist who tried to pet a raccoon in Discovery Park for years). But when you feel that frustration bubbling, take a breath of slightly salty Puget Sound air and remember: come October, the ships sail away, the fanny packs vanish, and Seattle becomes ours again ‚Äì rainy, moody, **and blissfully tourist-free** (at least until next year).

Until then, **embrace the chaos with a smirk**. Use the season as an excuse to explore new corners of the city, perfect your crowd-dodging maneuvers, and swap war stories with fellow locals (‚ÄúI survived three family photo shoots in front of the Gum Wall in one day!‚Äù). This *Cruise Season Survival Guide* isn‚Äôt just about avoidance ‚Äì it‚Äôs about bonding with your city in all its 2025 craziness.

So here‚Äôs to you, jaded Seattleites: may your coffee be strong, your patience be long, and your ability to laugh at the madness carry you through another tourist-filled summer. Come fall, we‚Äôll high-five each other in an oddly empty Pike Place Market, reminiscing about the summer that **Seattle was overrun by Midwestern nice** once again ‚Äì and how we lived to tell the tale, *with plenty of snark to spare*.

Happy surviving, and remember: **at least we‚Äôre not the ones wearing matching neon rain ponchos in July**. Stay Local, Seattle!",3,1744514111.0,SeattleWA,6,0.6,False

Having the ability to wake up when my body naturally dictates, instead of waking to an alarm, even if only occasionally.

The first sip from a warm cup of coffee or tea in the morning. 

The first time I feel the sun kiss my skin with warmth after a long winter. 

Music. 

Witnessing the return of birds that sing, and the first blooms of spring. 

Hearing the innocence and unadulterated joy in a child's laughter.  

Watching people unabashedly express their love and adoration for their loved ones, and being able to see genuine love in action. 

Writing. 

The warmth, and positive energy that can only be found in the embrace of the ones I love. 

The acceptance, forgiveness and abundant love that I provide to myself, and everyone who touches my soul. 

The depth with which I know myself, and the beauty that it provides to every aspect of my life. 

Love. 

These are the things that bring me the most true happiness.

We‚Äôve been FB friends for about a year before we started communicating (we‚Äôve been acquainted since HS). From the get go he was upfront with his intentions to get together. I was hesitant about it because 1. He‚Äôs 4 years younger 2. We live far from each other (same hometown that we grew up in but I already moved to the metro since graduating uni but I do visit my family consistently almost each month). 3. I swore off relationships for a while after my last one ended badly. 

F was very persistent, even after I told him off. I am very much focused on my career, he knew about it and he patiently waited for me to give him the time of day. He asked my friends about me, what I want and don‚Äôt want. He sent me flowers and coffee (knows that I‚Äôm an addict). 

During one of my hometown visits in February we‚Äôve gotten together with some mutual friends and we did go on a ‚Äúkind of‚Äù date once. Kind of because I was meeting my closest friend from uni in the city and that‚Äôs about an hour drive and he offered to drive me to the city and back. That ‚Äúdate‚Äù was just us talking in his car while he drove. He was easy to talk to and I can tell that he‚Äôs fun to be with. After that I went back to the metro and we started communicating frequently. 

Fast forward to last month, we had a death in the family and 
I had to fly to a city that‚Äôs about 5 hours away from my hometown. Since I was already close, decided to go to my hometown after the wake of that family member. F wanted to pick me up, but told him that I will ride with my family. a few days after I got to my hometown F and I decided to go on a proper date in the city. And after that date we got to know each other on a deeper level. And we‚Äôve been seeing each other daily since. I even got to meet some members of his family. After a week, I flew back to the metro and we‚Äôve been communicating more frequently than ever. 

Last Tuesday, F and I were talking and he got drunk and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù sent a screenshot of our conversation to her longtime ex-GF (T). For context they‚Äôve communicated recently due to an emergency but it was all that (that‚Äôs what I was told). 

F and T were on and off for a very long time. They only got back when it was convenient for T. But before F pursued me, they were broken up for a year already with 0 communication. Now T have learned about us and wants to get back and build a life together with F. F is confused about it and dropped me like a hot potato ‚Äúto not hurt me anymore‚Äù.  They have a really long history and can‚Äôt/wont compete with that. 

We have plans for next week, since I‚Äôm flying back but not sure anymore if I still want to go. To add salt to injury this plan was made so we could celebrate my birthday together. 
I didn‚Äôt ask for this, and didn‚Äôt want to be with him but he made me change my mind. Now here we are. 

I know exactly what to do (move on gurl!) I know my worth and I don‚Äôt deserve this just want to get this off my chest. ",3,1744513724.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

You just got through an 8 hour test, that itself was a feat. Walk away from your table, get yourself something to eat or drink, look outside, if you feel some kind of emotion then let it out for that moment, just let yourself be human. It's alright - the whole thing is exhausting sometimes, but you made it this far.
2. Don't let one stupid score define you. Especially if this is just one (or two) bad tests. Things happen: maybe you were sleep deprived, maybe you weren't in a comfortable location, maybe the coffee just hit too hard. Or think about it this way: maybe this particular test just hit all of your weak spots, whether you knew you had them or not. It's a learning opportunity, not your actual score. Shit happens, it's a long test, but it'll get better.
3. Don't be on this lurking sub right after. I'm especially privy to this: after every FL, I default to searching up everything on MCAT reddit to see how everyone else did, to find some type of copium nestling in some other premed's post from five years ago, just to convince myself that¬†*this*¬†test was just a particular fluke, that it had nothing to do with me. But no....this isn't actually going to make you feel better, especially not if you hear about people scoring higher than you. You need to remember that at the end of the day, this sub is cherry picked...9 times out of 10 people are only going to be sharing their good news and miracle/success stories, and that's just going to get you feeling even more in the dumps. No. Delete that tab, and throw your phone or your computer away...just a couple hours without it will do you a lot of good.
4. This is not the end. This is far from it. Emotions are temporary, and when you feel ready you can get back on the grind. But when you do, do NOT let this score daunt you...it does¬†*not*¬†always mean that you didn't put the effort in, it just means that maybe you had a bad day. Whether you're testing in a week or three months, it doesn't matter...trust yourself, if you put in the effort and you've seen results in the past, then you'll see it again on test day. You might even surprise yourself.
5. It's all going to be okay. You will be okay, and you will become a doctor, because if that is truly what you want then you will get there. Not everyone's going to be the best at everything right away, so keep pushing. At the end of the day, the MCAT is a test of your endurance, to see how far you will go to get to where you need to be...don't let it defeat you. Make it¬†*your*¬†bitch instead.

So, I‚Äôve been quietly working on something I think you‚Äôre going to love: Keta Voice Assistant. It‚Äôs almost ready to make its debut, but I‚Äôm giving it a few more months before launching officially. Why? Because I want to make sure it‚Äôs as perfect as possible before it reaches your devices. And to do that, I need beta testers who are willing to help me fine-tune the last details.

üåü Why Keta?

You‚Äôre probably wondering what makes Keta different from everything else out there? Well, here‚Äôs a little sneak peek of what you can expect:

Memory: Keta actually remembers your preferences and gets better over time. It won‚Äôt forget that meeting with Sarah you mentioned two weeks ago, and it‚Äôll even keep track of your favorite music, weather updates, and more.

Dynamic Personality: Keta‚Äôs got range. Depending on your mood or the situation, Keta can be friendly, formal, sassy, or excited. No more robotic, monotone answers.

Multi-Step Commands: Keta doesn‚Äôt just answer your requests. It does things. Ask it to open an app, set a reminder, and play music all in one go and it‚Äôs done, like magic.

Real-Time Info: Weather, news, or nearby coffee shops? Keta‚Äôs always on top of it, without needing you to dig through a million apps.

Music Control: Forget the usual ‚Äúplay music‚Äù command. Keta knows what you need, and it delivers, whether it‚Äôs workout beats or chilled vibes.

üí• What I Need From You

I‚Äôm looking for testers who want to help make Keta the best it can be. If you‚Äôre into voice assistants but tired of the same old, Keta‚Äôs not your usual assistant and I need some help polishing it up.

What does being a beta tester involve? Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:

Testing: Use Keta on your day-to-day tasks and let me know how it performs.

Feedback: Tell me what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and how it could be better.

Patience: Keta‚Äôs almost there, but it‚Äôs still a work in progress. I need testers who can give feedback and help me make it shine.

üìÖ When

So, why the wait? I‚Äôm planning for a 6-month timeline before opening it up for testing, just to make sure everything is running smoothly. That means you‚Äôll get access before the general public, and be part of something that could just change how we think about voice assistants.

If you‚Äôre interested, drop a comment or DM me, and I‚Äôll keep you in the loop as I get closer to beta. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to miss this one. It‚Äôs worth the wait.
