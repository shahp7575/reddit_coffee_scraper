1ombri3,https://www.reddit.com/r/masterofcommand/comments/1ombri3/thoughts_on_some_item_and_unit_combinations/,Thoughts on some item and unit combinations,"This is not a guide, but some initial thoughts after I completed a playthrough with GB/no modifiers

I really like herbs becuse of the casualty replenishment. For a real line holding ""anchor"" infantry I like the combination of herbs, ewrthworks and entrnching tools. This maximizes your gaurenteed cover and replenished lost troops. You want this unit to be a ""tank"" where there job is to stand in a spot and receive fire. I like the idea of giving them the fragmenting ammunition to point blank blast when being charged or to get in the face of an enemy and shred. Three units focusing on one breaks it quick and I can only imagine what they can do with buck-and-ball.

Grenadiers are supposed to be brawlers. I caution against having too many though as they don't have the staying power of line infantry. I lkke herbs on these guys becuse melee=casualties. Since they are typically on the flank and have good melee, I use them early battle for anti cav and like them to be equipped with spikes. Since they want to be in melee, greatcoats are great paired with upgraded bayonettes and melee focused muskets. The shepherds axe is nice on them since they get extra melee and can take advantage of some cover. Now there are iron grenades and glass grenades. Iron grenade need to be close and do massive damage. Glass does less damage but have greater range. If you want to be in the face of the enemy go iron. An alternate build to a grenadiers is to keep the officer in there and keep them behind your infantry lines. This way you can counter charge or plug a gap if needed. When equipped with glass grenades, you can toss them over your line at the enemy due to the range. 

I like beer for my horses. Cavalry=melee. There is an argument for fragmented ammo and melee/charge bonus carbines for even more devestating shocks, since they fire while charging. 

I keep my guns smoking. Tobacco has an accuracy increase at the cost of stamina. I have never seen an artillery stam-out so there isn't a downside. My hunters want coffee since speed and reload is a no brainer for my light infantry. 

As for artillery, the light guns are good for keeping up with infantry and being part of the line (a little behind so they don't get shot). I'm going to experiment with the earthworks on line artillery with the entrnching tools and treatise with X+cover bonus. Your big guns are supposed to be in the back and I give them range, accuracy and reload bonuses. Canister is good on all of them but you get more range on the big guns (half of 500 is still 250).

I'm not certain about cheese but I think all the morale and XP buffing items should go on recruits so they can hang around longer and get that XP to upgrade. 

Any other good combinations I missed?

1ombosx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ombosx/i_miss_my_ex_from_7_years_agoi_think_im_gonna/,"I miss my ex from 7 years ago...I think I'm gonna reach out instead of living with ""what if.""","Tried posting once here to share but then deleted. It's so conflicing. I didn't think I cared much back then, we were young, 21 in college and there was a bunch of conflict to the point where the relationship didn't feel fun anymore. It was due to my lack of time and availability to prioritize the relationship and her trying more than she could tolerate to make the relationship work. I look back, and all she wanted was some time with me, a call without being prompted, a date or to see me once or twice a month without having to ask again and again. I just couldn't do it, I was trying to get into med school and was just so burnt out. As much as I liked her, as time went on, the relationship was just more expectations and I didn't see what I was gaining. She was always hurting and we'd get into these winded talks every 2ish weeks about how she felt unloved, distant, and alone. I felt like a piece of shit because I cared about her but just couldn't give her bare minimum without feeling like I was drowning. I kind of just checked out and we mutually decided to breakup after about 6ish months.

  
Fast forward, I'm now a resident doctor, finally made it. I don't think of myself as much of a romantic, didn't even think I'm made for relationships the way I love my independence and am content with my projects and the family I already have. But I've been in a few relationships over the years and I see the point of it, and now realize it is something that I want in my life. Took me 7 years to get to this point. I was always so focused on me, my goals, and my passions, I did not have space for others. Looking at others realtionships including my own parents, I see relationships and long standing love isn't about what someone gives you, but what you can give them. That's what strengthens relationships, wanting to add to someone else's life.

My ex from 7 years ago, this girl tried it all for me. She was the most sweetest, caring, passionate, confident, and full of life person I knew. The way she knew my coffee order and would randomly pick it up for me when she got herself coffee after our classes, listened to me talk about my passions for hours with so much interest and curiosity. She is so intelligent too. She would always encourage me and even when I was insecure about some things in myself, she would always compliment me genuinely, with examples so I would believe her. We were friends for a year before we dated and had so many things on common. Going on our crazy roadtrips where she was open to doing anything spontaneously, even teaching me to be more spontaneous. The banter, even when her takes were always so off, it was the funniest thing ever. 

  
We are still friends on Facebook, and when I see her posts, I see she's still the same girl I was attracted to back then in so many ways. Posting her roadtrips, the way she excitedly decorates her clinic for halloween, her favourite music, when the seahawks win. Of course we've grown, but I would think it's for the better. She struggled to communicate her issues in our relationship on time when we were younger because she didn't enjoy it (no one does) and she didn't want to turn me off but that always lead to greater buildup of emotions that became harder to manage. I was emotionally unavailable in many ways. I remember when her grandmother passed away, I was so busy with my own shit it took me 3 days to find out since I didn't communicate with her during those days. And now I remember after asking her how she felt the day I found out, I never followed up, never asked how she felt as the week went on or month. Just completely moved on. Didn't even offer to see her. That's now who I am now, and I would think she's also worked on setting boundaries and what not. I was her first boyfriend, she way  my second girlfriend.

Of all the women I've been with, she some how keeps coming back to my mind. I didn't think she would. Months after the breakup, I rationlized it and knew it wouldn't work based on our needs. I didn't feel strong enough romantic feelings to try harder by then. She made a great friend and was great to be around and talk to, but despite being beautful and attractive, I didn't feel a need to continue in a relationship. Didn't work with my life plan. The checked out point I mentioned earlier. Now I want to reach out to her and see if it can go somewhere again...It doesn't seem like she has a partner based on what I have seen online. I moved to a different state for residency but I still go back to visit my parents, and think I'll move back when I am done. I don't think I want to live with a ""what if."" What if we tried, what if it worked, what if she's the one that got away. I haven't met a woman who gets so excited for my passions for me as she did, she was my number one cheerleader and supporter. It felt like too much back then, but I know it was just the loving girl she was. Perhaps she's changed in some ways and isn't like that, but she's still the funny, joyful, and passionate girl I remember in other ways. I felt like I took that away from her 7 years ago when we got together, but I am commited to trying harder and make sure I add to that joy, the way she tried to add to mine.

Don't know how this will go, but I hope this is one of those ex reconciliation success stories we hear about. I am not going in delusional that we will pick up right where we ended. Maybe when we try we don't feel the same but it is worth the shot. Love isn't just those fleeting feelings, the butterflies, lust. Its the commitment, trust, choosing someone that chooses you back, respecting them, being curious about their lives, caring for them, and then the affection and love grow. If she's open to it, I am here. ",1,1762070455.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

1ombn9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TruthAccordingtoGod/comments/1ombn9f/how_to_grow_in_faith_prayer/,"How to Grow in Faith, Prayer"," Talk to your Father.

https://preview.redd.it/d6ptxd1wusyf1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb9302dd1467cf7a7b3caa84f3ff89447da9661

How do you overcome the world? How can a newborn child of God grow in faith, knowledge, and wisdom? This is what we will discuss. Prayer. First, let us pray.

Heavenly Father, we come before you with thanksgiving and praise. We love you and thank you for everything from life itself to life everlasting. As we enter your word today, we ask for eyes to see what the world cannot see. Ears to hear the things of yours that the world cannot hear, and a spirit to understand what you wish us to learn here today. We ask this in the name of Yeshua, Amen!

We read this in 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

**“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.""**

Wait what? **“Rejoice evermore?” “Pray without ceasing?”** What does that mean? How can I pray without ceasing? Exactly how long is that? And as for “rejoice evermore?” Yeah ok. I lost my job, and I will rejoice, right? I mean, I do go to church. I pray the way Jesus taught me to pray. Do you know people like this? Have you been like this? You have people who go to church every week. They do what Jesus said to do. They pray the ""Our Father"" three times. They are saying the prayer that Jesus Himself taught us to pray? Right?

Well, no. Not exactly. Did Jesus give us the ""Our Father Prayer"" in Matthew 6? Of course. But what was He telling us? You see, He was teaching us how to pray by showing us the formula. He never intended for us to simply repeat it, hoping that God would hear us and do whatever we asked. In fact, right before He gave us this example, He said this.

**""But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.""**

He goes on to say, not pray this prayer, but

**""After this manner, therefore pray ye.""**

He tells us that this is the formula. This is an example. **""After this manner,""** or, to resemble in appearance, character, behavior, etc., or, to follow as an example. Keep in mind, He just said, **""when ye pray, use not vain repetitions.""** So was Jesus telling us, 'Say the"" Our Father Prayer' and all will be well? No. He was saying, This is how you should pray.

Some people think about prayer as holier than anything, a grand procedure that one must be skilled in, with the knowledge of how to do it. Well, no. All we need to do is follow Jesus' formula. God already knows what you are going to say before you say it.

God is your Father. He is there when you wake up. He is there when you eat breakfast or don't. Shower and get ready? He is with you. Go out the door? He is with you. Work, school, or play? He is with you. It is not a part-time, only in Church on Sunday concept or idea, or thing. He is with us always. In all things. During all things. He is there. He is God.

Do not ever forget this. Yes. Of course. He is always there, parting seas, calming storms, healing sickness, and casting demons away out of your life, carrying you even if He must. He is also there at all other times. Read the Word. Pray, and always think about Him.

Then, of course, and sadly, you have what I call “foul-weather children of God.” I’ve been one. Death in the Family? ""GOD?!?!?"" Loss of a Job? ""GOD?!?!?"" Loss of a House? ""GOD?!?!?"" Sickness and disease invade your home? ""GOD?!?!?"" Dark clouds coming?? ""GOD?!?!?"" Trying to walk on water, and start to sink? ""GOD?!?!? SAVE ME!!!!""

Everything is going well? Everyone healthy? Got that new Job? Got married? Birth of a child? Healed from sickness? Beautiful sunny days? Where is your cry to God? Where is your Thanksgiving?  Where is God? Oh, He is there. Where are you?

Jesus tells us to be ever vigilant. Spend time with your Father. Ask Him to give you the strength to overcome. To be steadfast. He wants a relationship with you. Walk with Him. Talk with Him. One of the best things you can do next to reading the Word is prayer.

God is there with you in the good times. He wants you to celebrate with Him. He wants a one-on-one relationship with you, just like your earthly Father. He wants to be your Heavenly Father. Just like your earthly Father, He wants to be there to celebrate life's good times with you.

Yes. He will be there in the bad times. He will be there when you lie down. He will be there when you get up. If you are His child, He will be meeting your needs every day. He will bless you daily. He will teach you, lead you, love you, always, in all things.

**“Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:4-7**

Have you ever been touched by that **""peace of God, which passeth all understanding""**? If not, there is no describing it. There is nothing to compare it to. You have to experience it yourself. I have been touched. I have experienced it. Better than any amount of alcohol. Better than any kind of drugs. It just is the Peace of God. The Joy of our Lord. You can find it in no other way, save spending time with God.

If you have never done this, try it. Do not think about prayer as holier than anything, a grand procedure that one must be skilled with the knowledge of how to do it. It is not this way. It is simply a conversation. Talk to God. Get up and say your 5-minute obligatory prayer in the morning. How about on your way to work? At work? How about something you see that you would instantly want to share with someone? Share with Him. ""God? Did you see that?"" Or ""Father, can I please get through this meeting today?"" Or something like ""God, thank you so much for this coffee. It is really good."" Any and everything is worthy to share with God, and to also help you remember, HE is always with you.

**“Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.” Colossians 4:2**

Remember, all that you have, ever had, or ever will have is from God. As the Word tells us, all good things are from Him.

**“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. Of his own will, he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” James 1:17-18**

Are you a child of God?

**“The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs--heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.” Romans 8:16-17**

We will wrap it up today with this, from our Lord Himself.

**""But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap.”**

Remember, we talked about this before. It does not have to be “the end times” for today to be your end time. Your last day. No one knows the hour or the day.

**“For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.”**

However, we have the advantage. We know what is next. We know that death is not the end. Just a transition into the next existence. Which is forever.

**“But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."" Luke 21:31-36**

If you have never tried this, go ahead and do it. Say your morning prayer or your nightly prayer—whatever you are used to doing. Then, try doing the opposite as well, not instead, but in addition. If you start your day with prayer, also make a habit of thanking God for the day at the end. If you pray at night, consider waking up earlier if needed to pray in the morning and thank God for another day.

If you are going through your life and you see someone whom you think needs a blessing, bless them, but also pray for them. It can be something as simple as “Father, please be with them.”

Another reason, and one Jesus was trying to convey here, is this. If you are praying or talking to God daily, where is your mind? Are you focused on the world? Or are you focused on God? Exactly. So if you are focused on God, the world seems less and less important.

As you grow in faith, you grow out of the world. You grow stronger, wiser, and you will have less fear in your life. Nothing will seem overwhelming when you know, not think, but rather know that the creator of the universe and all that is in it is now your Father. If God is for us, who can be against us? The answer? No one and nothing.

Now I hope you are reading the Word. I hope you will try to pray more. What is next? Well, repentance. I know, I know. This is one of those messages that makes people angry. However, that does not mean it is not true. Join us next time for our conversation on true repentance and what that means.

Have you **""put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him""Colossians 3:10?** Then start to grow in the faith. Read your Bible; if you do not have one, get one. Pray and spend time with God.

1ombm2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ombm2r/reviewing_5_affordable_fragrances_recommended_by/,Reviewing 5 affordable fragrances recommended by this sub last week,"So, this thread from last week of affordable fragrances: *""What frags are so high quality, you can't believe they're not more expensive?""* inspired me to order 5 of them. Altogether they came to $126, that's with shipping and tax. Here's my review of the 5 I bought. All 5 from fragrancenet. 

For reference on scents I normally like, I'm drawn to wood, oud, vanilla, coffee, amber, incense, warm for winter, as well as clean, fresh, fruity, shampoo, bright for summer. Mind Games Grand Master, Mind Games J'adoube, YSL Black Opium, Coach Wild Rose, Ralph and Ralph Hot by Ralph Lauren, Oujan and Haltane and Layton by Parfum de Marly, Shea by The Body Shop, those are some of my favorites. I don't like powdery or overly bakery sweet fragrances (clean sweet like Ralph or Wild Rose is great though) and I rarely like super floral. 


**Cabochard by Parfums Gres** ($17)

I was most excited to try this one, it was highly recommend by several people, and it's possible that the people recommending it got the pre-reformulation bottles and I got one of the newer ones. But this smells like straight grandma perfume to me. The floral notes overpower the woody base notes and I just cannot see anyone under the age of 70 rocking this one. Also old fashioned bath soap, like the powdered kind. I think it's all the rose. The bottle even looks retro, and it's got some impressive staying power and sillage. But damn, this is just too old fashioned for me. In its defense, that's kind of what it advertised itself as, the original came out in the 50s. It's not terrible but I won't be wearing this one. 
**2.5/5**


**Encre Noir Lalique** ($27)

Wood. So much wood. Walking around the lumber department of Lowe's, with a hint of fresh green forest plant smell. Lumberjack in a bottle. Initial spray was kinda harsh, didn't think I'd like it, but it dried down quick to something much more pleasant. Not my personal style but still smells nice, might spray on my sheets before bed or gift to a guy I like. Moderate sillage and pretty long lasting. Bottle looks cool with the dark black square and the wood top, I thought the scent would be heavier based on that. 
**4/5**


**No Limit$ by Phillip Plein** ($32) 

Initial spray was very medicinal, definitely getting Carmex notes. But when it dries down the leather and dark chocolate really come through, but a very bitter dark chocolate, not at all candy or creamy. There's still something slightly camphor-y about it, maybe the herbal notes blending together? If I bury my nose in my arm it's way too strong but from a foot or two away it actually smells pretty nice, I get a little bit of a wood smell from a distance too. I have a collection of men's fragrances I like but rarely wear, I'm adding this to that collection. Heavy sillage and lasting power. Bottle is tacky as hell, looks like something you'd buy for a teenage boy. 
**3/5**


**Oxygene Lanvin** ($22) 

Clean, fresh, unique yet familiar. Initial spray makes me think of summer and water. More mature than most summery clean fragrances, it's not sweet or shampoo-y at all. There's a distinct creaminess to it even though it's subtle, and that balances out the floral aspect nicely. The milky/creamy element comes out the longer I wear it as it warms up on my skin. The faint woodiness keeps it from being too floral. Totally unique, unlike anything else on my shelf. Instantly fell in love, can't believe how cheap this is. Sillage is weak, longevity is moderate, this is definitely more of a skin scent that people will smell up close to you. Only complaint is the bottle is both a little boring and a little awkward to hold. But oh my God I seriously love this so much! 
**5/5**


**Oxygene Homme Lanvin** ($19)

I saw Oxygene recommended and I didn't know if they meant the original or the Homme, so I got both. Initial spray is underwhelming, just green trees smell. But the dry down is actually a nice clean masculine scent, there's a hint of something bright I can't quite place. I love the original feminine Oxygene way more, but this masculine flanker/spinoff has the same refreshing summery energy, they both make me think of a sunny vacation. Oxygene is beach and pool vacation, Oxygene Homme is cabin camping vacation, maybe by the lake. Another skin scent, weak sillage, moderate lasting power. Boring bottle as well and difficult to spray. Surprised this is in a blue bottle because it really makes me think of green.

I haven’t slept uninterrupted for more than 2-3 hours in about 12-13 years. I don’t really have a problem getting to sleep, but I have trouble staying asleep. I wake up anywhere from 10-15 times a night (that I know of and remember) for a few minutes each time, roll over, and fall back asleep relatively quickly.

A few years ago, I had a sleep study done and was just told that I slept poorly and that I probably didn’t have sleep apnea (not a high enough score on the index), but they wanted me to try a CPAP machine for 5-6 months. I kind of got busy with life and didn’t think that was necessary (had another sleep study where I used a CPAP machine and slept even worse) and never ended up doing it.

My doctor did say I moved my legs a decent bit.

I had under 5 hours of sleep each sleep study and they were both very fragmented. I felt like both were very similar to how I sleep every night, so basically that for the last 12-13 years.

I have a pretty nice watch, which may not be the most accurate thing, but seems to be at least semi accurate from the things I can track otherwise and verify with it. I generally get 4.5-5.5 hours of sleep a night with over an hour spent awake from the time I first fall asleep to when I get up. It usually says anywhere from 0-30min REM sleep.

I also had my blood tested and my ferritin was 7, which I believe is low for an early 20s male, but they just said to try and eat more iron rich foods.

I’ve tried everything else. No screens close to bedtime/no blue light, melatonin, Benadryl, other random supplements, etc. I don’t really have caffeine ever (rarely drink coffee, have pop sometimes and almost always early in the day/afternoon). I’m pretty active everyday. I do not take naps.

My doctor told me it was normal to feel tired when you get up in the mornings and that feeling well rested wasn’t really a thing.

Generally, a night of sleep looks like this: I’ll lay down and fall asleep within maybe 20-30 minutes and only sleep for maybe half an hour, wake up feeling kind of alert, then fall back asleep for maybe an hour or two, then start waking up every 15-30 minutes until I have to get up.

I recently moved and am not sure how to go about getting this figured out. I don’t think I can go straight to a specialist, so maybe I need to just go to a regular doctor? Will they help? Or will they refer me? What can even be done about this? Seems like only medication could help, which I don’t love, but don’t know what else I could do.

I can’t really even tell how it’s affecting my life because I don’t know what it feels like to sleep correctly. I say it’s been 12-13 years, but it honestly may have been my whole life, I just didn’t really recognize until then.

# Why I Chose Dalat

Before Dalat, I was in Koh Samui in Thailand, but I didn't like it that much. It was very hot, very touristy, very sketchy. Every two blocks you would have a massage shop and some shady massage. I don't like the vibe there at all.

So I asked ChatGPT at the time, what's the best place to go from Koh Samui that would be close with good weather? It told me about Dalat. One thing intrigued me: there's not a lot of foreigners in Dalat. Not like other cities that are swarming with Americans, Europeans, all that stuff. So I was very intrigued. I always wanted to be in a place that's not very touristy, very chill.

The locals are friendly because if you have a lot of foreigners in a place, the locals usually have like a tourist fatigue syndrome. They'll be sick of tourists, they'll be trying to scam them. But if you go to places without a lot of foreign tourists they're usually more chill and more calm and more fun as well.

I went there with the intention of focusing on work as much as possible because I had a lot of work going on. I wasn't in the mood for exploring, I was mostly in the mood for working and just getting shit done. But also, I wanted a place with good weather so I would work in the morning and in the evening I would go on walks, meet people, things like that.

# The Weather

[The lake next to downtown and night market](https://preview.redd.it/k43wwwttssyf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=55127998fe89b868d5bd71906e1b18e3fc65fa78)

The biggest advantage of Dalat is the perfect or near perfect weather throughout the year. I think one of its names is like the city of eternal spring or something like that.

Even during my time there for like six months, it never got too hot or too cold. Some nights got kind of cold, but you could still sleep with an AC and even if you go outside, you could just wear a light jacket and you'll be fine.

It would rain occasionally in Dalat, especially early afternoon, but from what I recall it was never too much to handle. I didn't think it was that bad and definitely didn't deter me from my daily walks.

# The BIGGEST Problem: No Co-Working Spaces

When I first got there, the first difficult thing I noticed was that they don't have any co-working stations, any place to work. If I wanted to work, I went to a couple of coffee shops but it's not a good place. The chairs they have are very hard, it's noisy, and you're supposed to keep buying coffee.

I really struggled with that at the beginning. I was contemplating going to another city because of it. I spent like two weeks trying to find a place, trying to ask around, but I just couldn't find any place. **So that's the biggest con of going to Dalat. At the moment they don't have any co-working places. If you go there just keep that in mind.**

# My Accommodation Journey

# Month 1: Hotel Setup

I contacted a couple of hotels and told them I'm gonna book for a month, can you guys set up chairs and desks for me? I want to come there and everything is ready. I found a hotel for like 27 million Vietnamese dong, I think that would be like 700 euros.

The location was great. They gave me a desk, a room, and a kitchen I could use. The kitchen was next to my desk so it was very nice because I could go there and heat things or put things in the fridge.

But after a month they told me that somebody else paid for the room I was renting and they can't really afford to let me stay unless I get another room for another month. I was like, no, I'm not gonna do that.

# Months 2-6: My Own Apartment

Because I've grown fond of Dalat, I got my own apartment very close to downtown and the lake. If you look at the pictures from Google Maps, the lake is really beautiful, especially at night. I used to go there in the mornings, do a quick walk for maybe 30 minutes and then come back and start working. I had a park next to my apartment as well. The whole place was just very green, very pleasant.

I got the apartment for like 600 euros a month, which for Dalat is considered very expensive. You can find places for much cheaper, probably like 300 euros, 250 if you really look. But for me it was really important to be next to the lake and I didn't mind paying double for that. The place was very close to a mart, so groceries were very easy. There were so many shops and spots around me.

**But it had one problem. It was very close to a school. So it was kind of noisy, especially on weekdays.** For me, I would usually sleep late, so it was kind of difficult because there was a lot of noise from the street, from the school especially. **If you get an apartment in Vietnam, make sure you're in a place that's away from noise. Or if you're close to noise, just make sure your apartment is noise isolated.**

# Setting Up My Home Office

Once I got the place, I bought my own standing desk, like an electronic standing desk so you can change it from standing to sitting. The desk itself cost about a hundred euros, maybe eighty, ninety. It's not that expensive in Vietnam. The monitor was a regular price, I think a hundred euros. I also bought a chair, I think it was 70 euros, some gaming chair from China. It was decent, good enough.

The whole setup with the monitor and everything cost me like three hundred euros. Overall I kinda wished I didn't waste my time with the hotel to begin with and I just went ahead and got my own apartment. At the beginning I wasn't sure if I'm gonna like Dalat or not. But after some time, I really liked it and I don't mind spending the money to get all this equipment.

# Daily Routine & Lifestyle

I would consider my stay in Dalat to be mostly a vacation for work. It was a great time for me to focus on myself, my self-improvement. I had a very solid routine of going to the gym and doing stretching because my body can be very stiff.

I would go to the gym four times a week. I would do a lot of steps, a lot of walking. I think my average was 14,000 steps. I would work out at the gym in the morning, then come back to my apartment and do my skincare routine and start working for like six hours, seven hours. In the evening I would go outside to the lake and walk there for maybe two hours or an hour and a half, listening to some podcasts or audiobooks. I definitely finished a lot of cool audiobooks when I was walking around the lake.

Overall, I really liked my routine in Dalat. It's a solid, chill routine. It's not like a big city where you're meeting a lot of people and it's very active.

# The Local Community

# The Vibe

Overall the vibe was very chill. There wasn't a lot of tourists. Most tourists there were actually locals, like Vietnamese tourists coming from bigger cities like Saigon.

Sometimes even when I was walking around the lake late, I would get teenagers or locals who would stop me and invite me for drinks. Some of them would be sitting down and invite me, come sit down with us, drink something. Some would stop and say hello, asking where you from, things like that. Some teenagers took pictures with me for some reason. Overall the vibe was really nice. I thought the locals were very friendly. I didn't think they had tourist fatigue.

# Foreigners in Dalat

The foreigners I saw there, Americans, Europeans, a lot of nationalities, I thought they were mostly chill. I think a lot of them are retired people with their own Vietnamese wives there. Some backpackers from time to time, but overall the vibe was chill.

There's a WhatsApp group and a Facebook group. The people there are active, especially on WhatsApp. I think they meet like once a week for coffee meetup. The group was very active with bi-daily events. People would arrange to walk around the lake or go hiking, or do a meetup about AI. I thought the people in the group were very friendly as well. Many locals in the WhatsApp group too.

The locals there mostly use Zalo for communication, and I think you need a Vietnamese phone number to sign up on it.

A lot of the young foreigners are actually heat refugees from Thailand and other places. Because in Chiang Mai and Bangkok, a lot of places are very hot. So a lot of them came to Dalat because the weather is really nice and cool.

# How Friendly Are the Locals?

I can't overemphasize how friendly the locals were. I remember once I was walking in the neighborhood and they had a small coffee shop. I didn't even stop, I was just walking around slowly, looking around. The lady running the shop saw me and waved to me to come inside. She called in her friend who spoke English, an English teacher. She told me that she lived in another city and came to Dalat because she likes the weather, it's much nicer, much more chill.

The kids were friendly too. When I was walking around the lake or in a neighborhood, they'd always be waving to me. I remember walking next to the school because my place had a school next to it. A lot of time I would pass kids walking and a lot of them would be looking at me from far, screaming ""hello, hello!"" It's very funny actually, very friendly people.

I think it's partly because they don't get a lot of foreigners there, so they don't have that tourist fatigue. Most Vietnamese people there weren't comfortable with speaking English but the ones who did were very eager to talk in English.

I was always frequenting this coffee and smoothie shop. The lady there, she's very nice. Every time I come, she would have me sometimes try some fruits, things like that. The guy next to her runs a coffee shop too. Once he came over and started talking to me, like where are you from? He told me, oh, we have a new drink, would you like to try it? It's like a matcha latte drink, some special way to make it. I feel like the general impression of the locals there was very good of foreigners.

# Vietnamese Locals Love Dalat Too

From my conversation with other Vietnamese locals, I met a few Vietnamese people that moved from other cities to Dalat. Apparently, Dalat is like a dream destination for a lot of Vietnamese people, especially people who work in the big cities complaining about too much traffic, maybe the air quality is bad. But you don't have any of that stuff in Dalat. The air quality is great, there isn't much traffic going on. It's very chill and the weather is always good, always nice.

# Food & Shopping

# Getting Around & Delivery

They have Grab for delivery. You can order food and you can also order a bike to go anywhere. You can go from one part of the town to the other for like two euros maximum, especially on a bike. On cars it's like two times that, but it's very cheap. Grab is one app so you can order from restaurants, juices, all kinds of stuff. You can order groceries as well.

I just relied on Grab bike, which tends to cost around 1 to 2 euros to go anywhere in the city. But most of the time I preferred to walk.

# Fresh Produce & Locally Sourced Food

For me I preferred to go to the market because I lived close to the lake and they have a wet market next to it. I would go there and get fruits. They had a lot of guava, which I liked. A lot of fruits, coconut as well. It was a very nice place. You would get all the fresh produce.

Not too far from my apartment there was a fruit cart parked and the lady selling there would sell duck eggs from a local farm as well. There was also an online shop you could text and they would deliver organic grass fed locally sourced eggs to your apartment! There was another one that would deliver cow milk from a local farm. Dalat is a great place if you're looking to eat locally sourced foods in my opinion.

If you're a vegan or don't eat animal products there's still a lot of vegan buffet restaurants I saw throughout Dalat. Overall the Vietnamese cuisine has a lot of variety for vegans.

# Coffee Prices & Quality

You can probably get a coffee for like a euro and a half, sometimes a euro. So it's pretty cheap. My friend who owns a coffee shop in Dalat said a lot of places, especially if they're not grinding their own beans or they're just using pre-made coffee, coffee powder or something, if they do that, it's likely their coffee is very low grade. A lot of these coffees they actually put filters in them and other stuff. So just keep that in mind. If you're a big coffee guy, you probably want to go to a place that has their own beans and their own methods to make coffee.

# Cooking vs Eating Out

I cooked in my apartment most of the time. I think if you go to local Vietnamese restaurants it's pretty cheap, although I heard from locals that big cities like Saigon tend to have better food. There's a few good Indian restaurants and French restaurants. The WhatsApp group has a sub group for sharing those restaurants as well.

# Online Shopping

They had Lazada. It's kind of like Amazon in some way. You can order pretty much from there and it's much cheaper than Amazon. Problem with Lazada is it doesn't have all the American products, like electronics, things like that. They have some of it, but not everything. If you order foreign products that's not Vietnamese, you're probably gonna have to pay extra.

There's also fado.vn where you can order stuff from the US and Europe and they will deliver it and take care of the customs and all stuff like that.

# Activities & Nature

You have a lot of nice strawberry farms. You can do hiking. There's a lot of cool places for hiking. A lot of people in the WhatsApp group, some people were picking up mushrooms. They did mushrooms for Roger's trip in the mountains, things like that. So all in all I thought it was really a place that's full with nature. You can go hiking, probably you can find a place to hike within like 20 minutes from downtown, 10 minutes. It's very nice.

# Practical Stuff

# Internet & Mobile

The internet I had in my apartment was kinda spotty and would fail on me from time to time, but I think that's a problem only in my building cause other expats said it was fine at their place. In my apartment building there were a few power outages, but I'm not sure about other places.

I used Viettel, it's the best mobile provider but you need to go to them and give them your passport. **DO NOT GET esim plan from apps like Airhub, they will get you the worst mobile provider in all of Vietnam. Only get it from Viettel.**

# Banking & Money

Some ATMs charge extra fees for withdrawals, but there's a few ATMs that don't. You can ask in the Facebook group which one cause I forgot haha. But no problem withdrawing in general.

# Laundry

I had laundry machines in my building so no problems there.

# Healthcare (Dentistry)

When I spent my time there, I needed to go to the dentist. I needed to change a few crowns, things like that. I found actually a pretty good dentist there in Dalat. Overall the cost of treating my tooth and working on them was pretty low if you consider U.S. prices. I thought I got good quality. Although with dentists, you don't really know if they did really great work until a few years after. But it's been a few months now and I think it's a pretty good job. I'm not seeing any problems or anything like that.

# Safety & Environment

It's pretty safe, I don't recall a sketchy situation and I walk a lot at night. The air was consistently clean. I don't recall bugs or mosquitoes being a problem either.

# Scams? Not Really

Regarding scams or anything like that, I don't believe I got scammed, at least not explicitly, not obviously. Maybe if you go to a fruit shop, if you're not careful, maybe they can give you the tourist price. But I don't think there was obvious price gouging. I didn't definitely notice that. And I'm usually the person who would double check, maybe ask locals what they paid just to make sure I'm not getting ripped off.

# The Visa Situation (Important!)

This is a big con of being in Dalat. If you don't have a residence visa in Vietnam and you're staying as a tourist visa, you need to leave every three months.

**In Dalat, it's not very well connected to other countries.** There is no direct flight to another country except Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And I believe that's seasonal. So that's the only country you can leave Dalat from in a direct flight and then come back. So that's what I did. I would go to Kuala Lumpur on the direct flight and then sleep in the hotel, in the airport hotel, and then come back the next day for my visa border run.

Other people would take a bus from Dalat to Ho Chi Minh, which is like eight hours by bus. I heard they have comfortable buses, but for me, I don't think I can handle eight hours on a bus. But they go to Ho Chi Minh and from Ho Chi Minh there's a border run I think to Laos or something like that. You can go with a company as well that does that for you.

# Getting Fast Visas

There's services that can get you a visa on the same day. Because with Vietnam, you can't order an electronic visa until you leave the country. So there's companies that can do that for you. I think they cost 80 euros, at least the ones that I contacted. So you contact them, you leave Vietnam, and then they give you a visa in a few hours. But a lot of them are trying to scam. They will try to get you to pay 400 or 300 euros, but I think the actual price is like 80 to 100 euros. Just keep that in mind.

# Flight Connections

Maybe the biggest problem with Dalat is just the connection. The flight connections can be tricky. If you want to leave or come there, you have to keep in mind that you're going to have to take multiple stops. For some people it's fine, but if you're going to have to do a border run every 90 days and you don't like taking buses every time or doing multiple flights, then maybe it's not the best place. I think that's why a lot of people go to Danang, because in Danang you're pretty close to one of the borders so you can do a border run pretty quick.

# Final Verdict

All in all, I think Dalat is a great place if you wanna chill and focus on self-improvement like I did. But if you wanna network, if you wanna meet a lot of people, if you wanna party, I don't think it's a good place to do this. Overall it's very laid back. I don't think there's a lot of partying or anything going down.

If you wanna network, you probably wanna go to big cities like Bangkok. That's where you find young people, especially entrepreneurs with that mindset. I don't think you'll find a lot in Dalat. Most of the people there were working online and just chilling like I did. Some were retired, some just on breaks.

I had my girlfriend with me so I didn't feel lonely, but I did go to a few events and met other people. Probably will not go back because honestly I'm hungry for networking in big cities. But I will always recall my time in Dalat with fondness.

I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a chill location. I think it's good for a short trip as well.",6,1762069413.0,digitalnomad,0,0.8,False

Eventually I asked the barista, and that was the first time I heard the name Comandante C40. I remember being shocked at the price back then. I never even got a chance to try it — it just stayed in my head as “the grinder.”

Fast-forward a few years. Life happened, coffee took a back seat. Then in 2025, by chance, I got pulled back in. I ended up at a Comandante grinding competition and picked up a Timemore C3S on a discount. That grinder got me brewing again — consistently, joyfully.

And after a few months with the C3S, the feeling was clear: it was time. I finally got my own Comandante C40. The purchase felt impulsive, but in the right way. Like something I started years ago finally connected.

Now, every time I grind with it, there’s this quiet “I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be” feeling.

I dropped out of college almost ten years ago, but a few years back I restarted my life and finally completed my degree. Right now I’m focusing on growing in my career. If things go well, I want to retire early, live on my own farm, grow my own food, travel, and stay close to nature.

I’ve never been into drinks. Haven’t even tried tea or coffee. Mostly vegetarian. But I do want to try alcohol once someday, with someone special, just for the memory.

I used to enjoy living alone because it gave me complete freedom and I didn’t have to fear or answer to anyone. Another reason was that I used to think you needed to be exceptionally talented or skilled to have close friends or family. Over time I realised that’s not really true. Being around people, whether it’s family or friends, brings its own kind of comfort and happiness.

A partner is a whole different thing though. Everyone else has their own life, but a life partner is someone you choose to live and grow with through the good and the bad. There will be differences, but that’s what makes it real.

Humans are born with only two fears: loud sounds and heights. Everything else we like or dislike is something we pick up from what we see and experience. When two people connect deeply, they naturally change and adapt to each other without even trying. Ideally, having a partner is like having another version of yourself. If you like each other for who you are, things evolve naturally.

An extreme example would be this: if someone ever thinks about doing something wrong, like cheating, they usually talk it out with themselves in their own head first. Now imagine having that same level of honesty and freedom with your partner, where you can talk about anything without fear or judgment. That’s the kind of bond I’d want to build.

1ombcz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ombcz8/parents_are_dead_against_my_interreligion/,Parents Are Dead Against My Inter-Religion Relationship and Not Agreeing for Marriage,"Hi, sorry for the long post.

I’m a 24F Christian girl residing in Tier-I city. I met my boyfriend (28M, Maharashtrian) about nine months ago through Bumble, and we instantly connected. He was crystal clear that he wanted to marry me and told his parents about me early on while they were initially hesitant, they eventually accepted our relationship and now treat me like their own daughter. I recently completed my [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) with first rank and started working as a senior position in analysis at an MNC. When I told my mom about my relationship, she initially seemed supportive and kept saying, “Let’s talk to Dad.” However, the very next day, both my parents completely changed their stance and became strongly opposed to it. For context, my boyfriend has completed his BMS and MMS from Mumbai University. Unfortunately, he’s currently jobless due to mass layoffs at his previous startup, which led him to resign instead of being terminated. This has been his situation for the past four years of his work....one startup after another ends badly. Just pure bad luck!

When I stood up for him, my parents reacted extremely harshly. They hurled abuses at both of us, leading to constant fights throughout the past week. They’ve called him “poor,” a “slumdweller,” and used several other demeaning terms. They even went as far as to say that since he did MMS in HR, he’ll “never do well in life”, He won’t even have the capability to go abroad… he’s probably never even seen an airplane"" and will “always live in a slum/roadside/ chawl” because of his qualifications. Mind you, he actually lives in a bungalow, with two of his dad’s relatives’ families staying on the floors above and below, He is a partial owner of a flat that he and his parents bought a few months ago. They’re also strongly against the inter-religion aspect to the extent that they’ve asked me questions like, “Why did you even talk to people from other communities apart from Christians, don't youy believe in Christanity?” I was honestly shocked. We live in Tier-I city, for God’s sake! I never imagined my parents would be so orthodox and judgmental. Never in my wildest dreams.

At first, they tried to emotionally manipulate me, saying I’m a “smart, topper girl,” not like “other dumb, less qualified daughters,” and that I would understand and end the relationship on my own. But when I refused, they started taunting me: calling me an ungrateful daughter who doesn’t trust her parents, saying I “talk like a 12th fail,” that I have “mental issues,” and that they “wasted their efforts educating me to the highest level only for me to fall for a gutter guy.” They even said they were so proud of me just a month ago when I received an award for being a college topper, and now I’ve only brought them shame and tension. My dad started threatning me to have a heart attack, taking half days from office, while my mom kept crying, saying, “What will society and our relatives think that we let our daughter go to such an unqualified man?”""How will I prove to my in-laws that I succeeded by sending my daughter away to the wealthiest man?"" They even gave me an ultimatum: either choose him or the family. I love them both, so how am I supposed to make such a cruel choice? It’s completely unfair. My boyfriend is well-educated, respectful, and kind. I’ve never met someone so mature and genuine, and I truly love him. But my parents have gone overboard, even labeling him as a “criminal for trapping good earning girls” without any reason. He earns more than me and he has offers in his hand which has pay more than me. They’ve met him only once, very briefly, when he came over as a friend. My mom just made him coffee and went inside, saying she and my dad were shy to talk. Now, those same parents are saying, “We judged him in one look that he looks poor and like a slum guy.” The audacity, honestly. They don't even know him properly and are not ready to meet him at any cost. My sister has also taken their side, which makes it even harder to convince anyone at home. I always wanted to get married around 27–28, but my parents are pressuring me to marry by next year and only to someone of their choice. They even said that if I bring my own choice, he must be a doctor or engineer with massive wealth and highest qualification possible.

What’s worse is that they openly told me they’d rather I marry a man chosen through an arranged marriage, someone who has money but no love for me. When I asked what they would do if such a man ever hit me or turned out to have poor values, they said they would “just sort the matter out” because “men are men.” (Yes, that’s their exact statement.) When I told them I’m an adult and can make my own decisions, they flat out said, “No, you’re not an adult. Even when you turn 35, we’ll take all major decisions for you, especially marriage.” I told them I won’t marry anyone else, and they said they’d rather see me single than with him. Even threatned me to resign from job, but I firmly said ""Do whatever you guys want to do, I am not going to leave my job at any cost"".

Lately, I’ve been having nightmares not for myself, but out of fear that they might harm my boyfriend in some way. They haven’t been physically violent with me, but the fights have been intense it’s literally been me versus my entire family. I’m losing hope, but one thing I’ve realized is that this fight is no longer just about my relationship, it’s also about my independence. When I said I was definitely going to move out, my parents told me that “girls who move out end up in sex trafficking or prostitution.” They’ve completely lost control and are saying anything they can to manipulate me into staying trapped in this cage. My fault? I’ve never once rebelled in my entire life. Always said yes to their decisions. I’ve always been the kind of daughter any parent or society would consider “the perfect one.”

Even if I have to stay late at work, they start panicking and say, “Call your manager and tell them you can’t stay late, just work from home or you know change jobs” Horrendous, right? Now my mom and sister have started giving me the silent treatment. My dad is pretending to be normal, but I’m not talking to any of them.

Please give me some advice on how to proceed with this situation. I’m scared and losing hope… but my boyfriend has been extremely supportive and told me to stand my ground for my own life and happiness. He even promised that we especially he would win their hearts, but to me, it feels impossible right now.",1,1762069147.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1ombca0,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ombca0/where_to_go_and_how_to_fix_sleep/,Where to Go and How to Fix Sleep,"I’m in my early/mid 20s. I haven’t slept uninterrupted for more than 2-3 hours in about 12-13 years. I don’t really have a problem getting to sleep, but I have trouble staying asleep. I wake up anywhere from 10-15 times a night (that I know of and remember) for a few minutes each time, roll over, and fall back asleep relatively quickly.

A few years ago, I had a sleep study done and was just told that I slept poorly and that I probably didn’t have sleep apnea (not a high enough score on the index), but they wanted me to try a CPAP machine for 5-6 months. I kind of got busy with life and didn’t think that was necessary (had another sleep study where I used a CPAP machine and slept even worse) and never ended up doing it.

My doctor did say I moved my legs a decent bit.

I had under 5 hours of sleep each sleep study and they were both very fragmented. I felt like both were very similar to how I sleep every night, so basically that for the last 12-13 years.

I have a pretty nice watch, which may not be the most accurate thing, but seems to be at least semi accurate from the things I can track otherwise and verify with it. I generally get 4.5-5.5 hours of sleep a night with over an hour spent awake from the time I first fall asleep to when I get up. It usually says anywhere from 0-30min REM sleep.

I also had my blood tested and my ferritin was 7, which I believe is low for an early 20s male, but they just said to try and eat more iron rich foods.

I’ve tried everything else. No screens close to bedtime/no blue light, melatonin, Benadryl, other random supplements, etc. I don’t really have caffeine ever (rarely drink coffee, have pop sometimes and almost always early in the day/afternoon). I’m pretty active everyday. I do not take naps.

My doctor told me it was normal to feel tired when you get up in the mornings and that feeling well rested wasn’t really a thing.

Generally, a night of sleep looks like this: I’ll lay down and fall asleep within maybe 20-30 minutes and only sleep for maybe half an hour, wake up feeling kind of alert, then fall back asleep for maybe an hour or two, then start waking up every 15-30 minutes until I have to get up.

I recently moved and am not sure how to go about getting this figured out. I don’t think I can go straight to a specialist, so maybe I need to just go to a regular doctor? Will they help? Or will they refer me? What can even be done about this? Seems like only medication could help, which I don’t love, but don’t know what else I could do.

I can’t really even tell how it’s affecting my life because I don’t know what it feels like to sleep correctly. I say it’s been 12-13 years, but it honestly may have been my whole life, I just didn’t really recognize until then.

I feel like I stumble over my words sometimes, get headaches, anxious, sometimes have a hard time remembering things/portions of my life, etc., but I don’t know if this is why or what’s going on.",1,1762069068.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

When I was on Prozac before, I couldn’t tolerate caffeine at all. I realized way too late that coffee was constantly triggering anxiety and basically preventing the medication from reaching its full potential. It felt like caffeine was pulling me one way and the SSRI was trying to pull me the opposite way.

With Paroxetine I can tolerate caffeine more, but I still feel like I’d do better without it or with much less of it. So recently I tapered down from daily coffee → to only green tea and black tea instead. Maybe later I’ll try going fully caffeine-free.

Today is day 2 after tapering down and honestly, I do feel some anxiety creeping in, and I’m assuming it might be a bit of caffeine withdrawal kicking in. Has anyone else experienced this when reducing or removing caffeine?

I’m curious what worked best for other people:
	•	reducing coffee but keeping tea
	•	switching to decaf
	•	going fully caffeine-free
	•	timing caffeine differently
	•	or any supplements / strategies that helped during withdrawal

If you’ve gone through this, did lowering caffeine actually help your SSRI work more smoothly over time?

He's had radical cholecestomy in March 2024 with clear margin. Post that, He’s been through several lines of treatment over the last year:

1. Gemcitabine + Cisplatin (6 cycles)
2. S-1 (tegafur) - 4 cycles 
3. Irinotecan + Durvalumab 3 cycles
    → later PTBD + stent
4. Irinotecan + Durvalumab + Capecitabine 4 cycles
    → developed sepsis that paused treatment for around 1 month. Again PTBD + SEMS was performed
5. TAS-102 + Regorafenib 2 cycles
    → two infection in between cycles (GNB, GPC), melena and coffee-ground vomiting towards the end of the last cycle, CT showed progression

Recently he was told there are no further active cancer options and has been referred to palliative care.

Over the past couple of weeks he’s had:

* Persistent abdominal bloating and tightness
* Poor appetite and very little sleep
* Occasional greenish vomiting that gives short-term relief
* Dark brown stool at times
* Very much Weakness and mild leg swelling

An ascitic tap was done a few days ago – 1 L fluid removed. Fluid cytology showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, total protein 1.6 g/dL, albumin 0.35 g/dL (serum albumin 1.94 g/dL).
He had three albumin infusions and will likely start spironolactone (Aldectol) after a fluid work-up. The doctors also started Carvedilol (Cardivas) for maintaining portal pressure.

I’m meeting the GI and palliative teams again on Monday.
Right now his bloating makes him very uncomfortable, and I’m trying to understand what others have found most helpful at this stage.

What I’m hoping to learn,

* How you have managed malignant ascites or bloating — albumin, diuretics, tapping frequency, positioning, diet, anything that gave relief.
* How to make home care easier (hydration, comfort, sleep).
* Emotional / practical advice for family members when doctors move focus fully to palliative care.

I have just jotted down this question from chat gpt. I just want him to get better, I know he won't and I hate to be so realist but I really hope some magical drug gets produced that can help him to fight this battle. ",1,1762068349.0,gallbladdercancer,0,1.0,False

Now to the present day. Recently, my mom has been mentioning wanting me to go to the gym. I work typically from outside (like coffee shops), because I work best in outer environments.

Body:
Hey everyone - long-time lurker, first time poster. I recently added a statement piece from Nama Home and wanted to share my experience: the Escalate Coffee Table: https://namahome.in/products/escalate-coffee-table

Basic details

Brand: Nama Home.

Product: Escalate Coffee Table.

Finish: Aged Gunmetal Grey. 

Dimensions: 101 × 101 × 46 cm. 

Material: Aluminium, handcrafted in India. 

Style inspiration: The ridged texture takes cues from escalator steps. 


What I like

The finish and texture are absolutely striking- the ridged surface gives it an almost sculptural feel.

Because it’s from Nama Home and designed with a bold aesthetic, it elevates (no pun intended) the space in a way ordinary coffee tables don’t.

The gunmetal tone is modern and pairs well with both wood and metal accents.

Hand-crafted, limited edition feel - good for anyone who values design over mass-market furniture.

Things to consider

It is a premium item - expect a premium price.

Being aluminium and heavy in looks, placement and supporting décor need to match (don’t surround it with too many competing bold pieces).

It says “Indoor Use only. 

Because the design is bold and specific, the rest of your living space should allow this piece to shine instead of crowding it.

My verdict
If you’re looking to invest in a centerpiece that works both as furniture and as design art, the Escalate from Nama Home delivers. If you’re more budget-conscious or want a subtle piece, you may want to explore alternatives - but this one does make a statement.

How I styled it
Placed it in front of a mid-century style sofa, kept the rug neutral and low-profile, and used minimal accessories on the table top - letting the texture speak. Balanced the rest of the furniture around it with lighter forms so the table could be the anchor.

Final thoughts
Design pieces like this are more than just furniture - they tell a story. If you buy it, treat it like a piece of art + function. And of course, if you’re checking out Nama Home’s collection, make sure your room layout and styling support the boldness of this piece.",1,1762067717.0,namaluxuryfurniture,0,1.0,False

Thanksgiving - Thursday, November 27 from 2 p.m. - 4p.m. for a special Thanksgiving meal, or until food runs out.

For me, food is personal, it's love, it's humanity, it's a human right, and it is a way to show not only my family, but my community, how important you all are to me. If you need a meal, just come eat one on one of these dates.

If you're interested in helping, email me at jacki@kingfishertucson.com for volunteer efforts, we would love your help especially on Thanksgiving, and if you can't volunteer and / or would rather donate something to keep this happening, and keep feeding our community, we've set up a GoFundMe at https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kingfisher-feed-tucson-families-in-need, or if you have another creative idea, send me a note.

One of the more discussed 3* on this subreddit, I had high expectations in coming here and had a really nice experience overall but definitely some dishes which I thought were lacking. 

Service was excellent, I had 3 of the wait staff rotating during the menu and they were all lovely to talk to. I really enjoyed the table side preparation and plating, they seemed really on it and clearly practiced alot with they did it so easily. The meal was around 2 hours and 20 minutes

The menu has recently increased in price noticeably, now at ¥56925 per person after tax and service. I think the cost to value ratio isn’t great, I am interesting in coming again in the future to try different items but not for the foreseeable future. I enjoyed the meals at Sezanne and Joel Robuchon in tokyo personally. 

I ordered the non alcoholic pairing which was generally good, not great. Did like their version of non alcoholic wine made from beetroot and blueberries, the flavour was more pronounced than other versions I’ve had. 

1. Koshu grape and grape juice mocktail with seasonal vegetable crisps and tofu sour cream - thought it was a fun way to start the meal

2. Risotto with matsutake mushrooms, Ise lobster, scallops, and Sasaki Nishiki rice. Matsutake fragrance was amazing and the umami of the seafood was delicious. 

3. 64 kinds of salad - every bite was so varied in flavour and intensity, it was great fun to try a range of vegetables in different combinations with seasoning placed around the plate. Not every bite was as good as the other 

4. Slow cooked turnip with brown butter and parsley sauce, croutons and cured ham - another staple of the restaurant, didn’t love it to be honest. The flavour of the turnip was a bit too mild for me, the sauce helped give it some punch. 

5. Grilled whey marinated Grouper, with Americaine sauce and parsnip pure - finished in front of the table for a bit of theatre, the sauce was delicious and pairs nicely with the dish. 

6. Kyoto roasted duck with red wine sauce and sauteed makomodake & cauliflower mushroom with white wine sauce - favourite of dish, exceptionally well cooked duck and the makomodake was extremely delicious. sweetness and umami expanded with each bite. 

7. Wholewheet pasta with kyoto duck consomme and meatballs - looked and felt like a soba dish, was ok overall 

8. Cheese course - 6 types of sauce some with accompaniments, first time having brown cheese which had a caramel sweet flavour which was tasty. 

9. island banana panna cotta with jasmine flower ice cream with passion fruit sauce and filo crisp - enjoyed it even though not a banana in desserts person, jasmine flower flavour was perfect. Crisp and passion fruit sauce gave it more complexity

10. Petit fors served with matcha and a peanut milk

# *The Langley Directive*  
  
---  

## **Episode 1: The Morning Brief**

The Central Intelligence Agency begins every day the same way: by pretending it knows what’s going on.

Leonard Graves had long ago learned the trick. You didn’t need to *know*—you just needed to *sound like you knew*. So, he read from the daily intelligence brief like a priest intoning liturgy, his voice steady, grave, and full of unearned certainty.

“Item one,” he said, to the assembled cluster of deputy directors, analysts, and assorted career masochists. “The Russians are pretending not to hack us. Again. Countermeasures ongoing.”

He glanced up. A few heads nodded sagely, as if “ongoing” meant something. It didn’t. It never did.

In the back of the room, **Conrad Vale**, his deputy, was taking notes with the quiet focus of a man compiling a dossier for future blackmail. Leonard had noticed this weeks ago. Vale’s penmanship was suspiciously precise. No one that ambitious wrote neatly unless it was for posterity.

Vale caught the Director’s glance and smiled—perfect teeth, PR-approved. Leonard smiled back, the tight-lipped grimace of an apex predator who’s recently realized his reflection has younger eyes.

“Item two,” Leonard continued. “War's broken out in the Middle East.”

Another wave of approving murmurs.

He let the moment linger, then closed the folder with a deliberate slap. “Good work, everyone. Let’s keep up the good fight.”

---  

Vale was already at his side before he’d left the room.

“Sir,” Vale said, “the President’s team requested we, uh, streamline the daily reports. Fewer jokes. More actionable data.”

Leonard stopped walking. “More actionable data. Wonderful. Tell them to find some.”

Vale’s grin didn’t falter. “Of course, sir. Also, if you’d like, I can take the next NSC briefing off your plate. Lighten the load.”

Leonard’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes narrowed just a hair—subtle enough to be deniable. “That’s thoughtful of you, Conrad. But if I let you brief them, they might get the impression I’m dispensable.”

“Of course not, sir.”

“Good.” He smiled faintly. “Because I’m not.”

Vale nodded, but his eyes were already measuring the size of Leonard’s office for when he’d move in.

---  

At Langley, rumor was faster than satellite transmission. By lunchtime, word had spread that Graves was “phasing out.” Someone overheard someone who had overheard someone who’d once seen him take a blood pressure pill. In the cafeteria, analysts whispered about his “succession plan.”

Meanwhile, Leonard Graves was in his office, pouring bourbon into his coffee and reading a memo about new security badge colors.

He sighed. “This agency would assassinate a foreign head of state in the morning and spend the afternoon arguing over the shade of blue on the lanyards.”

\- Coffee/old looking white under dress, dark gray pinkish-purple kirtle and the waist isn't sitched at all like it's supposed to be, the white dress underneath has very long sleeves and the kirtle over it has very big puffy sleeves and it's god awful and even the other maidens are confused as to why I'm the only one without accesories like a ribbon wrapped around the waist and why I look like a peasant maiden and not fairytale maiden like them and we're allowed to bring our own stuff to add to our own costumes but I genuinely don't know how to fix this and I don't wanna buy something that I'm only gonna wear 3 times so I'd rather DIY it but I don't even know what to do and everytime I put on my outfit I wanna cry and all their other outfit ideas were WEDDING dresses for a maiden, which were all ripped and way to big and I'm so overwhelmed because our preformance is so soon and I don't even have an offical costume yet, Any tips on what I can do to fix my outfit?

I had a pretty uncomfortable headache and feeling exactly like being ""hungover"" for a few hours last night. A 400mg ibuprofen and a bottle of water helped tremendously. Just like a hangover, using the restroom #2 seemed to give me relief like I was getting something toxic out of my body.

I attempted to get it from the pharmacy here in Mexico. 3/3 did not know about it or carry it. I never felt terrible and today was the most relaxed my body has felt in the last 2 months, especially around the shoulders and upper back area. For reference I've been taking 150 xl without missing a single dose.

I am a little unsure still, and I assume I was probably a week or 2 from getting fully past most major sides as I went through many of the strange ones. Actually my complete list of sides is pretty crazy when I write it out: 
- tightness in shoulders cracking my back by raising  my arms above my head 
- stiff ankles
- weird weird GI tract sensations
- bloating/gas
- memory recall delay
- vivid dreams 
- heart racing 
- insomnia
- hypersensitivity to caffeine 
- weird head rushes 
- ""heartbeat"" in my head especially at temples and neck area 
- high resting heart rate 90+ 
- muscle spasms/twitching
- mild shortness of breath
- high anxiety which was notably high and I was logically aware of it being wrong
- hypersexuality (including potentially risky behavior which luckily did not happen)

Now that I am being forced to quit cold turkey on this 9 day vacation out of the country, I'm likely going to just stop the drug. Most of the crazier sides came and went, but the hypersexuality is problematic for my situation, the caffeine sensitivity makes me sad everyday and I feel like I have to accept suffering in the PM if I want to enjoy coffee in the AM. Even a single cup, which is super duper low compared to my 2-5 cups a day before.

I want to be super clear: I am very thankful for the experience with this drug as it pulled me out of a dark place with no motivation and no drive or focus to get the things, important things, done each day. I've picked up pretty good habits with calisthenics and yoga, I've made important decisions with more certainty and less worrying or pondering on ""what if"" and I've improved my mood and feelings of well-being because of those habits and routines which I would now consider established. I feel like if I land in a rut again, this could be a great solution for me to try again, but for now I am likely going to give it a shot without the bupropion for now.

Any experiences, feedback, opinions, and thoughts or questions will be appreciated!! Thank you for taking the time to read through my post.  ",1,1762066245.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

1omaihp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omaihp,Detailed Review of my best in collection | Montale Intense Café,"So few weeks back I was about to make my 5th expensive frag purchase and I was confused between Mancera Coco Vanille/Montale Intense Café. Mancera I had a decant and I liked it and Montale was something I tried few years back in one of the retail stores. I was confused because though I liked warm and creamy coconut of Mancera but I crave for rosy-floral-milk coffee scents. Decided to go with Montale and the best trigger I've ever pulled.

Presenting you the best of my collection

Intense Café is one of those fragrances that instantly stands out and stays with you. The first spray hits you with a burst of milk coffee and rose petals. Kinda confusing as you smell both heavy rose and light coffee in the back. But within minutes it turns into something warm, creamy, and almost edible.

It’s not a harsh “espresso shot” kind of scent rather it’s smoother — imagine a latte infused with rose syrup. The rose here isn’t too floral or feminine either; it just adds depth and sophistication, blending perfectly with the amber and musky base. This delivers the experience of sipping a latte in a bustling Parisian café and someone cutting and sprewing rose petals beside you, and back in the café someone is packing a vanilla pastry.

The performance is exactly what you expect from Montale — beast mode longevity and projection.

Definitely not for someone who only likes fresh or aquatic perfumes, but if you love sweet, gourmand, and cozy fragrances with a touch of sophistication, this one is a must-have.

For me, Intense Café isn’t just about smelling good — it’s about setting a mood. It’s the kind of scent that makes you feel calm, confident, and slightly indulgent at the same time.

From this I can now understand the difference between designers and niche. Niche are more for creating an experience with the scent rather than mass pleasing.",2,1762065764.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False
1omahkc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omahkc,Midnight Addiction & In the Stars layering,"Midnight Addiction reminds me of Into the Night, it also has excellent staying power and I was able to smell the single spray 3 hours later after going out with friends. It smelled faintly after getting home 6 hours later, but I also run warm and many scents including high end perfumes don’t last all day on me. 


A surprisingly good combo for FFMs is Midnight Addiction and In the Stars. My husband says it smells more like a perfume but is really pleasant. It has a surprisingly long staying power and I can still clearly smell it the next day on my fleece jacket. 


The other surprisingly good combo is: Calming Skies body wash (used for sleep), Into the Night body cream (dry down is a little different than the FFM on me), Midnight Addiction and Wild Vanilla FFM. It’s warm, a little spicy vanilla, fruit undertones. It is definitely a fall/winter scent. It smells very good together and will try it again during the day (minus the Calming Skies body wash) when I’m moving around to see how it works on my sweaty skin.

I am hoping to take advantage of the upcoming sales, but want to know exactly what I'm going for before they start.

I have (almost) settled on the Breville Bambino, mostly because of it's small footprint, and because all the reviews seem to say it is a solid little machine for its price. I am a coffee snob when it comes to taste, but I am not interested in going down the very deep rabbit-hole of home espresso. I just want a little machine that can pull a good shot, not a new hobby.

I will obviously need a grinder to go with it. I love the look of the DF54, but it is a little more than I was hoping to spend and doesn't seem to be available at the big retailers that will have big discounts. I am the only coffee drinker at home, so single dosing appeals to me, but it's not essential. The Baratza Encore also gets good reviews and is cheaper, but also bigger and chunkier.

I am very open to other suggestions.

I have some experience with dialling in and adjusting for particular beans, so I do want some level of control.

I'd appreciate any advice on the grinders I mentioned, or others you think may suit. And I'm open to advice on espresso machines themselves, if you have a better suggestion than the Bambino.

Ideally I'd like to spend $500 all up, but for the two parts I could go up to $700.",2,1762065579.0,AustralianCoffee,3,1.0,False
1omagm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1omagm0/complicated_m26_f31/,"Complicated M26, F31","TL;DR; gf is friends with ex, but living in their apartment.


So I’ve been dating this girl for 6 months. We met in person, then started dating and pretty much saw each other every week. The only odd thing was around a month in I realised I hadn’t seen her place - no stress, so I posed the question “hey how I about I come to yours tonight?” She said I couldn’t because her sister was there and it was only a 1 bed place, no issue in my mind as siblings, shit happens etc etc.

Anyway a week or so on we were in bed and I could see something was on her mind and finally she says can I tell you something, I say go ahead and she says, fine I live with my sister in a 1 bed place but my ex owns the place. For context the ex is 10 years older than her, they’d been dating for 8 years then broke up. This is 2 years on. Again it’s a bit odd but in my mind I try to see the best and thought hey maybe it was an amicable breakup, he found somewhere to live and rented to this girl. Odd thing number 1 was rent is subsidized and he has left a bunch of his stuff there, not clothes but collectables.

At this point I said well perhaps you should find your own place so you can fully close a chapter of your life before starting a fresh one, not pressuring but floating the idea. She told me he was seeing someone and had been for a while so it was algood. Anyway one night we’re about to go sleep and he calls her at midnight… this was the second time in a couple weeks it happened. Not to worry, I mean he’s seeing someone right?

The weird thing she said they’re basically family and now he’s like an older brother figure etc etc, but they still catch up from time to time for coffee, say every 6 weeks. Again weird but I want to trust people. Another caveat is she said she never initiates the convo, always the other way around, him asking how she is etc.

Let’s get to the curve ball. Turns out two years ago as they broke up they’d been living together, the sister had come for a gap year - she’s 28F. The girl who I’m now dating comes home to find her ex and her sister in bed together. She’s obviously embarrassed, upset etc etc.

What I can’t fathom though is how two years on the she still is “friends” with the ex and lives in this place with the sister. The ex lives elsewhere but when the girl I’m seeing isn’t around he often comes round to have wine or sleepover with the sister, as they’re still together.

I keep saying it’s unhealthy to be in this odd relationship whereby you think you’re friends with someone who did some thing like that, but she always says it’s “too complicated” , “too much history” or that “the flat is too good”.

Personally though I find this very very weird and if it were me I’d have blocked the ex 2 years ago.

She is saying she wants to move in with me next year, but I really want to get to the bottom of why she would still entertain a friendship with the ex, and if that’s acceptable? If not how do I raise it without imploding the relationship, I really do love the girl, but this keeps itching at my head.",1,1762065563.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

1omacrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1omacrb/confused_about_the_toxic_parent_never_ending/,Confused about the toxic parent never ending manipulation cycle. Need your opinion or experience on this.,"A little background for context: I grew up in an Indian household with a narcissistic mother and a submissive father. My father truly loved me, but my mother’s love was always conditional and often absent. I was beaten brutally behind my father's eyes and given silent treatment almost every week. I became a people-pleaser and carried deep emotional scars. However I was academically strong and eventually built a life abroad. My father passed away in 2019, and since then my mother lives alone. I support her financially each month — beyond her pension — covering not just her needs but also her luxuries like travel, jewelry etc. Through therapy, I’ve been processing my childhood trauma. Meanwhile I met my husband abroad. My husband, who has Indian roots but was raised in a 1st world country, has gone through something similar — he also had toxic Indian parents but, with the help of therapy, he cut them off five years ago without regret.

Now I’m five months pregnant. I recently went to India both to visit my mother before giving birth and to finalize the purchase of an apartment that I bought for her comfort, since her old place had no elevator. 
Three days ago, we had a major fight. It started when a friend from abroad asked me to bring several packages for his child that he ordered online without asking me. Though I found it inconsiderate considering limited luggage space, I agreed and planned to discuss it later. My mother, however, kept criticizing him and suggested I should humiliate him indirectly by talking about it in front of someone else. I found that degrading and told her so — asking her to reflect on where such behavior comes from. She got furious, saying she wouldn’t move into the new apartment because it’s “my apartment,” despite it being chosen and bought for her comfort. Hurt and exhausted, I said fine — she could stay where she is. My husband and I decided to move to an Airbnb for our last two days to avoid more conflict. As soon as we started packing, she threatened to commit suicide — something she’s done my entire life to manipulate my father and me. This time, I didn’t give in. I told her those threats wouldn’t work anymore. Triggered and overwhelmed, I confronted her about everything — her lifelong narcissism, the emotional abuse to me and to my dad even in his sickness, her denial of what happened when I was sexually harassed by her sister’s husband, whom she still sees as if nothing happened. In response she shouted, cried, called her brother to complain about me, denying everything she said before. Then I gave her an ultimatum: either she tells her sister the truth in front of me or we cut ties. She asked my uncle for advice, and after some resistance, they finally agreed to call my aunt. My aunt was shocked, but apologized, and acknowledged what happened. 
After the call, I asked my mother to apologize to me too. She did, but with an insincere attitude, saying she didn’t know what for. I rejected that hollow apology. The next two days, she gave us the silent treatment — ignoring my husband entirely, not even offering morning coffee, no basic mannerism. Offended, I decided we wouldn’t eat at home anymore. When she suggested lunch on our last day, I declined, saying we preferred to eat outside. She again threatened not to move into the apartment but in a calmer tone. I said it was her choice, and she went silent again.

After returning abroad, I texted her to say we’d arrived safely, but the message didn’t go through. Then I tried to call on Whatsapp and see that it's not working. I thought she turned off the internet by mistake. So I texted my uncle and told him to call her and let her know. Apparently he could not contact her either and got worried. He went all the way to visit her and found her fine, just sulking and claiming she “has no one.” She intentionally turned off her phone. He told me not to take it personally, that she’d calm down in a few days. 
But this is a constant cycle — drama, manipulation, silence, and no accountability. Everyone in the family excuses her behavior, puts up with it, saying she lives alone, but she’s always been like this. She is the youngest daughter of the family as well and her siblings always covers up for her even when they get abused by her. She refuses therapy, though she clearly needs it. I’m exhausted and don’t want her emotional chaos to affect my peace, especially now that I’m pregnant. I feel torn — I want to cut her off for my mental health, yet I feel guilty knowing she’s alone and won’t seek help. I don’t know what to do anymore.",2,1762065158.0,indiasocial,2,1.0,False

1oma9bz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oma9bz,Trip Report for Furong ancient town with the waterfall...,"Trip Report for Furong.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**NOTE: PHOTOS ATTACHED TO THIS POST IS OF FURONG ONLY.**

**FURONG = 1 day / night and its enough to see / do everything!**

**I caught the 11:30am 25min train ride from Zhangjiajiexi (west) train station to Furongzhen train station.** My home-stay owners picked me up and dropped me off at Furongzhen train station: I had arranged with them via WeChat message, a few days beforehand, and there was no extra charge. I didn’t see many taxis or DiDis around – maybe I didn’t notice them? I was busy looking out the car window admiring the scenery, checking out the streets, buildings etc. On the way to my home-stay, we stopped at a security checkpoint gate (there were x4 officers here, a bit daunting) with a ticket office: **you need to buy a ticket to enter Furong ancient town scenic area, where The Waterfall is.** I purchased my ticket on Trip.com while in the car, then got out of the car and walked over to the ticket office to show staff my booking and passport, who gave me a paper ticket with a QR Code on it. You can buy from the ticket office as well– I chose to buy on Trip.com as it was a bit cheaper and so I could get points!

**IMPORTANT: do not loose or damage this paper ticket as you need to show the ticket staff, or security, your paper ticket – several times – throughout your visit. Every time you enter/exit the ancient town (there are several gates and you can also visit via boat) and to access certain areas within the ancient town, you need to show your paper ticket and get it scanned.** It was really annoying but these are the rules. **If you’re only visiting Furong ancient town and The Waterfall for a few hours, the taxi or DiDi, will drop you off at the main entrance area where there’s a big tourist information centre, Luckin Coffee and KFC. I cannot remember (not 100% certain) if there were lockers for suitcases (I wasn’t looking for them), sorry... please make a post and check with other redditors or contact the tourist information centre for confirmation.**

I stayed at **Guixin Inn for 1 night = $37 AUD.** I booked on Trip.com... I had a private room with a double bed, TV, wet bathroom with a sit-down western toilet and an amazing view of the lake, mountains and village on the other side / opposite of the ancient town with The Waterfall. It’s a simple, basic room in a traditional Chinese architecture building and about 10min walk to the ancient town and waterfall. If you don’t need a luxurious place to stay, I highly recommend this home-stay. I felt like I was really in the countryside and the view from my room was 110% worth the price. It’s also very quiet, away from the partying – loud music, karaoke, drinking etc. that occurs around 9pm+ inside the ancient town.

When I walked from my home-stay to the ancient town, I passed **a 3-way street ticket checkpoint**. I had to show my paper ticket and the officer scanned it. About 5min later, I was inside the ancient town and on the main strip called **Slate Street, where there’s many restaurants overlooking The Waterfall** (looking down at The Waterfall) for lunch. **Here, restaurant staff will approach you and show you their menus to try to get you into their restaurant... It’s a bit awkward but the staff aren’t aggressive – they don’t chase you or yell at you. Just be mentally prepared and politely say no or shake your head, if you don’t want to eat at any of these restaurants... but many visitors do, because they all have balconies with wonderful waterfall views!** I paid 120 CNY for some fried rice (huge serving), fried fish and 600ml bottle of Fanta. It’s pricey, but of course, you’re paying for the location...

When I was here, at 1pm on Saturday 6th September, it was quiet: I saw maybe 80+ people in the ancient town and waterfall area. At night, around 7pm onwards, I saw maybe 400+ people and it wasn’t overcrowded – there were no queues, no lines at the popular viewpoints to take photos, no pushing or shoving, etc. I found it really pleasant visiting Furong during the day and at night, especially compared to Zhangjiajie. It seemed there were more people at night because the Chinese bus tour groups dropped by then...

After lunch, I wandered through every alleyway or cobblestone footpath that forked off the main strip called **Slate Street**. **There are more restaurants, cafes and eateries than souvenir or clothing shops in Furong ancient town** (I couldn’t find anything to buy and I’m a shopper!). I visited a few small museums and temples (10min needed for each one) on Slate Street, strolled pass the **Chastity Memorial Archway** (very cool photo-stop) and **Xixi Ancient Well.** I stopped by **Tusi King’s Bridge (must visit, popular undercover resting spot & performances are held here too), Copper Pillar Park, Hand-Waving Hall (main stage area for outdoor performances), Yougang Palace, Rock-Jumping Stones (there’s x3 pathways you can hop along over the stream here)** to name a few. **NOTE: all maps have different names of the attractions or landmarks in the ancient town, so I’m only listing a few as a guide to what you can see, or venture pass, while you’re here.**

**If you only want to visit The Waterfall,** then start from the **Furong Town Pier**, walk through the **Viewing Gallery Bridge (wooden covered boardwalk with red lanterns)**, which leads you to **The Waterfall**. **NOTE: you have to walk directly behind / underneath The Waterfall – you will get a bit wet and the cobbled footpath is slippery so take your time**, then climb up a mountain of stairs (ugh), pass a boutique hotel, **Yinan Theatre**, a toilet block, and head over to the **Waterfall Platform (main observatory concrete deck with a small stage) for the best views of The Waterfall.** Now, **if you choose to walk down a flight of stairs near here, you will end up at a small pier / dock where wooden dingy boats can take you across the river (I saw one coming from the other side of the river), to a garden, and a nice eye-level viewpoint of The Waterfall.** I didn’t see many people walk down / up these stairs – but it’s worth exploring this area, if you have time – like 30min is enough, depending on your fitness level. **There’s also a dirt footpath down here that leads you to The Waterfall – you see in you-tube videos and on some maps, but it was closed off for reconstruction or maintenance when I was here.**

**FYI: you can follow this route, above, or in reverse. There’s only two ways to visit The Waterfall – from the left or right side. Either way, you will walk up, or down, the mountain of stairs to get back to the ancient town area. Unless, you want to back-track and only enter/exit The Waterfall via the Furong Town Pier and Viewing Gallery Bridge…**

I headed back to my home-stay around 5pm, unpacked, took a shower and enjoyed the view from my room for a bit, then ventured out by 7pm for dinner and explored the whole ancient town again for the night lights. I also watched the **8pm 30min show at the Hand-Waving Hall outdoor stage main square area** then followed the crowd over to the **9pm 40min indoor show at Yinan Theatre which I enjoyed very much!**. If you’re visiting Furong at night, I highly recommend the 9pm show. **Near the Hand-Waving Hall, there’s a board with the show schedule or ask your hotel / home-stay for it. It doesn’t cost extra to watch the shows and performances.** My home-stay sent me WeChat messages with the show schedule and pin-point maps (open up in Amap) which was awesome!

I’m not a drinker or party-type person, so after I watched **the night lights on The Waterfall – several times, (full cycle was about 5mins, you see different colours shining on The Waterfall)**, I made my way back through the ancient town and to my home-stay. The ancient town is lit up really nicely at night, its very pretty... it was also challenging to take photos at some places because many lights flickered or due to the glare / reflection with my mobile phone camera. I was in bed by 11pm...

**Now, many people (seem to) choose to visit Furong for a few hours and during the day. Many people (seem to) prefer visiting Fenghuang at night. I think, its worth visiting both ancient towns during the day and night = I recommend to stay x1 night in Furong and (at least) x1 night in Fenghuang. You have to really rush to see both Furong and Fenghuang in the same day and it takes time to get to the ancient towns from the train stations (20min+ each way) – and back to Zhangjiajie, plus time for lunch and dinner… I understand people what to make the most of their time in China, and some people just want the highlights of each town/city/province they visit, but I do encourage everyone to consider staying overnight in Furong, and overnight in Fenghuang – they are both really great places!**

My next posts will be about my visit to Fenghuang then to Wangxiangu...

Mom loved it because living abroad where the U.S. dollar was strong, allowed her to live the life of an Embassy socialite. We had servants; a maid, a cook, and a gardener. Instead of having a career or being a housewife, my mom led charity events for the embassy's wives, went on daytrips with these women, and attended tea parties; many of which were hosted by the ladies of other embassies. 

She wasn't happy when my Dad's job brought him back stateside in 1977. Back in the States, we reverted to middle class life and mom couldn't handle being a housewife; nor did she have any interest in finding a job.

One of the things she did that I really hated was that she started to treat me as a servant. In Thailand, she had fallen into the habit of taking a mid-day nap. Whenever she woke up, she would ring a bell, and the cook would brew her a cup of coffee. The coffee would then be delivered on a silver tray by a maid.

The first chore she ever gave me was to make her coffee whenever she rang a little bell. I didn't mind doing this but what really ticked me off was that she didn't show me the courtesy that she had showed our servants. 

Instead of understanding that it takes time to brew coffee, she would repeatedly ring her bell and scream, ""COFFEE"" as though her impatience would somehow make the coffee brew faster.

After bringing mom her coffee, did I get a ""thank you?"" Of course not. She would scream insults about how I was lazy and stupid. In time, she began to tell me that I would never amount to anything and that I would be lucky if I became a garbage collector. I was sixteen at the time. 

As time passed, I became responsible for dusting, vacuuming, and washing, drying, and folding laundry. I also became responsible for washing the family car, for mowing the lawn, raking leaves, weeding the yard, and trimming hedges. 

Nothing I did was ever good enough. I wasn't thorough enough in dusting. I didn't vacuum ""fast enough"". I was too slow with doing laundry. The laundry wasn't properly folded. The hedges were uneven. The lawn always seemed to have a patch that I had missed. 

(sigh)

At night she got into arguments with Dad. She wanted to return abroad. She wanted to reprise her role as an Embassy ""grand dame."" 

I was relieved after I graduated. I went out of state to attend college. I was doing well until my mom called during the middle of my freshman year. She called at 2 AM to tell me that she had filed for divorce against my father. 

""Whose side are you on?"" she demanded. 

Given the hour, I was still half asleep. Although I had heard what she had told me, I hadn't had time to process what she had said. 

""What?"" I asked. 

""Are you on your father's side or MY SIDE?"" 

""For what?""

My mom cursed me for having ""wasted"" her time. She hung up on me. She subsequently told her attorney to cut off my college expenses. Although my father was able to borrow money from relatives to pay for my tuition, I had to come up with my own room and board. I got a part-time job through the university as a librarian's assistant. I also found a 2nd part-time job as a supermarket stocker/carry-out. 

In retrospect, I should have cut back on my course load. As it was, I worked 40 hours per week. I fell behind in some of my classes. I was short of sleep. I lost weight because of too many days spent eating ramen noodles. At one point, I wore shoes that had holes in them because I prioritized purchasing used textbooks over buying new shoes.

The phone call that I had with my mother during the freshman year was the last time she ever spoke to me. It would not be until decades later that I learned that she had told all of the relatives on her side of the family to terminate all contact with me. 

Decades have passed.

I have since learned through the family grapevine that mom has fallen upon hard times. Although she had initially found employment as an associate professor for English literature, she lost her job after she was arrested and charged for shoplifting. 

Although I have the financial wherewithal to help her out, I have made no effort to contact her. To my way of thinking, she chose this path many years ago. I'm simply following her lead. 

I've had friends tell me that I should help my mother because she's still my mother. I don't agree. When I was very young, I was raised by a nanny. I was subsequently supervised by servants. I don't recall my birth mother ever doing anything motherly. 

I recall her verbal abuse and her lack of appreciation for my completion of the chores she gave me. I also remember the occasional open faced slaps she dished out for any perceived disrespect. 

If I was too late serving her coffee, SLAP!

""Don't you give me that look!"" she would sometimes snap and SLAP!

When I asked why my sister who was five years younger than I was, never had her own chores to complete, I'd get a lecture about how my sister was more special than I was. She would then beckon me forward her and SLAP! ""That's what you get for impertinence and for not knowing your place in this family!"" she'd snarl.

(Double sigh)

P.S. What's bitterly ironic is that if she had been just a bit more patient, she would have gotten her wish. A year after the divorce, Dad's job took him abroad for another five years. Mom could have returned to her lifestyle as an embassy socialite.  As it was, her life took another path. ",3,1762064674.0,AmITheJerk,7,0.8,False

We stayed in Banff for 4 nights and Lake Louise for 2 nights.

I really like the vibe in Banff. Yes, it's touristy, but it did not feel busy. Maybe it's our timing, but it was not crowded. There were not a lot of people. 

I liked that evervthing that we needed as vacationers were in Banff. Food, shopping, groceries, coffee, boba... we found it in town. I really liked that it was easilv accessible from our hotel. We drove in late and managed to walk to town and pick up decent food, even when it was way past midnight. We did start driving into town once we figured out there was free public parking available by Nesters on Bear Street. 

The vibe in Lake Louise is different. It was still touristy, but it felt far away and distant. Lucky we got to stay in The Fairmont. It's nice because we wake up and we're there. We got to fully enioy the views and jump out for pictures without any hassles besides putting on layers of clothes.

After we've enioved the lake, its surrounding views. and some of the restaurants in The Fairmont, we did end up driving back out to Banff because food. LOL.

We also got to visit Lake Minnewanka, where I took one of my favorite photostp date. We also hiked halfway up Johnston Canyon. 

It was nice during the dates we were there. It was cold, which I like. What made it ""bad"" was the wind chill. We did get used to it after a dav or two. It was mostly sunny on the week we stayed. It really complimented the views. 

It did snow on our day of departure at Lake Louise. Living in Honolulu, this was really cool for us. It felt like we got our share of ""white Christmas."" Our daughter got to experience her first proper snowfall. We played in the snow a lot that morning.

Like any corporation, they needed to come up with a visual emblem to act as the company's brand and identity. While most companies achieve this through a logo or an iconic company product, few if any went to the extent these guys did in commissioning monumental architecture unified by the common motif of a dome with a cupola depicting Ganymede riding atop a phoenix, to act as the company brand. An interesting alternative to having a movie or sports star be the face of your company, to say the least. 

The company was bought out in the 1990s, but its architectural legacy remains adorning Spanish cityscapes with some of the finest works of the Beaux-Arts style. 

Pics 1-3 depict the building on Paseo de Gracia, which some of you may have noticed when visiting Barcelona. Today the first floor houses a Muji, not sure about the rest of the building, seemed vacant last I saw it. 

Pics 4-6 need no introdution as it is the most iconic building the firm ever commissioned, the Metropolis building in Madrid. 

Pics 7&8 depict a lesser known work they commissioned, but also in Madrid and unlike the other buildings, this one is a skyscraper.

1oma6rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1oma6rf/just_got_back_from_traveling_in_thailand/,"Just got back from traveling in Thailand, interacted with a lot of Thais and witnessed the warmth and friendliness they showed toward Khmer like me. Now, I'm not sure anymore whether the hatred of Cambodians toward Thais is justified or truly blind.","As a Khmer Krom living in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, I was lucky enough to avoid the anti-Thai education system that Khmer in Cambodia are taught. That said, I've come across plenty of anti-Thai posts online and heard countless stories from my Cambodian friends about how the Thais stole everything from the Khmer. So I did have a pretty negative view of Thailand, and it stayed that way until I actually traveled to Thailand.

Honestly, I didn't know much about Thailand at all, but when I traveled to Bangkok, I realized that Thai and Khmers are way more similar than different. The food, the way we talk, the clothes, the culture, the language—it's all pretty much identical. It really feels like Thais and Khmers are siblings. What surprised me the most was how incredibly friendly the Thai people are here—if anything, even friendlier than Cambodians.

A lot of times, I was hesitant to tell local Thais that I’m Khmer because the Thailand-Cambodia tensions are still simmering. But once, at an Amazon café, the Thai waitress seemed to pick up on my accent and said, “You’re Khmer, right? Just order an Amazon coffee. We don’t hate Khmers here.” She said it in English, just like that. Honestly, it brought tears to my eyes—Thais were still warm to someone like me, despite all the vicious online attacks and insults from Cambodian extremists. It was nothing like the ugly image of Thais as a nation out to swallow the Khmer whole that I’d heard so many times from Cambodians. And for all the friendliness I felt in Thailand, back in Cambodia a tuk-tuk driver scammed me out of 20,000 riel.

The more Thais I meet, the more I feel like the hatred Cambodians have toward them comes from a brainwashing education system pushed by corrupt politicians to manipulate the people. Watching Burmese, Lao, and even Malaysians sitting and chatting comfortably with Thais, it really seems like we Khmers are the only ones in Southeast Asia still stuck at the bottom of a well—trapped in extreme paranoia, convinced that one day the Thais will swallow us whole again. Meanwhile, Thai history books don’t even mention the Khmer once.

While Vietnam and Thailand teach Khmer Krom like me—and Khmer in Surin—about Khmer culture, history, traditional clothing, and language to preserve and honor Khmer identity, with a focus on building critical thinking through science, math, literature, and physics, Cambodia’s education system mostly drills into Khmer students the glorious history of the Khmer Empire and blames Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand for stealing everything from Khmer.

It's just, I don’t get why Khmers keep blindly blaming neighboring Southeast Asian countries for everything. Lot of Cambodians today love pretend to be victim of “Vietnamese and Thai expansionism,” and the irony is Khmer nation itself bullied smaller neighbors like the Mon kingdom, Laos, and even forced Lao girls into prostitution for Khmer men, if Laotians know what Khmer did to their girl in the past, maybe Laotians see Khmer as Khmer see Vietnamese and Thailand as well. Even Khmer destroyed their own empire when their kings handed over land to the Vietnamese and Thais for free just to cling to the throne. So I don't understand why my Khmers still cry over lost ancient Khmer Empire territory?

As a Khmer Krom myself, I feel like Cambodians hate Thailand for no real reason other than not even knowing why they hate them. Honestly, my trip to Thailand completely changed how I see Thai people, and I think every Cambodian should visit Thailand at least once instead of drowning in the anti-Thai propaganda fed to them by politicians like Sam Rainsy, Hun Sen, and Hun Manet.",13,1762064527.0,ThailandTourism,9,0.81,False
1oma5u3,https://i.redd.it/rsdfkllydsyf1.jpeg,Make Me Your King,"Stephan King said, “Books are a uniquely portable magic.” To read is to voyage through time. Someone dead for thousands of years can speak to you through writing.

But I’m not talking about the metaphorical. I’m talking about the supernatural. Real magic. Let me prove it:

* I was born on June 14, 1985 and went to Catholic school in Canada.
* In grade 8, I played Jesus at the school play. It was between me and a girl. We picked straws and I won.
* My childhood Master gifted me a black belt, it was found in his storage unit after he passed away.
* I once met a theologian at a coffee shop. He received a PhD in Old Testament studies and included me in his dissertation.
* Kanye and I both released “The Key to Life” on the same day. His song and my book. The odds of this happening is one in millions.
* I later announced Chicago as the first city on my US book tour.
* Chicago’s Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo the XIV on May 8, 2025.

In summary: I played Jesus. Received black belt from a dead master. Same wavelength as Kanye. Pope Leo the 14th on 5/8 correlates with my birthdate.

I’m claiming “The Key to Life: In 365 Quotes” possess magic. And I’m also claiming virtually no other book can claim this. Because I’m talking about numbers, and numbers don’t lie.

On the validity of my Black Belt: I will use this dying gift to make you proud. For truth, for honor and for life: We march forward into battle.

Ephesians 6:12–18 NLT

\[12\] For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. \[13\] Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm. \[14\] Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness. \[15\] For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared. \[16\] In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil. \[17\] Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. \[18\] Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.",1,1762064430.0,VanTrinh,0,1.0,False

1oma590,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oma590,(Round 2) Let's see if anyone can figure this out LOL,Ok so I got a bunch of these E5 Ultras for Christmas. When I purchased them GameMT Only had one 256GB SD card in stock. My supplier told me just take the last card and make copies of it for the other units. Welp.... I ve don't everything to copy the stock card to a blank and NOTHING works at all. I've formated the card exactly as the other card and I've also tried formating it in the android device too. The pics show the stock card on the right and the copied card on the left. I have no clue what the hell would cause this to happen or why it's not working at all. The card on the left only shows how many games are on each emulator but it won't show or play the games. I've tried everything. I'm starting to think that GameMT has put some type of copy blocking software in the card so you can't copy it. If anyone has any other ways to try please let me know and I'll buy you a few Starbucks coffees 😂,2,1762064368.0,RetroHandhelds,3,1.0,False
