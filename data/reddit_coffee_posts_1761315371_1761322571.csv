The new daily routine ate up all my thirst for reading and the few hours that were left to me at the end of the day were spend in exhaustion and reminiscence. 

Then my commute changed and I found myself in an underground metro with no internet for 30 mins daily, so I picked up a non fiction from a local street vendor (guilty) and read it bit by bit every working day, only to enjoy the endless river of seretonin today as I finished it!

I like the fact that a good book can act like an anchor to a life with frequent changes in your mood and social settings, like a constant thing that keeps you sane in a volatile world. Now I think that's what partners are for, so single people: get a good book, lol.",2,1761322430.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

Bear with me because that sounds wild. 

I've only worked there a couple of months, and there's not really a power dynamic because I'm a couple of years older than them and I also have an extensive career history, I just left a job where I worked as a AVM at a much bigger hospo company for years and I have managed many bars and so have they, we've both been managing in the industry for many years.
Also, they found out a couple of weeks ago that they're contract is ending unfortunatley, so I intended to wait until after we finished working together to say something. 

Anyway, we've worked together for 2 months and I gay panic at work a fair bit haha 🙈

We have a regular performer at work who comes in regularly, and today we went out for coffee and then some drinks and they kinda said they hoped it was a date and I was a little shocked, pleasantly shocked, but surprised a bit. 
Then I went straight into work and told my barmanager/crush about it and said 'I guess it was unexpected, like I never knew if we were being friendly or flirting, but idk, I'm not great at the social skills, you know? Like, I never know if you and I are flirting or not' and immediatly 100+ people walked through the door, and it was just the two of us on, we didn't stop serving for hours, we ran out of glasses and ice and beer, finally we got everyone out and closed at 2am and sat down for a knock off. 

I appologised immediatly, I had felt so bad all shift, I was so worried I had misread things and had come off as creepy or weird and made them uncomfortable.
But they were actually super adorable and said they had been waiting to talk to me about it all night, and they wanted to say something for weeks but were waiting until we didnt work together anymore to ask me on a date 🤭 but they decided to stay on casually in the company and decided, this morning, that they were going to ask me out after work today haha

It was super cute, we also just spoke a couple of shifts ago about how they need a moment after their last relationship to heal and I spoke about how I need a moment before getting into another relationship to deal with some personal things and things with my nesting relationship. 
We're all poly and queer. 
So it's nothing that's going to happen very soon. 

But it was just so cute to have that chat and to know that they have a crush on me too and I've been smiling and blushing ever since I dropped them home after work 🥰",1,1761322422.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1of1yq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1of1yq4/fm26_beta_6_hours_lots_of_clicks_a_few_bright/,"FM26 Beta: 6 hours, lots of clicks, a few bright spots...and why I'm going back to FM21 (for a while, at least)","Yesterday I loaded up FM26 and I had intended to stay up late to get to grips with the game. Like many people, I did not like what I saw beyond the Manager Creation part. Maybe I was tired? Maybe I was sub-conciously rebelling against the pace and scale of change? Either way, I got about 90 minutes into clicking about (so many clicks!), and I decided to close down the laptop and get a decent night of sleep.

I woke up this morning with a changed mindset. I read through this sub and I was disheartened to see so much negativity, but also and dismayed to see that a lot of what was being said held with my own experience of the night before. But, I am strong willed and I’d made the decision to give the game a good 5 hours before making a decision on whether to revert back to FM21 for a while, or whether to crack on with the FM26 beta. I made a decision not to manage my club, West Bromwich Albion, because it felt too personal and I didn’t want to feel any more dismayed  by likely seeing us lose more than we should as I got used to the new game! So, I chose Peterhead to manage instead. Smaller stage, simpler football. Less pressure. All good. Why Peterhead? Well, I’ve been listening every week to the ‘The Terrace Scottish Football Podcast’ and I’ve really got into lower league Scottish football.

Anyway, I approached the set-up with a really positive mindset. I’d had a good sleep. I’d had some decent coffee and a good breakfast and my work schedule for the day was empty. I could take time, and I did. No rushing straight into match day. I wanted to really set Peterhead up for a decent season, and that would mean I would get to know where everything was on the various new screens. Yes, screens. I refuse to call them tablets or tiles or whatever, I can only adapt to so much, so fast!

I delegated some stuff to my very small back room staff as I normally would. I made a request of the Board to find a Senior Affiliate, as I normally would for a club of this size (declined, no surprise there). I had a tinker with the tactics, choosing a relatively simple in-possession and out-of-possession set-up. Then I had a look around the transfer market, brought a few in on trial and made an end of contract signing to shore up the defence once the biting North Sea wind of January howls in.

Now, the real question. Was I having fun? Was I enjoying it? The night before I had not enjoyed it at all and I was not having fun. This morning, well, yes I was having fun in that I was learning a new interface and getting to know a team I’ve never managed in FM before. But was the enjoyment really there? Yes. But only in patches. The enjoyment was broken, along with the immersion, with the many glitches/bugs/errors/incongruities I encountered along the way. But I ploughed on. As many have defended: “It is the Beta, after all”. Whenever I thought I might just pack it in, I thought back to a comment here that made me really laugh: “There are so many Adaptability 1 managers revealing themselves right now!” – I did not want to be one of those managers. In real life, I consider myself very adaptable and amenable to change. It’s part of life. In game, this one, maybe I’m a bit less adaptable.

I won the first pre-season friendly unexpectedly against a team predicted to win League Two this season. I’ll come to the match play experience in a minute. I went on from that to check out the ‘Instant Result’ option for the next friendly against a non-league side. I won that too. In between games, it was click here-click there-click back over there-click-click-click-click…and it was driving me a bit mad. Then came the first competitive tie of the season in the Scottish League Cup. I was wavering now. I wasn’t sure I wanted to carry on clicking. But, again, mindset. I decided to click on and to play this one. I expected to lose against a much better side in Falkirk. We were also playing away. We did indeed lose, 4-1. But one of my new signings scored on his debut off the bench. Which was nice.

But not nice enough to keep me in the mix with FM26. Over the six hours of play I decided to keep a list of things I liked and things I didn’t which was mean to give me a chance to (a) really cement in my mind what was good about the new layout and game and (b) give me a list of bugs and stuff that I might be able to report to SI. Unfortunately, there were only 3 things on the list of things I liked. I stopped compiling the dislike list after about four hours or so, perhaps prophetically at that point, the list had 13 items on it. My lists are below, and before you read on let me be really clear: I am not a designer, I am not a gamer, I am not a technically minded person so I don’t have or understand the lingo of gaming/UI/UX/design. So, with that in mind, these are my initial observations of the game:

**Like:**

1.      Some of the delegation tasks and screens are much clearer and easier to navigate.

2.      There are a lot (but not too many) options, content and choices in different menus.

3.      The new manager set-up is great (but not something I really care all that much about).

**Dislike:**

1.      There is dead space on the left and right of my screen – it is was not possible to make it truly full screen as I can do with FM21 (my iteration of choice).

2.      The graphics around the buttons, menus and drops downs just look a bit untidy and badly put together (I changed resolutions and other stuff to try and sort this out – no luck).

3.      There are so many borders, everywhere, around buttons, names, icons – everywhere! (Why?!)

4.      Some of the finer lines and text, particularly on the tactics screen, appeared fuzzy or blurred.

5.      It was very irritating not being able to click generally in an option ‘box’ – mostly you have to centre the mouse in a small circle.

6.      Why is the width of the screen not used to expand text boxes, to show their entire content? Why was it the only way to see all the text on some screens was to hover and have it pop-up in yet another box, tile, tablet or whatever?

7.      Generally speaking, the layout and presentation seems more ‘gamer’ than ‘football manager’. Now, I know what I mean by this but it is a bit vague, my apologies! I am not a gamer. Football Manager is the only game I have played for any length of time, ever.

8.      SO. MANY. CLICKS. TO. DO. ANYTHING.

9.      The click throughs and layout just don’t seem intuitive. I can see myself still being confused or lost with another 10 to 20 hours of game play.

10. The touchline shouts have gone. I miss them.

11. Managing the match itself felt less immersive than the FM21 experience. It really did feel a lot more like spectating than necessarily doing anything at times. The availability of player information to make tactical changes, for me at least, just wasn’t easy to find.

12. Press Conferences – I thought I’d give it a go. I have always delegated in FM21. But yeah, same old schtick. Same tired old options.

13. Another general one – but why are the options to choose from when interacting with players, the press and the like, on the right hand side of the screen? Personally I preferred them at the bottom of the screen and I would have preferred this to be on the left of the screen if change had to happen in this domain. (This is likely because I am left handed).

Am I disappointed? Yes. I am angry? No. It is annoying that the game has been released in such a poor state. It is not a great look for SI or Miles that there has been so much negative feedback on this. But I do hope SI/Miles have broad shoulders and an open mind. Unfortunately, what they don’t have is time. There is absolutely no way that everything that has been highlighted so far, less than 24 hours after the Beta release, can be fixed before the full launch date. So, what am I going to do? Well, I’m going to leave FM26 there on my desktop. I do have time and I do have choice. My choice is to load up FM21 with the Daveincid mod and to start a no badges, unemployed journeyman. I’ll keep persevering with FM26 periodically but this is a hobby for me. Something that is supposed to bring enjoyment and escapism. Hopefully, in time FM26 will sort itself out a bit. I expect that once mods are allowed those improvements will come, and if not, let’s see what FM27 looks like in due course.",1,1761322382.0,footballmanagergames,0,0.67,False

1of1xcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1of1xcd/feeling_hurt_after_my_boyfriendm22_went_to_places/,Feeling hurt after my boyfriend(M22) went to places I (F23) wanted to share with him,"I’ve been feeling a bit conflicted about something in my relationship, and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective on how to process it.
My boyfriend and I love trying new places to eat and having new experiences together. One of my favorite things to do with the people I care about is show them around my favorite spots or places I’ve been wanting to share with them.
I’m from a really cute small town, and since I started dating my boyfriend, I’ve told him I wanted to show him around and take him to this specific coffee shop that I love going to when I’m home. His hometown is about 20 minutes away from mine. I had been sending him Instagram posts about it and talking about how much I wanted to go together.
One weekend, we were both back home but spending time separately with our families. Mine tends to be stressful, so I hadn’t seen him much that weekend. When I happened to check his location, I saw he was in my hometown at that same coffee shop. I texted him, and he said his siblings wanted to grab coffee, saw the place on Instagram, and decided to go there.
I felt really sad and a little angry, because I had been so excited to take him there myself. I wanted it to be something we shared, where I could show him around and tell him stories from my hometown. I just wish he had told his siblings, “Hey, my girlfriend and I were planning to go there together, can we pick another one?” There are a ton of cute coffee shops in the area, so it felt unnecessary for them to choose that specific one. Since then, I haven’t taken him there because it feels like that special experience is already gone.
Fast forward to recently. I had been sending him TikToks and Instagram reels about this one restaurant I’ve wanted to try, and he even said, “We have to go together!” For context, he struggles with planning dates, and I’ve mentioned before that I feel like I’m usually the one who makes the plans. He’s always happy to go along, but sometimes I just wish he’d take the lead.
Then one day, I noticed he didn’t pack a lunch, which I assumed was because he was running late. Later that night, I asked what he had for lunch, and he said he went to that same restaurant with his coworkers. I instantly felt sad, because not even two weeks ago he had said we’d go there together. He explained that his coworkers invited him to lunch and only texted the restaurant name once he was already in his car.
I get that he didn’t plan it himself, but I can’t help feeling disappointed. I wish he had said something like, “Hey, my girlfriend and I were planning to go there soon, can we pick another spot?” or maybe grabbed food somewhere else and met them after. I’m trying to be be understanding because I don’t want to interfere with his work, but he’s friends with his coworkers and they are close to his age so idk.
It’s not really about the coffee shop or the restaurant. It’s more about how I’ve been feeling in the relationship overall. Lately, things have felt unbalanced, like I’m the one putting in more work to make plans or create meaningful experiences. It’s making me feel a bit burnt out and numb, which I really don’t want. I love him and want our relationship to work, but it hurts feeling like he puts more effort into spending quality time with other people than with me.
I’m trying to figure out how to bring this up again without sounding like I’m holding a grudge, and how to stop it from building resentment. I’d really appreciate some advice on how to handle this.",1,1761322294.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1of1w51,https://i.redd.it/n0yy42gp23xf1.png,Who the Hell was... Jack Kerouac?,"Jack Kerouac was the gasoline and the match for a generation that didn’t want to sit still. Born in 1922 in Lowell, Massachusetts, a French-Canadian kid from a mill town, he stumbled through football scholarships, the Navy, and the Merchant Marine before finding what would become his real vocation — chronicling the mad, ecstatic, sorrowful rhythm of post-war America.

By the mid-1940s he’d fallen in with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and the rest of what the media later called the *Beat Generation.* They weren’t trying to start a movement — they were trying to *breathe* in a country that had turned beige after the war. The world was buttoned-down, afraid of communism, chasing conformity. Kerouac turned his back on that and hit the road.

His writing caught fire for the same reason James Dean’s acting did: it felt **alive**, not posed. Dean mumbled truth through his teeth; Kerouac poured it out in rolling, improvisational sentences that felt like jazz solos. *On the Road* (1957) wasn’t a novel so much as an energy transfer — raw scroll typed on a single roll of paper in three feverish weeks. It captured the ache of motion, the sacred boredom of highways, and the spiritual hunger of young men who thought maybe, just maybe, freedom could still be found out there somewhere west of Denver.

Critics sneered at the loose grammar and “sloppy” form, but readers felt the pulse. He gave voice to the restless kid in every diner, the poet in every gas-station attendant. His “Belief and Technique for Modern Prose” wasn’t a rulebook — it was a manifesto for *aliveness.* Write what you feel, trust the flow, don’t tidy up the truth.

Kerouac’s America was one of back roads, cheap coffee, jazz clubs, and infinite longing. He died young, burned out by fame and alcohol in 1969, but the myth never cooled. He was the James Dean of literary travel because he didn’t *describe* rebellion — he *lived* it, one hitchhiked mile and one breathless paragraph at a time.

  
Jack Kerouac set down 30 essentials in something he called “Belief and Technique for Modern Prose.” These tips may or may not make sense to you, but that’s Kerouac, man: 



1.   Scribbled secret notebooks, and wild typewritten pages, for yr own joy

2.   Submissive to everything, open, listening

3.   Try never get drunk outside yr own house

4.   Be in love with yr life

5.   Something that you feel will find its own form

6.   Be crazy dumbsaint of the mind

7.   Blow as deep as you want to blow

8.   Write what you want bottomless from bottom of the mind

9.   The unspeakable visions of the individual

10.  No time for poetry but exactly what is

11.  Visionary tics shivering in the chest

12.  In tranced fixation dreaming upon object before you

13.  Remove literary, grammatical and syntactical inhibition

14.  Like Proust be an old teahead of time

15.  Telling the true story of the world in interior monolog

16.  The jewel center of interest is the eye within the eye

17.  Write in recollection and amazement for yourself

18.  Work from pithy middle eye out, swimming in language sea

19.  Accept loss forever

20.  Believe in the holy contour of life

21.  Struggle to sketch the flow that already exists intact in mind

22.  Don't think of words when you stop but to see picture better

23.  Keep track of every day the date emblazoned in yr morning

24.  No fear or shame in the dignity of yr experience, language & knowledge

25.  Write for the world to read and see yr exact pictures of it

26.  Bookmovie is the movie in words, the visual American form

27.  In praise of Character in the Bleak inhuman Loneliness

28.  Composing wild, undisciplined, pure, coming in from under, crazier the better

29.  You're a Genius all the time

30.  Writer-Director of Earthly movies Sponsored & Angeled in Heaven

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

Avoidant move or healthy boundary? Has anyone reconnected after this?,"I’m single mom in my 30’s. I just ended a whirlwind long-distance connection after a few weeks. We clicked hard—hours-long calls, easy laughter, I felt more “me” than I have in years. We met once and it felt safe and kind. The feelings were all very mutual. 

Then the overall pace and intensity ramped up. I wasn’t sleeping enough, my work slipped, and I felt my bandwidth for my kid shrinking. He actually checked in about pace a lot, and I kept saying yes even when my gut wasn’t sure. I hit a wall.

Instead of asking to slow things down, I froze. I asked for space and then ended it by text the next day. He responded hurt (fairly) and said it deserved a call. I texted a long apology later and we had a weird back and forth where he asked not to keep long breakup texting. I sent one final apology owning that I panicked, and then stopped. No contact since. That was earlier this week. 

Now I’m sitting with both relief and grief. I miss the safety and curiosity. But things were a little intense, he planned multiple trips to come see me and I had planned one to go see him, but that all started to overwhelm me. On the one hand I’m proud I listened to myself, but I’m not proud of the delivery and how I completely shut the door on our connection. 

This isn’t new for me. My pattern: big spark > lots of closeness > I override my limits > feel obligated/trapped > eject (often by text) > regret. I’ve even bailed on (ghosted) a therapist when it started to feel like an obligation. I want stable connections without nuking things when I’m overwhelmed.

What I’m asking:
	•	Does this read like avoidant coping, or a reasonable boundary on an intensity bubble? Maybe both?
	•	How do you actually practice the middle path (asking to slow pace) before panic hits?
	•	If you handled an ending clumsily, how did you forgive yourself and do it differently next time?

To add on:

I’m moving to his city early next year (this was the plan before I met him and why we were cool doing long distance). Has anyone successfully reconnected after ending things this way? If so, what timeline/approach worked? Is a simple, months-later “hey, I’m in town now, open to a quick coffee?” appropriate, or better to leave it alone and focus on pacing with someone new?

TL;DR: Fast LDR felt real and then overwhelming. I ended it by text instead of asking to slow down. Relief + regret, and I see a bigger avoidant pattern.

Every day revolves around him and this impulsive business venture. Everyday I am 100% involved and supporting physically mentally, going the accounting, etc. Trying to buffer us against bankruptcy.

But life is all about him and I still feel valueless and discarded.

We just talked about it last night. I am full of fear. So unsure, so lacking stability.

Now his family told me to fuckoff and is blaming me for his bipolar issues and rages. I deserve them. He's not standing up for me, or respecting me, reinforcing that it was never me vs him, and that I stood by unwavering as a dedicated wife while his abuse and hate and discard was out of control.

The lack of effort, after all this, I feel half dead. A shell. I have no support, affirmation, comfort.

I'm just a crybaby shell of myself. ",2,1761321813.0,BipolarSOs,2,1.0,False

How do I even??","Hi, Im 25F and my BF is 25M. We were both univ students when we met about 6 years ago, we both loveeee coffee, and have been in a relationship for a little bit over a year now. We have our differences, but we can still bond over a few stuff.

About 8 months ago, I caught my boyfriend chatting with his ex of idk like 4-5 yrs on Instagram because a notif suddenly popped up while I was watching on my spare phone that he once used. She sent him a meme that said something like, “me running to my fave ex after a light inconvenience,” and they were clearly talking. Eventually, I realized they had actually met up at some point when he went away for a bit, during a really rough patch in our relationship, right after we moved in together.

When I found out, I immediately called him — I was furious and honestly couldn’t control myself. I said a lot of things out of anger, and I was crying and cursing him out because I just felt so betrayed. I can’t remember exactly if it was before he answered or it was while we were on the call, he deleted all of his messages with her, which obv made it even worse because I never got to see the full conversation or know how far things went.

I also saw in their messages that they were setting up another day to meet, and at that point, I knew it wasn’t just some harmless conversation, something was definitely going on (which he eventually denied).

He told me that they only went to a cafe, and admitted that he thought about getting back together with her, but said he didn’t really mean to act on it or say it out loud. We’ve talked about it, and we’re still together now. To be fair, things have been mostly healthy. He’s shown effort and consistency, and I know he regrets what happened.

But here’s where I’m struggling: every time he interacts with other girls, even casually or online, I can’t help but feel this wave of anxiety and mistrust. I don’t snoop or accuse him, but it sits in my head and makes me tense. When I bring it up, he gets frustrated because he thinks it’s “petty” and I quickly flash the “u did this to me” card.

I honestly love him and I don’t want to keep holding onto this. But the hurt still lingers. Has anyone been through something similar and found a way to actually get over it? How do you rebuild real trust after catching something like that, especially when the relationship otherwise feels healthy?

TL;DR: Caught my boyfriend chatting with his ex about 8 months ago. They had already met once at a coffee shop and were planning another meet-up, but I caught them before it happened. He deleted their messages after I confronted him and later admitted he had thought about getting back with her, but didn’t act on it. We stayed together and things have been mostly healthy since, but I still struggle with trust and get anxious when he talks to other girls.

I called at 8am to confirm a time (I had asked for 9, that was not possible, 10 was a burden, so 10:30 was what she offered and started saying hurtful things over the phone)

I explained that I have plans in the afternoon and wanted to have time to visit and also accomplish some tasks today and expressed that it hurt my feelings that she was being hurtful and I didn't think it would be a good day to visit. I told her not to come. 

So at 10:45 she is at my door. I open it and express that I'm not prepared for a guest and was upset that she didn't respect my boundary. She comes in and starts saying toxic things immediately. Telling me that im not an adult and she is canceling my baby shower.

I saw red. I'm in my safe space and she is sitting on my couch telling me im nothing. I dumped her coffee down the sink and told her to leave. 

She put her fists up at me and started taunting me, and I went down to my basement so she couldn't get physical. She sat upstairs at my kitchen table saying im nothing and mocking me for calling my home my safe space. 

She started vaping and exposing me and my baby to second hand smoke. I saw red again. Told her if she didn't stop and get out of my house I was going to f*** her up. That she was making me go to a mental space that I didnt want to be, and that I was really hurt that she could torment me like this when I am in such a vulnerable state. 

She sat at the table and continued saying hurtful things and yelling so I ended up calling my husband at work to calm me down. Thankfully he picked up and I immediately felt protected because I knew she wouldn't keep abusing me with him witnessing. The whole thing was messy and so embarrassing. She got up and left when she realized she couldn't carry on anymore.

I'm very disappointed in myself for reacting that way in the first place. I feel like as soon as she barged in, my ptsd was very triggered and I went into mama bear mode. Major fight or flight reaction, and I felt cornered in my own home. I am off of my antidepressants and anxiety meds to avoid exposing the baby to those chemicals, and I've been really proud of the way I have handled challenging situations up to this point. Now I feel small, broken, and alone. Also very guilty for getting so upset when I am pregnant. She has physically and mentally abused me my entire life and I regret letting her get into the door so much.

1of1lor,https://x.com/cokuto_uma_02/status/1977796676925657589,Date review: Fenomeno,"As Dalai Lama once said:  

“The wheel, electricity, slot machines, the umamusume series and all of humanities greatest ideas were conceived while listening to Powewolf.” 

And this was no different.

Inspired by u/collidah’s sex reviews and all other works which he fathered in some way, a thought came to my mind “Hey! Wouldn’t it be funny if someone wrote date reviews with the umas?” and with this I started hoping that someone would hear my idea through telepathy, however, earlier today I was enlightened again and realized that there is no one better to do this job than myself. And so, I put my writing skills to the test. 

Writing this was truly one of the experiences of all time, every few sentences made me cringe harder and harder, I took that as a hint that I was on the right track. I really hope you guys like this as much as I liked making it, as it was for sure the most different piece of media I ever wrote while listening to power metal. Taking the parasocial relationship pill was not on my 2025 bingo and I felt like a 13yo hopeless romantic girl who writes fanfics about her favorite characters and her in a relationship.

To do this, I picked the perfect uma for a date, none other than Fenomeno herself, for *~~she is my favorite uma~~* no reason in particular. This is the moment you, dear reader, asks me: “But how did you managed to do it? I never thought Fenomeno would be willing to go out with someone like you” and to that I take no offense, but remember it very well, my rizz is unimaginable\*.

(See second image for reference\*)

What can I say? Took some more convincing but you get the gist of it, sooner or later they all end up falling for my charms. We ended up agreeing to meet in front of an ice cream parlor at 2:00pm 

 

**The Date:** And there I was, punctual as clockwork on the agreed location, it was a chilly but sunny afternoon, the streets were full of people, although not as much as in rush hour. However, something was missing, or rather, someone. “It’s okay, she must be on her way” I thought to myself, and I waited, what else could I do? 10 minutes, 20, half an hour. When I finally accepted my fate and realized she stood me up, heartbroken, started making my way to leave, when I suddenly heard someone shouting behind me. 

— Wait! — she said, I rapidly turned and to my surprise there she was, wearing her casual, yet very elegant, attire with some brown leaves on her head, which surprised me at first since I wasn’t expecting her to wear that for a stroll through the city, much less such strange headgear . But am I really in position to judge her wardrobe options? She looked stunning either way. 

She explained to me the reason for her lateness, as according to her, she was supposed to be in the meeting place at the agreed time, but while making her way there she ended up having to: 

* Help an old lady cross the street 
* Give directions to a very confused man 
* Stop a group of mischievous kids 
* Help a cat who was stuck on a tree 
* Catch a burglar who snatched a purse 
* Help some lady who dropped her unusually large coin purse (which opened, covering the ground with hundreds of dollars worth of pennies) 

Upon hearing the list of deeds, I couldn’t help but to laugh, not at her but at myself, she was out there helping people and ignorant me was about to ditch her because she was late. Oh sour irony, if she arrived half a minute later, I would be nowhere to be seen, and in the end, the roles would be reversed and instead of laughing I would be crying in my bedroom for fumbling this. What does this situation teach us? That my dumbass should have messaged her from the beginning. 

After laughing a bit and explaining that I wasn’t laughing at her, I helped her take off the leaves from her hair and then we started our little trip around town. While walking alongside her I realized how many problems everyone has, not talking about hidden problems or invisible wars on their heads (while this is also true), I’m not really sure if it’s my obliviousness but I never took note of the number of adversities people face when on the street, and somehow, nothing ever escaped her sight. 

I dare to say that the most beautiful part of Fenomeno is her precisely calibrated moral compass, a desire of helping others, not out of the need of personal gratification, but from a sense of duty. If you compliment on her behavior, she wil say something along the lines of “I was only doing what was right”, it got to the point she was profusely apologizing for leaving my side to run across the street and help someone so many times. But I never thought it was rude of her, not even for a moment, and reassured her that it was okay. 

I don’t see myself as the type of person who goes out of their way to help a stranger, while I do try to be kind and help anyone who asks for my assistance, but Fenomeno takes it to another level, after pondering for some time I was sure, her selflessness was truly her most beautiful trait, which is an insane feat considering she is basically perfect. I made sure to bring this up with her, but she didn’t seem to like the comment, as she quickly broke eye contact and looked another way while stuttering a thanks, well can’t get it right every time, can we? 

It didn’t take long for me to start helping people with her too, and although I'm fairly taller than her, she is still ten times more fit, cause’ she is an uma and all. Still, these kinds of activities don’t demand much physical prowess, although doing this many of them does takes a toll on your energy reserves, however the satisfaction of helping someone in need will replenish your energies and make you happy, I wonder if she feels the same. 

Throughout all our walk I was trying to make her laugh by cracking some jokes, and I admit I’m not the funniest individual ever, but I really wanted to make her laugh to make her break her serious countenance. The jokes were mostly funny comments on the situations we got ourselves involved with, like saying ""That was a FENOMENOL PERFORMANCE"" after she succesfully helped a group of kids cross the road, but nothing I said made her express a reaction, she would sometimes look the other way and hold what I assumed was some kind of cough,  what a way to blow this date huh? 

After walking some more time, we stopped at a cafe to eat something and drink some coffee, there we chatted up a bit more, apparently her sisters are quite the troublemakers and getting on her nerves is something they do well, I reassured her that she wasn’t alone on this, as I too suffer from this same ailment. Siblings are tough, but at least we have more in common than I thought. 

Leaving the cafe led us to the main activity of the day: walking aimlessly through the city streets (again) while helping whoever we found on our way (again²). During this time, I was certain that she was a magnet for this kind of situation, I am sure I'm not the sharpest knife on the shed when it comes to spatial awareness, but this was getting out of hand. And while I was there getting exhausted over helping others, she looked perfectly full of energy, was it her conditioning? Her nature? I honestly don’t know, but she seemingly wasn’t getting tired. She cleaned her forehead on her sleeve and let out a relieved sigh. 

— Never helped this many people in a day, are you holding up alright? You seem tired. 

— Kind of, but don’t worry bout’ me, I can still walk just fi — 

I was interrupted by a conveniently placed stone that jumped on my way and made me trip, Fenomeno quickly came to my assistance, I am sure you all already realized this, but she is actually a sweet person, her serious gaze is nothing but her way of being herself and there is nothing wrong with that, it is like a bitter taste that ends up highlighting the sweetness that comes right after it. Even though it wasn’t anything serious, she still helped me getting up and said that I shouldn’t make much effort right after hurting myself and volunteered herself to carry me on a piggyback ride, I said that it wasn’t really needed, but she insisted, and i wasn’t completely opposed to the idea. 

Anyway, it was almost nighttime so our time together was coming to an end under the dark sky, I apologized to her for making her go through so much trouble today, since I probably messed up her training schedule and ate up all her free time, and now she was carrying me back to the academy. She replied saying that I shouldn’t be sorry since she enjoyed doing her everyday activities with company, and she thought I was quite funny — this surprised me and made me happy — although she expected me to be more...intense...based on my first impression. I then explained that the first impression is what counts, that was an all or nothing situation in which I had to give my all in order to accomplish my goal, and she suggested me to never do it again. 

The ride back was calmer than the rest of the day with much more insightful conversation, I believe that these kinds of moments are the best to build up intimacy, all while still being able to discover more about the other party’s worldviews, opinions, likes and dislikes in a more deep level than of normal small talk, the green scenery from the academy’s surroundings was a beautiful landscape for this kind of conversation. The leaves flowing through the wind and dancing in the air, making the starry sky the most beautiful stage for their presentation, perfumed with the most fragrant smell of cherry and almonds, although in retrospect, that was probably her shampoo. 

She gently dropped me off in front of her dorm and thanked me for the day, I reciprocated the feeling while holding her right hand with both my hands, and assured her that the next time we go out, I would take her somewhere where she wouldn’t need to worry so much about others and could concentrate more on having fun, all while smiling (it is very important to smile). Again, she didn’t seem to like the idea, as she quickly faced other way and kinda mumbled that she would be waiting. I then bid my farewell and took my leave, she did the same, entering her dorm. 

Even when walking back to my home I couldn't stop thinking about her and her way of caring for others, her beautiful dark purple hair, her intense gaze watchful for everything, her deep voice that resonated within my soul. I think I am in love, Am I in love? Should I be in love? Am I going a little too fast maybe?...Nah I’m sure it is totally fine to make this kind of statement 



**Verdict:** Fenomeno is the best out there, she might seem scary at first but I assure to you that she is actually pretty sweet, always taking care of those around her, while it is true that she can be a little more...aggressive...when she deems something a bad deed, it is not hard to stay away of her more strict side, as I believe most are law abiding citizens. She was unfortunate to be the black sheep of her family, but this doesn’t mean anything, hearing she speak about her sisters makes me sure she holds them in high regard, despite them being a little *too much* sometimes. Even if the date was kinda exhausting, I still had my share of fun, she is a great conversation partner and all of her answers seem to be on the tip of her tongue, she does speak in a peculiar way most of the time, almost like she is always reporting to a superior office, or participating in a training drill, but my grandmama always said that a little bit of uniqueness was the way God found to season our personalities, *~~and I don’t know what kind of seasoning he used on Fenomeno but he was definitely cooking something delicious~~*. ",5,1761321561.0,okbuddyumamusume,1,1.0,False

1of1kes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1of1kes/i_desperately_need_a_reality_check_about_my/,I desperately need a reality check about my marriage,"I grew up in a very bad home.  It was so bad that I was removed from it in my teens. Long story short, I don’t have many positive examples of what love should look like in my life.

I’ve done a lot of work on myself. I’ve been in therapy for years, and I’ve come a long way. When I met my husband in my mid-thirties, I thought I was ready. In hindsight, I think I was close — maybe I was, but I don't think he was (thought he pretended to be.)

I admittedly rushed into marriage with my husband after just a few months. We were both smitten. Neither of us had kids, but we wanted one, and I was eager to start our life together. Shortly after we got married, I became pregnant but suffered a very traumatic miscarriage with a hemorrhage. Then I was diagnosed with more health issues and decided that giving birth wasn’t in the cards, especially as I neared forty.

Now, I’m thirty-nine and have been married for four years. This is my second marriage.

I don’t know if I’m in love with my husband anymore.

Over the past four years, he’s always been loyal. He doesn’t have addiction issues like other men I’ve dated. He’s generally agreeable and, for the most part, helps around the house — though he slips up with chores from time to time.  Any time he's able, he's there for me to go to doctor's appointments or just to spend some time.  He'll make it work, and that means a lot to me.

However, there have been a few breaches of trust. 

His career has gone nowhere since we met, while I’ve built my own businesses, have a job I’m proud of, and am active in my community. He works the complete opposite schedule from me, so we only see each other one afternoon and one day a week. I work from home, so I see him before he leaves for work — but it disrupts my schedule and my sleep. 

At almost forty, that sleep disruption really affects me. I’ve asked him to consider career changes or other steps to better align with our life together, but he likes his job. I fear I’m going to be alone most of the time for the foreseeable future.

Recently, he lied to me about something that’s still impacting us. He maxed out a $3,000 credit card behind my back because he refuses to pack a lunch. He’d go out for coffee, lunch, and charge random things to the card. I upgraded our living situation without realizing that the card was being racked up. When I found out, I flipped. 

I felt betrayed, especially as the breadwinner and the one managing the finances. I felt like I was his sugar mama. I do my own nails and hair at home to save money, and here he was just treating himself behind my back.

We came up with a payment plan. He said he’d DoorDash or get a second job to pay it down, but he never did. We even stopped contributing to his 401(k) to cover the debt. Then, a few months later, I found out he’d maxed it out again.

I just don’t look at him the same anymore. 

I feel like I’m parenting him. He’s carelessly created debt, doesn’t take accountability, and lied to me twice. He has no goals, no hobbies, and no real drive. He genuinely enjoys spending time with me — but it feels more like I have a kid I enjoy hanging out with and guiding than an equal partner. It’s only been four years, but I’m exhausted, checked out, and craving romance and mental stimulation with an equal.

Every time I hit my breaking point, he’ll go through the motions of pretending to change.  He'll talk about getting a certification, looking at new jobs — but it always fizzles out.

I struggle because my husband is handsome, things are good in bed (when they happen), he’s smart, and we’re great travel partners. We cohabitate decently (more or less). But I’m at a pivotal point in life where I need to be strategic, save for retirement, and build my future.  I'm ready to thrive and take life by the throat.

But I feel like he’s keeping me on a hamster wheel of mediocrity that’s driving me insane.  I spend hours trying to suss out what he wants out of life, how we can work similar schedules, what would make him happy, and trying to keep things romantic and start conversations that go nowhere.

It makes me want to leave.  But then I start to think maybe I should just accept him for who he is — that no one’s perfect — but I get overwhelmed at the thought of being single in my forties.

Can y’all give me a reality check? Is this bad? Is this fixable?

Here’s my biggest thing:

I’ve lived a very hard life, and I’m finally in a place where I’m personally happy. I really want my forties to be special, happy, and abundant. 

I don’t want to drag this out and be going through a divorce in my mid-forties. I want this next decade to be the best one yet. But I’m tired. At this age, after several long-term relationships, I really thought I was healed enough to choose well — and maybe I was — but I didn’t give it enough time to see if this man could treat me well consistently.

Now he’s saying he was “masking” because of autism, and he doesn’t know who he is. All of this has completely shocked me. I just can’t spend another decade waiting around on a man, no matter how much I love him and deeply empathize.

I love love. I have no kids. I want to experience a love that’s real and true. I don’t want to be alone (who does?), but I’d rather be alone than feel like I’m settling and getting sidetracked all the time.  I even thought I might foster, but things are so all over the place with him that it serves as a constant distraction.

We've talked about separating, but I don't know how that will do much of anything except keep the door open in case we want to circle back in a few months.  I know the marriage would never be the same once that step is taken.",1,1761321481.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False
1of1k6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/RootLevelHealing/comments/1of1k6v/mold_and_biotoxin_illness_the_hidden_root_cause/,Mold and Biotoxin Illness: The Hidden Root Cause Making Millions Sick,"Mold and Biotoxin Illness: The Hidden Root Cause Making Millions Sick

Mold and biotoxin illness is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood root causes of chronic illness. Millions of people are suffering from symptoms caused by exposure to water-damaged buildings and the biotoxins they harbor, yet most healthcare providers aren't trained to recognize or treat this condition. Understanding mold illness is crucial because it can mimic dozens of other conditions and often prevents recovery from other health issues.

**Understanding Biotoxin Illness:**

**What Are Biotoxins?**
Biotoxins are poisonous substances produced by living organisms, including mold, bacteria, algae, and other microorganisms. In water-damaged buildings, these toxins create a complex mixture of inflammatory compounds that can severely impact human health.

**The Perfect Storm:**
Water damage + organic materials + time = biotoxin production. Modern buildings with synthetic materials, poor ventilation, and energy-efficient sealing create ideal conditions for biotoxin-producing organisms to thrive.

**Why It's Often Missed:**
• Symptoms are vague and systemic
• Conventional medicine doesn't recognize biotoxin illness
• Testing is specialized and not widely available
• Symptoms can persist long after exposure ends
• Often dismissed as psychosomatic

**The Science Behind Biotoxin Illness:**

**Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS):**
Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker identified CIRS as the body's response to biotoxins in genetically susceptible individuals. About 25% of the population has genetic variants that make them unable to properly eliminate biotoxins.

**HLA-DR Genetic Testing:**
Certain HLA-DR gene patterns make people more susceptible to biotoxin illness:
• **Mold susceptible** - 25% of population
• **Multi-susceptible** - susceptible to multiple biotoxins
• **Low susceptibility** - can tolerate higher exposures

**The Biotoxin Pathway:**
1. **Exposure** - inhaling biotoxins from water-damaged buildings
2. **Immune activation** - innate immune system responds
3. **Inflammation** - chronic inflammatory cascade begins
4. **Hormone disruption** - affects multiple hormone systems
5. **Neurological symptoms** - brain inflammation and dysfunction
6. **Multi-system illness** - affects virtually every body system

**Common Sources of Biotoxin Exposure:**

**Water-Damaged Buildings:**
• **Homes** - leaks, floods, poor ventilation, high humidity
• **Workplaces** - office buildings, schools, hospitals
• **Schools** - often have significant water damage and poor air quality
• **Cars** - water damage from floods or leaks

**Types of Water Damage:**
• **Visible mold growth** - obvious black, green, or white growth
• **Hidden mold** - behind walls, under flooring, in HVAC systems
• **Microbial growth** - bacteria, actinomycetes, mycobacteria
• **Chemical off-gassing** - from water-damaged materials

**High-Risk Environments:**
• Buildings with history of water damage
• Humid climates with poor ventilation
• Basements and crawl spaces
• Buildings with flat roofs or poor drainage
• Older buildings with outdated HVAC systems

**Symptoms of Biotoxin Illness:**

**Neurological Symptoms:**
• Brain fog and cognitive dysfunction
• Memory problems and word-finding difficulty
• Difficulty concentrating and processing information
• Mood changes - depression, anxiety, irritability
• Sleep disturbances and insomnia
• Headaches and migraines
• Dizziness and balance problems

**Physical Symptoms:**
• Chronic fatigue and weakness
• Joint pain and muscle aches
• Respiratory symptoms - cough, shortness of breath
• Sinus congestion and chronic sinusitis
• Skin problems - rashes, sensitivity, crawling sensations
• Temperature regulation problems
• Digestive issues - nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain

**Hormonal and Metabolic:**
• Thyroid dysfunction
• Adrenal fatigue
• Sex hormone imbalances
• Blood sugar dysregulation
• Weight gain or loss
• Electrolyte imbalances

**Immune System Effects:**
• Frequent infections
• Autoimmune-like symptoms
• Chemical sensitivities
• Food sensitivities and allergies
• Poor wound healing
• Chronic inflammation

**The Biotoxin Illness Cluster:**

**Why Symptoms Cluster:**
Biotoxins affect multiple systems simultaneously, creating a constellation of symptoms that seem unrelated but actually stem from the same root cause.

**Common Misdiagnoses:**
• Chronic fatigue syndrome
• Fibromyalgia
• Multiple chemical sensitivity
• Autoimmune diseases
• Depression and anxiety disorders
• Irritable bowel syndrome
• Chronic Lyme disease

**Testing for Biotoxin Illness:**

**Shoemaker Protocol Testing:**
Dr. Shoemaker developed a comprehensive testing protocol to diagnose CIRS:

**1. HLA-DR Genetic Testing:**
• Determines genetic susceptibility
• Guides treatment approach
• Helps predict recovery timeline

**2. Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS):**
• Simple online test measuring neurological function
• Affected in 90%+ of biotoxin illness patients
• Can track improvement during treatment

**3. Laboratory Markers:**
• **C4a** - complement activation marker
• **TGF-β1** - transforming growth factor beta-1
• **MMP-9** - matrix metalloproteinase-9
• **VEGF** - vascular endothelial growth factor
• **MSH** - melanocyte stimulating hormone
• **ADH/Osmolality** - antidiuretic hormone function

**Environmental Testing:**
• **ERMI testing** - Environmental Relative Moldiness Index
• **HERTSMI-2** - simplified mold assessment
• **Mycotoxin testing** - urine testing for mold toxins
• **Air sampling** - spore counts and species identification

**Functional Testing:**
• **Organic acid testing** - shows metabolic dysfunction
• **Mycotoxin panels** - Great Plains, RealTime Labs
• **Inflammatory markers** - cytokines, oxidative stress
• **Immune function** - natural killer cell activity

**The Shoemaker Protocol:**

**Phase 1: Remove from Exposure**
• Identify and remediate water-damaged environment
• Cannot recover while still being exposed
• May require temporary or permanent relocation

**Phase 2: Eliminate Biotoxins**
• **Cholestyramine** - prescription bile acid sequestrant
• **Welchol** - alternative bile acid sequestrant
• **Activated charcoal** - natural binder
• **Bentonite clay** - another natural option

**Phase 3: Eradicate MARCoNS**
• **MARCoNS** - Multiple Antibiotic Resistant Coagulase Negative Staph
• Nasal colonization common in biotoxin illness
• **BEG spray** - Bactroban, EDTA, Gentamicin
• **Natural alternatives** - silver, iodine solutions

**Phase 4: Correct Hormone Deficiencies**
• **MSH replacement** - if deficient
• **ADH support** - for water regulation issues
• **VEGF support** - for circulation problems
• **Androgens** - if depleted

**Phase 5: Reduce Inflammation**
• **VIP** - Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide
• **Low-dose naltrexone** - immune modulation
• **Anti-inflammatory supplements**
• **Omega-3 fatty acids**

**Alternative and Supportive Approaches:**

**Natural Binders:**
• **Chlorella** - binds mycotoxins
• **Modified citrus pectin** - heavy metal and toxin binder
• **Zeolite** - volcanic mineral binder
• **Activated charcoal** - broad-spectrum binder

**Immune Support:**
• **Glutathione** - master antioxidant
• **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** - glutathione precursor
• **Vitamin C** - immune and detox support
• **Vitamin D** - immune modulation

**Liver and Detox Support:**
• **Milk thistle** - liver protection
• **Alpha-lipoic acid** - antioxidant and chelator
• **B-vitamins** - methylation support
• **Magnesium** - detox pathway support

**Gut Health:**
• **Probiotics** - restore beneficial bacteria
• **Digestive enzymes** - improve digestion
• **L-glutamine** - heal intestinal lining
• **Anti-inflammatory herbs** - turmeric, boswellia

**Remediation and Environmental Control:**

**Professional Remediation:**
• **Hire certified professionals** - IICRC certified
• **Proper containment** - prevent spread during cleanup
• **HEPA filtration** - during and after remediation
• **Post-remediation testing** - verify successful cleanup

**DIY Prevention:**
• **Control humidity** - keep below 50%
• **Improve ventilation** - exhaust fans, air circulation
• **Fix leaks promptly** - within 24-48 hours
• **Use dehumidifiers** - in basements and humid areas

**Air Quality Improvement:**
• **HEPA air purifiers** - remove mold spores
• **Activated carbon filters** - remove chemical odors
• **UV lights** - in HVAC systems
• **Regular filter changes** - every 1-3 months

**Living with Biotoxin Illness:**

**Lifestyle Modifications:**
• **Avoid re-exposure** - stay away from water-damaged buildings
• **Support detoxification** - sauna, exercise, hydration
• **Manage stress** - biotoxin illness is stressful on the body
• **Prioritize sleep** - essential for recovery

**Dietary Considerations:**
• **Anti-inflammatory diet** - reduce systemic inflammation
• **Avoid mycotoxin-containing foods** - coffee, grains, nuts
• **Support liver function** - cruciferous vegetables
• **Stay hydrated** - support kidney elimination

**The Recovery Timeline:**

**Phase 1 (0-6 months):**
• Removing from exposure
• Beginning binder therapy
• May feel worse initially (herx reactions)
• Gradual stabilization

**Phase 2 (6-18 months):**
• Continued detoxification
• Addressing secondary infections
• Hormone optimization
• Steady improvement

**Phase 3 (18+ months):**
• Significant symptom improvement
• Increased tolerance to environments
• Return to normal activities
• Maintenance protocols

**Challenges in Recovery:**

**Re-exposure:**
• Can quickly undo months of progress
• Must be vigilant about environment
• May need to avoid certain buildings permanently

**Cross-Contamination:**
• Belongings from moldy environments can carry toxins
• May need to replace clothing, furniture, books
• HEPA vacuum and ozone treatment can help

**Multiple Chemical Sensitivity:**
• Often develops during biotoxin illness
• Makes recovery more challenging
• Requires careful environmental control

**Success Stories:**

**Case 1: Teacher's Recovery**
A teacher with severe brain fog and fatigue recovered after discovering her classroom had extensive water damage. Remediation and the Shoemaker protocol restored her health.

**Case 2: Family's Transformation**
An entire family suffering from various health issues improved dramatically after moving from a water-damaged home and following biotoxin treatment protocols.

**Case 3: Executive's Return**
A business executive unable to work due to cognitive symptoms returned to full function after identifying office building exposure and completing treatment.

**Prevention Strategies:**

**Home Inspection:**
• Regular inspection for water damage
• Monitor humidity levels
• Address leaks immediately
• Ensure proper ventilation

**Workplace Awareness:**
• Report water damage to management
• Request air quality testing if symptoms develop
• Know your rights regarding healthy work environments
• Consider air purifiers for your workspace

**Travel Precautions:**
• Research accommodations for water damage history
• Bring portable air purifier
• Trust your senses - musty odors are warning signs
• Have backup plans if exposure occurs

**Questions for the Community:**
• Have you experienced symptoms in certain buildings?
• Have you discovered water damage in your home or workplace?
• What testing or treatments have been helpful?
• How has biotoxin illness affected your life?

**Resources for Further Learning:**
• International Society for Environmentally Acquired Illness (ISEAI)
• Surviving Mold website (Dr. Shoemaker)
• Building Biology Institute
• Environmental Health Center-Dallas

**The Hope Factor:**

While biotoxin illness can be devastating, recovery is absolutely possible with proper identification, environmental control, and treatment. Many people who were severely ill have returned to full health and vitality.

**The Bottom Line:**

Mold and biotoxin illness is a real, diagnosable, and treatable condition. If you have unexplained chronic symptoms, especially if they worsen in certain buildings, biotoxin exposure should be investigated as a potential root cause.

Remember: You can't get well in a sick building. Environmental control is the foundation of recovery from biotoxin illness.

What experiences have you had with water-damaged buildings? Have you considered biotoxin exposure as a potential root cause of your symptoms? Share your story to help others recognize this often-overlooked condition.

Remember: This information is educational and not medical advice. Always work with qualified practitioners experienced in biotoxin illness for proper testing and treatment.

Also a throwaway because I'm very confused rn. 

I (F32) matched with, let's call him, John (M32) on a dating app 4 months ago. 

I'll be honest, I wasn't super interested in John at first but we exchanged numbers and chatted here and there. 

He started to get jealous if I didn't respond in time and he did say if I'm not interested to just tell him as its disrespectful. At this point my life was very full and busy but my profile made it clear I wanted long term and as he seemed keen, we continued to get to know eachother. 

The dynamic snowballed rapidly from there and we began having phone calls, sending intimate messages and pictures and speaking every day. To say we clicked was an absolute understatement. I knew when we met in person it would be just as good, i could feel ut in my bones. This man felt made for me. 

There were 5 or 6 times before we met in person that John tried to call it off. He said he had kissed another girl, he said he was busy and the final excuse was that he was moving abroad to work for the year. Every time we found our way back to each other. 

With the news of John going away for the year, we had a few tears and his voice notes sounded so sincere. He didn't want me to wait for him so we stopped talking for a few days. 

I got another voicenote where John likened the connection to drug withdrawal and said he couldn't even tell his friends how he felt about me because it didn't make sense if we hadn't met. 

So, We decided to meet and he came to mine. We went for a coffee, messed around for a bit at the park and he came back to mine. We kissed and a few other things but he didn't think it would be fair to sleep with me due to his impending move across the world. 

We decided we would continue to talk and if distance meant we would drift, then so be it. He sent me presents in the post for my birthday before he was due to fly and I felt really lucky! Finally, someone who felt the same about me as I did him. 

Things got further complicated due to his jealous nature whilst he was abroad due to my friends being guys and my boss also being a male. I reassured John how I felt about him but the lows were more often than the highs by this point. 

Queue me seeing a picture of him online in his new country with a woman. I gave him the chance to explain and he lied about her being a Co worker. The following day John messaged me and apologised and told me he had feelings for someone else. 

I felt blindsided. He had always told me he wasn't speaking with anyone else yet here he was telling me there was someone else. 

He called me, and it turns out they have been together for around a decade. He said their lives are intertwined with owning a house together, having shared friends and he said his family would be very unhappy if he ever broke up with her. Andddd, he isn't working away for the year, that was just a lie and it was only for a few weeks. 

So, I'm the other woman. And from the bottom of my heart, I didn't know. 

I have ended up being collateral in whatever sick game he was playing to make himself feel good about himself and I don't know how I move past this. 

My fiancée had cheated on me the year prior to meeting John and I had opened up to him about this which is why I think it hurts more. 

He's blocked but I'm the other woman. I'm the other woman. 

How do I stop feeling so guilty when I didn't know? Can someone be with someone for a decade, be in love with them but still cheat? Do those things co exist? 

I don't know what I'm looking for, perhaps some different perspectives, perhaps someone to tell me I'm not as awful as I feel. Perhaps to restore my faith in relationships as I move forward.

Prior to taking on such an intense spell i will share some insight on our relationship how it ended and how i can get it back.
My ex broke up with me during eclipse season in september, I was blindsided completely and did not see it coming. There was no reason besides he “wasn’t ready anf i deserved better.” On the last day of the eclipse season, there was a lunar eclipse, i did a obsession:love spell next to a river under the moon. the next night I successfully got him back… for a night. He then called to break up with me again… 

I gave it time to process before settling on something else, Making a poppet of him.
The object i used (and don’t judge me..) was a labubu he GIFTED me. So i emptied it, played “love and relationship” subliminals, and sewed a picture of his face on it with red thread. As the taglocks, I used a small voice box of him saying “I’ll always be there for you X, I miss you”, I used a clump of his hair, I necklace he gifted me with the engraving of the date we first hung out, and a picture he drew for me. I sewed a heart onto the body of the doll. 
I placed Bloodstone, Garnet, Rose quartz and Rhodonite, all anointed with love oil. 
I lit a White pheromone candle we used together, surrounded by salt and a in depth birthday card he wrote me, his pictures and Tarot cards surrounding it the fit my intentions (the sun, 2 of pentacles and cups, the lovers, the magician and the empress)

I then started working on a honey jar spell to place into the poppet, Its contents had whole cloves, Orange peels, dried rose petals from roses he gave me, lavender, pink salt, rosemary, dainma, jasmine flower, pheromone candle wax, honey, instant coffee, rose oil, love anointing oil, in a cupid vial.
Then i did a love spell with our names/DOB carved on a pink and red candle, tied together with red thread placed on top of the honey jar. 
While the spell was burning, I wrote my intentions/petition on the back of pictures of us together (ripped the sides and folded it three times and put it in the poppet.)
I then sealed up the poppet, Naming him with my EX’s name. 
Now I don’t know what more i can do with the poppet so im asking for suggestions, i placed my underwear on the poppet so he would think of me. Im planning on getting colored needles to place on his heart.. but what more could I do?",0,1761321130.0,Wicca,7,0.43,False

For instance, I once built a product called DAE Bridge for a client, but along the way, I also ended up building her entire company’s tech structure with a few guys I work with. At that point, it’s hard to be strict on someone like that, she always has new projects, new requests, and before you know it, the invoices start piling up. Some get paid, some don’t, and when she finally asks for her outstanding balance, my team and I are left scratching our heads trying to figure out the numbers accurately.

That frustration led me to create Freelance Trackr (yes, that’s the correct spelling). It helps me track clients, payments, invoices, and even sends automatic reminders, with around 10 tools designed to make freelancing a lot easier. I launched it just yesterday, and surprisingly, the SEO score hit 100%! You can even test it yourself if you’re curious.

Now I’m just figuring out the best way to get people to try it out and maybe support the project so I can keep improving it. For support, I’ve added a Buy Me a Coffee link for easy subscriptions which after subscribing Buy Me a Coffee let’s my system knows who just subscribed then I upgrade their access to more features, pretty interesting journey here🤞

My friend and I (both f/20s) live in different cities, but as both of us have ties to both cities, we see each other fairly regurlarly. We had planned to meet for coffee next week. 

Yesterday, my friend texted me that she’d had a mental breakdown and might have to cancel our coffee date as she’s with her family in a different city & doesn’t know when she’ll be back because she doesn’t want to be alone right now. 

She has always been a people pleaser and it seemed like she felt guilty for possibly having to cancel our coffee date. She told me she would text me next week to tell me if she’s available for the coffee date. I told her not to worry about that and assured her I’d always be there for her whenever she needs me or wants to talk. 

I’m worried for her because I know she isn’t good at putting herself and her mental health first. I would like to reach out and check on her from time to time, but I am afraid she would interpret a simple “how are you? Are you feeling better?” as “what about the coffee date?” 

I don’t want to put pressure on her or cross her boundaries, I just want to show support. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have many close friends, so the thought that a friend cares about her wellbeing and wants to support her without expecting anything in return is new to her.

24M – Severe GERD responsive to PPI but intolerant to it (bloating, gas, constipation) – looking for advice or similar experiences

Hey everyone,

I’m a 24-year-old male, generally healthy, non-smoker, no alcohol, active and eating a balanced diet. I’ve been struggling with chronic GERD for several years.

🔹 Diagnosis & Tests

Chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia, H. pylori negative (biopsy, June 2025).

CT abdomen with contrast – normal.

Blood work – normal.

Celiac – negative.

SIBO – diagnosed in the past, treated with Rifaximin + another antibiotic successfully for a few months, but symptoms came back later.

🔹 My Main Problem

PPIs (mainly Nexium 20 mg) completely eliminate my reflux and heartburn — but they destroy my digestion.

Whenever I take Nexium, I develop:

Severe bloating and upper-abdominal pressure

Constant burping (dozens of times a day)

Chronic constipation

Abdominal cramps

Return of SIBO-like symptoms (same as before Rifaximin)

These symptoms disappear completely when I stop PPIs —

but then the reflux comes back worse than ever (strong, daily, persistent).

I’ve tried:

Gradual tapering / alternate-day dosing

Switching to Controloc (Pantoprazole) — same issue

H₂ blockers (Famotidine) — not effective enough

Diet changes: reduced coffee, acidic foods, spicy/fatty meals, smaller portions, no lying down after meals → no real improvement

🔹 Current Situation

So basically:

Without PPI → unbearable reflux.

With PPI → unbearable bloating, gas, and constipation.

My gastroenterologist advised another follow-up in 6 months, but at this point my quality of life is poor.



🔹 My Questions

What are the best evidence-based options for PPI-intolerant GERD patients?

Would Rabeprazole or another “lighter” PPI make a difference?

Is it realistic to consider procedural options like STRETTA, TIF, or LINX at my age (24)?

Could long-term PPI use be perpetuating or re-triggering SIBO, and is there a way to manage both together?

I am now having gastroscopy every half a year for follow up (colnoscopy was ok).  
just to be clear, I am suffering from this issue for the last 4 years and have tried multiple medical protocols with PPIs and without PPIs. currently considering surgery. 

This is NOT a rebound effect of PPI, I have been off PPI for almost half a year, it only made my acid reflux worse. I also did gradual protocol of getting off ppi it did not help:(

1of18o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AdFast7524/comments/1of18o1/the_ai_corridors_play_stop_forcing_ai_into_old/,The “AI Corridors” play: stop forcing AI into old frameworks — what G20/B20 + WEF briefings in SA made clear (verifier streams → programmable finance → auditor access),"**TL;DR**

\- **After a week of G20/B20 engagements and WEF briefings in SA, the same quiet truth kept resurfacing:** AI isn’t a feature you bolt onto PDFs; it’s a systems shift (power + copper + storage + data governance).

**- “Export-grade” projects are built against EU/US standards from day one:** live telemetry, auditable ESG, corridor SLAs, and programmable finance.

\- South Africa can anchor three arcs (Northern/Eastern/Western) if we wire minerals → midstream → power/storage → telemetry → policy-as-code → finance.



**A quick story from the floor**

**Outside a packed session, an EU buyer told me over coffee: “We don’t need more decks—we need to see the throughput, the emissions, the substation queue, today.” That’s when it clicked:** our industry still treats AI like a plug-in. It isn’t. It’s closer to electrification. If we keep forcing new tech into old workflows, we’ll keep missing the productivity curve.



**WEF lens (what we heard)**

In WEF-aligned briefings and roundtables that week, three refrains were consistent:

1) Traceability is the ticket to entry. “Trust at origin” using continuous, verifiable data—not annual PDFs.

2) TradeTech beats paperwork. Digitized customs + corridor SLAs lower friction for buyers and DFIs.

3) Skills + standards travel together.\*\* Auditable systems (not slogans) bring capital, and they create better local jobs.



**Who I am (context / E-E-A-T)**

I’m Jean-Jacques Janse van Rensburg (Cape Town), founder at SelfBuiltSystems—AI systems & trade infrastructure. We work with operators/buyers on critical minerals and AI-adjacent infra. Participated in G20/B20 engagements and WEF briefings in South Africa this October/ and invited to G20/B20 Finale events happening on 22-23 November.

**Standards & scope (first-world edge)**

IFC Performance Standards 1–8 • Equator Principles IV • EU CSRD / CBAM / Battery Regulation • ISO 27001 / SOC 2 (data) • OECD DDG (minerals supply chains)

**New frameworks > old frameworks**

**Old:** static PDFs, retrofitted “AI dashboards,” unpredictable permits.  

**New:** Living Data Rooms that stream safety/throughput/emissions/water/community metrics to lenders/buyers/verifiers; \*\*policy-as-code\*\* so permits have SLAs; programmable finance so offtake milestones are auditable.



**7 lessons from the week**

1) Treat AI like infrastructure. Budget for substations, copper, storage, and governance—not pilots that look good on stage and die in operations.  

2) Bankable-by-design beats after-the-fact compliance. Start with verifiers in the loop; let auditors read the same stream as lenders.  

3) Programmable cross-border finance reduces drag. Tokenized offtake/receivables + milestone disbursements; stablecoin vendor rails where permitted (multi-trillion settlement in 2024—sources below).  

4) Corridors unlock underwriting. Bundle resources + midstream + power/storage + LEO connectivity + digitized customs under harmonized permits. Capital prefers a cluster with visible throughput.  

5) AI/data centers ↔ copper + grid reality. Offtake terms now price substation queues and copper logistics; inference growth is gated by metal and megawatts.  

6) South Africa’s leverage. Deep-water ports (Richards Bay, Saldanha), heavy-haul rail, renewables/nuclear experience, engineering talent. Build the Northern/Eastern/Western arcs; co-site midstream + substations + storage + telemetry.  

7) Community trust is evidence-based. Telemetry tied to benefit-sharing (community metrics in the same stream) reduces friction and speeds permits.



**What to do next (operators / buyers / policymakers)**

**- Operators:** instrument sites; publish a read-only verifier stream; model rail slots, port dwell, substation queue, storage hours; prepare tokenized offtake/receivables options (where permitted).  

**- Buyers:** require auditable origin + programmable milestones; prioritize corridor-anchored supply over scattered assets.  

**- Policymakers:** publish corridor SLAs (permits/customs/power connections); ring-fence substation capacity/ROW; enable verifiable e-rails for trade finance.



**FAQ**

\- \*Why corridors, not single mines? Pool risk/capex; amortize power/storage/logistics; lenders buy into cluster throughput with real-time evidence.  

\- Are stablecoins realistic? Where permitted, yes—paired with strict KYC/AML and milestone controls; the point is programmability + auditability.  

\- Remote assets? LEO latency in the low tens of milliseconds supports continuous telemetry + verifier access.

I have been using these (coffee works, roasted on, 8 weeks ago, medium/dark) beans, and have got through a kg of them, so by now barista assist should know what to do.

I am getting a recommended grind size of 21, this seems wildly high compared to what I’ve read elsewhere, with most people having single shots recommend about a 10 grind? Double size is recommended at 15 for reference.

Strength on 2, water temp medium. 

Pour length is generally as per in the video.

Samsung’s Galaxy XR Headset was finally announced this week after months of teasing. The headset runs Google’s Android XR platform and is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2+ gen 2 chip. It has Google’s Gemini AI assistant on board and some pretty impressive-looking Google apps, including the YouTube immersive video support and Google Maps is taken to a whole new level. While it’s currently only available in Korea and the US, the price is also impressive, as at $1799, it's around half that of the Vision Pro M5. 



**Samsung smart glasses update**

At the end of the Galaxy XR launch, Samsung also teased an upcoming pair of smart glasses. These seem similar to the glasses Google demoed back in May, even working with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster on the frames, but it looks like these could be Samsung branded. 



**The next Xbox console will be super premium**

According to Xbox President Sarah Bond, the next-gen Xbox will be very premium. That’s great news for high-end gamers, as it could mean the device not only outperforms the upcoming PlayStation 6 but could also be a hybrid unit capable of PC gaming too. However, this is likely to also come at a very high price, putting it out of reach for many regular Xbox fans. 



**Leica’s new rangefinder is missing something**

Leica has released its latest M-series digital rangefinder; however, it’s missing one crucial thing. The Leica M EV1 has an electronic viewfinder in place of the optical rangefinder that has been a feature of the M series since the beginning. While this may horrify purists, the EVF is more accurate, as it offers a through-the-lens view, complete with focus peaking for that manual focus, while still being fast enough for some street photography. Priced at just under £7k or $9k, it’s still only for the select few, but it does look stunning. 

Costa

**Costa coffee at home**

There’s now a way to get Costa in your own kitchen. The firm has launched its own coffee machine called the Podio X1. It uses special Cost Coffee pods and is finished in the trademark Costa colours. This is primarily aimed at office and hotel use but it is possible to buy it for around £359.

 I’m writing this now because sleep isn’t happening, and because the smell is back—the wax, that animal tallow stink I can’t wash off my hands no matter what I try. My name is Diego, I’m from Madrid, 32, project geotech for a small firm. Last weekend—Saturday night, October 11, 2025—I went out to the woods above a village in Lugo province with two friends, Mateo and Iván. We weren’t chasing anything supernatural. We wanted to finish a mapping job and make it fun with an overnight at a ruined hermitage that locals swear is safe if you keep quiet and don’t provoke the place. It was supposed to be easy overtime: cross-check coordinates, test a drone path over chestnut groves, sleep under a roof older than any of us.

 We’ve known each other since university—field labs, cheap beer, and colder mornings. Mateo films everything; he edits workplace videos into mini-docs nobody watches except our moms. Iván is the practical one, recently divorced, the kind of guy who checks the spare before he checks the map. I’m the one who says yes to too many things. The plan was simple: drive up, grab a caldo at the village bar, hike to the hermitage before twilight, shoot stars, test the drone grid for Monday’s survey, sleep, and go home before lunch on Sunday.

 The bar smelled like soup and wet wool. The old man at the counter—Emilio, he said, though everyone called him don—asked where we were sleeping. When we told him the hermitage name, he pressed his lips together, then laid a small ashtray on the table like it was a talisman. He said certain nights the woods are crowded in ways you don’t see. Don’t answer if someone calls you by name, he told us. If you feel a gift pressed into your hand, drop it. If the wind goes still and you smell wax, step inside a circle of ash and wait without speaking. We smiled and promised we’d be careful. He didn’t smile back.

 We left the bar into a drizzle that turned to a fine mist by the time we reached the trailhead. Galicia does damp like a second atmosphere. The path threaded between chestnut and oak, the kind of green that eats sound. The hermitage sat on a shoulder of rock above the village; we could see its slate roof when the trees opened. Mateo was talking about timelapses of moving cloud; Iván showed me a photo of his little boy with a plastic dinosaur, the first thing to make him smile all week. Everything felt normal. Better than normal, honestly. Work had been loud and here it was very quiet.

 The hermitage was exactly as Google had promised: four walls, one door hanging wrong on rusty hinges, and an altar made of the same stone as the hill. We set the stove on a flat rock, ate bread and cheese and the last of the caldo in plastic. Mateo whistled softly as he fitted the tripod plates; Iván stretched his bad knee and grunted. I felt that city static peel off me. After sunset the clouds burned away and the sky went fierce, stars speaking like they only do far from streetlights. We were three men and the cold, and it was good.

 On our second pass to fetch water from a rivulet below the clearing, we cut a corner and found a fork I didn’t remember from the map. In the center someone had traced a ring of ash. It wasn’t a campfire ring—too clean, too careful—and there were drips of wax on a stone the way kids make when they tilt a candle over paper. A small cross of twigs lay half-buried, soggy. I kicked it gently and it slid with a rasp. Iván said some village kids must’ve played at Holy Week. Mateo squatted to film and then stood quickly, shaking his head like a horse does when a fly touches its eye.

 We put the drone up to check canopy gaps, but it came home early with a full battery like it had hit a ceiling we couldn’t see. Mateo swore softly, tapped the controller, sent it again. Same thing. While he fiddled, Iván and I noticed a leaning cross—two sticks tied with string—propped across the path we’d just taken in. It hadn’t been there ten minutes earlier. I set it aside without thinking. The air felt heavier, like a shop before closing where the clerks are waiting for you to leave.

 We got proper night around eleven-thirty. The headlamps went red to save our night vision; the stove ticked. When I checked my phone for the time later, the lock screen said 01:07 with the seconds frozen—no signal, just the hour like a painted sign. I locked it, opened again. 01:07. It was funny until it wasn’t. Somewhere to our right, down the slope, a man’s voice said my name. Not loud—more like a greeting from a neighbor turning the corner. Diego. The way my mother says it when I answer the phone distracted. I turned halfway and caught Iván’s sleeve. Don’t answer, he said, and I realized he was kneading his jaw like it hurt.

 We killed our headlamps and crouched behind a low stone. The lights we thought were farmhouses moving through the trees were not farmhouses. They were hand-held, a wavering little chain of gold sliding along the slope. I smelled the sea for a moment, impossible so far inland, brine cutting through leaf rot. Mateo raised the camera but didn’t press record. Between trunks I saw shoulders hunched under hoods, faces like washed-out photographs, and at the front a taller figure carrying a cross that looked heavier than any one of us would want to lift. The candle flames burned steady even when the mist licked at them. Somewhere behind us the voice said my name again, softer. Diego.

 We held as the column passed below, but the front figure turned uphill, smudged by branches, and without hurry came toward us until I could have touched the cross. A second hand lifted, offering it, patient. I’d like to pretend I remembered Don Emilio’s warning quickly, that I dropped my own hand instantly, but the truth is I reached and only stopped because the wood felt cold in a way wood isn’t supposed to. My palm came away wet, slicked with a wax that wasn’t quite wax. The world tilted an inch. Mateo hissed my name through his teeth like he could pull me backward with it.

 We ran without dignity. The procession didn’t chase. It didn’t need to. Tracks we knew a couple of hours earlier refused to be where we left them. The nearest structure was a hórreo, a granary on stone legs ten meters off the path, and we piled into it and dragged the warped door nearly shut. The slats let in threads of light and the smell of old grain and mouse. Outside, candle-glow passed like a tethered river. My palm burned cold where the not-wax had smeared; when I wiped it on my pants it left a dull sheen like oil.

 The latch rattled lightly with no wind to move it. Then something small and pale pressed under the door: not a finger but the idea of one, a bulge of wax finding space the way water does. I stamped and it flattened, smearing, then gathered itself again—slow, patient—until Iván ground his boot hard enough to drive it back. He whispered a prayer I didn’t know he knew, not showy, just words from somewhere older than us. Mateo said please twice, to the room or to the air. Someone outside moved past, a sound like cloth brushing bark, measured as a tolling bell.

 I tore open the ashes tin from the stove, hands shaking so badly I almost dumped it into the gaps in the planks, and traced a ring around us on the splintered boards. It felt ridiculous until it didn’t. When the circle closed the light from outside thinned, like fogged glass between us and them. The latch lifted and dropped once, twice, nine times—counting the knocks made my throat hurt. None of us spoke. The smell of tallow was so strong I could taste it, fat and old. Through the slats I could see sandals but no feet in them, just the leather, and then nothing at all, like a page turned.

 Dawn came like someone lifting a wet cloth. When we finally opened the door the air moved again and the birds made the usual cheap jokes. On the threshold hung a new stick cross from the latch we hadn’t fastened, twine still wet. In the mud below the steps were footprints—naked, human-looking, all heading away downhill toward the stream, no pattern of return. On the granary floor the ash circle was scuffed but unbroken. I picked up a loose ribbon I thought was trash and saw my initials stitched in tarnished thread. D G. I don’t own anything with embroidery.

 We didn’t talk about it as we packed, because talking would mean deciding whether it had happened. The hermitage looked like a postcard you could buy in any petrol station: pious ruin, forgettable. I scrubbed my left palm with sand and water until it went raw, but the sheen remained and the smell stayed, like I’d been helping butcher something. On the way down none of us wanted to be first; none of us wanted to be last. We returned the drone to its case like we were apologizing to it.

 Back in Madrid I told myself we’d been overwrought in a place geared for ghost stories. I kept telling myself while I scoured with dish soap, with coffee grounds, with rubbing alcohol until my skin protested and the smell lingered anyway. I slept a few hours Monday and woke at 1:07 a.m. exactly with the sound of slow steps in the hall outside my apartment, steps that stopped at my door and then continued past like a neighbor pacing with a baby. Tuesday, the same. Wednesday, I dreamed I was carrying something heavy down rows of trees and the weight wasn’t a burden but a task I’d been given long ago, something I’d forgotten and was glad to remember.

 Thursday I opened Mateo’s shared folder to sort survey clips. Most files were perfect: shaky jokes, skyline, Iván complaining about his knees. One clip I didn’t recognize started black, then showed the three of us crossing the clearing in a jittering gold light. The camera was low, like set on the ground. We passed in front of it and I froze. I was barefoot. I don’t remember losing my boots. A black strap crossed my chest and something long and dark rose over my shoulder. The timeline said 00:03 on October 12. Behind me, Mateo and Iván kept a respectful distance with their heads dipped like mourners. I closed the laptop so fast the mug jumped.

 That night Don Emilio called. He shouldn’t have had my number, but he said Iván gave it to him to ask if we’d found a rosary. No, I said, we hadn’t borrowed anything. He hummed in a toothless way and told me not to answer if someone came to return what I’d already taken, and to check my bags for anything that wasn’t mine. After we hung up, I opened my pack and found, beneath the drone charger, a strap of cracked black leather that smelled like smoke and old churches. It fit my chest without adjusting. I put it on the table and went to wash my hands again. When I came back, the strap lay in a neat circle, like it wanted to be a ring around something.

 Earlier today I ducked into the chino shop on the corner for batteries. I passed the shelf of candles and one stub, the cheapest sort, sputtered and took flame. There was no lighter near it, no matches. The clerk didn’t look up. I stood there like an idiot watching the wax run in a line down the side, a perfect thread that reminded me of that thing pushing under the hórreo door. When I got home, the hallway smelled faintly of salt air though I live 600 kilometers from the sea. Something had been pressed into my mailbox slot, and I half-expected a candle to fall. It was empty.

 If you grew up in Galicia you probably have a name for what we stumbled across. I didn’t grow up there, but my grandmother did, and some of her stories wore the same shoes: a procession that moves like an errand, the living conscripted to lead the dead, the weight in your hands a cross you shouldn’t accept. I thought those were for scaring kids into coming home before dark. Tonight, before writing this, I made a small ash circle on a plate because it feels less ridiculous to be ridiculous on purpose than to pretend none of this is happening. The strap they offered me—because I think that’s what it was, an offer—sits coiled like a sleeping snake. I keep smelling wax when the wind is perfectly clean.

 I keep thinking about the video frame and how calm I look carrying that weight. I keep thinking about how the flames didn’t flicker and how the air didn’t move until we drew the circle, and how a ribbon with my initials lay where I’d stand to leave. If this is a prank, it’s a mean one that knows too much. If it isn’t, then there’s a schedule I’m not making but that keeps me anyway at 1:07, the minute my phone learned to be only a sign. It’s late again, and the steps are back in the hall—pace, pause, pace, a knock lower than knuckles, something like wood on wood. I’m going to post this and then sit inside my little ash ring like a child because I don’t know what else to do.

update from deletd account:

Yesterday my husband was having a very important meeting with half of his subordinates as the year will end soon and our son kept pulling his arm because he wanted something from the fridge. I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.",0,1761320377.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,2,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Along with my mom since her bday is coming up and she lives across the country in the desert so I can hopefully do a 2 in 1. 

I don’t want it to just be the regular old bottle of wine or something. I was thinking coffee, chocolate, or baked goods made locally here would be pretty nice since it’s not something anybody really buys themselves being more expensive than just regular coffee or donuts from wegmans.

Also, doesn’t even have to be either of these, just need recommendations since I’m a 26M I feel a bit disconnected from what she would actually want since I don’t know her personal life very well. Both her and my mom are pretty well off so they just buy whatever they want, which makes it even harder since they are a bit boujee I guess.

Bonus points if it’s only in Rochester since she lives in Albany but I’ll be seeing her tomorrow out there. Basically anything possible with a $40-60 budget.

Would love to support a small business here in town as well I just am fairly new to Rochester so haven’t learned of the small local shops too much yet. Thanks everyone for any advice or recommendations!!

I've started the long road to surgery, had my initial psych and surgical consults, waiting for nutrituion classes to start. Still probably 3-6 months out from a surgery date, and basically my program wants me to adapt my food and exercise now to behave as if I have already had the procedure. 

I'm trying to start implementing some of the diet changes I know are coming, but I'm having a tough time. I need to get off caffiene, and have gone from 2 daily cups of coffee to 1 (sometimes skipping altogether). At this point it's more ritual than addiction, but I miss it on chilly mornings. I don't drink diet soda or carbonated drinks often, but when I do it's because I'm craving a sweet treat or an afternoon pick-me-up. 

Tracking my food or being regular about walking/moving is just not happening yet, I'm very sporadic about it. I keep thinking ""I need to eat/drink this now to get it out of the house,"" as if there will be some magical time where the cupboards are bare and I will only be bringing in the ""right"" foods.

I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same boat? What are you working to change pre-op, and what could you use support with? Maybe we could have regular check-ins as we work on these behavior changes. I know being successful now will make the post-op life that much easier! ",1,1761320141.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

1of0wab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1of0wab/we_built_fa_san_coffee_from_scratch_in_nyc_five/,"We Built Fa San Coffee From Scratch in NYC. Five Months Later, Here’s Our Story.","I’ve tried many times to update this post, but each time I opened it, what I wanted to say had already changed. It’s not that I was trying to prove anything — it’s just that every time I read what I wrote before, I realized I had already gone through another round of growth and evolution.

Running our own coffee shop has been, for me and my wife, not just a business — but a medium to explore and fulfill the ideas and dreams we’ve carried inside.

The summer was *amazing.* Every day felt full of joy and energy — opening the door each morning, seeing people come in, getting support from friends and strangers alike. What started as something that felt almost magical — people actually showing up to this small space we built — slowly became something even more special: Fasan has turned into a gathering place for people in New York’s coffee community.

I used to dream about being part of such a group, and now, through what we created, I’ve found myself surrounded by people who share the same passion.

I still remember our opening day party([opening video](https://www.tiktok.com/@fasan_coffee?lang=en)). Even though we opened at 4 PM, there were already people — familiar and unfamiliar faces — waiting outside the door. I had never worked in coffee before, and suddenly I was hand-making cream top for each drink, pulling espresso shots non-stop. It was chaos, but it was also one of the most fulfilling days of my life.

Since then, so many interesting people and stories have come through our doors. I really believe good energy attracts good energy. One rainy day, before we got our business license, I saw a few girls across the street struggling to find shelter. I called out to them to come in and wait out the rain, made them some warm lattes, and we started talking. Later, after we officially opened, they came back — bought beans, drinks, even used our vintage buttons to make clothes. Those small moments mean everything to me.

In our first few days, we had a jar of wedding candies at the counter — we wanted to share our happiness with everyone. One morning, a man came in for a hot Americano, so I gave him a wedding candy along with his drink. A few hours later, a woman came in asking how I knew she was getting married that day. I was confused until she explained — the man from the morning was her husband. When he got the candy, he thought it was a sign — that someone was wishing them a beautiful day, and it made him feel even more certain that it was the perfect day to marry her. Later, their wedding photographer also happened to stop by our shop for coffee, so I gave him a candy too. The next day, the couple came back to tell me the whole story — they were from California, had come to New York just to get married at Tompkins Square Park, and somehow, our little shop became part of their story. It was such a beautiful, serendipitous moment.

Among our regulars, many are older folks — grandmas and grandpas who wander in because the vintage chairs draw them outside and the smell of coffee inside. One rainy day, an elderly couple came in under one umbrella. We started chatting — they asked why we opened this shop, and why we filled it with antique furniture. I told them the story: I opened Fasan for my wife. I wanted to create a space for her to enjoy coffee, display the things she loves, and have a place where she could freely express her creativity. We can’t afford a house yet, but this café has become the home for all the things we love. I still remember the warmth in grandparents smiles.

Because Fasan is fully independent, we have the freedom to choose beans we love and explore roasting styles from all over the world. I’ve tried beans from roasters across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. — and every time I find something I love, I want to share it with others

We serve everything from high-end Panama Geisha to reliable daily Ethiopian beans. Since opening, we’ve been offering cold brews made from different Geisha varieties, not just espresso-based cold brews. My goal is to share and rediscover coffee with people, so that it doesn’t have to be over-concentrated or overly sweetened. Good coffee speaks for itself, and people can taste that difference.

Creating our drink menu has been one of the hardest but most fulfilling parts. We didn’t want to rely on syrups or copy existing drinks, so every recipe — from our house blend to our seasonal menus — has been carefully tested and adjusted. During development, my wife and I would drink so much coffee that our hearts were racing all day, but our minds were exhausted. Even now, we haven’t done much online social marketing. Maybe it’s our Asian humility — we’d rather let the drinks speak for themselves.

We want to let people experience coffee beyond sugar and milk — to taste tea-infused lattes, floral extractions, and natural sweetness. Our **Yuzu Bright Brew** became one of the favorites this summer, and now we’re working on our winter drinks. I’m nervous but excited — we’re keeping the tea-coffee fusion alive, adding more hot options, and bringing in new cold brew beans from around the world.

# Looking Ahead

This first winter feels like a new chapter. The past five months have been *crazy* — full of growth, lessons, and endless iteration. Fasan continues to evolve in front of everyone’s eyes. We don’t know exactly what the future holds, but we know one thing: we’ll keep putting our hearts into it.

Thank you to everyone who has walked through our door, shared stories with us, and believed in what we’re building. For those of you dreaming of starting your own business — keep going. You *can* do it. We’re living proof that a small dream, built with love and persistence, can become something real.

We’re now open every day from 10 AM – 5 PM — come grab a coffee and hang out with us!  
Also, I’m looking to connect with someone who could help me turn this journey into a book. I’d love to share our story — how it all began, and what we’ve learned along the way — with all of you.

1of0vp2,https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-great-feminization-hasnt-gone,The Great Feminization Hasn’t Gone Far Enough,"When I was 13 years old, most of the girls in my single-sex school failed a question on a science test: *Why do teenage boys have higher levels of iron than girls?*

Different students took different approaches to the question. Maybe boys eat more red meat? Or their propensity for risk somehow gives them an added layer of protection?

The answer is so obvious that you’re screaming at me: Boys don’t get periods. Our all-girls school had lulled us into a sense that the female is the default human. Of course, this brief period of tranquility didn’t last—soon we absorbed the concept developed by Simone de Beauvoir that man is default and woman is “Other.”

Still, the intensity of an all-female environment has stayed with me in the decades since, so I read Helen Andrews’ recent viral essay “[The Great Feminization](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/)” with interest and a raised eyebrow. Drawing on the blogger J. Stone, Andrews argues that many issues facing society today—especially wokeness—are in fact driven by the feminization of society. Andrews says, paraphrasing Stone, “all cancellations are feminine. Cancel culture is simply what women do whenever there are enough of them in a given organization or field.”

Andrews’ argument relies on the fact that women are [more likely](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178914000329) to use ostracism and gossip to exclude or publicly shame individuals, and that these are the characteristics of left-wing cancel culture. She claims that as the number of women in various industries has grown, women began imposing these toxic norms in the workplace and public life in what she describes as a vast experiment in “social engineering.”

There is a kernel of truth to Andrews’ claims. Like many women, I’ve felt the thrill of being part of a group excluding someone, and equally have felt the sting of ostracism myself. (Anyone who has ever joined a dysfunctional team at work knows that nothing unites a group like a common enemy, whether that’s a difficult boss or the person who takes away the free coffee.)

It’s true that prominent left-wing cancellations follow similar dynamics. In 2020,[ Matt Yglesias](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/substack-and-medias-groupthink-problem/617102/) left *Vox* for Substack after (among other things) a colleague accused him of making her feel “less safe” for signing the pro-free speech *Harper’s Letter*. In 2023,[ Carole Hooven](https://www.thefp.com/p/carole-hooven-why-i-left-harvard) was forced to resign from Harvard for saying sex is biological and binary. According to a[ survey](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom) from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), over half of academics are concerned about losing their jobs or reputations due to their words being used against them.

What’s more, the surge of left-wing cancel culture during the 2010s and early 2020s did, roughly, coincide with increasing female participation in both education and the workplace. While female students have outnumbered male students since[ 1979](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/women-in-higher-education-facts-statistics/), traditionally male subjects such as law and medicine became majority female only in[ 2016](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2024/01/women-outnumber-men-in-us-law-school-classrooms-but-statistics-dont-tell-the-full-story/) and[ 2017](https://www.aamc.org/news/brief-timeline-women-medicine), respectively. As Andrews points out, 55% of *New York Times* staff are now female. This broadly matches the timeline of the rise of wokeness and cancel culture.

But scratch beneath the surface, and Andrews’ argument falls apart.

First, the Great Feminization hypothesis relies on the sweeping assumption that men are rational, while women are emotional. Of course, anger—the emotion most associated with men—is excluded from this analysis, which is strange given that it guides so much of a certain president’s behavior. A great deal of the United States’ current foreign policy seems to be guided by perceived slights to Trump rather than the rational calculations we are assured men excel at.

Meanwhile, history’s most futile wars give lie to the idea that women are uniquely driven by emotion. The[ Battle of the Somme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme)—in which over one million soldiers were wounded or killed for a territorial gain of six miles—is hardly a glowing endorsement of men’s capacity for rational thought. And the recent wave of cancellations coming from the right in the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk—much of it driven by conservative men—should make us skeptical that, as Andrews puts it, “men tend to be better at compartmentalizing than women” such that they keep politics from infecting everyday life.

Then there is Andrews’ inaccurate characterization of female conflict strategies. In a recent[ tweet](https://x.com/herandrews/status/1974808063400882371), she writes: “When the conflict is over, \[men will\] shake the other guy’s hand and accept the outcome gracefully. Women don’t have that. If you’re her enemy, you are subhuman garbage. No rules govern the fight; no shaking hands when it’s over. It is never over.” But this just doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Peace agreements are [20%](https://wps.unwomen.org/participation/) more likely to last at least two years, and 35% more likely to last 15 years, if women are part of the process.[1](https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-great-feminization-hasnt-gone#footnote-1-177000688) (Andrews also seems to contradict herself here—one moment she claims women prioritize “empathy over rationality,” and the next she acts as if women lack any empathy whatsoever.)

What about her claim that feminization is the main culprit for wokeness? The timing is dubious. The number of women studying for and entering traditionally male professions has been on the rise for decades, yet wokeness of the sort Andrews is concerned about is a fairly recent phenomenon. (Yglesias dates the “[Great Awokening](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020)” to around 2014). While Andrews argues that this is because organizations reached a tipping point once they became majority female (or were heading that way), this isn’t a satisfactory answer. Even with an increasingly female workforce, most managers and CEOs are still men. And as Andrews points out, only 33% of judges today are women, which doesn’t prevent her from applying her thesis to the legal profession.

What other factors might explain wokeness? The timing fits more neatly with the rise of smartphones and social media. As Jonathan Haidt[ argues](https://jonathanhaidt.com/anxious-generation/), these new tools triggered a wave of anxiety and depression among adolescents, as well as a broader concern for “safety” from perceived threats. Social media provided the perfect tools not only to amplify new ideas such as wokeness, but also to enforce sanctions on non-believers from the comfort of one’s own couch.

This makes sense when you consider that left-wing cancel culture arguably peaked during the COVID pandemic in 2020, when everyone was scared, confused, and isolated. Had wokeness merely been an expression of typically female behavior, the pandemic would have had a much more limited effect—and indeed wokeness would have continued to grow in strength every year since then as more women entered the workforce, when in fact the opposite seems to be the case.

**The truth is that,** in many ways, feminization hasn’t gone far enough—something that Andrews seems unable to recognize.

Take medicine, a subject Andrews only touches on to make the implausible point that male doctors are better than female ones at keeping politics “out of the examination room.” Historically, female patients have faced a great deal of discrimination, from doctors dismissing their symptoms to exclusion from medical studies. In her memoir *Giving Up The Ghost*, the novelist Hilary Mantel described her excruciating experience with endometriosis, a condition that affects [one in 10 women](https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/population-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-endometriosis) of reproductive age, yet which even today can take between four and 11 years to diagnose. Despite negative pregnancy tests and years of pain, a doctor dismissed Mantel’s pain with the words “there’s a baby in there.” (Mantel later had a hysterectomy, including removal of part of her bladder and bowel, as a result of the disease.)

This is part of a broader trend: women are frequently ignored when reporting symptoms, and life-saving treatments are still not adequately tested for their impact on women’s bodies. The COVID vaccines were a huge scientific achievement—yet from early on in the vaccine rollout, women[ reported](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/didnt-doctors-listen-women-link-covid-vaccines-periods/) its effects on their menstrual cycle, from heavier periods to breakthrough bleeding in post-menopausal women. Vaccination studies simply didn’t look at menstrual side-effects, and both medical organizations and media outlets were initially[ dismissive](https://newsletter.carolinecriadoperez.com/p/invisible-women-murderous-menstrual-blood-734697) of women’s reports. (Thankfully, the link has since been[ studied](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12364997/).)

Rather than admitting that there are some areas in which it would be better to listen to women more, Andrews is concerned with making sweeping statements about how feminization will lead to the end of Western civilization. “The field that frightens me most is the law. All of us depend on a functioning legal system, and, to be blunt, the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female,” she frets, using Obama-era Title IX regulations as an example of what a feminized legal system might look like.

This is a vast overstatement. There are real reasons to[ criticize](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-campus-rape-policy/538974/) the Obama-era Title IX regulations, in which many of those accused of sexual assault on college campuses had too little right to due process. While these rules came from an understandable desire to support survivors of rape and assault, in practice both women and men benefit from a fair system with due process at its heart.

But Andrews’ claim that “the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female” is ludicrous. Women are not immune to rationality, and the fact that women[ outperform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2024/01/14/from-kindergarten-to-college-girls-are-outperforming-boys/) men in areas of education that apparently play to male strengths, such as exams, suggests that we understand rules and arguments, too. In fact, female lawyers are [23%](https://premonition.ai/women_lawyers_significantly_better_study_finds/) less likely to be sued for malpractice than male lawyers, and female partners win 12% more than men, showing that women are in fact competent at upholding the law.

More broadly, Andrews is right to be concerned that feminization is driving men away from traditionally male institutions. But once again she misidentifies the cause. Research has shown that professions dominated by women are [considered less valuable](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html), while those seen as more masculine enjoy a status (and corresponding financial) bump. This suggests that it’s not toxic female behaviors driving men away, but a lack of respect for women.

**Anyone who has** spent time in groups dominated by each sex knows that the social lives of men and women are very different. Until recently, I worked in predominantly female workplaces in which updates about our complex love lives were practically a standing agenda item in team meetings, and the solution to any issue was invariably “let’s all join hands.” (I loved it.) All-female groups also tend to handle conflict differently to men, for example by canvassing other members to see if there’s general agreement before making a decision on how to act.

But it’s wrong to extrapolate that feminization somehow poses a threat to civilization. Indeed, there are plenty of areas in which more feminization would improve things for men as well. Letting men[ take](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmwomeq/358/358.pdf) paternity leave of longer than two weeks tends to lead to more hands-on childcare, which in turn is associated with better outcomes for children. Indeed, research shows that fathers today *want* to spend more time with their children than those of previous generations, suggesting that both men and women would benefit from increased focus on areas of life that are traditionally considered women’s domain, such as childrearing.

Today, we are lucky that we don’t have to choose between the old, stagnant patriarchal system in which women were confined to the domestic sphere, and the cruel matriarchal system people like Andrews think we already live in. Instead, we can embrace the positive aspects of masculinity *and* femininity, whilst finding effective strategies to mitigate the harms of both. This means championing values and policies that lead to a free and fair society for all—even men.

I’m moving to Colorado in February and I’m super stuck between Old Town Fort Collins and somewhere in Denver. Frankly, I like Denver better.

But at the same time, I’m a single parent to a 4 year old and that makes Old Town Fort Collins kind of perfect for kid life— super walkable, coffee shops, splash pad, places to get ice cream, etc.

But the apartment situation in Fort Collins is dire (hardly anything available, and what is available is super dumpy), and it sort of feels like everyone is either 21 or 65 there which feels like it’s going to make it hard to date and make friends with people in their 30’s and 40’s.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

""Everything from gold to ground beef is near record highs.""

If you’ve tuned into financial media over the past year, there’s a good chance you’ve heard an economist or other expert proclaiming that the stock market is entering a bubble. While television’s pundits may seem like alarmists, they’re not alone.

Everyone from JPMorgan Chase CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-exclusive-ai-real-bubble-billions-use-case-outlook-19684558.htm) to Amazon founder [Jeff Bezos](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/jeff-bezos-ai-in-an-industrial-bubble-but-society-to-benefit.html) seems to agree that AI stocks are barreling towards — if not already in — a bubble. Historically high valuations have earned this corner of the market more than a few comparisons to the dot-com bubble of a generation ago.

“There’s a lot of speculation in the stock market that looks quite a bit like the previous tech bubble in the late 1990s,” says David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research. “The stock market has been caught in this generative AI frenzy,” he says.

The result, according to Rosenberg, is the expectation of accelerating profits and economic growth. That enthusiasm has grown beyond AI stocks, though. The market has been on a tear since April, with all of the [S&P 500’s](https://money.com/fed-rate-cut-sp-500-7000-2025-forecast/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) 11 sectors up on a year-to-date basis.

But beyond stocks, prices — from housing to hamburgers — have climbed to record levels, suggesting this could be an everything bubble.

# What’s fueling the surge?

Economies typically don’t act like this. Prices for one type of goods or services usually rise at the expense of another. But the current marketplace seems to be defying the odds, and there isn’t an easy answer why.

Everything from gold and silver to car prices, rent and credit card interest rates are near historic highs. All the while, the S&P 500 continues to set new records.

According to Rosenberg, part of the reason it’s so hard to determine why is that there isn’t a single driving force. “Each individual asset class is responding to different variables,” he says. Here are a some of those factors, and how they are driving up prices across the economy.

# Wall Street’s optimism lifts stocks

Comparisons to the dot-com bubble are inevitable, but economists say there are key differences about today’s market buoyancy. For one, the companies spending prodigiously on AI aren’t start-ups burning through venture capital. Instead, they’re well-established, mega-cap companies cranking out profits that routinely meet or beat analysts’ expectations.

Even if those expectations aren’t met, these are still companies with strong earnings and revenue streams, according to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “It’s early, I think, for ‘everything bubble’ talk,” he says. “We’re getting a push up in many assets, but it’s being followed by fundamentals,” Haworth says, including companies operating outside of AI.

Some of this reflects the ripple effect that AI spending has on other sectors of the economy: Haworth points to energy and utility stocks, which stand to benefit from data centers’ enormous electricity demand. Some market optimism is fueled by the promise of future innovations, such as the prospect of AI unlocking discoveries in biopharmaceuticals and improving medical diagnostics — an evolution Haworth says is already beginning to take place.

Despite that optimism, Haworth admits that risks remain, particularly regarding the Trump administration’s policies. “What we’re most worried about is if tariff implementation significantly changes consumer behavior or significantly increases corporate costs,” he says.

Nevertheless, the [Buffett Indicator](https://money.com/buffett-indicator-near-record-highs/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) — which measures the stock market’s total valuation relative to U.S. GDP — has also reached an all-time high. In other words, the indicator is now higher than it was preceding the dot-com crash of 2000.

# Immigration and trade policies are raising prices

The Trump administration’s trade and immigration policies have already sown chaos in boardrooms and balance sheets, with the government’s immigration crackdown being blamed for labor shortages in industries spanning [agriculture](https://prospect.org/politics/trump-labor-department-immigration-ICE-food-crisis/), [hospitality](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/how-crucial-is-immigration-us-hotel-industry-2025-06-13/) and [construction](https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2025/april-2025-construction-deep-dive.html). Fewer workers means companies have to pay more to attract scarce labor or invest in automation. Those higher costs get passed down through the supply chain and, ultimately, to consumers.

That’s on top of [tariff costs](https://money.com/coffee-prices-soar-congress-tariff-repeal-bill/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd). Although President Trump’s push for import duties on everything from motors to movies has only been [partially successful](https://money.com/trump-tariffs-supreme-court/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd), the abrupt reversal of a decades-long free trade agenda has thrown a wrench into the operations of American companies both large [and small](https://money.com/how-tariffs-affecting-small-businesses/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd).

Nowhere, perhaps, is this more evident than in the housing market. A ratio of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index to income has risen sharply, passing the high-water mark previously reached in 2006 amid the housing bubble. Homes today cost roughly [seven times](https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/) Americans’ median household income — and [mortgage rates](https://money.com/current-mortgage-rates/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) today are considerably higher than they were in February 2022, the first time this ratio hit a level of seven.

That’s partly attributable to tariffs, which weigh heavily on the construction industry, imposing higher prices on everything from cement, [lumber](https://money.com/trump-us-tariffs-drugs-trucks-furniture-lumber-2025/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) and copper wiring. Combined with higher labor costs resulting from the administration’s immigration policies, home prices have soared out of reach for many Americans.

Residential real estate is a tremendous economic engine, generating demand for everything from [property insurance](https://money.com/best-home-insurance/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) to patio furniture. A frozen housing market creates a chill over a much greater swath of commercial activity. “Housing is still the quintessential leading indicator… and nobody talks about the fact that housing prices are starting to roll over,” Rosenberg says. “That’s the canary in the coal mine.”

# Food, housing and credit card debt surge for everyday Americans

Some of the run-up in prices across a wide spectrum of assets can be attributed to the concentration of wealth among affluent Americans, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The wealthy are very, very wealthy, and there’s nowhere else for them to go,” he says.

Along with piling into stocks, these wealthy investors are diversifying into [alternative assets](https://money.com/south-florida-wealth-conference-investing-advice/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd). That includes private equity and private debt — asset classes that often preclude retail investors. They’re also investing in [gold](https://money.com/gold/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) and other precious metals, which are outperforming the S&P 500 this year by a wide margin.

Meanwhile, widening inequality in the face of climbing [food](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/business/grocery-store-prices-kroger-coupons) and housing costs could push the growing U.S. economy closer to an inflection point, as middle-class and lower-income Americans display increasing financial strain.

The cost of meat, poultry, fish and eggs [rose 5.6%](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) in August from the year prior, while prices of imported goods like coffee — which jumped an eye-opening 3.6% in a month and is up almost 21% from a year ago — have seen some of the sharpest increases. Even domestically-produced foods, especially ones that rely heavily on immigrant labor to harvest or produce, have risen substantially. Yale University’s Budget Lab [estimates](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025) that if tariffs remain at their current levels, the cost of fresh produce will rise by more than 4% in the near term.

Ballooning levels of credit card debt and delinquencies have raised concerns about a debt bubble. Americans hold a near-record of more than [$1 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG) in outstanding credit card debt, suggesting that many have turned to borrowing to fill the budget gaps. Despite the Federal Reserve’s new rate-cutting cycle, its impact has been smaller-than-expected for mortgage rates, while credit card interest rates remain near record highs.

Evidence is mounting that more Americans’ financial stability is cracking under the strain of their debts, particularly since the Department of Education resumed collections activity — including wage garnishment — on loans in default. Data from credit reporting bureau TransUnion found that the number of seriously delinquent student debtors who fell more than 60 days behind on personal loan payments jumped by 186% between December and June, while those who fell behind by more than 90 days on credit card bills during that same time period shot up by a whopping 479%.

# As the dollar drops, gold, silver and crypto push record highs

While the value of numerous assets continue pushing all-time highs, it’s quite the opposite for U.S. currency. The [value of the dollar](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/currency) has dropped by nearly 10% since Trump took office, which economists attribute at least partially to his administration’s policies.

Although a less-expensive dollar sounds bad, it’s good for certain companies and sectors. “It’s particularly good for service exporters,” Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund Kenneth Rogoff [told](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money-capital-risk/2025/08/01/trumps-gift-to-the-markets-a-weaker-dollar-00487632) Politico. This is one reason why big tech companies are raking in earnings; their international sales, when converted from local currency, are a higher number of dollars than they would have been if the greenback was stronger.

The U.S. dollar’s decades-long status as the global de facto reserve currency is also being rethought, as other countries consider the implications of a more isolationist, inward-looking United States. Zandi says that other countries’ central banks buying up stocks of gold bullion is a big reason why gold prices have risen to record highs. “Central banks are diversifying their reserves… out of dollars and into gold,” he says.

The price of gold hit $4,000 for the first time last week and continues to rise. The yellow metal is a traditional hedge against economic uncertainty, serving as a store of value and a safe-haven asset in the event of a downturn, and central bank-buying has accelerated the precious metal’s record gains this year. Right behind gold, the price of [silver](https://money.com/how-to-invest-in-silver/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) also hit an all-time high in October, surpassing its previous record set in 1980.

While some investors are turning to precious metals to avoid what they perceive as a stock market bubble, [others](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-buyers-dodging-bubbles-may-be-blowing-one-2025-10-14/) believe this could be contributing to a gold bubble. Meanwhile, as other countries stockpile bullion, Trump is turning towards [bitcoin](https://money.com/trump-vs-harris-on-crypto/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd), is only 11% off of its all-time high.

The administration’s agenda to deregulate and invest in digital assets is a major force behind the meteoric rise in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year. A push to integrate cryptocurrency into the financial mainstream, including a [plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-u-s-digital-asset-stockpile/) to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, lends credibility to an asset class that otherwise remains largely speculative.

# What should investors do?

Navigating a market that seems to be going nowhere but up can be challenging. While experts broadly agree that what goes up must come down, no one knows exactly when stocks will peak — or what happens after.

“Markets that are speculative and frothy can go on for a long time,” Zandi says. “But the higher the market grows, the more vulnerable it becomes.”

While companies’ robust returns make a legitimate case for high valuations, Zandi suggests that some investors could be donning rose-colored glasses. “Speculation is just creeping in,” he says. “That’s not atypical, \[but\] it feels like investors are getting over their skis.”

Getting out too early can mean forfeiting gains, but trying to time the market is a tightrope walk without a net. This puts ordinary Americans who depend on market returns to grow their nest eggs in a tough spot.

But there is one thing investors can do, according to Rosenberg. “It’s very important right now, if you haven’t already done so, to rebalance your portfolio.” While 401(k) savers have enjoyed impressive gains over the past few years, the way those gains are reinvested is likely to leave them overexposed to the high-growth tech companies at the forefront of the burgeoning AI bubble — and the most likely to correct when market [sentiment](https://money.com/stock-market-highs-investors-bearish/?xid=mcclatchy&utm_source=mcclatchy&utm_medium=rss_synd) shifts.

The end of a bull market is potentially the most lucrative and riskiest for investors. Rosenberg sounds a note of caution, using the analogy of a rising market as a slow-moving escalator, but a falling market as a stomach-dropping elevator.

I smoke marijuana and drink alcohol sometimes but had neither for about a week prior to my blood draw. I drink caffeine daily, not exceeding 2 cups of coffee, but I did not have any prior to the draw either.


I get hormone bloodwork done semi-regularly, 3 days ago was no different except they took twice as much blood. It was done in my left arm. The spot itself still hurts to touch and my arm and hand have been feeling weak. I can still use both but it really starts to hurt and feel numb if I put too much strain, which isn't very much either (I couldn't confidently hold a coffee cup without risk of spilling). I also tried to wash my hair and I couldn't scrub and keep the arm up without the same thing happening. I had a vasovagal response soon after the draw was done and I lost consciousness for about 30 seconds but as far as I can tell I was sitting in a chair so I don't think I injured the arm.

1of0koi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/1of0koi/wallace_gromit_in_the_grand_getaway_on_psvr2/,Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway on PSVR2 - Complete Impressions,"I have uploaded gameplay from my fresh experience with the game [here](https://youtu.be/OvrITgeuPGs) if you want to see how it looks / plays. My completed game impressions are shared below:

After completing the game, I have mixed feelings about recommending playing **Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway** on PSVR2, but hopefully the details below help you decide well for your interest.

It is a VR Experience game through a movie-length ""Grand Getaway"" with Wallace & Gromit where you will mostly play as Auto-Caddy but also spend some time in first person from perspective of Gromit and even some as the oblivious Wallace while you receive instructions from Beryl.

The gameplay involves following Beryl's instructions with some very light puzzle solving and a variety of mini-games in between chapters of fully animated cutscenes with voiced dialog where the game doesn't take control away from you, but it does shift your perspective between characters at times and you aren't able to move around freely (at any time). As Wallace or Gromit, your gameplay is limited to what you can touch within range (some room scale movement may help), but whenever you are controlling Auto-Caddy, you can use your extended arms to grab things from a distance and throw things by using your arms or putting the object in your mouth to eject it on target. You can also put your Auto-Caddy hands up to your headset and use L1 + R1 to go into scan mode that allows you to teleport to another location or scan and collect one of the collectibles where if you find / collect all, there may be some additional story as your reward (?). Aside those collectibles, it is a linear progression with no fail state except if you aren't able to beat the mini-game at which point it just lets you try again.

The controls are very simple. It uses lower left controller button to show you clip board of task list which is also how you can exit to Main Menu. The top left controller button re-centers you (as opposed to holding Options button). Aside that, it is just the L1 / R1 for gripping things to pick up or interact. You can also use the L2 / R2 to change your hand shape for how you choose to interact with buttons you press. Within these simple controls, you can do things like pour yourself a cup of coffee and drink it in low-gravity ([25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=1515s)).

The mini-games you play have a carnival games feel and include things like:

* Batting Asteroids ([23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=1425s)) where you can't hold and use it like a proper cricket bat but can fling it around to to knock away incoming asteroids.
* Shooting Gallery ([39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=2370s)) where it is difficult to point it where you want to shoot (Hold to Grip required) but after couple of fails, I managed to figure out how to get through.
* Memory Match ([43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=2580s)) which works well.
* Whack-A-Fruit ([48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=2935s)) which works well.

Graphically, I think it is using reprojection, but I didn't see clear signs of it (even for subtitles) so I am not sure. It may just be the animation style that feels lower frames that makes me think it is using reprojection when it is not. The game looks crisp and clear and looks really good in any of the enclosed areas but also bland & lacking detail in some of the outdoor areas that have longer draw distances showing shapes in the distance. I think standout here are the authentic claymation feeling animations including characters, your rocket ship and various alien things. There is a standout moment near end of the game that looks especially good and I felt the end credits were also really well done.

Audio has authentic Wallace & Gromit soundtrack, voices, and sound effects. The audio dialog has good enough audio separation that I didn't feel need for subtitles, but there are some areas where the environmental sounds can drown out the dialog and it doesn't provide any settings to adjust audio mix. You are only able to turn subtitles on / off by going into Options after exiting to Main Menu.

Haptics are present in the controllers and range from subtle to stronger. It doesn't have headset haptics, but when you are doing Auto-Caddy scans with your hands up to your headset, the controller haptics can make it feel like you have headset haptics. They gave careful attention to the haptics in this one.

For settings, you can choose whether you are playing seated or standing and aside that just language and subtitles option. One negative here is that you can only access settings from the main menu which means if you decide to change subtitle setting during a chapter ([31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=1900s)), you will have to repeat that chapter when you resume. The other is that the game doesn't remember your Options preferences between sessions and defaults back to subtitles on, so visit Options to change settings to your preference before resuming.

There are no VR comfort options as the game really doesn't need it. It only supports snap turns and for limited movement, uses teleport while using Auto-Caddy scan mode which also provides a vignette.

The game is not featuring a Platinum trophy. In fact, it only has 4 Gold trophies which are guaranteed to unlock if you make it to the conclusion of the story. The collectibles are optional and not required to unlock any trophies.

In my complete playthrough, I missed 3 out of 11 of those. The game sometimes displays save failed message ([55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrITgeuPGs&t=3300s)) which I think leads to the collectibles you collected not saving correctly and you may have to replay a chapter to re-collect it. The game does have chapter select so you can replay whatever you want easily (and it is a short game) but I don't feel like replaying the game to find all the collectibles.

If I had stopped after my first play session, I probably wouldn't recommend it, but by the time I completed the game in my second session, I felt much better about the overall game and do lean towards recommending it. I still don't feel like replaying it, but I am glad that I did see it through. So if you do get the game and find the gameplay itself janky or shallow (which it is), don't let that stop you from going further and completing the story.",16,1761319180.0,PSVR,3,0.94,False
1of0kjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1of0kjw/im_scared_of_my_partners_ex_wife/,I’m scared of my partner’s ex wife,"I’m going to try and make this as clear as possible, lots of moving parts. My parter (Bryan) and I have been together a little over a year now and live in a town with a population of 1,200. Bryan originally moved here with his ex wife Lily five years ago. They were together/married less than two years, and Bryan’s younger sister is married to Lily’s younger brother in another state. Bryan and Lily had a very nasty divorce, Bryan bought a building when they originally moved here, Lily wanted it in the divorce, and her dad ended up coming to a settlement with Bryan to buy it for her. At some point during the divorce Lily freaked out and pushed Bryan down a flight of stairs.

Last year when Bryan and I started dating Lily began starting weird completely untrue rumors about me around town, in addition to telling people she hated me. This is all really dumb because we are in our mid 30’s, so like… grow up.  At one point two separate people told me Lily was obsessed with me. It’s generally known that Lily is an unwell person. Shes very theatrical and dresses in what often looks like costumes. Over the course of the last six months her weird obsession kind of died down and there hasn’t been many encounters and zero rumors spread. Thought this was a good sign…

I have a friend (Kate) that rents an apartment in Lily’s building. A few weeks ago I go visit with my friend and while we are chatting Kate gets a text from Lily asking why I’m in her building… I leave shortly after and over the next few days Kate tried to have a conversation with Lily, but Lily leaves her on read. The first floor of Lily’s building is a coffee shop… within the same week Lily freaks out on her commercial tenant saying she can’t going anywhere in this town without having to see me and threatens the Coffee shop owner about terminating his lease if he continues to have me as a patron. A few days later Kate receives an email from Lily raising her rent  by $700 effective immediately. Obviously is this is illegal, so Kate consulted a lawyer that’s ended up serving Lily with a letter. Lily spoke with the lawyer and more/less admitted she had no issue with Kate and that it was all about me… this conversation happened Monday.

Tuesday while grabbing lunch with another friend this older lady we know approached us and asked us if we knew why Lily was in court Tuesday morning for a protection order. I guess the lady thought things may have escalated between Lily and Kate, but this wasn’t the case. We searched the docket and found out Lily was in court with her on/off again boyfriend (Ray). Apparently…. Lily is six months pregnant (secret baby), and Ray found out hers not the father and tripped out. The actual father is a local 65 year old married man with three kids out age, seven grandchildren, and two more grandchildren on the way! This is absolutely bonkers! The grandfather Lily had an affair with is a very well respected man in community, and this is 100% going to tear apart his family. The man screwed up big time….

Now the reason I’m scared Lily might do something crazy is because despite all the personal serious problems happening in her life, she still somehow has enough energy to obsess over me… and here’s the kicker…. I’m pregnant too, and we are announcing our pregnancy next week after we find out the sex. Remember how I said  Bryan’s sister is married to Lily’s brother? Our kids will have the same cousins….

In addition to all this it recently came out that Ray shot a dog because Lily didn’t like the dog and pressured him to kill it. Don’t have any additional details on that unfortunately. But, absolutely crazy! I’m scared because Lily is clearly unwell and things have been escalating in her life. She hates me with her whole being, and I know when she finds out I’m pregnant she’s going to have a complete mental breakdown. I’m not going to keep my pregnancy a secret, but I’m worried for my safety potentially….",3,1761319172.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1of0k4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentMarketing/comments/1of0k4h/my_content_workflow_is_now_faster_than_grabbing/,My content workflow is now faster than grabbing coffee,"It takes me seven minutes to create and publish a LinkedIn post. That's faster than walking to Starbucks and waiting for my order.

Here's my entire workflow: I open LinkedIn on my laptop. I write whatever I'm thinking about, usually 150-250 words. Takes about five minutes. Then I click my browser extension for [Looktara](http://looktara.com), type a quick description of the vibe I want (""professional but approachable"" or ""serious and contemplative""), and it generates a matching photo in five seconds. I add it to my post, review everything once, and hit publish.

Seven minutes total. Often less.

Compare this to my old workflow: Write post in Google Docs. Edit for 20 minutes. Overthink it for another 10 minutes. Realize I need a photo. Spend 15 minutes scrolling through old photos trying to find something relevant. Settle for something that doesn't quite match. Download it, crop it, upload to LinkedIn. Format the post. Second-guess everything. Maybe post, maybe save as draft and never publish.

Old workflow: 60+ minutes and 40% of posts never went live. New workflow: 7 minutes and 100% publish rate.

The difference isn't that I got faster at writing. I write at the same speed. The difference is I removed all the friction and decision points that used to derail me.

Looktara specifically solved the photo problem, which was my biggest friction point. But the principle applies to everything in content creation. Find your slowest, most frustrating step and either eliminate it or make it so fast it doesn't matter.

Speed matters in content creation because it determines volume, and volume over time is what builds audience. I can now publish 20 posts in the time it used to take me to publish 5. That 4x multiplier compounds into followers, engagement, opportunities, revenue.

In the form they ask you the projected monthly revenue of the business you are proposing, so I guess they charge you based on a % of the sales volume.

  
does anyone have a number or a range for those kiosks? (not including those Starbucks-like kiosks that make like twice the area of a regular one? I'm running the numbers for a proposal, but I'd like an idea of what they charge, so I can adjust my numbers to a more conservative value in case I'm going too low on the rent cost.

1of0iwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaintedTreeBoutiques/comments/1of0iwj/here_is_purpose_of_human_life_so_dont_seek/,"here is purpose of human life, so dont seek elsewhere","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I have no idea what to do and who to trust,"I posted this but my account got deleted so this is the updat:

Yesterday my husband was having a very important meeting with half of his subordinates as the year will end soon and our son kept pulling his arm because he wanted something from the fridge. I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post 

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs. 

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. ",1,1761319052.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

Occupation: Civil Engineer

Industry: Engineering consulting

Age: 26

Location: Seattle WA

Salary: $120K

**Section Two: ASSETS + DEBT** 

Retirement Balance: $114,000 between two 401ks and Roth IRA

Equity if you're a homeowner: N/A

Savings account balance: $110,000 in investments\* and $43,000 in a HYSA

Checking account balance: $2,500

Credit card debt: $0

Student loan debt: $0

My husband S. and I have separate finances. We have a joint credit card that we pay with a joint checking account, and every month we each transfer in half of what's needed to cover the credit card bill. While I don't know the specific numbers anymore, I know S. has more than I do when it comes to savings, investments, and retirement. His only debt is student loans through his home country's government - the interest rate is less than 1%. We'll probably combine finances some day, either when we buy property or have a kid (no plans for either any time soon).

\*My parents gifted me about $35K in stocks this year. I treat the money like it's not there and haven't touched any of it.

**Section Three: INCOME**

Main Job Monthly Take Home: $6,100 after taxes and deductions. S. is on my health insurance plan and he pays me for his half every two weeks.

S. has his own startup, and pays himself a salary of $100K. I think his monthly take home is around $5K (I don't know how their business's taxes work).

Salary Progression: I started as an entry-level civil EIT right out of college, making $60K. This was way lower than what I should've been making for a HCOL city, but I graduated in 2020 into an unstable job market so I was grateful to have had a job at all. I went from $60K to $68K to $72K to $86K to $90K over 5 years at the same company. I knew I was grossly underpaid, but I had bad imposter syndrome and felt underqualified to work anywhere else. Then when I got my PE license, I asked for a raise and was given 4%. That was my wakeup call to leave that company, so I quit in April and accepted the offer for my current job that same week.

**Section Four: REGULAR EXPENSES**

Rent: $1,650 for my half of our 2BR townhouse. This includes water, sewer, garbage, and parking. S. covers renters insurance

Utilities: $50 for electricity and gas (my half)

WiFi: $32 (my half)

Phone: Covered by parents

Transportation: I bought my used car in cash three years ago, so no payments. Insurance is $125 per month. I spend \~$120 (my half) on gas monthly

Gym: $220 for an unlimited Orangetheory membership

Apple for iCloud storage: $10

Spotify: Covered by family's phone plan

Amazon/Netflix/Hulu/Disney+: $0, all mooched off other people

NYT: $6 every 4 weeks for now

**Section Five: THE DIARY**

**Day 1: Monday**

5:30AM - Alarm goes off and I grudgingly roll out of bed. I go to Orangetheory at 6:15 most days. S. is still sleeping so I get ready for my workout in the office. 

7:20AM - Get home, shower, dress, and put on my face. S. gets up to make me coffee, and I have toast with peanut butter. Out the door by 8:09, and sadly I miss my bus by about fifteen seconds. 

8:30AM - I get settled in at my desk. I always wonder what people actually DO for work all day, so here’s my morning: check comments from the senior engineer on the drainage report I’m writing for Project #1, meet with my manager to plan out my time on Project #2 for the next two months, sit in on an all-discipline design meeting for Project #3, and organize and delegate tasks for junior staff on Project #4. I also eat second breakfast—yogurt with chia pudding, granola, and fruit—between meetings. 

12PM - I made a big batch of pasta yesterday to pack for lunches this week, but I go with my coworker to a nearby food court anyway just to get out of the office. I buy a peach iced tea to go with my pesto pasta and chicken. **$4.41**

1PM - Back at my desk for a weekly team check-in. I also have a meeting about Project #5.  After that, I finally have time to actually work, so I block out an hour each for Project #1, #2, and #6. 

4PM - I decide to finish the day at home, so I do my timesheet and pack up early. When I get back, I log on and work a bit more (Project #1) before starting dinner. Tonight’s my turn to cook, and I make Thai red curry with chicken and veggies. After dinner, I tell S. I’m craving brownies, so he starts a batch while I finish up more work (Project #4 and #6). 

8:30PM - We eat brownies and play the NYT Spelling Bee (and reach Queen Bee!). After much deliberation, I preorder my birthday cake: pistachio dacquoise, white chocolate, and cassis mousse and glaze. **$68**

10PM - S. reads while I watch some YouTube. Shower and lights out by 11. 

**Daily total: $72.41**

**Day 2: Tuesday** 

5:30AM - Orangetheory, the usual. 

7:30AM - Shower, get dressed, do my face. Peanut butter toast, pack my lunch, out the door. I have the routine down to a science, but I’m in a bit of a rush today because I need to be at my desk for an 8:30 meeting (Project #2). I miss my bus again by ten seconds - I need to learn to time this better. 

8:30AM - The morning consists of the meeting for Project #2, two meetings for Project #4, meeting for Project #5, and a meeting for Project #1. I eat second breakfast between calls. 

1PM - Lunch is the same pesto pasta and chicken, eaten at my desk. S. snuck a brownie into my lunchbox! This afternoon’s docket is Project #1, #4, and #6. #4 is becoming a real headache. I work on redlining some plans and addressing comments on a results report.

4:45PM - Pack up, timesheet, and bus back home. It’s beautiful out today so I decide to walk to get some stuff for dinner. We already did the big grocery run on Sunday, so I get frozen udon, kimchi, instant ramen (Jin is my favorite), hoisin sauce, and some tofu soup kits. **$18.56** (for my half)

6:30PM - I veg out on the couch until S. gets home from tennis. For dinner, I make steak and miso udon salad and we eat while watching Master Chef. We do the Spelling Bee (Queen Bee again!) before I log on and do more work for #4. 

10:30PM - In bed and lights out. 

**Daily total: $18.56**

**Day 3: Wednesday**

7AM - I miss my alarm!! The Orangetheory no-show fee (plus tax!) charges automatically. This is literally the first time I’ve ever missed a class and of course it’s this week. **$15.45**

8AM - And now somehow, I’m running late for work too. I’m commuting to another office location for an in-person business development meeting, so I have to drive to the park-and-ride and take the train to the office.

12PM - The meeting was three hours, but at least they provided doughnuts. I grab lunch with some coworkers after — I get a turkey pesto crepe. Lots of pesto this week. **$19.72**

1PM - I do work for Project #1, #2, and #4 while snacking on dark chocolate pretzels. By the time I look up from my laptop, it’s 5PM and I’m the last one here. I do my timesheet, pack up, take the train to my car, and drive home. S. has shawarma chicken, cucumber and tomato salad, tzatziki, and pita waiting when I walk in the door. I rant about my day while we eat. 

6:30PM - We meet up with some friends at a nearby bar for trivia. I get an apple cider sangria for my first drink and it’s delicious ($9.86). For the second round, I get a hot mulled wine and some buffalo cauliflower, but sadly both are subpar ($40.43). **$50.29**

8:30PM - We got 8th place out of 17 teams! Not too bad. Our friend convinces us all to go to another bar for jazz night and why not, it’s a Wednesday! I ask S. to order us a drink and he comes back indignant. The mango cider was FOURTEEN dollars!! Granted, it’s delicious and 9% ABV. **$7**

9:30PM - The jazz group shows up an hour late, so my friends teach me how to play hearts — turns out I’m surprisingly good. The group finally goes on and it’s Latin night, and at this point I’m a little tipsy and just bopping along to the music. Life is good. 

11PM - We get home and all I want to do is flop into bed, but I force myself to tidy the kitchen and prep lunch for tomorrow while S. finishes up his work. Lights out just before midnight. 

**Daily total: $92.46**

**Day Four: Thursday**

5:30AM - Oof, I’m feeling ROUGH. But somehow I make it to Orangetheory. 

7:30AM - Showered and ready for work. I want something a little heartier today so I make eggs and rice. S. gets up long enough to make coffee and eat some eggs before going back to bed. I miss the bus by a minute - luckily the buses come every 6 minutes, which is why I never check the schedule before I head out. 

8:30AM - Between the bus stop and my office, I almost get hit twice: first by a bus running a red light, and then by a pigeon. I have three meetings this morning, all camera off, so I have a chance to eat second breakfast during calls and update my planner.

12PM - Lunch today is spinach and cheese tortellini with tomato sauce. I try not to eat at my desk too often, but I have so much work today for Project #1, #2, and #4. Someone asks to jump on a call, but I push it back a half hour so I have time to eat my brownie. 

4PM - End of day rolls around just as I figure out how to properly adjust my chair. I pack up, do my timesheet, and head out. When I get home, S. and I share some frozen Trader Joe’s dumplings while we catch up on two Spelling Bees.

6PM - It’s technicallyyy S.’s turn to cook but he’s working late, so I make the tofu soup kits I picked up on Tuesday and add zucchini, broccoli, frozen pork belly, and ramen. Unconventional, but it’s hot and tasty and filling. We watch Master Chef while we eat, and then veg out for a long time.

9PM - I put away laundry that’s been sitting in the dryer since Sunday, and note how stretched and worn some of my underwear has gotten. Aerie is having buy 4 get 4 free on their underwear, so I pick out 8 pairs plus some boxers for sleeping. **$56.05**

10:30PM - I make the executive decision to not work out tomorrow morning.

**Daily total: $56.05**

**Day Five: Friday**

7:30AM - It feels glorious to sleep in, and even better to know that my commute is one room over. I change into sweatpants and have a bowl of (stale) cereal. I get to have my coffee in a real mug instead of a travel tumbler today, so S. decides to attempt some latte foam art. It’s beautiful to me.

9AM - Log on late today and get started on work. Because I worked extra at the beginning of this week, I technically should only work until 2PM today to bill 40 hours on my timesheet. But I have a sneaking suspicion today will be a full day. I discuss upcoming tasks for Project #5 with my manager, mark up some redlines for #6, and work on the report for #1. 

12PM - Lunch is a medley of leftovers: Thai curry with brown rice, shawarma chicken, and the last of the cucumber salad. I also set out a bowl of maple kettle corn and we share the last brownie. We do the Spelling Bee over lunch (third Queen Bee of the week! This is unprecedented). 

5:30PM - As predicted, I’ve spent all afternoon finalizing the drainage report for Project #1 (QC is supposed to start on Monday). But I still enter it as 40 hours and submit my timesheet. I send some materials over to the senior engineer to review and take a break for dinner. We meet up with my parents and brothers and, as it usually is with my mom, we order too much. We get multiple bowls of hand-pulled noodles, beef noodle soup, wontons, soup dumplings, and scallion pancakes. My parents pay.

8PM - Once we get home, I log back on and start addressing comments the senior sent back over. S. tidies the house and finishes some work. I finally get the report out and we reconvene to watch Master Chef, and go to bed early. 

**Daily total: $0**

**Day Six: Saturday**

8:30AM - I’m going to look at a car this morning and I don't want to go alone, so my dad picks me and S. up to head to the dealership. We stop for coffee and pastries on the way, and my dad pays. I pay for his parking though, since he doesn't have the app. **$0.50**

10AM - I liked the car, but the dealership wasn’t willing to negotiate on price at all, so I pass. I’ve been shopping for cars on and off for a while now. Mine is technically running, but she’s a high-maintenance gas guzzler and I’ve put so much money into repairs in the last year. I’m looking for something more reliable with cheaper upkeep, and hybrid. 

11AM - I eat leftovers for an early lunch while we do the Spelling Bee. The forecasted rain is late, so S. and I go for a bike ride. We do a 13 mile loop and head home just as the rain starts, excellent timing.

2PM - I decide we’re going to break tradition and do our weekly grocery shop today instead of Sunday. We take turns cooking dinner, so this is next week’s menu: 

* Spaghetti, turkey meatballs, and arugula salad (S.)
* Maple Brussel sprouts, baked chicken drumsticks, and wild rice (me, the wild rice was not good)
* Crispy chicken thighs, beets, potatoes, and red-wine poached pears (S.) 
* Pork and veggie stir fry with noodles (me)
* Miso salmon, garlic green beans, and couscous (S.)
* Bulgolgi beef bowls with kimchi, cucumbers, and edamame (me)

I get a salad kit, chicken tenders, and ravioli for work lunches, and we also buy fruit, pantry staples like chicken broth and onions, some quick frozen meals, and assorted snacks. **$75.81** (for my half)

3PM - At home, we eat tinned sardines on crackers for a snack, and what's left of this morning's blueberry scone. It’s a weird food day. I meant to get some reading in (recently started *Katabasis*), but I end up lounging around on the couch while S. vacuums and tidies the house. He does another mini grocery run at a local store for his specialty yogurt and some other things. **$18.12** (my half)

6PM - I’m not going to lie — I’ve been on the couch and on my phone all afternoon, alternating between shopping for handbags and looking up flights for a potential Europe trip next spring. S. makes pasta and meatballs (we forgot to get spaghetti!) with salad, and we eat while watching more Master Chef. He leaves for his tennis match, and I remain on the couch.

8PM - Okay, time to get up. I clean the kitchen and start my Dutch homework. I’m enrolled in a Dutch language class that meets every weekend. Ideally, we’re supposed to practice at least half an hour per night, but I’ve been falling behind. I snack on maple kettle corn (Trader Joe's seasonal item, it's dangerously addicting).

10PM - S. texts that he'll be home late from tennis, so I do my skincare and get into bed. I notice that he tidied my nightstand and untangled the necklace that's been there for a week.

**Daily total: $94.43**

**Day Seven: Sunday**

9:30AM - S. is on a call for work, so I make my own coffee and get on the call for my Dutch class.

11:30AM - After class, I have tortellini and leftover soup for lunch. The weather is unexpectedly nice and S. wants to go to the farmers market. We end up buying a half dozen fresh mini doughnuts ($3.50), some bagels ($13.24), and potatoes ($5.18, all these are on the shared card). I also buy two bottles of cider for my upcoming birthday party ($24). **$34.96**

2PM - S. and I decide to do one of our favorite lazy afternoon activities: open houses. This was one of our top date activities when we first got together. We drive to a nice neighborhood and pull up Redfin. The first house we see has weirdly low ceilings but an absolutely gorgeous backyard, complete with a deck and fire pit, for a paltry $1.5 million. The second house is a townhouse with dark wood baseboards that aren't really speaking to me.

4PM - My friends pick me up to go grocery shopping. We're doing hotpot at my house tonight, so we need to get ingredients. At the first grocery store, we get pork belly, bok choy, bean curd, various types of tofu, mushrooms, quail eggs, hotpot soup base and dipping sauce, soju, and egg tarts for dessert ($63.87, I pay and we'll divvy it up). At the second store, we get beef, more mushrooms, fresh noodles, 2 pounds of assorted fishballs, and lychee beer ($59.33). I also get some groceries separately: instant Vietnamese coffee, frozen pho meatballs, and churro-flavored Turtle Chips ($26.95). **$26.95**

7PM - Hotpot time! S. has the table set and ready by the time we get back. We eat almost everything and are absolutely stuffed. I divide the total by four and it’s so much more affordable than what we would’ve paid at a restaurant. **$30.80**

9PM - After everyone leaves, S. and I debrief on the dinner conversation. We do a Spelling Bee and watch some Master Chef before bed.

**Daily total: $92.71**

**Section Six: THE BREAKDOWN**

Food + Drink: $229.33

Fun / Entertainment: $125.29 (birthday cake is counted here)

Home + Health: $0

Clothes + Beauty: $56.05

Transport: $0.50

Other: $15.45

**Total Spend: $426.62**

**REFLECTION**

I already track my expenses almost daily (I'm more of a tracker than a budgeter) so I would say this week is atypical but not extraordinary in terms of spending. Obviously I'm not buying a birthday cake every week, but there's always these $50-100 ""irregular"" expenses that pop up and the only thing that changes is the category it's in. I will say that since starting my new job a few months ago, I've started to notice myself succumbing a little bit to lifestyle creep. To name a few things: I buy the fancy granola from our local grocery, I splurge on my Orangetheory membership (still mad about that fee), I cover for my friends here and there when we go out, and I started shopping at Everlane. And knowing that I'll likely be purchasing a new car soon, this is all something I'll need to keep an eye on.

I also usually don't work this much - it fluctuates up and down, and that's just the reality of consulting.",8,1761318799.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,7,0.83,False

1of08tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/contentcreation/comments/1of08tj/my_content_workflow_is_now_faster_than_grabbing/,My content workflow is now faster than grabbing coffee,"It takes me seven minutes to create and publish a LinkedIn post. That's faster than walking to Starbucks and waiting for my order.

Here's my entire workflow: I open LinkedIn on my laptop. I write whatever I'm thinking about, usually 150-250 words. Takes about five minutes. Then I click my browser extension for Looktara, type a quick description of the vibe I want (""professional but approachable"" or ""serious and contemplative""), and it generates a matching photo in five seconds. I add it to my post, review everything once, and hit publish.

Seven minutes total. Often less.

Compare this to my old workflow: Write post in Google Docs. Edit for 20 minutes. Overthink it for another 10 minutes. Realize I need a photo. Spend 15 minutes scrolling through old photos trying to find something relevant. Settle for something that doesn't quite match. Download it, crop it, upload to LinkedIn. Format the post. Second-guess everything. Maybe post, maybe save as draft and never publish.

Old workflow: 60+ minutes and 40% of posts never went live. New workflow: 7 minutes and 100% publish rate.

The difference isn't that I got faster at writing. I write at the same speed. The difference is I removed all the friction and decision points that used to derail me.

[Looktara](http://looktara.com) specifically solved the photo problem, which was my biggest friction point. But the principle applies to everything in content creation. Find your slowest, most frustrating step and either eliminate it or make it so fast it doesn't matter.

For me that was photos. For you it might be ideation, editing, design, or something else. But until you identify and fix your specific bottleneck, you'll stay slow no matter how much you optimize everything else.

Speed matters in content creation because it determines volume, and volume over time is what builds audience. I can now publish 20 posts in the time it used to take me to publish 5. That 4x multiplier compounds into followers, engagement, opportunities, revenue.

Fast systems beat slow systems. Build for speed.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

That's faster than walking to Starbucks and waiting for my order.

Here's my entire workflow: I open LinkedIn on my laptop. I write whatever I'm thinking about, usually 150-250 words. Takes about five minutes. Then I click my browser extension for [Looktara](http://looktara.com), type a quick description of the vibe I want (""professional but approachable"" or ""serious and contemplative""), and it generates a matching photo in five seconds. I add it to my post, review everything once, and hit publish.

Seven minutes total. Often less.

Compare this to my old workflow: Write post in Google Docs. Edit for 20 minutes. Overthink it for another 10 minutes. Realize I need a photo. Spend 15 minutes scrolling through old photos trying to find something relevant. Settle for something that doesn't quite match. Download it, crop it, upload to LinkedIn. Format the post. Second-guess everything. Maybe post, maybe save as draft and never publish.

Old workflow: 60+ minutes and 40% of posts never went live. New workflow: 7 minutes and 100% publish rate.

The difference isn't that I got faster at writing. I write at the same speed. The difference is I removed all the friction and decision points that used to derail me.

Looktara specifically solved the photo problem, which was my biggest friction point. But the principle applies to everything in content creation. Find your slowest, most frustrating step and either eliminate it or make it so fast it doesn't matter.

For me that was photos. For you it might be ideation, editing, design, or something else. But until you identify and fix your specific bottleneck, you'll stay slow no matter how much you optimize everything else.

Speed matters in content creation because it determines volume, and volume over time is what builds audience. I can now publish 20 posts in the time it used to take me to publish 5. That 4x multiplier compounds into followers, engagement, opportunities, revenue.

Some days I manage it, some days I fall short. Working from home in a startup makes it difficult. Still, my average went from 7,000 steps in August to 10,500 in September. Here is what helped me the most 👇

**Morning walk before the shower**  
Thirty minutes every weekday. It wakes me up, helps me sleep better, and has replaced my morning coffee. Pallie helped a lot here. It suggested new nearby routes and, on rainy days, gently reminded me about my treadmill. No decisions, just go out or walk indoors if needed.

**Short evening walk when possible**  
I tell myself, *“Just fifteen minutes.”* Once I start, I keep going and often walk much longer.  
What surprised me was that Pallie noticed when I had a tough day. Instead of pushing, it sometimes suggested rest or a slower plan for the next morning. That small empathy made a big difference ❤️!

**Walking pad during meetings**  
I move slowly while on calls and easily add two thousand extra steps.  
Pallie noticed my online meetings in Google Calendar and started suggesting short walking sessions during them. When I told it about my walking pad, it remembered and began cheering me for using it.

**tl;dr** Simple walks, less decision fatigue, and thoughtful support from Pallie helped me make walking a natural part of my day.

1of03s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeSpills/comments/1of03s8/16_study_tips_for_college/,16 Study Tips for College,"# First, Focus on Preparation.

# 1. Organization is key!

First and foremost, make sure you get a college planner. This can be a planner with a creative design, a plain notebook, a wall calendar, or even a small dry erase calendar for your desk that changes each month. A wall calendar or desk calendar is best for double-checking appointments, events, and due dates while a notebook planner of some sort will be best for planning on-the-go, wherever you are. This planner will keep you in check when you’re in class or in a meeting with your advisor. 

If digital works better for you (since you can sync it with just about anything – your computer, phone, tablet), think about setting up an agenda on your mobile device. You can set up reminders for test dates, department events, study times, and assignment due dates. Additionally, you can create a study outline on your device in something like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or another digital format that works for you.

# 2. Plan Ahead

Create a study plan at the beginning of the semester based on your course syllabus. Ideally, you should study a little bit every day throughout the week —even just 20 minutes can make a huge difference—so you don’t wind up cramming and stressing out right before the big exam.

# 3. Take Good Notes

Studying starts in the classroom. Pay attention and take good notes, so when you’re studying later, you’re just reviewing information (instead of learning it for the first time). Speak with your professor about recording lectures on your phone. A recording can complement your notes so you can go back and re-listen to the information in case there are other details you pick up on later to note. Effective note-taking strategies can have a direct impact on your study habits and is one of the most important study tips for college.

# 4. Find a Routine

Getting yourself into a study routine is one of the best ways to make sure that studying becomes a part of your everyday habit. Figure out what time of day works best for you and make a real effort to dedicate that time to reviewing notes, videos, and other related resources.

Pick times during the week to try out your studying. You can try studying in the morning on one day, the afternoon another day, and in the evening if that works best for you when there are no distractions at the end of the night. Once you’ve decided which time works best for you, try to stick with that time of day every day (or at least 3 days a week) to get in the habit of studying consistently. You might wind up rearranging your routine due to extracurricular activities, time with friends, and other commitments, but be sure to prioritize your studies and get them done in one way or another.

# Teamwork is Essential

# 5. Study with Friends

Encouraging friends to study with you can make everything more fun and productive! Ask your classmates to study with you at a certain time and location. For example, you can ask your biology colleagues to study with you after class for an hour at the school cafe. You can set up your computers at a table together and grab some snacks and coffee to enjoy the time. 

The same goes for studying with your friends. If you’re not in a class with them, studying together in-person can help you hold each other accountable. When you make plans with friends, you don’t want to be *that person* who cancels or doesn’t show, right?

# 6. Ask for Help!

If you really don’t understand a concept, ask questions! Stop by your professors’ offices during their office hours, or contact classmates and professors via email. Some classes might even have a Facebook Group to keep students engaged and to create an environment to ask questions outside of class. Either way, your professors will be on your side – nonjudgmental, wanting to help you understand the class in its entirety.

# 7. Teach Someone!

Teaching a friend, family member, or even your pet the material is a great way to see how well you know it! When you explain it to someone else, you’ll have a better grasp of which information you already have mastered and which information you should revisit for yourself. 

You can create a fun PowerPoint or  Google Slides presentation, get creative and present the information in a way that’s easy for you and your audience to understand. Who knows – you might even use that presentation in the future for your classmates!

# Create an Ambiance

# 8. Switch Up Your Study Spots

Studying in the same spot can get tedious, so why not mix it up and get a new perspective on things? College campuses have tons of study spots for students—from the library to the campus lawn to local cafes (think back to studying with friends and finding an area to set up for an hour or for the day). Take advantage of these study areas, both indoors and outdoors, and give yourself a new view every day!

# 9. Eliminate Distractions

Studying without distractions is crucial. If you’re studying alone, try to find a quiet space or put headphones in to block out noise from your surroundings. If you’re in an area trying to study and it’s just not working out, relocate. It might be frustrating to have to pick up and move, but it will be worth it once you’re in a good environment. 

Consider putting your phone on silent or vibrate too – you can always respond to your messages after your study session!

# How to Approach Studying

# 10. Don’t Cram

While it may seem like a good idea to learn an entire semester’s worth of information in one night, it’s not an effective study habit, and it can cause a lot of unnecessary stress. Instead, study a little bit of information every day for at least 20 – 30 minutes. You’ll likely remember more later and you’ll feel calm and prepared when it comes to exam time.

# 11. Memorize vs. Understand

One of the study tips for college that can make a massive difference in how you approach new information is knowing the difference between memorizing the material and understanding it. Memorizing information isn’t actually learning the information—it’s just helping you learn how to repeat it during a finite time. 

For example, if you’re studying for a Spanish exam and you’re memorizing a conjugated verb chart, remembering what the verbs look like in written form will help you remember the information for that exam. However, you might forget the meanings of the verbs and how to use them in a sentence afterward since it’s a very specific way of studying. This may catch up with you when you take the next level up of Spanish.

# 12. Review and Reorganize Your Notes

Whether you’re using a notebook, a laptop, or good old-fashioned flashcards, reviewing each line of your notes helps ensure that you hit all the right information you reviewed in class and might even remind you of a few things you would have missed otherwise. It’s good to review notes shortly after class, and then again a few days later. This allows you to take a break between edits and come back to the information with a fresh perspective.

# 13. Study Smarter, Not Harder

Occasionally, college professors will tell you the information that will (or won’t) be on an exam—listen to them! They’re sharing this information with you to save you time so you’re not studying the wrong information for hours, and you can focus on the important points. If you’re unsure about what to focus on while studying, send your professor a quick email to confirm or speak with him or her after class.

# Keep Your Cool

# 14. Use the Reward System

Studying can be draining, so treat yourself for a little motivation. Buy a coffee from your favorite coffee shop or get some study snacks from the campus convenience store. You can also reward yourself by taking breaks for activities you enjoy, like walking, reading, or watching TV. Adding in a reward will give you something fun to work towards.

# 15. Take Breaks

Continuing from the previous point, taking breaks is important. Breaks give you a boost of productivity, reset, and prevent burnout. It might seem like you need to use all the time you possibly can to study, back-to-back, but your brain will start to slow down if you don’t give it a chance to relax. Taking breaks can help you get the most out of your study time with the least amount of stress.

# 16. Be Confident About Your Studies

It might be easy to fall into a trap of stressing yourself out while you’re studying, but that will be counterintuitive in the big picture. You can control when you study and how you study to help prepare you for your exams. After that, you have to be confident and try your best to retain the information. Believing in yourself and trusting that you’ve got this can help you forget about the stress and focus on moving forward.",1,1761318113.0,CollegeSpills,0,1.0,False

Email received is below. 




Happy Autumn, I hope this letter finds you well! I have some very exciting news to share with all of you.



After 46 years, I am ready to retire! This comes with loads of mixed emotions.



I must share that I have sold the business to a wonderful woman named Dima Easterday. She has been a customer at Rostov’s Coffee & Tea for many years. She loves the shop and wants to keep it moving forward with the same name and same feeling of community. Dima and I have been working to make the transition a smooth one, and some of you have already met her.



This business has been more than a job for me over all these years. Having been raised in the business by my single father, it feels like a part of the family, which means all of you are my cousins!



I know the word humble creeps into most of my correspondence, but it is a true word to me! My life would not have been as wonderful and fulfilled if you all did not humble me with the acceptance, warmth, kind words and showing up when things were not always easy!



My co-workers that have filled the shop everyday for the last 46 years deserve a big thank you for keeping me on task and making the store experience welcoming and amiable.



We have gone through a lot together: a name change, the passing of my father, a move, a recession (or 3), and a pandemic. And yet you all stuck with me. Humbling! And so many celebrations! You all have included me in your most personal moments, weddings, births of babies, graduations, and some of you have taken me with you when you moved far away.



My partner, Robert, and I have big plans for our retirement. We want to travel to places we have never been. After some of you have shared your travel stories, my list has grown! But don’t worry, I will never be far away. I am going to stay in Richmond, my home.



Thank you to all of you for sharing this part of my life with me, showing me what community and belonging feels like! You have humbled me!

1of023h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukstartups/comments/1of023h/looking_for_a_ukbased_cofounder_for/,Looking for a UK-Based Co-Founder for Automotive-Focused IT Business,"I'm the founder of an IT services business that’s focuses on the automotive industry. I’m looking for a co-founder to help me take this business to market. 

**The Backstory** 

I’ve spent over 20 years in enterprise IT, 70% of my career is within automotive. I’ve worked with major players like Motorpoint, Pendragon, and Sytner, building everything from auction platforms, major customer facing websites, finance proposal systems, and integrations with lenders like Black Horse and Evolution Funding. I know the space inside out — not just the tech, but the sales side and more importantly how finance works. In the UK, without finance there would be no industry – its the life blood of automotive. 

In addition to just offering services, I also built an Enterprise search platform called S2Search which was designed purely for the automotive industry. Think of vehicle search but on steroids. S2Search will be ready for market in the next month – I'm using the time I have between contracts to refine and update it. It’s designed to improve vehicle search UX, support multiple data formats (AutoTrader, Motors, etc.), and track every user interaction into an insights dashboard which can be used by decision makes and buyers as business intelligence to help make informed stock buying decisions.

At the end of 2021, I left my full-time role to start this business. At that time I had a business partner who I had known for many years and worked with at previous jobs. He was technical like me. We were working together at the same place where i got him the job. we'd agreed to go into business together and then resign in December 2021 and start it January 2022, new year new business. But when it came down to it, he just didn't have the balls. Hes still had the same job I got him. 

**The Journey So Far** 

I started with about £24k in savings and spent the first couple of months trying to drum up business on LinkedIn. But, I’m not a sales guy. My background is in enterprise IT, architecture, and delivery. I’ve worked with stakeholders, product owners, C-suite and led teams, but I’ve never done cold outreach or Business development. 

After two months of trying to generate leads and burning through cash at £2k a month for mortgage bills, etc , and with my co-founder still not resigning and starting to ghost me, I pivoted. I picked up contract work — and it was boom times. I landed multiple contracts and earned more than I ever had before. After 3 months from resigning from my full-time job i was making 4x per month than i was previously. So at that stage for me it was mission accomplished. None of the contracts were related to the business which wasn't ideal, but the money was, so that carried me through the last few years. One of the contracts i got was because of the experience i had with enterprise search due to the experience of building S2Search, but now those contracts have ended, and I’m ready to refocus on the business. 

**What are the goals** 

I want to secure work from the industry I'm targeting – i.e. automotive. However, i do know that as a single tech only founder, that will be a struggle without a co-founder that has skills in business development, marketing and sales. I also want to bring S2Search to market – so the business can offer services, and it also has a product. 

**What I’m Looking For** 

I’m looking for someone who: 

Has business development, marketing, sales, experience ideally in automotive or the automotive finance industry 

Understands the automotive industry and sees the opportunity here 

Is UK-based — ideally somewhere central so we can meet regularly – I’ve been remote for five years now in what I call my “luxury prison.” I’m done with remote. I want to collaborate face-to-face, build together, and succeed together. 

**Why This Matters** 

My view is that there’s a real gap in the market for IT professionals who truly understand automotive. I’ve built the tech, I know the industry, and I’ve got the vision. But I need someone who can help bring this to market — both the services and the platform. 

If you’re someone who’s got the experience, and the belief that this industry is ripe for innovation, let’s talk. I’m open to meeting up, grabbing a coffee, and seeing if we click.

I took and passed my 6 yesterday. Here is some info on my experience. My firm provided me with Training Consultants. I have some mixed feelings about their materials. The info is pretty dry, but I'm not sure that can be avoided. I read the whole book, took notes, watched the videos, used Chat GPT when something didn't make sense, took more notes, and then took the chapter quizzes. They tell you to do them closed book, but I took them open book. I feel the quizzes are more of a chance to learn material than to test my knowledge. So if a question came up, I went to that part of the book and found the answer and the why behind it. That worked for me, but do what works for you. Once I did all the chapters, I did the benchmark final. Again, open-book and learned a lot about my weaknesses from the exam. For some reason, they do not let you see what you got wrong or right on the benchmark which is dumb in my opinion. Also, the Training Consultants index is trash for looking stuff up. I actually created my own index, it was so bad. Then I re-listened to every chapter at 1.4 or 1.7 speed while reviewing my notes, and then moved on to the finals. I again took them open-book.

While I was running through the finals, I was listening to Series 7 Guru and Ken Finnen (huge thanks to them for their videos, they do a great job of hitting the highlights and keeping me engaged, even on the 8th listen), mostly their ""night before"" videos but I did listen to some of their specific topics that I did not feel overly strong about. I also watched about 4 or 5 passmaters test videos and they were pretty good too. I also created a sheet of stuff that I kept mixing up in my head (IRA taxes, VAs, records rules, some of the retail communications rules). I also created a dump sheet with about 5 formulas, anagrams that I developed.

Exam day, got a good night's sleep, well, a good night for me. Had breakfast and coffee and headed to the testing center. I had to travel about 80 minutes to the center, so I was able to listen to Dean and Ken's videos one last time. Started the test, and the very first question punched me in the face. I am 99% sure it was one of the experimental questions, because I had no clue. For about 3 minutes, I let it get the best of me. I closed my eyes and made the deliberate decision to let it go, and it worked. As I progressed through the test, I felt very uneasy about a lot of the questions, like a lot of them. I kept chugging through them and when I finished number 55, I felt like a pass was going to be a coin flip. I then went back through to review the questions and answers, starting at number 2, question number 1 can go F itself. As I was going through each question, I kept having the thoughts (with legitimate justification) ""this feels right"" and ""yeah this looks good"". To be honest, after my review, I felt like really good, close to 100%) about 45 of the questions and on 9, I felt like I was able to narrow it down to 2 ""could be's"". When I was ready to hit ""finish,"" I knew without a shadow of a doubt it was going to be a pass, which was an amazing feeling and such an opposite of first studying a topic and thinking ""what the hell does this mean"".

I had very minimal experience in this arena prior to the SIE/S6, and if I can do it, so can you. It will take some sacrifice, have a plan, and prioritize that plan. Find those ""time wasters"" in your life and put them on the shelf, maybe that means deleting an APP, not re-bingeing the office for the 7th time, or letting friends know you cannot be as present as normal, but you will be back, they will still be there in a couple of weeks.

Big thanks again to Dean and Ken, leverage their expertise, but use their videos as a supplement and put in the work with the book yourself.

I [22] had found this phrase very relevant to my current situation. There's a woman [22] I like with the same age as me and I think we are also one of those people who hadn't been to any love relationships. I had known this based on the posts and notes she shares on soc med. Anyways I had many attempts on trying to make a conversation with her through chats on IG and she's really hard to communicate with, its like that girl who's not interested at you at all but still replies out of sympathy? idk actually but I'd still talk to her as long as she didnt specifically told me to stop, I mean I like her so I gotta endure the fact that she isnt interested and its my part to make her so. 

One day she replies a little faster like maybe a minute to 5min, then I casually sneaked the words to ask her out on a date because she said she was sleeping all day and stayed home for months after grad. My heart beats faster than it had ever been as she said that its okay and we can go grab a coffee and meet. I was overjoyed and got excited I even told her that I was nervous fr (how lame) and she said ""why, we can be friends"" and those words were like a bucket of cold water doused on me out of that excitement but I collected myself and continued the conversation but this time with a bit of pride and seriousness to appear reliable and charming. 

We met inside the mall and found a coffee shop there so I bought us a coffee and pancake and talk like I had never ever before until ran out of topic, awkward stares then ensues as she suddenly reach out for her bag and took out a building block pikachu (thank God she did!) and took an hour or so. before she got to in the vehicle I ask her at the last minute that if I'd ever see her again, then she answered ""maybe if me/you are free"" I'm glad she didn't say no. 

Second date would be the cinemas, we planned to watch a drama and this time I thought it would be a little better since I can take her out with a motorcycle. Anyways the date went well as we took pictures (selfies and mirror shot) and she even post me on her stories even though it was just our feet, but its fine a post is a post. 

The 3rd date is a coffee shop again but a little far and a seaside overlooking  the sunset. I guess she was a little excited too since the fit she wore that day suits her so much she so beautiful! I panicked as she suddenly appears at the side where I didn't expect. On that day coincidentally her guy friends was there on a celebration and invited us to join them he specifically says that to bring your ""boyfriend"" here and eat but we didnt, we enjoyed our time together, though unfortunately the clouds gathered and rain comes with it albeit lightly but we still missed the view. The odds were against me as even the dinner failed as the kitchen can't be used at night since the bar beside the coffee shop(cafe and bar shop same owner) will be using it. We waited till the rain stops and find another resto so we can eat but along the way the rain was getting stronger so I made her use the single raincoat I have and decided to drive her home as I felt so ashamed for it. I didnt mind the cold I only thought of getting her home and rid myself out of this shame, Gladly we reached to her home safe but her shoes was wet. 

After every date we had, we barely talk through chats for a bit and sleep. the following days would be silent until I ask her out again but just right last week when I asked her if we can go have dinner she refused and said she about to have study sessions to prepare for board exam and its a valid reason and truthfull as I checked the schedule of the sessions. Even so I still found a way to see her even if its just for a moment. I asked her if she can go out her home at 5pm just accros the street because there's something I want to give to her, and she agreed. I was full of hope, that week (last wk) was really busy as my final thesis defense is coming up on the same day my appointment with her. when the day came up at 4am I was awake and was writing a letter for her, right after that at 9am I scourged the City of flower shops so I can buy her flowers and make a bouqet of it (I wanted it to be genuine so I decided to make it myself) I finished my preparations at 12pm and gone back home to get ready for defense later at 3pm. I know time is really tight lol but I need to make it work, I hope that by giving flowers to her it would change or get her interest (like we talking through phone or maybe call or we update each other) for real this time so I really made effort. we was still not done by 5pm and there was still 3 groups that would go first before us so by 6pm I sneaked out and drove right over to her house sneaked the letter and a hair clip flower designed and gave it to her as I wore my suit with a stressed face (I forgot to wash my face before going as I was thinking of one thing) I thought it was perfect. I bared the embarrassment standing outside as I waited for her to come, she did and I gave it awkwardly she askes what was the flowers for, I answered ""nothing I just thought about giving you some"" and said goodbye and rode back to the university like nothing happened, eventually she posted it on her stories and even her mom found out about he letter lol. 

Still I hoped my feelings would go through but so far this time we are not talking, she didnt reply to my chat (ignored), she liked a story of mine a day ago with me on it once, but idk what it means, im still waiting till now that's why I wrote this long ass story hoping you could help me decide what to do. 

My opinion on her side tho is that maybe she also have a hard time comitting because like me she never had any relationships, I also treat women like that to those im not interested with like just playing along but I stated my truth to them that I am not interested and I didnt date them just to be clear.

So I have been struggling with low calorie, high protein chocolate creami for the past two months. But today, finally made a good one! (The bottom jar) 


Recipe: 
Low-fat milk 0.5 cup
Water 2 cups
Erythritol 3 tbsp
Inulin 1 tbsp
Xanthum Gum 1 tsp
Collagen powder 10 gm
70% dark chocolate 50 gm (I will use less next time because of calories)
Salt 1/4 tsp but i think I might have added more, went by taste, didn't measure salt. 
Chocolate Whey Protein Powder - 02 scoops

Method: 
- Simmer the milk and water together. 
- Take it off the heat and chopped chocolate and let it sit for a minute to let the chocolate melt.
- Add Inulin, xanthum gum and collagen powder. Stir them in.
- Add salt, protein powder and coffee (if you want to deepen the flavour, I only added a pinch because I am not supposed to consume coffee currently). 
- Use and immersion blender and blend to make ensure a uniform mix. 
- Freeze and process as usual on lite icecream. 

I have a deluxe and one full deluxe pint makes 4 servings for me. 

Surprisingly the texture is amazing and it tastes so rich and decadent.....I was finally able to satisfy my chocolate icecream craving! 

I don't think Xanthum gum did anything though. Will have to try next batch without it to be sure.

1oezsir,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCaliforniaMovers/comments/1oezsir/downsizing_checklist_before_moving_to_a/,Downsizing Checklist Before Moving to a California Apartment,"Transitioning from a spacious house to a California apartment requires thoughtful downsizing. With proper planning, you can create a functional, organized living space without the stress.

**Start Early:** Begin downsizing at least 2-3 months before your move. Working in 20-30-minute time blocks prevents overwhelm and leads to better decisions than last-minute panic purging. Tackle one room completely before moving to the next to build momentum.​

**Measure Everything:** Take measurements of each room in your new apartment and create a floor plan. Measure your current furniture to determine what will actually fit. This prevents the emotional difficulty of deciding what to keep only to discover it won't fit through the door.​

**Category-Based Sorting:** Instead of going room by room, declutter by category—gather all books, clothes, or electronics in one place and sort together. This shows you exactly how much you have and makes paring down easier. Set up labeled bins for ""keep,"" ""donate,"" ""sell,"" and ""toss"" in each area.​

**Prioritize Multi-Purpose Items:** Space-saving furniture becomes essential in apartment living. Keep wall desks, coffee tables that double as storage, and drop-leaf dining tables. Vertical storage solutions like shelving units maximize your limited square footage.​

**The One-Year Rule:** If you haven't used an item in the past year, you probably won't miss it. This applies especially to clothes, kitchen gadgets, and hobby items collecting dust.​

**Digitize Ruthlessly:** Scan important documents and save them securely online. Digitize old photographs to preserve memories while eliminating physical clutter. Shred unnecessary papers and recycle outdated stationery.​

**Focus on Essentials:** Prioritize items you use regularly or that hold genuine sentimental value. Embrace minimalist principles—light, neutral colors help small spaces feel larger.",1,1761317410.0,BestCaliforniaMovers,0,1.0,False

My sweet boy is 3 weeks now - he’s been a pretty good sleeper from the get go, but falling asleep has been a huge struggle for him. We had to rock him for 1-2 hours while he screamed his head off. We tried different positions, white noise, brown noise, co-sleeping, sleeping on our chest, carrier, crib, bassinet, walking around, rocking chair, different swaddles, arms in/out, nothing has made falling asleep easier for him and he’d cry himself to sleep every day. 
We rented the Snoo as a last resort, set it up yesterday, placed him in it at his regular bedtime, pressed the button and he just… fell asleep? It took roughly 5 minutes, he didn’t even want his paci (which he’s normally obsessed with), and slept for 10 hours total only waking up once to eat. After he was done with his bottle, he fell asleep again within minutes.
This morning was the ultimate test - his 1st nap of the day has always been terrible. He would fight sleep, scream, all while being very visibly tired. I once again placed him in the Snoo, and raced to brush my teeth knowing I had maybe 1-2 minutes before the screaming started - spoiler alert, it didn’t lol. By the time I was done, he was out. No screaming, no fussing. I was able to get ready for the day and drink my coffee warm for the first time since he was born.

I spent way too much time in my early start-up days chasing shiny new features. ""Let's build X!"" ""Users want Y!"" And sure, features are important. But I consistently overlooked something so fundamental, it makes me cringe looking back: **terrible error handling.**

Seriously, have you ever shipped an update, fixed a critical bug, only to have two more pop up elsewhere? It feels like an endless game of whack-a-mole 😩, right? I used to think it was just part of the dev journey. But for a startup, it's actually a silent killer for growth.

We're all obsessing over the next big thing, the next amazing feature. But we're completely ignoring a massive, gaping hole in our ""growth bucket"": when things inevitably go wrong, our software just... breaks.

Let me give you an analogy that really hit home for me:  
Imagine you're craving that perfect latte from your favorite coffee shop. Their machine is incredible, makes the best coffee. But one day, the sugar dispenser jams. Instead of a little screen saying ""Oops, out of sugar! Try again later or maybe a black coffee today?"", it just goes blank. Crashes. You're confused. The barista is frustrated. You probably just leave without coffee.

That's exactly what poor error handling does in your software. Instead of a helpful message, a smooth fallback, or even just telling the user what happened... it just explodes. Users get stuck. They get frustrated. They leave. And worse, they tell their friends. They probably won't come back.

Here's the painful reality I learned:  
Every time your user hits an unexpected snag, and your software throws some generic, cryptic ""Error 500"" message... **you're not just losing a potential sale. You're actively eroding trust. You're damaging your relationship with that user.**

You're basically shrugging your shoulders and saying: ""Figure it out yourself, buddy! Good luck!""

This isn't about avoiding all bugs (that's impossible!). It's about how you react when they happen. Are you building a system that can gracefully handle its own mistakes, or one that leaves users stranded?

# My (hard-won) Simple Fix for User Retention:

Stop building on quicksand. Focus on these foundational practices:

1. **Anticipate the Mess:** Before coding, take 10 minutes to brainstorm: What could possibly go wrong here? Network issues, invalid inputs, third-party API downtimes, user permissions. Map out the ugly scenarios.
2. **Guide, Don't Just Crash:** If an error occurs, the user needs two things:
   * **What happened?** (in plain language, not dev-speak)
   * **What can they do about it?** (""Your internet seems disconnected, please check your connection and try again"" or ""Payment failed, please verify your card details or try another method."")
3. **Log Everything (Intelligently):** Implement solid logging and monitoring. You need to know what broke, when, and where without users having to tell you. This lets you be proactive.

Good error handling isn't a fancy feature; it's your unsung hero for keeping users. It's the difference between a one-time visitor and a loyal advocate. I wish I'd prioritized this from Day 1.

Want to build software that users genuinely stick with? Start by making sure it can handle its own mistakes with grace. Otherwise, you're just inadvertently creating an exit ramp for every customer who runs into a bump.

**So, what are your personal horror stories about bad error handling, either as a user or a builder? Or what's one graceful error you're proud of? Let's hear it! 👇**",1,1761317276.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

Also had a mini thumb keyboard from iPazzport with built in track pad for light (but faster vs SW KB) typing duties while I worked from my couch. 

It wasn't perfect, but absolutely usable for my needs as a multi window mobile work setup away from my desk. I just hate the form factor of the non removable hard strap - as I want something with this level of lens and display combo that can fit in my shoulder sling like my XREAL One Pros. HTC could just re-release their Vive XR Elite headset with these 4k OLEDs and get my money again - because that headset had unmatched portability if you remove the back strap and put it in glasses mode. 

Started with a GeForceNow flat gaming session for some non VR Steam games and switched between Xbox wireless gamepad and Turtle Beach Atom controllers. I'm close to the GFN servers so very little noticeable latency. I made the game window larger than my 83"" OLED that I sit 10ft away from. I have an Ultimate account that has RTX5080 GPUs to play on. They just need to make the GFN android client support HDR and game resolution was stuck at 1080p (runs at 4K@60hz w HDR on my Shield). I'll test SteamVR when I get controllers I guess - but I actually didn't but this for VR gaming. 

So my main use case is working away from my desk that already has ultrawides and other big displays. I ran  a Parsec remote PC window open into one of my home servers, browser window, Reddit app, and football game via YouTube TV. I was able to highlight my targets with my gaze and pinch select individual browser tabs,  use the thumb trackpad to work in the Parsec app, scroll through Reddit and reliably select things and scroll on the browser with gaze and pinch - and eye gaze on the little 15s skip between commercials and plays while watching the game worked pretty well.

For an initial release, the hand and eye tracking want perfect but worked well enough for me in a moderately lit room. When I moved to my massage chair in a room that was more dimly lit, then I had tracking challenges - but I remember my Quest being this bad when it first shipped.

I'll be the kook working at the coffee shop with this thing in an hour while I take it through it's paces. I should just need the little thumb keyboard, INIU battery pack, and my unlimited work Hotspot to run Parsec to remote into my various servers. ",2,1761317267.0,GalaxyXR,0,1.0,False

We chatted for about 2 1/2 hours at a coffee shop and it wasn’t super awkward or anything, maybe just a little. We live close to one another so I thought it would be cool to have a new friend in the neighborhood. When we ended it I gave her a quick hug (I don’t think she would have initiated it) and later that evening we exchanged numbers on the app. She said something along the lines of ‘I’m sure I will see you at this or that meet up event if you join.” Not a meet up group I am part of btw. This made me feel like she wasn’t very interested in meeting up again one on one and I actually unmatched with her. I felt foolish for thinking it was a match and for giving her a hug. Too eager on my part I guess.
Last night, about 6 weeks later now, she sends me a text basically asking how I have been and what things I like to do. To be honest it took me a while to figure out who it was because I never put her number in my phone. I haven’t responded yet and I wonder if I am just a placeholder for her until she finds other friends. I think had she been pretty excited about meeting me she would have not left me a message about seeing me in another group setting but would have made plans to do something with me. I wonder what the consensus is here. If it seems like yes it’s a place holder situation should I say something like hey I don’t think we match or should I just ignore it? I don’t like ghosting people. 
Edited to add: I am def more outgoing than her; she seemed reserved. I typically have most women want to meet up again, at least the ones that aren’t super flaky. I also want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and want to include that sentiment in this situation.

Swordsman (sword only), Melee (sword and shield), paladin (maul with a point on one side that would give penetration to the defense, and also has a shield), magician, archer and Berserquer (has two double-headed axes) these would be the characters for the moment, and many objects that could be added to this game, the monsters, would be to your liking, but for ease it would be to put fantasy ones, such as dragons, orcs, ogres and trolls, large monsters, or goblins, and all kinds like that, whether the game is 3D open world, where there would be legendary, angelic and demonic weapons, and many things like that, there would also be a final boss called ""Rok-Monster"" who would be practically a powerful demon, this would be in adventure mode. 

Another game mode would be to put characters of different grades, something like Seven Knight style, in which there would be grades of characters, or if they wanted it to be multiple characters, it would be grades, but they would only give away 1 legendary at the start with pre-registration, since this game will have a lot of characters, of course balanced, with damage that is easy to handle, I don't know what you think.

### An Interview with Toei Animation Producer Tadashi Hirayama
Producer Tadashi Hirayama on ""Girls Band Cry Compilation Movie"": The Strategies That Kept the Fanbase Growing Even After the TV Anime Ended

Updated 15:00, October 21, 2025

Text by Yumiko Watanabe, Edited by ASCII / Tsuyoshi Murayama

#### Fanbase Continues to Grow Post-TV Anime Through the Dual Approach of Live Concerts and ""Anime Pilgrimages""

The anime ""Girls Band Cry"" has returned to the big screen. First, a two-part compilation movie is being released, with a brand-new movie already announced to follow. In the previous installment of this series, Producer Tadashi Hirayama told us about the journey of launching an original 3DCG work from scratch and winning over fans. This time, we ask him about what came ""after"" the hit.

The fact that their X followers increased by over 100,000 even after the TV broadcast ended is partly due to the Budokan-level popularity of the band ""Togenashi Togeari,"" whose members also serve as the voice actors, but there are other reasons as well. Hirayama says that providing various entry points—such as videos, live concerts, ""anime pilgrimages"" to real-life locations, and merchandise—has led to a phenomenon where ""fans bring in more fans."" What are these ""**analog-style methods that resonate in the modern era**"" that Producer Hirayama has put into practice?

> **""Girls Band Cry"" Latest Information**
> 
> ★ A compilation movie re-editing the TV anime is now showing.
>
> ""Girls Band Cry Compilation Movie Part 1: Seishun Kyousoukyoku"" (Adolescent Rhapsody) -> Now Showing
>
> ""Girls Band Cry Compilation Movie Part 2: Naa, Mirai."" (Hey, Future.) -> Premieres November 14
> 
> ★ A completely new movie has been greenlit! Teaser visual released.
> 
> ★ From February to March 2026, Togenashi Togeari will hold their first nationwide tour, ""Togenashi Togeari Zepp Tour 2026 'Hakudou no Mirai'"" (The Future's Pulse), at six locations across Japan.
> 
> ★ Game ""Girls Band Cry First Riff (GaruRifu)"" greenlit for production!

#### A Compilation, But Packed with New Scenes!

— The compilation movie, which re-edits the TV series, is a two-part work. What was your approach when producing it as a film?

**Hirayama:** For the compilation, we decided to keep the runtime under 120 minutes so that even first-time viewers could easily watch it. And to ensure fans of the TV series would also enjoy it, we completely revamped the sound design and added new scenes.

— Could you tell us about the new scenes?

**Hirayama:** For Part 1, we made the opening and ending sequences completely new. There are also new scenes within the main story and in the trailer for Part 2.

Actually, there were scenes in the original script for the TV series that we had to reluctantly cut due to time constraints, and we've brought some of those back. For example, in what was Episode 1 of the TV series, we've added a conversation scene between Nina and Momoka after they reconcile on the pedestrian bridge and before they go to karaoke. In what was Episode 3, we added a scene where Nina frets over what outfit to wear for their first live concert at Lazona Kawasaki.

Director Sakai really agonized over the movie version. He had to figure out how to condense 13 TV episodes into a movie's runtime, and where to insert the new cuts.

— So even though you had to cut down the runtime, you added scenes that were dropped from the TV version. Why is that?

**Hirayama:** **Because there are scenes that, when added, help the audience better understand the characters' feelings or add more meaning to the story.** For Nina and the others' live performance at Serbian Night Kawasaki in what corresponds to Episode 5, Director Sakai added a scene showing a certain character in the audience. By doing so, the words that this character says to Nina later in the story carry more weight.

— So it makes the story feel deeper.

**Hirayama:** Yes. And the 3DCG is another highlight. There's been **five years' worth of evolution**. At Toei Animation, our incredible animators have advanced our ""action"" animation through films like ""Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"" and ""Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac,"" and now we've added ""everyday-life acting"" to that.

Having characters stand, walk, and sit in 3DCG... ""walking naturally"" is actually the most difficult thing to animate. You can really see our growth in that area in the new scenes.

— So you've put a lot of effort not just into eye-catching parts like the opening, but also into what might seem like more mundane details. I imagine you could have gone in a different direction, adding more flashy scenes and saying, ""Let's aim for 10 billion yen at the box office with this movie!""

**Hirayama:** Adding flashy scenes... I never really considered that. At its core, this is a work where the story is front and center. We made sure to cherish that aspect in the compilation movie as well. And I hope everyone will also look forward to the ""**completely new movie**"" we announced at the recent Budokan concert (September 23, ""Togenashi Togeari LIVE in Nippon Budokan 'Sougeki no Sakebi'"").

#### Music Anime Are Well-Suited for Movies

— Regarding the ""completely new movie,"" why did you decide to make it a film instead of a second season of the TV series?

**Hirayama:** One of the advantages of a movie is that we can be very particular about the sound design. Also, because the runtime is shorter, we have to narrow down what we want to do, which results in a more condensed and intense viewing experience. Plus, ""GaruKura"" has a lot of live performance scenes, so I thought it would be well-suited for an ""event-like screening"" in a movie theater.

#### The Reason for First Aiming for ""Pacifico Yokohama""

— The live concerts by the band ""Togenashi Togeari,"" whose members also serve as the cast, became incredibly popular, and they finally made it to the Budokan.

**Hirayama:** At first, I couldn't even imagine the Budokan... We were starting from less than zero, with more factors that conventional industry wisdom says won't be a hit—it was a ""CG"" anime and ""original"" anime.

Amidst all that, the personal benchmark I set was ""Pacifico Yokohama,"" which has a capacity of 4,000. Because if we couldn't make it to that level, it would be tough to succeed as a business to begin with. But I felt that if we could get there, we might be able to set for the next stage.

Most importantly, the members of ""Togenashi Togeari,"" who also serve as the cast, are putting their lives on the line for this. We have to give something back to them in return. In the end, it was truly great that we went from Pacifico Yokohama to the Budokan.

Mirei, who voices Subaru, and Natsu, who voices Tomo, who had been on hiatus, have returned to voice recording. They energetically performed in the drama parts of our single CDs (10th Single ""Daremo,"" released May 28; 11th Single ""Usuiro Display,"" released September 24), in episodes where Subaru and Tomo were the main characters. The response from the audience to these has also been huge.

*""Togenashi Togeari"" garnered attention for its unusual setup where the band of the same name also handles the voice acting. In September 2025, they successfully held their long-awaited live concert at the Budokan.*

#### Keep the Doors Wide and the Threshold Low; Fans Will Grow with Consistency

— One thing I found curious was your X follower count. It was at 100,000 when the TV anime finale aired, but now (as of October 2025) it's over 200,000. With no new anime airing, why do you think it grew by **over 100,000**?

**Hirayama:** First and foremost, the biggest reason is that many viewers praised the TV anime, and many people who heard that praise watched the TV anime later and became new fans.

On top of that, I think it's because we were able to continuously provide an environment where customers could enjoy the work in various forms by releasing live concerts, new songs, CD dramas, merchandise, and so on. I believe it's important to have many ""entry points"" available.

— ""Consistency"" and many ""entry points,"" you say.

**Hirayama:** Yes. We made the base TV anime available on all platforms so that customers can get into it anytime, no matter what they like. In parallel with that, we created a wide range of entry points, including live concerts, music streaming, drama CDs, and merchandise. We welcome those who want to dive deep into everything, and we've also made it so that it's okay for newcomers to join in later.

One thing that made me realize the value of consistency was that our new song ""Daremo,"" released this year, had more streamings on various music distribution sites **than the songs released during the TV anime's broadcast**! This is proof that the fanbase for the anime and Togenashi Togeari has continued to grow even after the TV series ended.

— So, the ability for people to catch up later is what leads to an increase in new fans.

**Hirayama:** Yes. And when you have the anime, the songs, and everything else available, it's easy to recommend to friends. The number of X followers and streaming plays seems to have spread through ""word-of-mouth"" from our customers, so I think **creating that environment is crucial**.

#### ""I Want to Sit in That Seat!"" at a Real-Life Location; Even Overseas Fans Came to Kawasaki

— Please tell us about the situation with ""anime pilgrimages"" to Kawasaki City, the setting of ""GaruKura."" In a previous interview, you mentioned that one of the reasons for choosing Kawasaki was its proximity to Haneda Airport.

**Hirayama:** I think the proximity to Haneda Airport has been very effective. In addition to people from all over Japan, we've had many visitors from overseas. I heard from someone at the Kawasaki City Hall who said, ""**We never expected so many visitors from overseas.** We're so happy."" It seems that in the past, when it came to tourism, people would go to Tokyo or Yokohama, and Kawasaki was often just passed through.

With ""Love Live! Sunshine!!,"" which I previously produced, a similar thing happened where many overseas customers came to Numazu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, the setting of the work, via Shizuoka Airport, which surprised the people of Numazu. Now, a similar phenomenon is happening in Kawasaki with ""GaruKura,"" and it makes me very happy that the local people are pleased.

— Are there any particularly popular pilgrimage spots?

**Hirayama:** I've heard from ""Yoshinoya Kawasaki West Exit"" and ""Shimamura Music Lazona Kawasaki"" that they've seen an increase in customers. We received a joyful email from ""Yako-yu"" bathhouse saying, ""Someone came all the way from England to take a bath.""

Also, at the izakaya ""Toritei,"" the seats where Nina and the others sat in the anime are so popular that they often get phone calls asking, ""Is that table available?"" as if it were a reserved seat, and it's often fully booked on weekends. I've also heard that at ""Marufuku Coffee Shop Kawasaki Azalea,"" they get a lot of requests from customers saying, ""I want to sit in that seat.""

""*When people tell their friends about how much fun they're having, the circle of word-of-mouth spreads, and more people can enjoy the work. I believe that's how this positive cycle works.*"" (Mr. Hirayama)

#### ""Creating a Sacred Spot"" is Just as Important as a Live Concert; Real Places Help People Make ""Friends""

— The desire to ""sit in that seat"" is something that's only possible because the location actually exists. When you decided to set the story in Kawasaki, did you anticipate it would become such a popular pilgrimage spot?

**Hirayama:** The excitement has exceeded our expectations, but from the very beginning, we've been putting our full effort into ""creating a sacred spot,"" **treating live concerts and pilgrimage sites as two wheels of the same cart**.

— On the same level as a live concert!

**Hirayama:** Yes. By creating a sacred spot, first of all, when fans visit, they can feel that the characters really live there. And by being in the same space, they come to love the work even more. As a result, the fans, the local people, and we are all happy. Nobody loses, and it creates a very good cycle.

The reason we established ""real places fans can go"" for both live concerts and pilgrimage sites is not just so that fans will feel an attachment to the work, but also so they can **make friends**.

— Friends, you say?

**Hirayama:** If they have a good time when they visit, they'll post ""This place was fun!"" on social media or their blogs, or they'll bring their friends along. And by going with friends, those friends might also get to know and like the work.

Whether it's at a live concert or an event, people meet others and become friends, and then they go to the next concert or pilgrimage site to meet those friends. In this way, their circle of friends keeps expanding.

When I look at fans' posts, after a concert or event, there's a flood of photos with captions like, ""We all went out for drinks!""

— So they make friends on-site.

**Hirayama:** I really think friends are incredibly important. It becomes harder to make friends as an adult, but when you go to a concert or on an anime pilgrimage, you have the common ground of ""loving this work,"" which lowers the barrier to making friends, so to speak. People connect solely based on ""I love this work,"" regardless of their background or anything else.

When I see people writing on social media or blogs things like, ""I'm so happy I made friends,"" I think, ""Ah, I'm glad we could be of service, I hope we've created a place where people can spend their days happily.""

— Could it be that by enjoying things with friends, the ""word-of-mouth"" for the work increases as a result?

**Hirayama:** I think so. The enjoyment of getting excited in a real place is eventually linked to the presence of ""friends."" It makes daily life more fun, and if that can also connect back to ""GaruKura,"" that would be great.

*The official ""GaruKura"" X account has approximately 231,000 followers as of October 2025. This is more than double the number during the TV anime's broadcast.*

#### The Boost from ""Word-of-Mouth"" is Only Effective When There's an Environment Ready for It

— With ""GaruKura,"" you have the videos, music, drama CDs, and various merchandise, but you also have real places people can go, like live concerts and pilgrimage sites. This has allowed people to make friends and has greatly expanded the circle of word-of-mouth. It seems that this has ultimately led to the result of over 200,000 followers.

**Hirayama:** In the end, I realized that word-of-mouth is powerful. There's buzz on social media, but **a recommendation from a friend saying ""It was good"" resonates more than one from a stranger**, doesn't it? I think that's the best kind of word-of-mouth.

— I didn't realize word-of-mouth was that important.

**Hirayama:** I believe so. The reason ""Kokuho"" (National Treasure) is a massive hit and ""Samurai Time Slipper"" was a massive hit is, of course, first and foremost because the works themselves are excellent. But on top of that, I think the power of word-of-mouth is significant.

The fans who gather have a good time and feel the desire to tell their friends, ""That was great,"" and spread the word. When word-of-mouth spreads like wildfire from there, I think even an original work can gradually get noticed by a wider audience. It's just very difficult to get to that point.

To generate that word-of-mouth, I think it's crucial to create an environment where, when someone is recommended the work by a friend, they can watch it immediately. That means having a full lineup of content available so they can choose what they like.

— I see! So creating real places and having wide entry points all connect back to word-of-mouth!

#### Don't Compete for Fans, Instead Grow the Overall Base of the Genre

— In the last year or two, the number of ""girls' band"" themed works has increased dramatically. I was surprised to see that at the ""Togenashi Togeari"" concerts, you collaborated with bands from Bushiroad's works, like ""MyGO!!!!!"" (January 12, 2025, ""Avoid Note"") and ""RAISE A SUILEN"" (scheduled for December 7, 2025, ""RAISE MY CATHARSIS""). Aren't those rival titles with overlapping fanbases?

**Hirayama:** There's a culture of ""battle of the bands"" (taiban) in the band scene, and it started when Bushiroad reached out to us and we said, ""We'd love to."" The fact that it suited the nature of our work was also a big factor.

— But I would think there would be concerns, like ""competing for customers""...

**Hirayama:** Rather than competing for customers, I think it's better to think about the genre as a whole and increase the number of customers.

By collaborating, you create interaction between the fanbases. And if fans think the other band's work is interesting too and enjoy both, that's great. That way, the number of ""band-themed work"" fans itself will increase. The idea is not to fight over a limited number within the genre, **but to grow the total number of fans for this genre as a whole**.

— So, not competing, but ""growing the base through collaboration."" That might be a modern way of thinking. I remember hearing the phrase ""fighting for a piece of the cake"" back when anime was mainly sold on physical media. The idea was that the number of fans for a genre is limited, so the question was how to attract them to your own company's work...

**Hirayama:** However, even in the era of physical media, if you compare a season with only one strong title, to a season with five, which one was more exciting? **It was the one where five titles were competing. More discs was sold then.**

— What, really!?

**Hirayama:** Yes. They sell better. It's definitely better when there are many hit titles. Customers get into various works, and a momentum builds where they think, ""I might as well spend money on this work too,"" and the entire market gets energized.

That's why I think it's better to have rival works. The whole market gets more lively that way. Nowadays, you hear phrases like ""polarization of winners and losers,"" but I really think it's better when all the fans of a genre get excited together.

#### An Analog Approach

— When looking at it as an anime business, connecting real-life places to word-of-mouth seems quite analog.

**Hirayama:** ""GaruKura"" might be different from the mainstream approach today. In the current anime business, the main model is selling streaming rights. We have streaming companies purchase the rights, and we use that money to cover production costs. With a popular existing IP, you can sometimes recoup the costs just by selling the streaming rights.

However, with an original work, it's uncertain whether it will be a hit, so it's difficult to have the streaming rights bought upfront and roll it out on a large scale. That's why we have to take a more grassroots approach, like with YouTube videos and creating pilgrimage sites, to build a track record by appealing to fans directly. Only after that can we finally find companies willing to stream it.

We're fighting the same way they did back in the 1980s, in the era of directors like Yoshiyuki Tomino and Ryosuke Takahashi. It's like ""selling toys to cover production costs."" Now, instead of toys, we have fans purchase Blu-rays, CDs, and merchandise, and that's how we're finally able to make it work as a business.

— CDs and merchandise instead of toys.

**Hirayama:** That's right. Personally, **I feel that this kind of analog approach suits me**. I also have this feeling of, ""If an anime were to be completely self-contained within the video, would it be that enjoyable?"" Being able to visit places connected to the work, or buying something at a shop and enjoying it by displaying it at home... I think those things are incredibly important for feeling a connection to the work.

#### Wanting to Cherish the ""Real""

— With ""GaruKura,"" you place a lot of importance on ""real places"" like pilgrimage sites and live concerts. Could you tell us again about the distinctive features of the story?

**Hirayama:** The work ""GaruKura"" itself is an analog and grounded story. It's about girls who move to Tokyo and grow through their struggles.

We took the story by scriptwriter Jukki Hanada and, together with director Kazuo Sakai, whose style is known for being grounded, we depicted the world of bands and live shows from scratch, studying everything from how the equipment is wired. Furthermore, the moment we chose Kawasaki as the setting, I think it became a story that wasn't just grounded, but practically embedded in reality.

In real life, there are times when young people try to ""become someone."" I think those times are quite tough. If you leave home to make a living like Nina and the others, you need to pay rent and get a part-time job. On top of that, Nina and her friends are staking their lives on music, something that might not even become a profession, so they need the resolve to push forward even when it's hard.

...It kept getting more and more realistic like this, but I also felt that depicting that aspect was extremely meaningful.

**There aren't that many anime that tackle the ""tough times"" in life head-on.** That's why there's significance in doing it, and I believe that's precisely why it resonates with viewers' hearts in this day and age, when people feel a sense of suffocation in their daily lives.

#### Deliberately Not Looking Ahead, Always Giving It Our All in the Moment

— Does this ""GaruKura"" project have a long-term plan? Like, what you plan to develop over what kind of span?

**Hirayama:** Actually, we haven't really thought about it that much. An original work can only continue if it has the support of the audience. For us, only after the compilation movie and then the new movie we're making after that become hits, that's the first time we can start thinking about ""the next story.""

— That's a bit surprising, since many anime these days have their developments planned out for years in advance.

**Hirayama:** If you start thinking about the future, distracting thoughts like, ""Let's save this good part for later,"" can creep in while you're making it.

But even if you save it for later, that ""later"" might never come.

That's why we deliberately don't think about the ""future"" and just put out all the good ideas we have right now. Director Sakai often says, ""**Eat the strawberry on the shortcake first.**""

— Not looking ahead, but betting everything on the ""now."" Your approach to creating the work is as rock 'n' roll as Nina and the others.

**Hirayama:** That might be true (laughs). What I want to say to everyone is, thank you so much for your continued support. And for those who have newly become interested in ""GaruKura,"" please do watch the compilation movie.

We have a new movie, live concerts, and a game coming up, so please support us in whatever way you like best.

1oeznky,https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-great-feminization-hasnt-gone,The Great Feminization Hasn’t Gone Far Enough,"When I was 13 years old, most of the girls in my single-sex school failed a question on a science test: *Why do teenage boys have higher levels of iron than girls?*

Different students took different approaches to the question. Maybe boys eat more red meat? Or their propensity for risk somehow gives them an added layer of protection?

The answer is so obvious that you’re screaming at me: Boys don’t get periods. Our all-girls school had lulled us into a sense that the female is the default human. Of course, this brief period of tranquility didn’t last—soon we absorbed the concept developed by Simone de Beauvoir that man is default and woman is “Other.”

Still, the intensity of an all-female environment has stayed with me in the decades since, so I read Helen Andrews’ recent viral essay “[The Great Feminization](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/)” with interest and a raised eyebrow. Drawing on the blogger J. Stone, Andrews argues that many issues facing society today—especially wokeness—are in fact driven by the feminization of society. Andrews says, paraphrasing Stone, “all cancellations are feminine. Cancel culture is simply what women do whenever there are enough of them in a given organization or field.”

Andrews’ argument relies on the fact that women are [more likely](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178914000329) to use ostracism and gossip to exclude or publicly shame individuals, and that these are the characteristics of left-wing cancel culture. She claims that as the number of women in various industries has grown, women began imposing these toxic norms in the workplace and public life in what she describes as a vast experiment in “social engineering.”

There is a kernel of truth to Andrews’ claims. Like many women, I’ve felt the thrill of being part of a group excluding someone, and equally have felt the sting of ostracism myself. (Anyone who has ever joined a dysfunctional team at work knows that nothing unites a group like a common enemy, whether that’s a difficult boss or the person who takes away the free coffee.)

It’s true that prominent left-wing cancellations follow similar dynamics. In 2020,[ Matt Yglesias](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/substack-and-medias-groupthink-problem/617102/) left *Vox* for Substack after (among other things) a colleague accused him of making her feel “less safe” for signing the pro-free speech *Harper’s Letter*. In 2023,[ Carole Hooven](https://www.thefp.com/p/carole-hooven-why-i-left-harvard) was forced to resign from Harvard for saying sex is biological and binary. According to a[ survey](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom) from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), over half of academics are concerned about losing their jobs or reputations due to their words being used against them.

What’s more, the surge of left-wing cancel culture during the 2010s and early 2020s did, roughly, coincide with increasing female participation in both education and the workplace. While female students have outnumbered male students since[ 1979](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/women-in-higher-education-facts-statistics/), traditionally male subjects such as law and medicine became majority female only in[ 2016](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2024/01/women-outnumber-men-in-us-law-school-classrooms-but-statistics-dont-tell-the-full-story/) and[ 2017](https://www.aamc.org/news/brief-timeline-women-medicine), respectively. As Andrews points out, 55% of *New York Times* staff are now female. This broadly matches the timeline of the rise of wokeness and cancel culture.

But scratch beneath the surface, and Andrews’ argument falls apart.

First, the Great Feminization hypothesis relies on the sweeping assumption that men are rational, while women are emotional. Of course, anger—the emotion most associated with men—is excluded from this analysis, which is strange given that it guides so much of a certain president’s behavior. A great deal of the United States’ current foreign policy seems to be guided by perceived slights to Trump rather than the rational calculations we are assured men excel at.

Meanwhile, history’s most futile wars give lie to the idea that women are uniquely driven by emotion. The[ Battle of the Somme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme)—in which over one million soldiers were wounded or killed for a territorial gain of six miles—is hardly a glowing endorsement of men’s capacity for rational thought. And the recent wave of cancellations coming from the right in the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk—much of it driven by conservative men—should make us skeptical that, as Andrews puts it, “men tend to be better at compartmentalizing than women” such that they keep politics from infecting everyday life.

Then there is Andrews’ inaccurate characterization of female conflict strategies. In a recent[ tweet](https://x.com/herandrews/status/1974808063400882371), she writes: “When the conflict is over, \[men will\] shake the other guy’s hand and accept the outcome gracefully. Women don’t have that. If you’re her enemy, you are subhuman garbage. No rules govern the fight; no shaking hands when it’s over. It is never over.” But this just doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Peace agreements are [20%](https://wps.unwomen.org/participation/) more likely to last at least two years, and 35% more likely to last 15 years, if women are part of the process.[1](https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-great-feminization-hasnt-gone#footnote-1-177000688) (Andrews also seems to contradict herself here—one moment she claims women prioritize “empathy over rationality,” and the next she acts as if women lack any empathy whatsoever.)

What about her claim that feminization is the main culprit for wokeness? The timing is dubious. The number of women studying for and entering traditionally male professions has been on the rise for decades, yet wokeness of the sort Andrews is concerned about is a fairly recent phenomenon. (Yglesias dates the “[Great Awokening](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020)” to around 2014). While Andrews argues that this is because organizations reached a tipping point once they became majority female (or were heading that way), this isn’t a satisfactory answer. Even with an increasingly female workforce, most managers and CEOs are still men. And as Andrews points out, only 33% of judges today are women, which doesn’t prevent her from applying her thesis to the legal profession.

What other factors might explain wokeness? The timing fits more neatly with the rise of smartphones and social media. As Jonathan Haidt[ argues](https://jonathanhaidt.com/anxious-generation/), these new tools triggered a wave of anxiety and depression among adolescents, as well as a broader concern for “safety” from perceived threats. Social media provided the perfect tools not only to amplify new ideas such as wokeness, but also to enforce sanctions on non-believers from the comfort of one’s own couch.

This makes sense when you consider that left-wing cancel culture arguably peaked during the COVID pandemic in 2020, when everyone was scared, confused, and isolated. Had wokeness merely been an expression of typically female behavior, the pandemic would have had a much more limited effect—and indeed wokeness would have continued to grow in strength every year since then as more women entered the workforce, when in fact the opposite seems to be the case.

**The truth is that,** in many ways, feminization hasn’t gone far enough—something that Andrews seems unable to recognize.

Take medicine, a subject Andrews only touches on to make the implausible point that male doctors are better than female ones at keeping politics “out of the examination room.” Historically, female patients have faced a great deal of discrimination, from doctors dismissing their symptoms to exclusion from medical studies. In her memoir *Giving Up The Ghost*, the novelist Hilary Mantel described her excruciating experience with endometriosis, a condition that affects [one in 10 women](https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/population-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-endometriosis) of reproductive age, yet which even today can take between four and 11 years to diagnose. Despite negative pregnancy tests and years of pain, a doctor dismissed Mantel’s pain with the words “there’s a baby in there.” (Mantel later had a hysterectomy, including removal of part of her bladder and bowel, as a result of the disease.)

This is part of a broader trend: women are frequently ignored when reporting symptoms, and life-saving treatments are still not adequately tested for their impact on women’s bodies. The COVID vaccines were a huge scientific achievement—yet from early on in the vaccine rollout, women[ reported](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/didnt-doctors-listen-women-link-covid-vaccines-periods/) its effects on their menstrual cycle, from heavier periods to breakthrough bleeding in post-menopausal women. Vaccination studies simply didn’t look at menstrual side-effects, and both medical organizations and media outlets were initially[ dismissive](https://newsletter.carolinecriadoperez.com/p/invisible-women-murderous-menstrual-blood-734697) of women’s reports. (Thankfully, the link has since been[ studied](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12364997/).)

Rather than admitting that there are some areas in which it would be better to listen to women more, Andrews is concerned with making sweeping statements about how feminization will lead to the end of Western civilization. “The field that frightens me most is the law. All of us depend on a functioning legal system, and, to be blunt, the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female,” she frets, using Obama-era Title IX regulations as an example of what a feminized legal system might look like.

This is a vast overstatement. There are real reasons to[ criticize](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-campus-rape-policy/538974/) the Obama-era Title IX regulations, in which many of those accused of sexual assault on college campuses had too little right to due process. While these rules came from an understandable desire to support survivors of rape and assault, in practice both women and men benefit from a fair system with due process at its heart.

But Andrews’ claim that “the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female” is ludicrous. Women are not immune to rationality, and the fact that women[ outperform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2024/01/14/from-kindergarten-to-college-girls-are-outperforming-boys/) men in areas of education that apparently play to male strengths, such as exams, suggests that we understand rules and arguments, too. In fact, female lawyers are [23%](https://premonition.ai/women_lawyers_significantly_better_study_finds/) less likely to be sued for malpractice than male lawyers, and female partners win 12% more than men, showing that women are in fact competent at upholding the law.

More broadly, Andrews is right to be concerned that feminization is driving men away from traditionally male institutions. But once again she misidentifies the cause. Research has shown that professions dominated by women are [considered less valuable](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html), while those seen as more masculine enjoy a status (and corresponding financial) bump. This suggests that it’s not toxic female behaviors driving men away, but a lack of respect for women.

**Anyone who has** spent time in groups dominated by each sex knows that the social lives of men and women are very different. Until recently, I worked in predominantly female workplaces in which updates about our complex love lives were practically a standing agenda item in team meetings, and the solution to any issue was invariably “let’s all join hands.” (I loved it.) All-female groups also tend to handle conflict differently to men, for example by canvassing other members to see if there’s general agreement before making a decision on how to act.

But it’s wrong to extrapolate that feminization somehow poses a threat to civilization. Indeed, there are plenty of areas in which more feminization would improve things for men as well. Letting men[ take](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmwomeq/358/358.pdf) paternity leave of longer than two weeks tends to lead to more hands-on childcare, which in turn is associated with better outcomes for children. Indeed, research shows that fathers today *want* to spend more time with their children than those of previous generations, suggesting that both men and women would benefit from increased focus on areas of life that are traditionally considered women’s domain, such as childrearing.

Today, we are lucky that we don’t have to choose between the old, stagnant patriarchal system in which women were confined to the domestic sphere, and the cruel matriarchal system people like Andrews think we already live in. Instead, we can embrace the positive aspects of masculinity *and* femininity, whilst finding effective strategies to mitigate the harms of both. This means championing values and policies that lead to a free and fair society for all—even men.

It was game day, and I needed something special to lift my spirits after a tough week. Who would have thought a simple cap could do just that?

Wearing this cap isn't just about showing off my team spirit—it's a rite of passage, a personal statement of loyalty and pride. It fits snugly, like it was made just for me, and every time I wear it, I feel connected to the history of the Eagles, not just the team but the incredible fanbase. It's like being part of a family, united by our shared love for every exhilarating touchdown and heart-pounding game.

If you’re curious, you can check it out here: https://neweracap.blog/

Beyond the emotional connection, there are two very practical reasons why this cap is worth every penny. First, the quality is something else. The stitching is immaculate, and the fabric feels sturdy, like it can withstand seasons of wear. I've tossed it in my car, worn it to messy barbecues, and yet it still looks as fresh as the day I got it.

Secondly, it's an easy way to spark conversations. It never fails—whether I'm at a game or just out for a coffee, someone will start chatting about the last Eagles match when they see my cap. It's an instant icebreaker, making it easier to make friends or simply share in the excitement of last Sunday's play.

If you’re curious, you can check it out here: https://neweracap.blog/

Prior to taking on such an intense spell i will share some insight on our relationship how it ended and how i can get it back.
My ex broke up with me during eclipse season in september, I was blindsided completely and did not see it coming. There was no reason besides he “wasn’t ready anf i deserved better.” On the last day of the eclipse season, there was a lunar eclipse, i did a obsession:love spell next to a river under the moon. the next night I successfully got him back… for a night. He then called to break up with me again… 

I gave it time to process before settling on something else, Making a poppet of him.
The object i used (and don’t judge me..) was a labubu he GIFTED me. So i emptied it, played “love and relationship” subliminals, and sewed a picture of his face on it with red thread. As the taglocks, I used a small voice box of him saying “I’ll always be there for you X, I miss you”, I used a clump of his hair, I necklace he gifted me with the engraving of the date we first hung out, and a picture he drew for me. I sewed a heart onto the body of the doll. 
I placed Bloodstone, Garnet, Rose quartz and Rhodonite, all anointed with love oil. 
I lit a White pheromone candle we used together, surrounded by salt and a in depth birthday card he wrote me, his pictures and Tarot cards surrounding it the fit my intentions (the sun, 2 of pentacles and cups, the lovers, the magician and the empress)
I then started working on a honey jar spell to place into the poppet, Its contents had whole cloves, Orange peels, dried rose petals from roses he gave me, lavender, pink salt, rosemary, dainma, jasmine flower, pheromone candle wax, honey, instant coffee, rose oil, love anointing oil, in a cupid vial.
Then i did a love spell with our names/DOB carved on a pink and red candle, tied together with red thread placed on top of the honey jar. 
While the spell was burning, I wrote my intentions/petition on the back of pictures of us together (ripped the sides and folded it three times and put it in the poppet.)
I then sealed up the poppet, Naming him with my EX’s name. 

Now I don’t know what more i can do with the poppet so im asking for suggestions, i placed my underwear on the poppet so he would think of me. Im planning on getting colored needles to place on his heart.. but what more could I do?",1,1761316751.0,Spells,0,1.0,False

I have been on it for 8 weeks, keeping carbs under 30g daily.
Protein intake is about 2g per kg of my total body weight, roughly 150g, with the rest from fat.
I do not consume dairy.
My daily foods are consistent.
E.g., 25% fat ground beef, whole eggs, wild salmon and sardines (canned), chicken wings and whole chicken legs (oven-cooked with skin and some no-sugar seasoning). Sometimes pork belly, avocados, fermented cabbage, fermented pickles, raw macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, green zucchini, sometimes a little onion, organic raw coconut oil, raw cocoa powder, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, extra virgin olive oil, sometimes a bit of peanut butter, and 50 to 100g of frozen blueberries.

I walk about 6-7k steps daily and do weight training three times a week, intense sessions lasting 45 minutes to an hour. My new keto diet have caused me to lose about 40% of my strength and endurance.

When I reduce or cut out vegetables, avocados, and nuts, and try to eat more carnivore-like, I consume way more meat and feel heavy in my digestion. My heart rate also elevates with the increased protein intake. I eat 2-3 times a day, without snacking.
I have 1-2 coffees daily, and my water intake is around 30ml per kg of body weight, with an extra 0.5L on training days.

My weight is 74kg, height is 5’7”, body fat around 16%, and daily calorie intake is 2500-2600, aiming for maintenance. However, I do tend to overeat occasionally (no cheats, no sugars, just normal food).

Is this normal? I’ve heard that on keto, your appetite drops. I am not losing any weight at the moment.

[Exterior, Story House]

[Interior, Mr Ballen is doing 400lb parallel squats in the lounge. Live audience swoon and whistle. The door opens and Missing Enigma boy enters with a downtrodden look on his face.]

Mr B: Yo, my 'nigma why are you back so soon? You said you were on a date this afternoon!

Missing Enigma Boy: *sighs* yeah, I WAS on a date, but then she got all weird and left after 20 minutes.

Mr B: SHE got weird? [MR B looks at the camera and does a ""yeeeah right"" facial expression, crowd laughs]. Are you sure it wasn't YOU who got weird?

Missing Nigma Boy: No, John, I was just being myself. [Enigma Boy throws himself onto the couch, slumps, and grabs a cushion over his tummy for comfort]. We ordered coffee, sat outside, and talked... then she said she has to go do her laundry or something

Mr B: Her laundry? OoK, that is weird. What is it you talked about before she left?

Enigma Boy: Just normal stuff: bigfoot, people who go missing in national parks... normal stuff.

Mr B: whoa whoa whoa, Enigma Boy, none of that is normal! You're gonna scare the cuties away if all you talk about is bigfoot and Missing 411 cases! Girls are... girls! You gotta keep all the storyline stuff for your YouTube channel, Nick.

Enigma Boy: Easy for you to say, Navy Seal John Ballen. You don't need to worry about what you talk about when you have, what was it my ex said about you: ""sexy dad vibes""?

[Camera cut to top of the stairs, Bob Gymlan pokes his head out from the top with a big smirk]

Bob G: Did someone say sexy dad vibes? [Crowd erupts in laughter as if Sheldon had just said bazinga]

Mr B: No, no, no. We're just talking about Enigma boys date.

Bob G: oh yeah, how'd it go? 

Enigma boy: hmph, not good. She ran off cos apparently I'm too ""weird"" according to John over here.

Bob G: weird, huh? Not as weird as a bipedal ape, which moves on all fours with its back hunched down, or a pair of lions that eats 400 railway workers. Humans are attracted to big gorillas. Maybe you should join John at the squat rack he SO KINdLy installed in between the couch and the TV. How am I to going to watch my stories with thay thing in the way.

Mr B: (begins doing classic Mr ballen hand gestures to deliver jnfo) whoa, I was just over here doing my squats, watching sports channel, and now I'm under fire for nothing? What is this, Ruby Ridge? How about you two boys go get some fresh air, I'll take the rack down, and we can all watch some old school Mr ballen story videos on the plasma TV later, as a family.

Enigma Boy: [removes cushion] ok. Maybe I do need a walk. Let's go BOb.

[Cut to the woods. Bon Gymlan and Missing Enigma boy are on a stroll wearing mittens, scarves, winter coats etc.]

Bob G: ... and if shark attacks are under reported, and not reported at all, does that mean we even need a shark week.

[Bob G notices nigma boy has stopped in his tracks]

Bob G: Yo, nigma, what's going on? You've frozen in place. What is this, a UFO abduction taking place right in front of me.

Enigma boy: (raises his finger to point in the distance) P-p-pretty

[The camera follows his finger to what it is pointing at, a beautiful babe with librarian glasses in hiking boots and sports leggings. She is inspecting something on the ground and recording it with a clipboard]

Bob G: Oh, a female. You are attracted to her, yes. I don't blame you. Big you know what's to feed the baby, big you know what to make room for the baby. Go for it, champ.

Nigma Boy: Yeah, but she's beautiful. She'll just think I'm weird.

Bon G: You been taking advice from Mr B? He doesn't know anything except slamming heavy weights around. Go talk to her. Be yourself. I'm gonna go record for paranormal.noises.

[Nigma boy approaches the beautiful girl. She turns and says ""oh to acknowledge him]

Enigma boy: H-H-hi... I'm.. 

[Mr Ballens voice is heard in his head, saying ""be normal"", ""save the bigfoot stuff for your YouTube channel"", ""girls don't wanna be freaked out by bigfoot stuff""]

ENIGMA boy: Big foot?

[The beautiful girls eyes bright up and she throws her clipboard to the ground]

Girl: Oh my god, finally! I've been looking for bigfoot for years my father is a researcher. He told me to collect as much evidence as I can! [She continues]

Enigma boy: no, no, I'm not actually bigfoot I just -

Girl: If you haven't got much time, maybe a seven sample would be easiest [she removes her clothes to reveal a.smoking hot body and red lingerie]

Missing Enigma Boy: Hooga booga I'm not sure I....

[Cut to ads]

[Return from ads. Interior, Story House. Mr Ballen is ironing his extensive collection of plaid shirts. The door swings open and Missing Enigma boy enters, covered in red kiss marks and the crotch area of his trousers has been removed]

Mr B: Wooooah, wherever you been? The red light district? [Crowd laighs]

Enigma Boy: no, the woods. I just had the best sex of my life!

Mr B: Sure looks like it! Wait, the woods? How'd you pull that off? The woods are a level 10 difficulty for ploughing babes?

Enigma Boy: [shrugs] I was just... myself?

[Bob G enters, carrying a ghostbusters detector thingy]

Bob G: hey hey hey, looks like someone got luck-ay! [His machine starts beeping] Wait, you didn't breed with that girl in the woods did you?

Enigma Boy: Sure did, folks!

[Bob G's machine starts going crazy, Mr B walks over]

Bob G and Mr B: Duuuude!

Enigma Boy: what? I can't have a little fun without you two having a go at me? 

Mr B: Bob's spectraliz3r is going haywire on you.

Bob G: according to these readings, you have swamp hag DNA all over you

Enigma Boy: A swamp Hag? She was a beautiful girl, she said she wanted my bigfoot DNA to show to her father?

Mr B: Her father? Nigma boy, you're about to get h7nted down by a wendigo!

No matter what I eat or drink, I never have any issues. But today, my body decided to play a crappy joke on me.

The day at work started off as usual : I said hello to everyone in the office, turned on my computer, read my emails, and went to grab some coffee with my coworkers. A few sips in, I felt something was off. A tightening in my stomach, then a loud gurgle. That’s when I realized my morning muesli with yogurt and the coffee weren’t getting along.

I knew instantly that if I didn’t act fast, I’d regret it. I excused myself and sprinted to the only bathroom in the office. What happened next was the worst bathroom experience of my life. Let’s just say I finally understood those people who have to take their shirts off when they shit. When it was over, I was still shaking.

I flushed — or at least I tried to. The toilet in our office has such weak pressure it can barely handle pee, let alone… that. After a few failed attempts, I desperately tried to push my “creation” down with the toilet brush, but no luck. Now I had a shitty toilet and a shitty brush.

Luckily, there was a trash can nearby. I filled it with water to try and flush the mess down manually. Big mistake. The strong stream splashed everywhere — not just inside the bowl, but all over the floor and walls.

Thinking fast, I ran to grab the janitor’s mop. Of course, as soon as I came back, someone else tried to use the bathroom — and it just had to be my boss. He came out furious, saw me standing there with the mop, and clearly put two and two together. He just sighed and said, “I don’t have the energy for this today. Be in my office tomorrow morning.”

They don’t fire people for a shitty toilet… right?

TL;DR: I shit the toilet at work, then made a mess in the bathroom and now I might have a problem with my boss ",50,1761316280.0,tifu,30,0.65,False

1oezay2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1oezay2/stopped_taking_my_15mg_script_a_few_days_ago_but/,Stopped taking my 15mg script a few days ago but i don't think i'm having withdrawal i think i'm just this sad?,"23F... no way for me to explain my dilemma in brief...

I've been taking 15mg lexapro for about a year? I had a 10mg script before that but wasn't very consistent with taking it. When I was prescribed vyvanse in January I asked if my doctor could up the lexapro as well. I haven't recieved any real psychiatric evaluation for these meds, I just told my family doctor (who barely knows me... because my original one that I had my whole life retired) I was super depressed and I thought it was being caused by my (not formally diagnosed... but when you know you know....) ADD and he printed out a one page survey about depression symptoms and told me to fill it out and then wrote the prescription.

Around the same time I was prescribed these meds I got back into smoking weed like all the time. I have had phases of my life in the past where I smoke every day but never for this long and this consistently. At first I was just smoking all the time because I fell back in love with weed more than ever before. But then it became a way for me to fix my appetite which was being destroyed by no doubt the vyvanse (and prob the lexapro as well?), and then it just got to a point where I (thought I) was living life as a ""functional stoner"" aka smoking from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep, not to get high persay... just to feel ""normal"". Lexapro wise: I have zero routine in my life in general (due to my ADD and depression and I know these are worsened by a lack of routine as well) so I was taking the lexapro at different times every day, missing days, or taking 10mg one day and 20mg another because I was too lazy to split the pill in half to make it 15. I also was not consistent with my vyvanse. Some days I wouldn't take it in order to regain my appetite, and other times I ran out and had to wait a week or so for my dad to ship my refill because I live in a province that doesn't allow me access to their health care system (from ontario and live in quebec for uni).

This past week I've stopped taking the lexapro and only taking the vyvanse if absolutely necessary to keep me awake to work on school shit I have neglected to the last minute. Between the meds and weed, I have no understanding of where i am actually AT, what my base level is, because my brain and body are constantly being inundated with substances. I have also cut down smoking *significantly*. I probably haven't gone more than 48 hours without weed, but for the past two weeks or so I've only smoked in order to calm myself down when I've been having some kind of dramatic episode and there is no other way I feel I can get out of it (I try to see if I can call my dad or a friend first, but sometimes no one is available). 

I am realizing how bad things have gotten. I have no interest in anything, feel so disconnected, no motivation, eating sucks and is super stressful all the time, no sex drive (I used to LOVE food and sex, that was like all I thought about lol), everyone can tell or knows that I'm struggling and it only gets more and more obvious. I also don't really have anyone where I live that I feel I can be fully honest with about what's going on without freaking them out or embarrassing myself more than I already have. This week I failed all of my midterms and while I've never had good habits when it came to time management/school, I *always* managed to get away with it and keep a high GPA and so this feels like a new low. Coupled with that, I self-harmed for the first time yesterday, and this was previously something I never really understood why people did. It's not like I thought it was stupid, but my depression had just never manifested that way. I have maybe a few memories of having some urges maybe when I was a lot younger, but always too much of a pussy to actually to follow through, and also just probably not depressed enough. It's also pretty obvious, to the point where I'm anxious that my boyfriend is going to notice next time he sees me (or he won't, which might actually make me feel worse?). I haven't been able to stop crying, only when i physically have to, like this morning i cried from the moment I woke up, on my whole bike ride to school and then only managed to stop in order to get a coffee and even then it took all of my concentration to do so and now i am oversharing on reddit (which has actually also for this moment stopped me).

So I guess what I'm wondering is if stopping the lexapro might *actually* be making things even worse? I also think it could be weed withdrawal, but then I also think my noticeably worsened state is just a reaction to the complete fucking mess I feel I have made of my life, how low I've gotten. I have been so depressed this whole year and the lexapro it seemed like such a low dose that i feel like it didn't even do anything, so i didn't think stopping it would make much of a difference (and also hoped it might help bring some of my appetite back). I think I've been off of it for a bit over a week? I just highly doubt if i were to start taking it again I would notice much of a difference, but last week when I was ""on it"" I wasn't self harming on school property so... yeah :/

If anyone is still actually reading this and has any advice or has struggled with something similar or just has some insight about how I may move forward... Just feeling so lost :(",2,1761316266.0,lexapro,2,1.0,False
