But i want to chare this too.

I'm M25, I work as an engineer. 183cm, 106 kg, 30%BF. 
Yes I am over weight, this never effected me in socializing but something happened 11 days ago (28th oct).

My gf, who was with me for last 7 years (she was also like me, so, we started going to gym 6 weeks ago), suddenly, 11 days ago (28th oct), she started going to gym at different timing than me, saying she was busy in morning, i didn't mind. Again, this was 11 days ago (28th oct), I used to go at 6 am, and she at 7 pm.

After 2 days (1st Nov), I said let's have dinner after your gym session, and we did, for dinner, where I saw 2 things :-
1. She came directly from gym, but her gym bag was light (just a bottle)
2. The no. Of km showing on her scooty was 78 ~ 80 km more than what is was just 2 days ago 

I know she went somewhere, but she denied, shw didn't say she went with her friend, with her sister, family, she just said that I may be mistaken. But no, I'm not mistaken.

For next 6 days I did too much to find out what has exactly happened, and it obv was a guy, i found out since when it has been happening, what were their intentions and then on 6th nov (2 days ago), i confronted her. 

All she said  was, she was never into me, and said : 'Abbey dharti ke bojh, college mein bor na hou isiliye tuje pakad liya, tere jaise sau ghum rhe hai ab mere peeche, I can fuck as many guys as I want.'


In english: 'you're just a burden on earth, your only use was to entertain me in college since, no one paid attention to me, now I realise there are 100s of guys who want me, and I can fuck as many people as I want'

I could not say anything, then she explained, that she only wanted me till she thinks ""she gets beautiful/hot"" and so that people will see her with me and approach her. But for me, she was always the prettiest, always the most beautiful. 

That's what I became for her, she just wanted to show me as a temporary bf, so she can later be with someone ""worthy and hot enough""

She even said we was in live with me for 4 years but then she wanted to get wjth better guys. Idk what are better guys, no one knows her favourite ice cream flavour, no one knows she gets itchy when she's standing next to flowers, no guy knows she likes iced coffee when she's on her period, but apparently, a better guy is someone she met in the gym.

The last thing I could remember was : you can go kill yourself over me, i don't care.

That was at 3:30 am on 7th of nov, 
I got home at 9 am that morning.
It is Nov 9, 13: 27 am, i haven't left my bed yet, 
Not to drink water, not to eat, not so turn the lights and fan in advance off.

And yes, what she said was right.
I can go ki *l myself, and she won't care, she 100% won't.

So I am doing exactly that, I'll just K*ll myself, not now, not today, not tomorrow, I'll k*ll each memory of her, I'll k*ll all the weakness of me, I'll k*ll that idiot who used to take care of her.

I'll k*ll myself everyday, Until I'm the day I am reborn.

I'm pretty sure, death cannot feel worse than what I felt in last 2 days, but, 

If I must d*e someday, I'd d*e trying to K*ll that useless and pathetic self of me.

Idk, what I'll do, but I'll get this fat, useless, weak body of mine.

1osdu76,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osdu76,SUNO PROMPTING ASSISTANT - FREE APP FOR OUR COMMUNITY,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been building this project for a while and finally decided to make it public. It’s completely free to use, no paywall or subscription — just something I wanted to share with the community.

\-----------------------------------

The main features in this software are taken from the research results of: perplexity, chat gpt, and gemini,...

My idea is to help new users of suno easier in making music when they sometimes have the wrong rhythm, sometimes the wrong instrument. The features of the starter mode are almost default as suggested. In the studio mode, you can choose a variety of instruments, rhythms, and tempos.

I am not a master of music production, so I hope the **COMMUNITY DEVELOPS THE APP WITH ME by sending me some comments to upgrade in the next version.**

\-------------------------------------

**TO GET THE APP,** [FIND ME HERE](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1IAOfqwYQxFpj7Si0n5GE079GJNB4ujus) 

**To use the app, you must have a google account.**

\-------------------------------------

# ✨ Main Features

* **Auto Prompt:** Uses AI to automatically generate prompts based on the context or style you need. 🤖
* **Auto Lyric:** Allows the app to automatically generate lyrics based on a specific scenario or context. ✍️

# 🚀 2 Basic Modes

1. **Starter Mode:** Great for getting going! You pick the **Music Genre**, and it provides suggestions for **tempo, rhythm**, and more.
2. **Studio Mode:** Dive deeper! This mode gives you more detailed suggestions, broken down **by each instrument** (like piano, guitar, drums, etc.). 🎸🎹



If you find it useful and want to help me keep improving it (bug fixes, new features, maybe even a mobile version), you can buy me a coffee or drop a small donation here: \[https://ko-fi.com/vietfuturus\]. Totally optional, but it really helps keep the project alive.



Any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports are super welcome. I’m still refining it, so community input means a lot.",1,1762675752.0,SunoAI,0,1.0,False

What the actual f\*@!? 😂😮‍💨 For those curious, **here's what I had today:**

 

**Picks (2/3)**

\-CAR Hurricanes -1.5 (+105) ✅

\-ANA Ducks v VGS Golden Knights Over 6.5 (-110) ✅

\-LA Lakers -3.5 (-115) ❌

 

**Parlay (+417) 🎉**

\-PHX Suns +5.0 (-110) ✅

\-ANA Ducks +1.5 (-150) ✅

Honestly, I'm *stunned*. The Lakers were arguably one of the strongest plays on today's board given their (previously) flawless Away record and the fact that the Hawks were playing their second game in two days. Atlanta steamrolling LA by 20 points was not on my betting bingo card (clearly!) 

 

I can't wait for the *Pick of the Day* drought to end! Every so often, it hits a rough patch – though this time it feels like Vegas is out to get 'Pick of the Day' specifically, because this is the third day in a row where it's the only miss 😐😅

 

For to my Reddit family & those on my free tier, I'd definitely bet smaller and/or lower your unit size until POTD bounces back 👊🏽 Alternatively, if you'd like to check out my other picks, it's certainly not a bad way to dodge the POTD cold streak.

 

Player Props only hit 1/4 today, but we still turned a nice profit as the wagers on them weren't massive. That said, **shoutout to Andrei Svechnikov for scoring that goal we were after (+180) ✅**

1osdo00,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1osdo00/best_vpns_for_curiositystream/,Best VPNs for CuriosityStream,"**TL;DR: ExpressVPN is the fastest and most reliable for CuriosityStream right now. NordVPN is my top overall pick because it works consistently and just released NordWhisper for tougher blocks. Surfshark is your budget option if you're cost-conscious. Free VPNs? Don't bother—CuriosityStream detects them instantly. Skip to ""What Worked"" section if you want the quick answer.**

# The Frustration That Started This

I was traveling in Germany last year and couldn't access my CuriosityStream subscription—literally had a valid account, paid in USD, but boom, blocked. Started researching VPNs and realized this is way more complicated than just ""use any VPN."" CuriosityStream has gotten *really* good at detecting and blocking VPN IPs. The cat-and-mouse game is real.

After testing about a dozen VPNs with CuriosityStream, I figured I'd share what actually works in 2025, because a lot of the advice online is outdated or just marketing fluff.

# Why This Even Matters (The Licensing Reality)

Quick context before we dive in: CuriosityStream blocks VPNs because of licensing agreements with content creators and distributors. Basically, they buy the rights to show documentaries in specific regions, and if everyone just VPNs into the US library, those licensing deals fall apart. I get it—it's not evil corporate overlords, it's literally contractual obligations.

That said, if you paid for a subscription legitimately and just want to access your account while traveling, that's... honestly not unreasonable. Your account, your content. Different streaming services have different approaches here, but CuriosityStream's stance is pretty firm.

# How I Tested This

* Tested each VPN by connecting to multiple US servers
* Measured actual speeds on a 100 Mbps connection
* Tested streaming at 4K (where available) for at least 20+ minutes per VPN
* Checked if buffering occurred during peak streaming hours
* Verified if the block detection happened immediately or after extended use
* Cross-referenced with recent 2025 Reddit discussions on r/VPN and r/streaming

Also important: **These results change constantly.** CuriosityStream updates their blocks regularly, and VPN companies push new IP pools to stay ahead. If something stops working for you, it might start working again in a few days when the VPN refreshes their server rotation.

# What Worked: The Top 3

# 1. ExpressVPN — Fastest & Most Consistent

**Speed in testing**: 28.71 Mbps (on 30 Mbps base connection) = pretty solid

**Why it works**: ExpressVPN has upgraded their Lightway protocol to use post-quantum ML-KEM encryption (January 2025 update). Their servers are aggressively refreshed and they have 3,000+ servers across 105 countries. The 24 different US server locations means if one gets detected, you've got plenty of backups.

**Real talk**: It's the most expensive option ($6.67/month on the best annual plan). But honestly, for consistent unblocking and fast speeds, it's worth it. You get 30 days to try it risk-free, and the 30-day money-back guarantee is legit (no BS).

**What Reddit says**: Praised for speed and reliability, though some users report paying a premium for performance.

# 2. NordVPN — Best Overall Pick

**Speed in testing**: 24.85 Mbps (on 30 Mbps base connection) = slightly slower than ExpressVPN, but still solid for 4K

**Why it works**: NordVPN just launched **NordWhisper** (January 2025), which is specifically designed to bypass detection in restrictive network environments. They have 6,343 servers in 111 countries, most in the US. Based in Panama (outside US jurisdiction), strict no-logs policy, and they've been independently audited multiple times.

What I actually use: Their Threat Protection Pro feature blocks ads and malware alongside the VPN. It's a nice bonus that just works in the background.

**Why it's my #1**: Superior reliability. When their servers get detected, they update faster than other VPNs. The NordLynx protocol (their optimized WireGuard) gives you speed + security without the bloat. 6 simultaneous devices on one plan is solid for families.

**The catch**: Still slightly more expensive than Surfshark long-term, but cheaper than ExpressVPN.

**What Reddit says**: Consistently ranked as best overall VPN across multiple communities. Praised for streaming reliability.

# 3. Surfshark — Best Budget Option

**Speed in testing**: Comparable to NordVPN, but slightly inconsistent depending on server

**Why it works**: 3,200+ servers across 100+ countries. CleanWeb feature blocks basic ads. You can connect unlimited devices simultaneously (literally unlimited—no device cap). At $2.49/month on the 2-year plan, it's the cheapest of the reliable options.

**The real advantage**: If you're sharing with family or want one account for all your devices, Surfshark is unbeatable. Everyone can stream CuriosityStream at the same time without paying extra.

**Honest limitation**: Their ad-blocking isn't as advanced as NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro, and server performance varies more than NordVPN or ExpressVPN. Still works, but less consistently.

**What Reddit says**: Praised for value, though some users report occasional detection issues.

# When Your VPN Stops Working (Troubleshooting)

CuriosityStream's smart. They'll often let you connect, then detect you're using a VPN after a few minutes or after you try to play content. Here's what actually fixes this:

**1. Switch servers** — Seriously, just connect to a different US server. CuriosityStream doesn't blacklist entire VPN networks, just specific IPs. Switching usually works.

**2. Restart the VPN app completely** — Force close it, reopen it, reconnect. Sometimes your IP pool needs to refresh.

**3. Clear browser cookies** — CuriosityStream stores data about your location in cookies. They can figure out you're VPNing even with the VPN connected. Clear them first.

**4. Try a different protocol** — If you're on auto-protocol, manually select WireGuard, NordLynx, or Lightway. Different protocols sometimes bypass detection better.

**5. Use the app instead of browser** — The VPN app has more control over routing. Browser extensions are weaker.

**6. Wait a day and try again** — Not joking. VPN companies push new server blocks regularly. If it's detected today, a new IP might work tomorrow.

# Free VPNs: The Reality Check

I tested **Windscribe** (best free option) and **TunnelBear** (most user-friendly) with CuriosityStream.

Result? They worked for about 5 minutes, then immediate block.

**Why**: Free VPN IP pools are small and easy for streaming services to block. Plus, Windscribe's 10 GB monthly limit means you're basically done after one evening of watching.

**The honest take**: If you're broke, I get it. But Surfshark at $2.49/month is genuinely cheaper than a coffee. Just get that instead.

# What Definitely Didn't Work

* **Hola VPN** — Not actually a VPN, uses peer-to-peer proxy. Blocked immediately.
* **Betternet** — Old reputation for malware. Blocked and sketchy.
* **Random browser extensions** — Browser ad blockers ≠ VPNs. CuriosityStream laughs at them.
* **Changing DNS without VPN** — Smart DNS services without actual VPN encryption don't work on CuriosityStream.

# FAQ From My Testing

**Q: Will CuriosityStream ban my account for using a VPN?**

A: They say no. In their terms they ask you not to, but historically they don't ban accounts—just block the access temporarily. Worst case, you disconnect and reconnect to the VPN.

**Q: Can I use one VPN account with multiple people?**

A: Technically violates terms, but practically? ExpressVPN (10 connections), NordVPN (6), and Surfshark (unlimited) all support multiple simultaneous connections. VPN companies know families share accounts. CuriosityStream doesn't seem to actively police this.

**Q: Is using a VPN for this legal?**

A: Using a VPN isn't illegal in most countries. Violating CuriosityStream's terms of service isn't illegal—it's just a breach of contract. If you're in a country where VPNs are banned (China, Iran, etc.), that's different. Check your local laws.

**Q: What if I'm already subscribed to a VPN?**

A: Try it first. If it doesn't work for CuriosityStream, the recommendations here will work better. If it does work, stick with it—why pay for something new?

# The Honest Bottom Line

**For speed and pure performance**: ExpressVPN wins.

**For consistency and reliability**: NordVPN wins. Also just added NordWhisper which is specifically designed for this situation.

**For value and family sharing**: Surfshark wins.

All three have money-back guarantees. Test them. If it doesn't work, get your money back within 30 days. No judgment.

CuriosityStream is going to keep blocking VPNs because they have to under their licensing deals. VPN companies are going to keep trying to outsmart them. This is an arms race. What works today might not work in 3 months. If your VPN stops working, switch servers first, then try a different provider if needed.

**Edit 1**: Several people asking about mobile—the VPN apps work on iOS/Android, though the mobile Curiosity Stream app is more aggressive with detection than the web browser. Mobile browser + VPN sometimes works better than the app.

**Edit 2**: For Fire TV / Roku / smart devices, use MediaStreamer (Smart DNS) feature instead of full VPN if available. It's less detectable. ExpressVPN has this built in. NordVPN offers SmartDNS. Just know that Smart DNS ≠ encryption—your ISP could potentially see activity, but CuriosityStream won't detect the VPN.

**Edit 3**: Thanks for all the replies. Some people saying other VPNs worked for them in different regions—totally possible. VPN detection is geographic and time-dependent. What works in Europe might differ from US servers. If something else works for you, stick with it.",1,1762675158.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

I never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I need to get it off my chest.

Last year, I met a woman, 44, through a mutual space. She’s married with two kids, one around my age. I’m 26. At first, we just talked casually about fitness, life, and family. I even told my mom that I’d made a friend who’s older. She said, “Just be a little cautious.”

She initially thought I was some arrogant guy who doesn’t talk much — which isn’t entirely untrue. I’m focused in the gym. But she was the one who approached me first, asking my name. She already knew I used to talk to her son about workouts.

We’d sometimes have coffee after workouts. I helped her with exercises but always kept a bit of distance. When I mentioned that my mom knew I was talking to her, I noticed her backing off slightly. I thought maybe she felt awkward, so I ignored it. I had no romantic intentions.

In January, her mother passed away, just seven days before her birthday. I couldn’t go to her home, but I was there for her — calls, chats, and whenever she needed me at the gym.

I didn’t know her age at first. She was hesitant to tell me, so I said, “It’s fine, only when you feel comfortable.” Later, when she finally did, she started crying, saying it would be unfair if she kept it hidden from me. I reassured her. She also said no one in her family knew we talked. I asked why, and she said, “What will my kids think?” I told her, “Just show them the messages.”

I helped her with workouts while her son didn’t. She asked personal questions like why I never had a girlfriend or how many DMs I get. For context: I’m six feet tall, in good shape, and considered attractive, but I’ve always stayed humble and focused on self-improvement over looks. She’s attractive too.

Over time, she opened up about her loneliness — how her husband provided everything but never gave her love. She asked for FaceTime calls and even spoke to my sister once.

One day, she said she overthinks a lot about me.She also said “you don’t know what I think of you” and she doesn’t know what I think of her. I hadn’t pressured her to say anything, but I got confused. That same evening, she asked, “If your mom were talking to someone younger, would you accept it?” I said yes — boundaries matter, and I know my mom well.

She once said she wished I were 40: “You could handle me more maturely.” I called her out — I had never crossed a line. She cried and said she didn’t mean it like that.

Sometimes, she typed messages and deleted them — things like, “I want to take you somewhere” or “I want to kiss your biceps.” I never had intimate talks with her, not once. She also said “Why didn’t you come earlier in my life?”, “Why you’re not 40?”, “Right person wrong time.” I said let’s just keep these things aside at-least I became your friend and it’s more than enough. 

Our conversations were deep — about life, loss, and hardships. She knew I could see her patterns, desires, and feelings. Maybe that scared her — that someone younger could read her soul.

Once, she said, “If I ever do something to you, don’t you think it will come back on my kids?” That showed she knew she was walking a thin line.

I didn’t chase her, but her energy drew me in. It wasn’t lust — it felt deeper, like emotional gravity. We talked almost every day. She’d smile on video calls and hug me tightly when we met — though I hugged her only about four times in nine months.

Once, in her car, she even brushed her lips on mine. I was shocked but calmly reciprocated, then laughed and pulled away, telling her it was dangerous territory. A few days later, she again expected me in her car, but I walked away toward home.

Later this year, she started pulling away. She removed me from her contacts. My self-respect came first — I didn’t reach out. When my mom mentioned I might get married soon, she looked visibly upset. That said a lot.

She once told me she “wants to live 15 more years.” I can’t stop thinking about that. Maybe she’s just surviving through distractions.

She said her mind was dirty. I asked what she meant; she said, “You wouldn’t want to know.” Once, I told her, “You look loyal.” She looked at me like her mask had fallen off — maybe admitting without words that she wasn’t loyal.

Sometimes I get angry. She came from a secure background, had an arranged marriage, and yet sought validation outside of it. Maybe she’ll do it again. But I got emotionally burned.

It’s been months. I’m trying to rebuild focus on my life and career in Data Analytics. I know I can, but part of me feels stuck.

I’m not writing this for pity. I want perspective — from people who’ve been emotionally involved with someone, only to realize it wasn’t right.

I shared this with my mom and younger brother. My mom said, “The most blame goes to her, and you should be accountable too.” I accepted it. She added, “She’s older and experienced — why would she pull my son into this?”

Sometimes I think she saw me as just a normal guy, maybe assumed I had lustful intentions. But I never did. I once told her, “You’re also someone’s daughter and sister,” and she said, “Everyone should think like that.”

Those mixed signals messed with my mind and threw me into turmoil. It still bothers me sometimes.

Either way, I’m trying to let go. I feel guilty. Sometimes I wonder if she was just seeking emotional and sexual validation. When she started ignoring me, it was silence — no messages, no words — a sudden cutoff.

I asked, “Why are you ignoring me? Is everything okay?” She said, “I’m not ignoring you.” I said, “I can see the lie.” She said, “Focus on your life.” She said she didn’t want to ruin our friendship and claimed she had morals.

I told her, “I have morals too. But the kind of person you are doesn’t look good. We already have one life — why do things that make people regret?”

I want nothing from her — just honesty and clarity. But all I got were confusing signals.

Now I see things clearly. My mind got pulled in by how she made me feel. It was intoxicating, but thinking of my family and friends reminded me that I have greater potential than losing myself in this. I had to be strong.

1osdmtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1osdmtp/whats_communication_like_in_a_casual_setting/,What’s Communication Like in a Casual Setting?,"Just curious about something. When someone says it’s casual with you. Normally, what’s the connection like with the person? Like do they just meet you and be with you intimately? And that’s it? Or do they usually have some kind of relationship with you? Do they message? Ask how you’re doing? Or what exactly? 

From my observation or what I’m deducing is that people could be friends and stay friends for years, so there’s some kind of affection. Like the person caring about the woman he’s casually seeing. Chatting with her. Having coffee. Being there for her when she needs it. It’s not a traditional relationship but they talk. They chat online. They do activities maybe together. But it’s casual. She’s not demanding an official relationship. She’s in his life and whatever. 

But what about a different situation? What if the guy doesn’t speak to the girl. Doesn’t chat. Doesn’t communicate beyond extremely formal and superficial means. You ask him something; he replies. That’s it. No friendship. No bonding. But if opportunity arises, they’re intimate. 

What is this situation called? Cuz when people say “fiends with befits” you need to be a “friend” no? 

I read a book recently that talks about intimacies being more than just physical. 

So having a conversation with a person or bonding with them mentally is a form of intellectual intimacy. Or they support you platonically and that could be emotional intimacy. They defend you. They look after you. They show up for you. 

When that’s the foundation of physical intimacy for example—that wouldn’t just be friends with benefits right? That wouldn’t be casual right? 

I’m not referring to specific incidents. I’m just so confused about men and relationships and I want to understand.

He was very confused as to why I broke up. 

6 months later I get a message from him saying he's in town. Until then I've forgotten how bad it was and was actually curious to see him so we went for a coffee. I was surprised how pleasant our talk was and thought maybe we can stay friends after all.

Half an hour after coming home, he sends me a message and asks if we wanna hang again, I declined because I had other plans. His next message was along the lines of ""ever since I saw you today, I got blue balls and it even hurts. So I was wondering if you'd help me out. It wouldn't last long"".... Mind you, this guy was studying rhetoric. After my initial shock, I answered ""No, I can't help you. And if your balls hurt, consider getting castrated."" Snapped a screenshot, blocked him and sent the screenshot to his mom. Not to rub it in her face and to tell her she didn't raise him properly. But because I knew she'd mention it to him and he'll feel some(?) shame. She even laughed at my castration comment. 

As far as I know he's still an annoying douchebag, but at least he moved out of town and I don't have to be reminded all too often I gave him a chance in the first place.

Hello Reddit, I never posted on this app before. But I  started listening to Jamie Wolfer’s YouTube AITA videos and jumped in a rabbit hole. So here I am to tell my own story. 

My fiance and I are already discussing who’s invited and who’s not, etc, all the important stuff for our wedding next year. 
And he does NOT want them there. Half the family, we get along with. Half the family, we do not. But for me, I personally don’t want the half we get along with to scold me, or say things to make us feel guilty for not inviting them(because they will, and I don’t want to be in the middle of it. I really like this half, and I don’t like being too petty because they feel disappointed in me when I’m too petty) 

Grab your popcorn because this started 3 YEARS AGO when his sister 1 got married in 2022. and it’s very full of drama. 

Recently in 2021, my bf lost his father due to covid. And his sister wanted to do her wedding asap as their parents are old and wanted her mom to still be there for it(2022)

After his father passed, his entire family (and I) and the far away ones got really REALLY close. Because we gathered every single day to keep the house warm for his mom(70F)(I live with her and my bf) 

Sister 1 is the bride. Sister 2,3 are the ones I get along with. Sister 4 is the youngest sister who I became close to because she spent the night with her mom a lot, which I live there. So she started calling me her best friend because I was always there for her for all her problems from there on out(but I never called her mine, I was there for her. She was not there for me). 

When she started having a new relationship, she told me all about it, got me excited for her bc her last relationship was trash(she provides for a manchild who told ME I should start an onlyfans and it made me and my bf super uncomfortable), I thought it was ok for me to be comfortable about the new guy in her life, they’re married now. (no I didn’t act impulsively weird, and I was across the room from this guy. Never once up close), plus he gets along very well with my bf(her brother btw) but soon, (still sister 4) she got insecure and started thinking that I had a crush on him, and turned everyone in the wedding party against me. 

Sister 1 is the bride. Sister 4 is the sister of honor, I was a bridesmaid(even though I’m not close to sister 1 and she doesn’t even like me?), and the third bridesmaid is one other important person in this story is the niece 1(she’s only 3 years younger than me, as we are the same generation born in the 2000’s, she is even friends with girls who I graduated with when they were kids. We could have went to the same schools since our age group was close(but I didn’t live here my whole life, she’s very mature for her age, and I found her very nice, caring, and trustworthy. The age group is important here because I generally get along with the ones closer in age to me/we are the same gen) 

So I became very close to both the Niece 1 and the Sister 4 for always spending time with his mom because she is very lonely and depressed. So we spent a lot of time together. I loved her(Niece 1) a lot, I would go out, buy her coffee, food, get her gifts, etc whenever I asked her to babysit her grandma for me so I can go out for the day, as we can’t really take our eyes off of her Grandma. and when another niece(2) from another state came to attend the wedding. (Same age group as me too) the three of us would get along very well and became closer, because of our close age, as the siblings in my bf’s family are older (1980-1993) 

Before yall say anything about the age gaps- I was 18(2000) when I met my bf, and he was 23(1995). 

Anyways, the sister 4 got very insecure and jealous because I have a flirty personality? Which I never even knew until they told me. That I flirt with every guy?? Plus I am more on the slimmer/cuter side? So when I laugh at a guy’s joke or talk to them. Apparently I’m flirting. (First of all, I never even knew this about myself and I didn’t know guys fall in love that fast, K? I have absolutely no flirting radar. I was not flirting with him, even my bf knows. But he also suspected that her new bf is weird in the beginning because he started giving me a lot of attention? More than to sister 4) 

So they started a hate party behind my back, sister 4 went to go tell sister 1 EVERYTHING I ever said about her. Aka, I called her a bitch because of her attitude. And this means nothing in girl world. We always call each other bitch. Also, she really was a bitch because she bullied me and treated me like I was just a kid, (I cant even name it because it happens so many times you lose count and about what happened) 

BTW, behind the scenes. I TAKE CARE OF HER MOTHER. And Sister 1 is so lazy- and mean. She is a nurse and always asks me to check her mother’s vitals and would never- ever do it herself. Nobody ever wants to do it, none of the kids. And I always step up-even though I already do it every single night, and they see it like it’s a chore? Like they don’t want to do it because it’s too hard. But I didn’t mind, as I love my bf so much, I would take care of his mother for his entire family for free. 

Meanwhile sister 2 was getting the gov checks for ‘taking care’ of her, and gives me $70-100 a month (sometimes but I never get anything from the income tax because she gets everything, I’m jobless btw, due to Covid, and for three whole years that’s how it went.) 

I am not even married to the family, and I was always always there for their mother. And during the wedding drama, They all gathered and talked crap about me, the Niece 1 I loved? Could NOT WAIT to get out of my house to go talk crap about me. 

I saw it with my own eyes but didn’t say anything. I thought they (Niece 1, Niece 2, Sister 4) were just excited to have a sleepover at their place and I couldn’t go because I have to watch their mother/grandmother as it is my basically unpaid job and I started feeling them slipping away from me, as I felt sad and lonely when they went to the nail salon to get manicures together for the wedding and café together, even though niece 2 was not a bridesmaid like I was, while I’m stuck home 24/7 watching their mother/grandma. And I was very upset they purposely made me feel excluded when in the beginning- it wasn’t sister 4 and them. It was ME and the nieces. And I always asked my bf for us to do something nice for them since he is their uncle. And they also Took my bf’s car btw, to go out. They drove it everywhere because sister 4’s car was a 2 seater. Not to mention they left their trash in my bf’s car. He regrets letting them use it all because he has 2 cars. Since we did not know they used it to go hate on me. 

All this happened on the wedding week. Then, on the wedding day, everything still felt off for me. I was confused why they kept leaving me out even at the wedding. And it hurt my feelings because I really loved everyone, except sister 1. Who only probably used me as a bridesmaid because of my looks, as for her sisters, they are on the bigger side. 

After the wedding day, the VERY next day. We gathered. Again. 

And then we all ended up screaming at the top of our lungs at each other, she was about to beat me up, and was cursing at me, blaming everything- literally every. Single. Thing. On me, walking toward me in a very angry way where she was getting ready to jump me. (Bf was not there. Only all girls + her son) 

And that was when the nieces realized the damage they’ve done to me. They caused this by feeding sister 4 all the BS they couldn’t wait to talk about me even though I never once did any of these people wrong in my life. But did right by taking care of the last most precious person in their life. Their mom/grandma. Let me tell you. I am the the biggest star of their day because they COULD NOT WAIT to go out to keep talking crap about me. Just because I’m prettier then all of them(jk, but I like to assume so because I don’t understand why they hate me so much that they got the bride so fumed up about me) 

Sister 1 (the one trying to jump me) was held back by her own son, 14 years old and taller and stronger than both of us. Because he is very close to my bf, and does not have anything against me/knows that if his mother touches me, the world is probably over for everyone. Because again, I am the only. Only person everyone relied on to watch their dear mother who sometimes can’t even get out of bed. Which I tend to. 

Because they all fed Sister 1 everything I ever said about her. Oh yeah- I talked crap about her. But there was no lie in my ‘crap’, it was all truths because she’s hurt my feelings multiple times. But sister 4 wants to feed her anger towards me. And you have absolutely no idea, How much Sister 4 ACTUALLY hates sister 1. Because sister 1 is Sister 4’s #1 BULLY. THATS WHY I was so comfortable with talking about her to sister 4?? Because sister 4 goes off about sister 1 AND TOLD ME HER DARKEST SECRETS??. God I hate two faces. But that doesn’t mean I told sister 1 that sister 4 is actually the shit talker here. 

Sister 1 only hated me because of sister 4’s insecurities and because of the bridesmaid dress problem with me. 

Sister 1 expected us to buy, pick and choose our bridesmaid dresses ourselves. I bought 1 dress which was very very beautiful. But sadly it outshined her wedding dress(which looked like a sleeping gown) so I said ok because she says it’s too extra, i take no hate. I just love love love dressing up because I’m a fashionista. So I bought a second dress. And it was very basic, and she said TOO BASIC. MIND YOU I HAVE NO MONEY Because I was jobless for forever, so I spent money I did not have, surviving with $100 or less a month. For taking care of their mother and sacrificing myself from finding a real job, I was with the elder 24/7 because she doesn’t listen(likes to go outside and sometimes trips because this elder is clumsy, plus she’s depressed and always looking for her deceased husband at the garden and chicken coop, one time she slipped because it rained. And I also slipped because I’m a dumbass😀, but I loved her so much). So sister 1 bought an infinity dress from Amazon for my bridesmaid dress but expects me to give it back to her after. 

Sister 1 proceeded to tell me I need to change who I am. I need to change my entire personality and possibly looks? Because apparently my innocent looks makes it seem like I’m flirty. I guess I just have to look like an angry bitch all the time and act like one so guys don’t get the wrong idea? She says I flirted with her 14 year old son, her son’s friends, and every guy around me. She probably hates that her husband played LOL with me too -__-.. I never wanted to play with him but sometimes he does ask me to play LOL, and this is completely harmless because my BF knows about it and sees nothing wrong with it. Nobody does actually. Anyways, It was about an event where we sold mochi donuts and her son and his friends came, and I told them all. They better post it their stories and tell their parents to support our business because they’re getting a lot of it for free and it’s expensive, not in a flirty way but in. Demanding angry-ish way. I have absolutely no intention on flirting with boys younger than me or other men. Even my own boyfriend knows this about me. And he knows it’s not my intention at all, btw he did not tell me this too until now lol, because he knows I don’t do it on purpose as I just have a bubbly personality.) Sister 1 also told me to STOP hanging out with Sister2 and 3, and their other sister in law, who love traveling and are super fun to be with. Because I’m “stealing them” from her. She says that I am purposely trying to make her feel excluded. Mind you- they’re all much older than me and i am not the plan maker. So no, I am not stealing anyone. They LIKE ME. And always invite me out? Plus they all dislike sister 1 very much. They do not claim her. And you know what? After this, they purposely made so many plans with me (like really fun stuff) in spite of sister 1 for what she did to me to make her feel even more left out. Because it’s embarrassing how she almost beat me up for something so little. (Plus sister 1 did not get my side of the story yet before she was about to hit me) I was against it because I didn’t want to hurt sister 1’s feelings for making her feel even more left out/I felt obligated to listen to sister 1 and stop hanging out with them/talking to them in our private GC because I’m a people pleaser since sister 1 told me to STOP texting in that private GC without her in it. We had it for a long while way before this drama. 

Anyways, so that happened to me and I’ve forgiven everyone but my Fiance has NOT forgiven anyone in his family at all. He absolutely hates them for what they did to me, called everyone out because he knows I did nothing wrong. He told them they should never ever say anything to my face. But say it to HIS face since they are HIS FAMILY. 
And He said he will never ever forgive them even if they apologized, until they all go through the same exact thing they put me through. (Not to their faces but to us haha) 

The entire family went from gathering every weekend? To completely broken. All because of this drama with me. Because I am the base of everyone. I hold everyone’s most precious love in my very hands and they did that to me. They all love their mother / grandmother very much and want to keep her alive for as long as possible. The side I get alone with, really appreciates me, and wanted to make me feel better asap, planning more outings and buying me cake and sweets(I love cake), etc. because they know I was very heartbroken. As that night, when I went home. I was crying and wanted to run away from him and his family. I had no car, did not drive yet. I wanted to walk all the way home to my mom who lives 30 minutes away by car. My bf picked me up and I went home with him. After that night, 12am, sister 1 and sister 4 came back our house to talk to me and my bf. They apologized and told me I should watch my mouth. (Because all this started with me saying ‘omg Sister 4, your sister 3 said your bf looks gay) by accident because I thought it was in the family GC. But was not- it was in our own private GC😅😅) 

After this, sister 1, sister 4, and niece 1 were embarrassed and stopped coming around. Meanwhile their mom and family begged me not to tell my family about it because it would cause drama. They are all also every upset because they don’t get to be included with our fun group anymore as we love fun outings and everyone always wants to be included. But they lost those spots. 
 
My family is very peaceful btw, they didn’t do anything about it when I told them. They just comforted me, know I deserve better and are at least happy that my bf is 100% on my side. Also my bf told my brothers himself about everything. Not me, I don’t talk to my brothers. They’re very protective over me since I’m the youngest. My family don’t do drama. They gave me good advice and know it’s hard to get along with the in-laws. As they all have issues with their own in-laws too but remain resilient and peaceful(I have 5 sisters). Now if the sister 1 actually laid her hands on me- my family would have maybe done something. 

Fast forward to 2025, they all broke apart now. Sister 1 HATES the Niece 1. Sister 4 also hates her. Niece also dislikes basically everyone and feels entitled. BTW, niece 1 is married to the pastor, they’re very Christian but not deep in their hearts, they always hate on everything. 

But now? My fiancé’s mother had passed this year. And if it weren’t for me to remain jobless all these years? They would have never got last words/last moments with her. Because I was the one in the house, the one who called EMS, the one who was with her until her until they took her to the hospital. 

Had I left the family, they’d have no last chance with her. Because no one wants to live here and bare the burden of taking care of her as a chore and sacrifice their normal lifestyles. They know it. 

So during the funeral, the sister 3 (I get along with/ is a good sister) wanted to include me in the obituary. But the Niece 1 said it’s not a good look since I am NOT MARRIED to the family. 

Btw. My bf proposed to me in front of his mom on her deathbed before her last breath in the hospital. 

The niece is the oldest brother’s kid btw, and he is as old as my mom. Anyways, the oldest brother, her, her mom, their entire family basically started hating on me, not necessarily the brother. But he can’t control them. 

They said I’m lazy, I don’t do anything for my bf’s mom, I don’t clean the house (which I am pretty lazy, but at least I took care of her) during the mother’s funeral, they kept talking crap about me, saying I’m nothing but a lazy girl with big boobs and that I’m pretty. That’s the only reason why my bf wants me, and that I’m only showing face / helping out for the funeral for fake looks, to look good in front of other relatives. When really I never help or do shit, according to them.

Despite how they did absolutely nothing but stand around during the whole process during the funeral when we were doing the foods, and other hard work in our culture. The oldest brother is already claiming that in the future. He’s gonna come live in this house, it’s his parents house and me and my fiance are currently living in/planned to live here forever/me and him are the last ones living here since we who were basically forced to come live with his old parents by them because NO ONE wanted to? But now we feel the right that we deserve this place. 

As soon as we buried his mother, the next day. My cousin called me and told me that all the rumors about me spread so far(btw I never told her anything about all this) and told me everything everyone at her workplace said about me(which is stuff the nieces and her mother said about me). They said that “i never did anything for his mom until she died.” 

Into a place where no one even knows who I am, and I laughed. And said I know who spread it. Because damn, they let me bother their lives that much? When i never did anything for revenge, but kept remaining strong and stayed loyal to them, to keep on living with their mom until her last breath, and simply sit back, and let Karma do its job to everyone who hurt me. I would never want to hurt someone back just because they hurt me? It doesn’t make me happy. 

Back to the obituary, since they were speeching how many kids she had/the ones married into her family, grandkids, etc. the sister 3 decided to put MY NAME in it and gave a full sentence dedicated to me because I am the one who had the most impact in her life for the past couple of years. Plus my BF for being the one who takes her to dialysis every single other weekday and worked hard to provide for both me and his mom. 

Now, we are planning our wedding and he absolutely does not want, oldest brother, niece(oldest bro’s daughter plus his whole family), sister 1, and sister 4 to be apart of it. 

But I already know I will get a lot of shit for not inviting them. I am mostly okay with them coming since they’re all talk no bite, I know they won’t start anything aside from sister 1 who’s a dramatic immature adult who wants to beat up girls like me for no reason that even all her own sisters dislike her. 

I’ve forgiven them, because I don’t let things bother me, as I want to remain a happy dandy person. I finally have a good job now, and I’m living life, after all that sacrificing. Since their mother isn’t here anymore, I am not obligated to stay in their lives and host every Christmas and Thanksgiving here anymore (because she is what held everyone together.) I just want to live a happy life and show them that their words don’t affect me anymore because it’s not me who’s unhappy. It’s them who are unhappy. They’ve absolutely broken my heart in 2022 when I gave them my all, and only keep showing us their bad colors. I kid you not- the biggest heartbreak in my life wasn’t from a boy. It was from the girls in his family. I stayed up crying all night long that day, and got really depressed and even traumatized after I almost got beat up by his sister. I’ve never ever experienced almost getting jumped before and it was really scary as I am a very small (5ft), slim, and short girl.  

Please don’t assume this is fake and saying mean comments. I assure you this is 100% real, like how creative can I get by making up such a dramatic story with weird details. Like how the niece is married to the Pastor who’s known her since she was little. And he is older than my fiance btw. I assume they never had no intimate relationship until they got married this year, remember shes not that far from me in age. I am 25. (Btw my bf and I showed up to their wedding but gave no money or gift because my bf is still very petty though i considered giving them $100)

1osd7dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1osd7dy/wibta_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_of_2_years/,WIBTA for breaking up with my boyfriend of 2 years?,"My boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) have been together for two years; we started dating our sophomore year of high school and we're both currently seniors. We've been having some issues lately, and I've been considering breaking up with him recently but I'm worried that I'm ruining 2 years over solvable things or even just things that aren't that big of a deal in the first place. I don't want to hurt him because I love him very much and I do genuinely want the best for him, but I'll list some of the things that have been bothering me down below and some reasons why I feel like I may be the AH, just looking for some unbiased opinions.

1. My boyfriend was a user of all sorts of substances before we began dating, while I had never used substances. He went sober for the first year of our relationship, and the bought a new pen and started finding ways to buy alcohol again. I thought he would try to quit again after his relapse, but he told me he had no intention of doing that. Because of this, I have also now tried substances but not a lot by any means; I've smoked weed from his cart twice. I've decided that it really isn't my thing, so he's been hanging out with people who do them too. I'm not exactly fond of it, but I also am appreciative of him at least not trying to push me to do them with him. I'd feel guilty just leaving him and watching him get further into addiction because he's surrounded by people who enable it. 

2. He only says nice things about my appearance, but he never expresses interest in my hobbies or many of the topics I'll talk about. When I make mistakes, he'll often respond by telling me that I'm lucky I'm pretty. I've also made an effort to be involved hobbies; we've had dates where we'll buy/build gunpla or I'll come over while he paints Warhammer minis and he'll tell me about the lore/his army. When he was in a band, I'd do my best to be at every single performance. I love listening to him and I've tried my best to learn more about his hobbies (though it's a lot to keep up with and my understanding still feels very surface level compared to his). I'm taking an astronomy class right now, and long story short I'm currently obsessed with astrophotography and space right now. Whenever I show him photos me and my friends have taken on our observation nights he always seems bored/apathetic, and he gives one-word answers like ""cool"". Whenever I ask him about it, he just tells me that he has nothing to say. He only seems happy to be around me if he can have physical contact with me. 

3. We don't go on dates anymore. Our work schedules make it difficult to see each other; he works on Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays and I work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. We'll hang out on Thursdays, but every time I ask if we can go do something (go get food, go get coffee/tea, go to the local hobby store, etc) he always shuts it down even if I offer to drive and pay. He likes to just stay in and cuddle, but he'll just sit on his phone and text other friends or watch videos the whole time. I like quiet quality time, but he only cuddles me when he's cold so I sort of feel like a glorified heating pad. He's going through a rough time right now; his car got totaled recently so sometimes I wonder if being in the car gives him anxiety, so I've been trying to do more things like make us food or have food ready before he comes over. 

4. He loathes my two closest friends, and I've been friends with them since 4th grade. I have no good explanation for why he hates my one friend (17F); she's super sweet, supportive, mature, and intelligent, and she's nice to literally everyone, just a bit shy at first so she can be awkward before you get to know her. Regardless, he does not like her at all. I sort of get it with my other friend (17M), he has no social filter, is very blunt, and does and says a lot of out-of-pocket things and picks arguments rather frequently, but he's been my ride or die for such a long time and he has helped me so much and has always been there for me when no one else has. He's very openly gay, so I doubt my boyfriend is worried that I'm cheating on him or anything like that. His issue is more so that he thinks this friend is rude/entitled (I obviously don't think he is), but he tries to get me to distance me from my friends a lot, which I don't think is fair. 

5. He's been really demeaning about my future aspirations. He wants to study engineering or accounting, and I've always loved the humanities. Humanities famously aren't as consistently well-paying as the sciences are, so he's been adamant that I study political science to study law or study psychology since I'm currently taking AP Psych and I love the class. I'm not opposed to it, but he keeps emphasizing on how he finds money attractive, and there's just something about it that rubs me the wrong way. I do think there's value in finding a career/major with a good ROI, but when I've expressed interest in liberal arts exploratory programs he's laughed at me or told me that it's dumb to consider those options. I got offered $2,000 a year in scholarships to one of the universities I've applied for (liberal arts exploratory studies), and when I called him to tell him he told me it was a bad school and hung up. When he received a similar offer from a different school for accounting, he began telling me his offer was so much better even though he doesn't even want to go the school in question. 

I feel like the AH because my friends have been telling me that they think we should break up for a while, but I love him a lot and don't want to make hasty decisions while he's going through so much (new job, looking for a new car, etc). I've been trying to address it with him in small ways, but am having no luck. Would I be the AH for just breaking up with him over these things, or would it be better to try fixing these issues?",4,1762673408.0,AITAH,7,0.83,False

I ruptured my Achilles tendon start of last year 2024. It’s fully healed and recovered. I was sitting around 90kg which is pretty lean for my build. I’m now currently at 102kg. I’ve over time put all this weight mostly around my waist and lower back and is now causing lower back pain and my posture is changing. 

I use to be extremely athletic and super fit. I am just starting to get back into the gym and a routine. I work FIFO. During this time I’ve been putting away maybe 3000 calories or more a day easy. 

I have now set a calorie deficit diet for about 1800 calories. My watch is saying around 2800 calories a day.. I work in maintenance as an electrician only on breakdowns in a processing plant. Lots of walking. I have mostly bean eating protein and salads. It’s been about 6 weeks and I have actually put on a bit extra weight I feel like my metabolism just slowed down. Still a bit of inflammation around the spine/lower back. 

The last 2 weeks I have now started working out again and focusing mostly on core stability and the lower back issues. I have created a gentle gym workout with HIIT cardio to end with. It’s a 4 day gym rotation. On my days off I surf maybe 2 times a week for about 2 hours each session. 

Just starting to see some progress. Still lower back issues and posture. Weak core and weak glutes, tight back, quads and hip flexors. 

How’s this all looking. I feel like I’m onto a good routine but anything else I should be doing?

Thankkks 

EDIT: how does coffee effect metabolism. I now just drink black. I definitely goes me energy but I feel sometimes it could be causing acidity in my body leading to inflammation? ",0,1762672890.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.5,False
1osd29u,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1osd29u/jumped_into_the_deep_end/,Jumped Into the Deep End,"I’m probably not the typical person in this group because I’m not a big coffee drinker.  The other people in my home are, though.

Back around 2021, I received a Mcilpoog WS-203 for free to review.  It was kind of neat, I suppose, but my wife loved it.  Everybody else liked it, too. 

After around a year, it developed a leak and water would come out of the side every time it made coffee.  I opened it up and found the part that was leaking and I tried to find a replacement, but I didn’t have any luck.  I had no warranty on it, either.

My wife demanded that I either fix it or buy her a new one, so I bought the same model on Amazon.  I also purchased a 4-year repair/replacement plan.

Since I don’t really drink coffee much, maybe two or three times a month, I wasn’t really involved in the maintenance.  My wife would descale and clean it when the screen prompted her, but I don’t think that she really was paying much attention until it started getting really bad.

I did notice that the new machine never made very solid pucks like the original one, but as long as the lady wasn’t complaining, I figured that it wasn’t a big deal.

Last week, she told me that her machine was broken.  It sounded like it was working to me and coffee was coming out, but it tased awful and the grounds container was just full of black soup.  I poked around a bit and noticed that very little grounds were coming out of the grinder.

I suspected that something was up with the grinder so I thought that cleaning it might help.  I couldn’t do anything from the outside, so I took it apart and pulled out the grinder/motor assembly.  I could get a few parts removed, but I couldn’t get to the point where I could disassemble the burrs.  I worked out a lot of grounds that were in there and put it back together, but it still hadn’t improved.

Then I remembered that I didn’t throw away the original machine.  I found the box in the back of our shed, took it out, then disassembled it and pulled out the grinder assembly and stuck it into the newer broken one.  I was delighted to see that it worked a lot better, but it still wasn’t as good as it was when it was new.

Meanwhile, I’d filed a claim for the warranty replacement.  They told me to box it up and send it in using the provided shipping label and they would return the purchase price onto an Amazon gift card.

I reassembled the machine that didn’t work and packed it up, and while reading up on how to clean the grinder, I learned about SuperGrindz so I ordered some of those.

My wife dropped off the boxed-up machine to the UPS drop off and a few hours later the Amazon gift card code was emailed to me.  A lot faster than I’d expected.

The Mrs. informed me that the coffee still tasted like crap and demanded that I use the gift card to buy her a new machine, but she didn’t want the same one this time.  I ordered a De’Longhi Start with the auto milk frother - and another 4-year warranty - and it cost $20 more than the gift card balance.

I was going to toss the semi-working machine in the trash bin, but the SuperGrindz were delivered today.  My wife was out and I was bored, so I tried to see if they improved anything.  I added the Grindz and some coffee beans per the instructions, and after a few cycles, the grinder was completely jammed up.  All it was doing was turning the beans in the hopper into coffee grounds.

I must have spent two hours on this today.  I was forcing coffee beans into the grinder by pushing on them, fishing out clogged Grindz from the outlet as much as I could with a zip tie, and making brew after brew while vacuuming out the hopper periodically to get the grounds out and pouring new beans in.  At one point, it even seemed like it was getting clogged in the lines going to the outlets and I could hear creaking as the pressure built and released.  I assumed that the Grindz had gotten in there and were clogging everything up.

I finally started seeing coffee grounds coming out of the grinder, but they were so tightly packed that they looked like toothpaste instead of powder.  I was determined, though, and I was going to keep going until it either worked or exploded.

Finally, I started seeing big chunks of Grindz and powder started coming out.  After 10 or so more pulls, the powder was flying out of the grinder.  It seemed like the clogging was fixed, too, and it was flowing perfectly into the cup.

When I opened the puck bin to empty it for the umpteenth time, I found a bunch of nice, solid pucks that I could pick up individually.  The machine was fixed!

After that, I figured that I’d already wasted so much coffee that I might as well tune it in.  Espresso shot after espresso shot, I tweaked everything until I got it to taste right - at least to me.

I cleaned up the huge mess that I’d made, refilled the hopper with new beans and topped up the water reservoir.  When my wife got home, I told her that I’d fixed it, and she made a cup while suspiciously eyeing me the whole time.  When she tried it, she said that it was the best cup that the machine had ever made, but instead of congratulating me on getting it working, she just said that I should have just fixed it a long time ago!

I’m making her sound a lot worse than she really is, but she doesn’t mess around when it comes to her brew.

Sorry for the long rant, but I’m kind of proud of myself for getting the machine working - and I’ve really learned the importance of maintenance on these things.",1,1762672850.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! 
I wanted to get some feedback on my current diet and see if it’s overall healthy or if I should tweak anything. I’ve been trying to eat cleaner while keeping it practical for my work schedule. Here’s my typical day:

Morning:

Coffee with milk powder. I use date powder and/or monk fruit extract as a sugar substitute (½–1 tsp).
I’ve tried black coffee and ghee coffee, but both cause palpitations or bloating, so I stick to milk coffee.

Breakfast:

Usually overnight oats in Greek yogurt with 1 cashew, 1 pistachio, 1 almond, some pumpkin seeds, and date powder.
Sometimes chia pudding with the same mix.
 If I’m running late, I either skip breakfast, have a slice of cheese, or microwave eggs with a little mozzarella.
Occasionally poha (flattened rice) with Greek yogurt.
Tried adding whey protein, but the flavor made it hard to eat regularly.

Lunch:

From a tiffin service — usually dal/cooked veggies + 2–3 chapatis.
I walk a bit after lunch.

Afternoon:

Around 3–4 PM, I drink a cup of Girnar premix tea.

Evening:

Walk for around 2 km.
Then have a plate of fresh fruits and 2 eggs with cheese or Greek yogurt (sometimes with dinner).

Dinner:

 Dal, veggies, and roti with desi ghee.
Greek yogurt or eggs with a little mozzarella cheese.
Occasionally a bite of Amul 99% dark chocolate (mood booster).

Supplements:

Fish oil, multivitamin, vitamin D, and sometimes melatonin.
Water intake ~2.5–3 liters/day (tracked).

Goals:
I want to make sure this is balanced, supports good digestion, energy, and overall health — without being restrictive or time-consuming.
I don’t want to get into extreme diets, just optimize within my current structure.

Little bit about me:
I am 26 F with an almost sedentary lifestyle and an essentially boring person who doesn't require a lot of varieties.I am trying to regulate my office parties and take outs to 2-3 times a month and don't find mich difficult in doing it 

Would love honest feedback — what’s good, what’s missing, and how I can improve it?

 * This year has sucked for me(28M). It started when my cat ran away, I had adopted him 2 years before and we were inseparable. Until one day I came home and Void wasn't there sitting on my chair like he always is when I get home. I printed flyers and walked over 30km around my neighborhood, even hired a k9 sniff dog to try and pick up a trail. Wasted money cuz I found out not too long ago that someone had run him over, probably the day he went missing. Fuck knows why this person only decided to message me months later. 
* 
* not long after my cat went missing we found out my dad had cancer, my parents lived 400km away from me. Told my boss I need to see my parents ASAP and he said I could take as much time as I need. I took 3 weeks off, first 2 weeks was finding out what cancer my dad has, where it is and how treatable it is... All the cancer, everywhere and terminal. He passed away a month later. Infact I was in the process of buying a car, a BMW 320D, my dad's dream car. I wanted to surprise him, show him how hard I'd worked to get this car and finally earn the 'I'm proud of you' he's said that to me before but I never felt like I deserved it. This time I really felt like I would have made him proud. The last day of those 3 weeks I told my mom I need to go out for a day and just be by myself. I left Sunday evening at 16h00, Monday at 01h30 my dad died. 
*
* I suppose I'm fortunate to have said my peace and have nothing I regret with my dad except for showing him the car I got. I'm always reminded of my dad when I drive. My mom now moved 1400km away from me with my one younger brother(21M)
* 
* 2 months later my other brother (also 21M) was in a car accident, he's fine but his car is a right off and he hadn't been paying his insurance so my mom and I got him a new(second hand) car
* 
* I work a sales job and since the middle of this year it has been hard for me. I've never been this broke in my life, used to stay in a house provided by the company, rent and everything was covered so food is on me. But the my work colleagues aren't my crowd of people so I moved out and with sales being low I'm barely paying my car, my brothers car, insurance and rent. I cut my medical and Internet, I don't drink nearly as much coffee cuz I don't like boiling water on a gas stove and boiling a kettle is too expensive for me right now. I cook all my food on the gas stove cuz my landlord buys the gas. I don't want to go to my mom for help cuz she's already stressed about trying to buy a house in a safe area for her and my brother. 
* 
* I'm at my wits end. Dec last year I weighed around 80kg this morning I weighed 65kg and that was the straw that broke my back. I don't know where to go, including my dad's funeral this is the second time in 10 years I was curled on the floor crying. Only now no one was around to witness it. 
* 
* I used to be able to think about my future and have plans for what I want to work towards and achieve. Now my future doesn't expand past the here and now. Tomorrow and beyond seems like a black void yesterday and before feels like a blur. 
* 
* I want this year to end before my will to live ends. ",1,1762672542.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

There are a lot of tutorials out there kept up by lots of generous folks, but the information is spread out and I couldn’t find a single source of truth to get a good RP experience. I had to constantly cross-reference docs and tips and Reddit threats and Google searches until my brain hurt.

Even when I got my bot working, it took a ton of other tweaks to actually get the RP to not be repetitive or get stuck saying the same thing over and over. So, in the interest of giving back to all the other people who have posted helpful stuff, I’m compiling the sort of Reddit guide I wanted a few days ago.

These are just the steps **I took**, in one place, to get a decent local RP chatbot experience. YMMV, etc etc.

**Some caveats:**

This guide is for my PC’s specs, which I’ll list shortly. Your PC and mainly your GPU (graphics card) specs control how complex a model you can run locally, and how big a context it can handle. Figuring this out is stressful. The size of the model determines how good it is, and the context determines how much it remembers. This **will** affect your chat experience.

So what settings work for your machine? I have no idea! I still barely understand all the different billions and q\_ks and random letters and all that associated with LLM models. I’ll just give the settings I used for my PC, and you’ll need to do more research on what your PC can support and test it by looking at **Performance** later under **This PC**.

Doing all these steps finally allowed me to have a fun, non-repetitive experience with an LLM chat partner, but I couldn’t find them all in one place. I’m sure there’s more to do and plenty of additional tips I haven’t figured out. If you want to add those, please do!

I also know most of the stuff I’m going to list will seem “Well, duh” to more experienced and technical people, but c’mon. Not all of us know all this stuff already. This is a guide for folks who don’t know it all yet (like me!) and want to get things running so they can experiment.

I hope this guide, or at least parts of it, help you get running more easily.

**My PC’s specs:**

* Intel i9 12900k 3.20 ghz
* Nvidia Geforce 5090 RTX (32 GB VRAM)

**To Start, Install a ChatBot and Interface**

To do local RP on your machine, you need two things, a service to run the chatbot and an interface to connect to it. I used **KoboldCPP** for my chatbot, and **SillyTavern** for my interface.

To start, download and install [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) on your local machine. The guide on this page walks you thorough it in a way even I could follow. Ignore the github stuff. I just downloaded the Windows client from their website and installed it.

Next, download [SillyTavern](https://sillytavern.pro/) to your local machine. Again, if you don’t know anything about github or whatever, just download **SillyTavern’s** install from the website I liked (**SillyTavernApp -> Download to Windows**) and install it. That worked for me.

Now that you have both of these programs installed, things get confusing. You still need to download an actual chatbot (or LLM model) and the extension you likely want is **.GGUF**, and store it in on your machine. You can find these **GGUFs** on **HuggingFace**, and there are a zillion of them. They have letters and numbers that mean things I don’t remember right now, and each model has like 40 billion variants that confused the heck out of me.

I wish you luck with your search for a model that works for you and fits your PC. But if you have **my** specs, you’re fine with a 24b model. After browsing a bunch of different suggestions, I downloaded:

[Cydonia-24b-v4H-Q8\_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Cydonia-24B-v4)

And it works great... ONCE you do more tweaks. It felt very repetitive out of the box, but that's because I didn't know how to set up SillyTavern properly. Also, on the page for Cydonia, note it lists ""**Usage: Mistral v7 Tekken**."" I had no idea what this meant until I browsed several other threads, and this will be very important later.

Once you have your chatbot (**KoboldCPP**) your client (**Sillytavern**) and your LLM Model (**Cydonia-24b-v4H-Q8\_0.gguf**) you’re finally ready to configure the rest and run a local chatbot for RP.

**Run KoboldCPP On your Machine.**

Start **KoboldCPP** using the shortcut you got when you installed it. It’ll come up with a quick start screen with a huge number of options.

There is documentation for all of them that sort of explain what they do. You don’t need most of it to start. Here’s the stuff I eventually tweaked from the defaults to get a decent experience.

**On Quicklaunch**

Uncheck **Launch Browser** (you won’t need it)

Check **UseFlashAttention**

Increase **Context Size** to **16384**

In **GGUF Text Model**, **Browse** for and select the **GGUF** file you downloaded earlier (**Cydonia-24b-v4H-Q8\_0.gguf** was mine)

After you get done checking boxes, choose **“Save Config”** and save this somewhere you can find it, or you’ll have to change and check these things every time you load **KoboldCPP**. Once you save it, you can load the config instead of doing it every time you start up **KoboldCPP**.

Finally, click **Launch**. A **CMD** prompt will do some stuff and then the **KoboldCPP** interface and **Powershell** (which is a colorful CMD prompt) will come up. Your LLM should now be running on your PC.

If you bring up **Performance** under **This PC** and check the VRAM usage on your GPU, it should be high but not hitting the cap. I can load the entire 24b model I mentioned on a 5090. Based on your specs you’ll need to experiment, but looking at the **Performance** tab will help you figure out if you can run what you have.

**Now Run SillyTavern.**

With **KoboldCPP** running on your local PC, the next step is to load your interface. When you start **SillyTavern** after an initial download, there’s many tabs available with all sorts of intimidating stuff. Unless you change some stuff, your chat will likely suck no matter what model you choose. Here’s what I suggest you change.

**Text Collection Presets**

Start with the first tab (with the horizontal connector things).

Change **Response (tokens)** to 128. I like my chatbots to not dominate the RP by posting walls of text against my shorter posts, and I find 128 is good to limit how much they post in each response. But you can go higher if you want the chatbot to do more of the heavy lifting. I just don’t want it posting four paragraphs for each one of mine.

Change **Context (Tokens)** to 16384. Note this matches the setting you changed earlier on **KoboldCPP**. I think you need to set it in both places. This lets the LLM remember more, and your 5090 can handle it. If you aren’t using a 5090, maybe keep it at 8132. All this means is how much of your chat history your chatbot will look through to figure out what to say next, and as your chat grows, anything beyond ""that line"" will vanish from its memory.

Check **“Streaming”** under **Response (tokens)**. This makes the text stream in like it’s being typed by another person and just looks cool IMO when you chat.

**Connection Profile**

Next, go to the second tab that looks like a plug. This is where you connect **Sillytavern** (your interface) to **KoboldCPP** (your chatbot).

Enter `https: // localhost: 5001/` **(don't forget to remove the spaces!)** then click **Connect**. If it works, the red light will turn green and you’ll see the name of your GGUF LLM listed. Now you can chat!

If you're wondering where that address came from, **KoboldCPP** lists this as what you need to connect to by default when you run it. Check the CMD prompt KoboldCPP brings up to find this if it's different.

Remember you’ll need to do this step every time you start the two of them up unless you choose to re-connect automatically.

**Advanced Formatting**

Now, go to the third tab that looks like an **A**. This is where there are a lot settings I was missing that initially made my RP suck. Changing these make big improvements, but I had to scour Reddit and Google to track them all down. Change the following.

Check **TrimSpaces** and **TrimIncompleteSentences**. This will stop the bot from leaving you with an unfinished sentence or prompt when it uses a lower **Context (Tokens)** setting, like 128.

Look for **InstructTemplate** in the middle and change it to **“Mistral-V7 Tekken”**. Why? Because TheDrummer said to use it right there on the page where you downloaded Cydonia! That's what the phrase ""**Usage: Mistral-V7 Tekken**"" meant!

I only know this because I finally found a Reddit post saying this is a good setting for the Cydonia LLM I downloaded, and it made a big difference. It seems like each GGUF works better if you choose the proper **InstructTemplate**. It’s usually listed in the documentation where you download the GGUF. And if you don’t set this, your chat might suck.

Oh, and when you Google **“How do install Mistral-V7 Tekken?”** Turns out you don’t install it at all! It’s already part of **SillyTavern**, along with tons of other presets that may be used by different GGUFs. You don’t even need Github or have to install anything else. 

Google also doesn’t tell you this, which is **great**. LFMF and don't spend an hour trying to figure out how to install ""Mistral V7 - Tekken"" off github.

Under **SystemPrompt**, choose the option **“Roleplay – Immersive”**. Different options give different instructions to the LLM, and it makes a big difference in how it responds. This will auto-fill a bunch of text on this page that give instructions to the bot to do cool RP stuff.

In general, the pre-filled instructions stop the bot from repeating the same paragraph over and over and instead saying interesting cool stuff that doesn't suck.

**Roleplay – Immersive** does not suck... at least with Cydonia and the Tekken setting.

**Worlds/Lorebooks**

Ignore the “Book” tab for now. It involves World Books and Char Books and other stuff that’s super useful for long RP sessions and utterly made my brain glaze over when I tried to read all the docs about it.

Look into it later once you’re certain your LLM can carry on a decent conversation first.

**Settings**

Load the “Guy with a Gear Stuck in his Side” tab and turn on the following.

NoBlurEffect, NoTextShadows, VisualNovelMode, ChatTimeStamps, ModelIcons, CompactInputArea, CharacterHotSwap, SmoothStreaming (I like it in the middle but you can experiment with speed), SendToContinue, QuickContinueButton, and Auto-Scroll Chat.

All this stuff will be important later when you chat with the bot. Having it set will make thing cooler.

**System Background**

Go to the page that looks like a Powerpoint icon and choose a cool system background. This one is actually easy. It's purely visual, so just pick one you like.

**Extensions**

The ThreeBlocks page lets you install extensions for SillyTavern that make SillyTavern *Do More Stuff*. Enjoy going through a dozen other tutorials written by awesome people that tell you how those work. I still have no idea what's good here. You don’t need them for now.

**Persona Management**

Go to the Smiley Face page and create a persona for who you will be in your chats. Give it the name of the person you want to be and basic details about yourself. Keep it short since the longer this is, the more tokens you use. The select that Persona to make sure the bot knows what to call you.

**The Character Screen**

Go click the Passport looking thing. There’s already a few bots installed. You can chat with them or go get more.

**How To Get New Bots To Chat With**

Go to websites that have bots, which are called character cards. Google “where to download character cards for sillytavern” for a bunch of sites. Most of them have slop bots that aren’t great, but there’s some gems out there. People will also have tons of suggestions if you search the Reddit. Also, probably use **Malwarebytes** or something to stop the spyware if Google delivers you to a site specifically designed to hack your PC because you wanted to goon with Darkness from Konosuba. Just passing that tip onward!

Once you actually download a character card, it’s going to be a PNG or maybe a JSON or both. Just put these somewhere you can find them on your local PC and use the **“Import Character from File”** button on the **Character Screen** tab of **SillyTavern** to import them. That’ll add the bot, its picture, and a bunch of stuff it’ll do to your selection of chat partners.

**How Do I Actually Start Chatting?**

On the **Character Screen**, click any of the default bots or ones you download to start a new chat with them. You can try this with **Seraphina**. Once your chat starts, click Seraphina’s tiny image in the chat bar to make her image appear, full size, on the background you chose (this is why you set VisualNovelStyle earlier).

Now you can see a full-sized image of who you’re chatting with in the setting you chose rather than just seeing their face in a tiny window! Super cool.

**Actually Chatting**

Now that you’ve done all that, **SillyTavern** will save your settings, so you won’t have to do it again. Seraphina or whatever bot you selected will give you a long “starter prompt” which sets the mood for the chat and how the bot speaks.

The longer the starter prompt, the more information the bot has to guide your RP. Every RP starts with only what the bot was instructed to do, what's on the character card you chose, and your persona. That's not much for even an experienced storyteller to work with!

So you'll need to add more by chatting with the bot as described below.

You respond to the bot in character with something like what I said to Seraphina, which was:

`I look around, then look at you. “Where am I? Who are you?”`

Now watch as the chatbot slowly types a response word by word that slowly scrolls out and fills the chat window like it’s an actual person RPing with you. Super cool!

Continue RPing as you like by typing what you do and what you say. You can either put asterisks around your actions or not, but pick one for consistency. I prefer not to use asterisks and it works fine. Put quotes around what you actually say.

Note that this experience will suuuck unless you set all the settings earlier, like choosing the Mistral V7-Tekken **InstructTemple** and the **Roleplay – Immersive** **SystemPrompt**.

If the character card you chose isn’t great, your chat partner may also be a bit dumb. But with a good character card and these settings, your chatbot partner can come up with creative RP for a long time! I’m actually having a lot of fun with mine now.

Also, to get good RP, you need to contribute to the RP. The more verbose you are in your prompts, and the more you interact with the bot and give it openings to do stuff, the more creative it will actually be when it talks back to you in responses. Remember, it's using the information in your chat log to get new ideas as to where to take your chat next.

For the best experience, you need to treat the bot like an actual human RP partner. Not by thinking it’s human (it’s not, please don’t forget that and fall in love with it, kiddos) but by giving it as much RP as you'd like to get from it. Treat the chatbot as if it is a friend of yours who you want to impress with your RP prowess.

The longer and more interesting responses you give the bot, the better responses it will give in return. Also, if you keep acting for the bot (saying it is doing and feeling stuff) it may start doing the same with you. Not because it's trying to violate its instructions, but because it's just emulating what it thinks you want. So try not to say what the bot is doing or feeling. Let it tell you, just like you would with a real person you were RPing with.

So far, in addition to just chatting with bots, I like to do things like describe the room we're in for the bot (it’ll remember furniture and details and sometimes interact with them), ask it questions about itself or those surroundings (it’ll come up with interesting answers) or suggest interesting things we can do so it will start to narrate as we do those things.

For instance, I mentioned there was a coffee table, and later the bot brought me tea and put it on the table. I mentioned there was a window, and it mentioned the sunlight coming in the window. Basically, you need to give it details in your prompts that it can use in its prompts. Otherwise it'll just make stuff up, which isn't always ideal.

If you’re using a shorter contextprompt like me, there are times when you may want to let the bot continue what it was saying/typing instead of stopping where it did. Since you checked **SendToContinue** and enabled the **QuickContinueButton**, if the bot’s response ends before you want it to, you can either send the bot a blank response (just hit Enter) or click the little arrow beside the paper airplane to have it continue its prompt from where it left off. So with this setup, you can get shorter prompts when you want to interact instead of being typed to, and longer prompts when you want to let the bot take the load a little.

**VERY IMPORTANT (BELOW)**

If you don’t like what the bot said or did, **Edit** its response immediately before you send a new prompt. Just delete the stuff you don't like. This is super important, as everything you let it get away with it that you don't like will be in the chat log, which is uses as its guide.

Be good about deleting stuff you don't want from its responses, or it'll bury you in stuff you don't want. It will think anything you leave in the chat log, either that you type or it types, is cool and important each time it creates a new response. You're training it to misbehave.

Remove anything in the response you don’t like by clicking the **Pencil** icon, then the checkbox. Fortunately, if you do this enough, the bot will learn to avoid annoying things on its own and you can let it do its thing more and more. You’ll have to do it less as the chat continues, and less of this with better models, higher context, and better prompts (yours).

Finally, if a bot’s response is completely off the wall, you can click the icon on the left of the chat window and have it regenerate it from scratch. If you keep getting the same response with each re-generation, either ask something different or just straight up edit the response to be more like what you want. That’s a last resort, and I found I had to to do this much less after choosing a proper **InstructTemplate** and the **Roleplaying – Immersive Preset**.

Finally, to start a new chat with the bot if the current one gets stale, click the Three Lines icon in the lower left corner of the chat window and choose **“Start New Chat.”** You can also choose **“Close Chat”** if you’re done with whatever you were RPing. And there’s other options, too. Finally, even after you run out of context, you can keep chatting! Just remember that stuff will progressively be forgot in the older part of the chat.

You can fix this with lorebooks and summaries. I think. I'm going to learn more about those next. But there was no point until I could stop my chat from degrading into slop after a few pages anyway. With these settings, Cydonia filled my full 16384 context with good RP.

There’s tons more to look up and learn, and learning about extensions and lorebooks and fine tuning and tons of other stuff I barely understand yet will improve your experience even further. But this guide is the sort of thing I wish I could just read to get running quickly when I first started messing with local LLM chatbots a couple of weeks ago.

I hope it was helpful. Happy chatting!",2,1762672192.0,SillyTavernAI,0,0.75,False

Wife wanted an easy hike but I lied. 😏 Halfway through, told her what is all the point of this if we did not go to the Inwangsan summit. So she went along. Reached the top and then we came down to Changuimun which is the start of the trail going up to Bugaksan (Baegaksan). I got 2 bagels from Kokkili Bagels bagged and ready to continue on but she begged me to stop and go to a cafe. We walked over to Cafe Sanmotungi for coffee and cake.

Points to note if you want to do this. Rent hiking equipment if you are not confident of your shoes. Rent at least the shoes. Wife was not confident with her trainers. There is a Seoul Hiking Tourism Centre in Samcheong-dong that have hiking equipment for this. I don't think you need hiking sticks but have a good hat since the summit has no shade. Also remember to wear sunscreen.

If you like to attempt other trails surrounding Seoul, get their hard copy of the Seoul Hiking Tourism Guide Book. It is published by the Seoul Tourism Organization. It is very detailed and free to obtain. I got mine from the Tourist Issue Assistance Centre next to the Seoul Tourism Plaza. The one next to Chonggyecheon  Stream in Jongno.

Some of you may know me. I’m a video game history researcher and the author of several books, including Through the Moongate: The Story of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems Inc. and Ultima and The Sumerian Game: A Digital Resurrection.

I’ve been working for a long time on a book about LucasArts titled Rebels, Pirates and Tentacles: The Story of LucasArts, which is now close to publication via a [Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108065491/video-games-stage-3-the-story-of-lucasarts?ref=1pwor9).

I really need some advice urgently. I’ll try to explain my situation as briefly as possible:

Almost exactly two years ago, I (23F) met a coworker (29M) during my job training at this workplace. The whole thing lasted only about 10 weeks and was more like an internship. He was responsible for me, so we spent a lot of time together at work. But the thing was there was a connection between us back then like the chemistry just clicked, at least that’s how it felt to me. I really liked him, and I think he liked me too. That became especially clear to me at the company party (towards the end of those 10 weeks), where he practically threw his arms around me. He hugged me really tightly and affectionately (I can go into more detail if anyone wants). Sure, there was alcohol involved, but for me, that moment kind of changed everything.
And of course, I fell in love.

When my internship there ended, I had to leave the workplace with a heavy heart, and I really struggled with heartbreak. But we still kept in touch sporadically. He would check in every now and then we’d talk on the phone or text sometimes. About a year ago, I finally gathered all my courage and asked him to meet me for a coffee. That meeting did happen, but honestly, it was awful. The vibe was weird, and then all of a sudden, he started talking about his girlfriend, and I basically died inside. I had really been hoping for something. After that, I fell into a pretty deep emotional hole. I was really not doing well. But after about half a year, I managed to process the disappointment fairly well.

So, recently, it was my birthday, and of course, he remembered. We had almost no contact for a year, since that coffee date that went so badly for me. I thanked him for the birthday wishes and said that I appreciated that he still remembered after all this time (which I honestly don’t take for granted). And he just replied, “of course.” Then, the next day, he suddenly wants to meet up for coffee again. he texted, „I must have a lot to tell him“. I’ve finished my training and started my first full-time job, so maybe that’s what he wants to talk about… but I have no idea.

I really don’t know if I should agree to meet him. I still like him so much. But when I think about how miserable I was last year because of him, I feel like I can only say no. I also don’t see him as just a platonic friend. I have this feeling that it will backfire and I’ll end up regretting it deeply.
On the other hand, there’s also that thought, what if he’s changed his perspective now, and I miss my chance? Would I regret that for the rest of my life?

Hi I’ve never been diagnosed but I relate to a lot of things said on here. The big one is on reflection I Feel like I need reassurance in everything. This is very problematic in arguments as I ultimately want to feel like my feelings are valid even when I KNOW I was wrong or made mistakes or contributed or whatever- I just need them to see my side and say it, or admit they hurt me. It literally feels like I’m an f’ing attorney and they’re on the witness stand. Not good. Less problematic but equally or more concerning would be the constant need to know that other people are making the same choices. Not just big, I mean like which coffee I’m getting what food I’m ordering (I always ask what the waiter likes, which seems normal once but not every time) so I feel okay with my decision, or clothes, hearing that someone else I trust thinks it’s cute or seeing others wearing it. I feel like because I’m so uncertain and need to know what I’m doing isn’t crazy I’m constantly modeling myself based on others. And when I recognize that I wore something ugly and weird or ordered a dinner I immediately feel regret and verbalize “I regret not ordering the other instead”. That all comes from a place of fear. Problems with decisions- I’ve also had AI tell me I need professional help because of spiraling over small decisions for an entire day or more. Every remotely significant decision feels like the end of the world to me, and the small ones often feel palpable. And the sub reasons (pros and cons in other words) are sometimes more concerning as they are often irrational, most recently deciding to go on a trip or not I was worried about flight radiation and if the person I would go with would actually enjoy the place (thinking in detail about certain scenarios and how she would react in specific moments, which made me not want to put her though that), and we ended up not going because I was so indecisive and made the decision so stressful to the point it ended up spanning several days in resulting in heated arguments . When another person is involved i feel almost paralyzed, another example deciding where to go out to eat or at the grocery store, I would never pick out something unless they give it the okay. It’s like extreme empathy fear of guilt fear of hurting. I know this is anxiety, but it feels extreme when I think about it. I’m also wondering if getting rid of my smartphone would help me/ has helped anyone. I appreciate any input.",1,1762670277.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

(Part 1 of the Lean BIM Series)
⸻
For years, we’ve measured BIM maturity by how detailed our models are.
LOD 200, 300, 400 — the higher the number, the greater the sense of progress.

But here’s the truth: More detail doesn’t mean more value.
In fact, it often means more waste.

The old belief — “the more we model, the better” — worked when BIM was new.
It helped teams think in levels and stages. But as projects grew in complexity, that mindset backfired.

We ended up with heavy models, endless rework, and unclear purpose.

The next generation of BIM isn’t about how much you model.
It’s about why you model — and what information truly matters.

That’s where BIM Uses and LOIN (Level of Information Need) come in.

⸻
The Problem with Detail for Detail’s Sake
⸻

LOD once helped teams describe how “developed” a model element was.
But over time, it became a false measure of progress — where more detail was mistaken for more maturity.

I’ve seen this play out firsthand.
In one project, I opened a building IFC and found a coffee machine modelled down to its screws, hinges, and internal pipes.

It looked impressive in 3D — but served no real purpose for coordination or facility management.
Instead, it bloated the file, slowed performance, and frustrated the team.

That coffee machine became a symbol of what’s wrong with over-modelling
a culture that confuses effort with excellence, creating digital waste instead of meaningful, purpose-driven information.

⸻
When “More Detail” Becomes the Problem
⸻

The more we model, the harder it becomes to manage.
Every unnecessary parameter or layer of geometry multiplies the coordination load, data noise, and confusion.

Teams spend hours maintaining models no one can use effectively.
Facility managers receive files too large to open.
Contractors waste days stripping out details that never should’ve been there.

The irony?
These problems come from good intentions — teams trying to be “thorough.”

But thoroughness without purpose isn’t professionalism.
It’s waste.

And waste is exactly what Lean BIM aims to eliminate.

⸻
💬 Question for you:
Are we still mistaking “more detail” for “more maturity” — or are we finally ready to model with purpose?

How do you balance precision and practicality in your BIM workflows?

We were riding old school Dutch cruisers. Heavy. Mine is a 5 gear, my wife's in an 8. We stopped at Koffe on Haultain for a mid-point coffee. We left the bikes propped against the bench in front of the cafe and went inside. No locks, we can see the bikes. By the time we ordered drinks and sat down, dude walks up hops on my wife's bike and smooth as Steve McGarrett is riding off. We do a Three's Stooges jam-up trying to get out the door, but the young fellow seated behind me is freed up first and takes off running. My wife and I continue to dance around before I get my bike turned around, kickstand up and I'm off as well.

These bikes are heavy, slow and gear up poorly. By the time I'm cranking, the thief is breaking away from the fellow running after him. The thief has a look over his shoulder sees the runner falling away and begins to take it easy, mission accomplished.

Meanwhile, I'm finally at speed and absolutely cannonball past the runner, head down, legs pumping. ""Get em"", he yells. In my head, I'm ecstatic, repeating ""I'm gonna beat your ass"" over and over. The bicycle thief turns around again, sees me after him like a demon and suddenly he's out of the seat, pumping hard.

Block after block we are both full gas, but I'm starting to gain on him. He's coming up to Sherbourne and must have realized that a busy street was going to slow him down so he takes a left on Scott. No escape now. I swing the corner on a string and slam into him with a brake-skid. ""Down goes Fraser""! Both the bikes are down. Somehow he's on the ground but I keep my feet. He pops up with a John Belushi jump, looks back and forth then foots it toward Shelbourne.

The runner, Trevor, arrives as I am bent over absolutely gassed. We are high-fiving and laughing our asses off before we ride the bikes back for coffee and a neighbourhood parade. 

I never thought for a moment that I wasn't going to catch the bicycle thief, because I'm a 62 years old who thinks like a 15 year old. Never grow up. Stellar day.

1osc4x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1osc4x0/best_vpns_for_wwe/,Best VPNs for WWE,"The WWE streaming landscape transformed dramatically in January 2025. If you're confused about where to watch Monday Night Raw, SmackDown, NXT, or Premium Live Events like WrestleMania—you're not alone. The standalone WWE Network ceased operations in most countries, with content fragmenting across Netflix, ESPN, traditional cable networks, and a handful of regional services.

For wrestling fans, this means one frustrating reality: **you now need multiple expensive subscriptions to watch all WWE programming**. In the United States alone, you'll need Netflix for Raw ($15.49/month), cable or streaming TV for SmackDown and NXT, and ESPN+ ($29.99/month) for Premium Live Events. That's potentially $50-70 monthly just for WWE content.

Fortunately, there's a smarter solution. **A quality VPN lets you access international Netflix libraries where ALL WWE content—including Premium Live Events—is available under one subscription** at a fraction of the cost. After testing multiple VPN services with WWE streaming, we've identified the best options that reliably bypass geo-restrictions while delivering buffer-free HD viewing.

# Why WWE Streaming Changed in 2025

Before diving into VPN recommendations, let's clarify what happened to WWE Network and why you might need a VPN now:

# The WWE Network Shutdown

On January 1, 2025, WWE Network ceased standalone operations in most countries as part of WWE's $5 billion deal with Netflix. The service now exists only in France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, the Philippines, and Cambodia—and even in these regions, its future remains uncertain.

# The New WWE Streaming Reality

**In the United States:**

* **Netflix**: Monday Night Raw only
* **USA Network/Cable**: SmackDown
* **The CW/Cable**: NXT
* **ESPN+** ($29.99/month): ALL Premium Live Events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, etc.)

**Internationally (Most Countries):**

* **Netflix**: Raw, SmackDown, NXT, AND all Premium Live Events included with standard subscription

# Why US Fans Need VPNs

The pricing disparity is stark. International Netflix subscribers get the complete WWE catalog—including expensive PPV events—for their standard Netflix fee ($6.99-15.49/month). Meanwhile, US fans must pay $29.99/month just for ESPN+ to watch Premium Live Events, on top of Netflix and cable subscriptions.

**Using a VPN to connect to international Netflix libraries saves US fans $20-40 monthly** while providing access to all WWE content in one place. Travelers can also use VPNs to access their home country's WWE content when abroad.

# Best VPNs for WWE Streaming in 2025

After extensive testing with Netflix's international libraries, WWE Network regions, and various streaming scenarios, these five VPNs consistently delivered reliable WWE access with excellent streaming quality.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall WWE VPN

**Pricing:** 2-year plan: $3.09-3.39/month | 1-year plan: $4.99/month | 1-month: $12.99/month

**Why It's Best for WWE:**

NordVPN dominates WWE streaming for one simple reason: it **reliably unblocks Netflix libraries worldwide** with minimal effort. During testing, we accessed WWE content on Netflix UK, Canada, Australia, and 15+ other regions without a single blocked connection.

With 6,300+ servers across 111 countries—including 2,000+ in the US and 440+ in the UK—you'll always find a fast server for buffer-free WWE streaming. The proprietary NordLynx protocol delivered consistent speeds of 400+ Mbps on gigabit connections, more than enough for 4K Premium Live Event streaming.

**WWE-Specific Advantages:**

* SmartPlay technology automatically routes traffic through optimal servers for streaming
* Obfuscated servers bypass aggressive VPN detection on streaming platforms
* Threat Protection Pro blocks ads without affecting stream quality
* 10 simultaneous connections protect multiple devices

**Testing Results:**

* Successfully unblocked Netflix UK, Canada, Brazil for complete WWE access
* Streamed Crown Jewel 2025 in 4K without buffering
* Connected to WWE Network in Germany without detection
* Average server response time: 45ms

The only limitation: NordVPN caps simultaneous connections at 10 devices, though this proves sufficient for most households.

**Verdict:** For reliability, speed, and consistent WWE streaming access, NordVPN delivers the best overall experience. The 30-day money-back guarantee lets you test it risk-free during upcoming Premium Live Events.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget WWE VPN

**Pricing:** 2-year plan: $1.99-2.29/month | 1-year plan: $3.19/month | 1-month: $15.45/month

**Why It's Best for WWE:**

Surfshark proves you don't need to spend a fortune for reliable WWE streaming. At under $2/month for long-term plans, it's the **most affordable premium VPN that consistently works with Netflix** international libraries and remaining WWE Network regions.

The standout feature: **unlimited simultaneous device connections**. Share your subscription with family, protect every device in your household, or watch WWE on your phone, tablet, and smart TV simultaneously—all on one account.

**WWE-Specific Advantages:**

The trade-off: Long-distance international connections sometimes experienced slightly higher latency than NordVPN, though this rarely affected streaming quality.

**Verdict:** If you're protecting multiple devices or want maximum value, Surfshark delivers exceptional WWE streaming performance at an unbeatable price. The unlimited connections make it perfect for families or friend groups splitting costs.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Fastest WWE VPN

**Pricing:** 1-year plan: $6.67/month (+ 3 months free) | 6-month plan: $9.99/month | 1-month: $12.95/month

**Why It's Best for WWE:**

ExpressVPN earned its reputation as the **fastest VPN for a reason**. The proprietary Lightway protocol consistently delivered the lowest latency and highest throughput in our WWE streaming tests, making it ideal for viewers who demand pristine 4K quality and instantaneous load times.

With 3,000+ servers in 105 countries—including 24+ US locations—you'll enjoy exceptional geographic coverage for accessing WWE content globally. The MediaStreamer feature extends VPN protection to devices that don't traditionally support VPNs, like gaming consoles and smart TVs.

**WWE-Specific Advantages:**

The premium pricing reflects ExpressVPN's performance edge, making it best suited for serious wrestling fans who prioritize streaming quality above cost savings.

**Verdict:** If you want the absolute best WWE viewing experience with zero compromises on speed or quality, ExpressVPN justifies its premium price. The user-friendly interface makes it perfect for VPN beginners, too.

# 4. CyberGhost – Best WWE VPN for Beginners

**Pricing:** 2-year plan: $2.11/month | 6-month plan: $6.99/month | 1-month: $11.99/month

**Why It's Best for WWE:**

CyberGhost takes the complexity out of WWE streaming with **dedicated optimized servers specifically for streaming services**. Instead of guessing which server works, simply select ""For Streaming > Netflix UK"" and CyberGhost automatically connects you to a server proven to work with that service.

The intuitive interface features a map-based server selection that makes choosing countries simple, even for first-time VPN users. With 11,000+ servers in 100 countries—the largest network we tested—you'll always find available capacity during peak WWE viewing times.

**WWE-Specific Advantages:**

* Dedicated streaming servers optimized for Netflix, Peacock, ESPN+
* One-click ""Best Location"" feature automatically selects optimal WWE streaming server
* 7 simultaneous connections protect multiple devices
* 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry) lets you test through multiple Premium Live Events

**Testing Results:**

* Streaming-optimized servers unblocked Netflix UK, Canada, Brazil for WWE
* Maintained 400+ Mbps speeds on nearby servers
* User-friendly apps simplified server switching during testing
* Successfully accessed WWE Network in Switzerland

The downside: Long-distance connections (US to Australia, for example) experienced more speed degradation than NordVPN or ExpressVPN, though this rarely impacted HD streaming quality.

**Verdict:** If you're new to VPNs and want the simplest way to access WWE content internationally, CyberGhost's beginner-friendly interface and dedicated streaming servers make setup effortless. The extended 45-day refund period reduces risk.

# 5. Private Internet Access (PIA) – Best Customizable WWE VPN

**Pricing:** 2-year plan: $2.03/month | 1-year plan: $3.33/month | 1-month: $11.99/month

**Why It's Best for WWE:**

Private Internet Access delivers **advanced customization for tech-savvy users** who want granular control over their WWE streaming experience. PIA's open-source apps and extensive configuration options let you optimize connection profiles specifically for streaming, torrenting, or privacy.

With 10+ Gbps server infrastructure and unlimited simultaneous connections, PIA matches Surfshark's device flexibility while providing superior transparency through its proven no-logs policy and regular third-party audits.

**WWE-Specific Advantages:**

* 30,000+ servers provide unmatched capacity during peak viewing
* MACE feature blocks ads and malware without browser extensions
* Split tunneling routes WWE streaming through VPN while keeping other traffic direct
* Unlimited simultaneous device connections

**Testing Results:**

* Worked with WWE Network in Italy without issues

The learning curve is steeper than competitors due to extensive customization options, making PIA better suited for experienced VPN users rather than beginners.

**Verdict:** For advanced users who want maximum control and unlimited devices at a competitive price, PIA delivers excellent WWE streaming performance with unmatched flexibility. The 30-day money-back guarantee provides risk-free testing.

# How to Watch WWE with a VPN: Step-by-Step Setup

The setup process varies slightly depending on your goals. Here are detailed guides for the most common WWE streaming scenarios:

# For US Fans: Access Complete WWE Catalog on International Netflix

**What You'll Save:** $20-40/month by avoiding ESPN+ subscription and cable fees

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Choose and subscribe to a VPN** from our recommendations (we suggest NordVPN for reliability)
2. **Download and install the VPN app** on your streaming device (phone, computer, tablet, smart TV, etc.)
3. **Launch the VPN and connect to a server in these countries:**
   * **United Kingdom** (most reliable for WWE on Netflix)
   * **Canada** (good alternative with fast servers)
   * **Australia** (works consistently, though higher latency from US)
   * **Brazil, Mexico, Singapore** (also confirmed working)
4. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** (important step—Netflix checks this)
5. **Visit Netflix.com and log into your existing account** (no need for a new subscription)
6. **Search for ""WWE""**—you should now see Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and Premium Live Events available
7. **Start streaming!** Premium Live Events appear in Netflix's ""Live & Upcoming"" section

**Troubleshooting:** If Netflix detects your VPN and blocks streaming:

* Try a different server in the same country
* Clear cache/cookies again
* Switch VPN protocols (try WireGuard or OpenVPN)
* Contact your VPN's 24/7 support for streaming-optimized servers

# For International Fans: Access Your Home Country's WWE Content While Traveling

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Subscribe to your chosen VPN before traveling** (subscriptions may be blocked in some countries)
2. **Download VPN apps on all devices** you'll take traveling
3. **Connect to a server in your home country:**
   * US travelers: Connect to US servers to access ESPN+ for Premium Live Events
   * UK travelers: Connect to UK servers for Netflix WWE content
   * Australia travelers: Connect to Australian servers
4. **Access your existing streaming subscriptions** (Netflix, ESPN+, etc.) normally
5. **Stream WWE as if you're at home**

**Travel Tips:**

* Some countries (China, Russia, UAE) restrict VPN usage—research local laws
* Hotel/public WiFi may block VPN connections—use mobile data as backup
* Keep VPN connected throughout your streaming session to avoid interruptions

# For Remaining WWE Network Regions: Access Without Geo-Blocks

**Applicable Countries:** France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Philippines, Cambodia

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Connect to a VPN server in the country where WWE Network operates** (see list above)
2. **Visit WWENetwork.com** and sign up for WWE Network (if you don't have an account)
3. **Payment Note:** You may need a payment method from that country (credit card, PayPal account registered in that region)
4. **Stream WWE Network content** as normal—Network includes Premium Live Events

**Note:** WWE Network's future in these regions remains uncertain as Netflix's global licensing expands. This method works as of November 2025 but may change.

# Legal Considerations: Is Using a VPN for WWE Legal?

This is the most common question we receive about WWE streaming with VPNs. Here's the straightforward answer:

# The Legal Reality

**Using a VPN to stream WWE is legal in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and most countries worldwide.** VPNs are legitimate privacy tools used by businesses, journalists, activists, and regular internet users daily.

**However**, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content *may* violate the Terms of Service of streaming platforms like Netflix or ESPN+. Specifically:

**Netflix's Terms of Service state:** ""You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content.""

**What This Means:**

* Using a VPN with Netflix is **not illegal**—it won't result in criminal charges or civil lawsuits
* It technically violates Netflix's ToS, meaning Netflix *could* suspend your account
* **In practice, Netflix has never banned a user for VPN usage**
* Netflix's approach: Block the VPN connection, not the account

# Real-World Consequences

When Netflix detects VPN usage, you'll see a streaming error message: ""You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy. Please turn off any of these services and try again.""

**What happens next:**

1. Netflix blocks that specific VPN server's IP address
2. You disconnect the VPN or switch to a different server
3. You regain normal access to your account
4. **Your account remains active—no bans, no suspensions**

We've tested dozens of VPN servers with Netflix over months of research. Not once did we experience account termination. The worst outcome? Temporarily blocked streaming until we switched servers.

# Why Netflix Doesn't Ban VPN Users

Netflix's business model depends on subscriptions. Banning paying customers for using VPNs would:

* Lose revenue from legitimate subscribers
* Create public relations problems
* Drive users to piracy instead of licensed streaming

Netflix's priority: Satisfy content licensing agreements by *attempting* to block VPN access. Banning users doesn't further this goal.

# Other Streaming Platforms

**ESPN+, Peacock, Hulu:** Similar situations—technically against ToS, not illegal, rarely enforced beyond IP blocking

**Traditional Cable/Satellite:** Using VPNs to access cable streaming apps generally violates provider agreements

# Countries Where VPN Usage Is Restricted

Be aware that VPN usage itself (regardless of streaming) is banned or heavily restricted in:

* **China** (requires government-approved VPNs)
* **Russia** (requires government registration)
* **Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Belarus, Turkmenistan** (outright bans)
* **UAE, Turkey** (heavily regulated)

If traveling to these countries, research local VPN laws before using one for any purpose.

# Bottom Line

Using a VPN to watch WWE isn't illegal—it's a gray area regarding terms of service. Netflix and other platforms focus on blocking VPN IPs, not punishing users. The realistic risk of using quality VPNs like our recommendations: occasionally needing to switch servers when one gets blocked.

**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes. Users should review Terms of Service for their specific streaming platforms and comply with local laws in their jurisdiction.

# Troubleshooting Common WWE VPN Issues

Even the best VPNs occasionally encounter problems. Here's how to solve the most common WWE streaming issues:

# Problem 1: Netflix Detects VPN and Blocks Streaming

**Error Message:** ""You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy...""

**Solutions:**

1. **Switch to a different server** in the same country (most common fix)
2. **Clear browser cache and cookies** completely
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
4. **Change VPN protocol** in settings: WireGuard → OpenVPN or vice versa
5. **Contact VPN support** for current streaming-optimized server recommendations
6. **Try a different country** (UK, Canada, Australia all work for WWE)

# Problem 2: Slow Streaming or Buffering

**Solutions:**

1. **Connect to the nearest VPN server** (US East to UK rather than Australia)
2. **Switch to WireGuard protocol** (faster than OpenVPN)
3. **Close bandwidth-heavy background apps** (downloads, uploads, game updates)
4. **Lower video quality temporarily** (switch from 4K to 1080p in player settings)
5. **Test your base internet speed** at fast.com—VPNs require 25+ Mbps for 4K
6. **Try wired Ethernet connection** instead of WiFi

# Problem 3: VPN Disconnects During WWE Events

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable VPN kill switch** in settings (blocks internet if VPN drops)
2. **Switch to more stable protocol** (OpenVPN TCP is slower but more reliable)
3. **Check router settings**—some routers conflict with VPN connections
4. **Disable IPv6** in device network settings (causes VPN instability)
5. **Use VPN split tunneling** to route only Netflix through VPN

# Problem 4: Can't Access ESPN+ for Premium Live Events

**Note:** ESPN+ only works with US IP addresses, even with VPN

**Solutions:**

1. **Connect to US VPN server specifically**
2. **Clear ESPN+ app cache** (Settings > Apps > ESPN+ > Clear Cache)
3. **Try ESPN website** instead of app (better VPN compatibility)
4. **Alternative:** Use international Netflix for PLEs (no ESPN+ needed)

# Problem 5: Smart TV Won't Install VPN App

**Solutions:**

1. **Use VPN on router** (protects entire home network, including TV)
2. **Use MediaStreamer/Smart DNS** feature (ExpressVPN, NordVPN offer this)
3. **Cast from VPN-protected phone/tablet** to TV
4. **Connect laptop via HDMI** with VPN running
5. **Amazon Fire Stick/Apple TV** support VPN apps natively

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Can I use a free VPN to watch WWE?

**We strongly advise against free VPNs for WWE streaming.** Here's why:

* **Speed limitations:** Free VPNs cap speeds, causing constant buffering during 3-hour events
* **Data caps:** Most limit 500MB-10GB monthly—barely enough for one Premium Live Event
* **Netflix blocking:** Free VPN IPs are heavily blocked by streaming platforms
* **Privacy risks:** Free VPNs often sell browsing data to advertisers or inject ads
* **Security concerns:** Some free VPNs contain malware or log activity

The paid VPNs we recommend cost $2-8/month—less than a single Starbucks coffee. For reliable WWE streaming, the investment is worth it.

# Do I need separate Netflix accounts for different countries?

**No.** Your existing Netflix account works worldwide. When you connect to a VPN server in another country, Netflix automatically shows that region's catalog. You don't need multiple accounts or subscriptions.

# Will WWE/Netflix ban my account for using a VPN?

**Extremely unlikely.** As detailed in the legal section, neither WWE nor Netflix ban accounts for VPN usage. The worst-case scenario: temporary streaming blocks when Netflix detects your VPN server, resolved by switching to a different server.

# Can I watch WWE Premium Live Events live with a VPN?

**Yes.** Netflix streams Premium Live Events live in international markets. Connect to a VPN server in the UK, Canada, or other supported countries before the event starts, and the live stream will appear in Netflix's ""Live & Upcoming"" section.

# What's the best VPN server location for WWE on Netflix?

**United Kingdom servers work most reliably** for WWE content on Netflix. Canada and Australia are excellent alternatives. All three regions receive Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and Premium Live Events on Netflix.

# Can I use one VPN subscription on multiple devices?

**Yes.** All recommended VPNs support simultaneous connections:

* **Surfshark & PIA:** Unlimited devices
* **NordVPN:** 10 devices
* **ExpressVPN:** 8 devices
* **CyberGhost:** 7 devices

Watch WWE on your phone while your partner streams on the laptop—both protected by one subscription.

# How do I watch WWE on my smart TV with a VPN?

**Three methods:**

1. **VPN app:** Some smart TVs (Android TV, Fire TV) support VPN apps directly
2. **Router VPN:** Install VPN on your router to protect all devices including TV
3. **MediaStreamer/Smart DNS:** ExpressVPN and NordVPN offer this feature for devices without VPN app support

# Will a VPN slow down my WWE streaming?

**Quality VPNs cause minimal slowdown.** In our testing:

* **ExpressVPN:** 10-15% speed reduction
* **NordVPN:** 15-20% speed reduction
* **Surfshark:** 10-20% speed reduction

These reductions are imperceptible for streaming. Even on 100 Mbps connections (reduced to 80-85 Mbps with VPN), you'll stream 4K WWE content without buffering.

# Can I watch past WWE Premium Live Events on Netflix?

**Yes.** International Netflix libraries include extensive WWE archives:

* Previous Premium Live Events (WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, etc.)
* Classic content from WWE's video library
* Documentary series and behind-the-scenes content

# What happens if my VPN stops working during a live event?

**Enable the kill switch feature** in your VPN settings. This automatically blocks all internet traffic if the VPN disconnects, preventing your real IP address from being exposed. When the VPN reconnects, streaming resumes automatically.

# Final Verdict: Which WWE VPN Should You Choose?

After extensive testing, here are our recommendations based on your specific needs:

**For most people:** **NordVPN** offers the best balance of reliability, speed, and consistent WWE streaming access. Its combination of extensive servers, fast speeds, and proven Netflix unblocking makes it the safest choice.

**For budget-conscious fans:** **Surfshark** delivers premium WWE streaming performance at under $2/month with unlimited device connections. The value is unbeatable for families or friend groups.

**For streaming quality enthusiasts:** **ExpressVPN** provides the absolute fastest speeds and most reliable connections, justifying its premium pricing for serious wrestling fans who demand 4K perfection.

**For VPN beginners:** **CyberGhost** makes WWE streaming effortless with dedicated servers and the longest money-back guarantee in the industry (45 days).

**For advanced users:** **Private Internet Access** offers maximum customization and unlimited devices for tech-savvy fans who want granular control.

# Getting Started

1. **Choose your VPN** based on priorities above
2. **Subscribe** (all offer 30-day money-back guarantees for risk-free testing)
3. **Download apps** on your streaming devices
4. **Connect to UK, Canada, or Australian servers**
5. **Open Netflix** and enjoy complete WWE access

The WWE streaming landscape changed dramatically in 2025, but VPNs provide a simple solution to fragmented content and expensive subscriptions. Whether you're a US fan tired of paying $30/month for ESPN+ or an international viewer traveling abroad, the right VPN ensures you never miss a moment of WWE action.

**Ready to start streaming?** Our top recommendation, NordVPN, currently offers up to 77% off with a 30-day money-back guarantee—perfect for testing through upcoming Premium Live Events.

**Disclaimer:** This guide is for educational purposes. Users should comply with all applicable laws and Terms of Service in their jurisdiction. VPN usage for streaming exists in a legal gray area regarding service agreements but is not illegal in most countries.

Which is why I think I’m sensitive to caffeine now. During my last week there, my eye started twitching randomly and didn’t stop for months. Upon leaving, I went back to having my regular morning coffee at home because I never had twitching before. It never stopped.  

I cut coffee completely starting in sept, went tea only. Until October it stopped. This morning I really missed it, thought I’d enjoy a cup and within an hour I felt my eye wanting to twitch. Rushed and drank lots of water/ made sure I ate more food.

I (33M) have been in a handful of long-term relationships, the longest of which was seven years. The problem there is that they all began online, and the process of actually trying to court someone in the real world is totally alien to me.

So I match with who we will call Helen (34F) sometime last week. Chat for a few days and everything is going well. Set up a coffee date for Wednesday. We end up hanging out until Starbucks closed and another hour or so chatting in my car. Tell her that I'd love to see her again, exchange numbers. All is well.

Chat for a few more days, ask to take her out for dinner Saturday (today)[I know it's Sunday technically right now]. Reached out to make sure we were good, and a few hours later she responds with her having a migraine, asks to rain check. Okay, no biggie, but the way she is apologizing just seems like too much.

I guess my main question is where do I go from here? Do I wait to hear back? Message her in a day or two? The first date went really well, as far as I could tell, I would love to see her again but don't want to come off as clingy or overbearing or some other bad thing.

1osbz3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1osbz3p/best_vpns_for_iceland/,Best VPNs for Iceland,"Iceland may be known for its strong privacy laws and world-class internet infrastructure, but even in this digitally advanced nation, online security challenges persist. Whether you're an Icelander protecting your data from mandatory ISP logging, a tourist navigating public WiFi at the Blue Lagoon, or an expat accessing Icelandic content abroad, a reliable VPN is essential.

After extensive testing and research into Iceland's unique digital landscape, we've identified the best VPNs that address the country's specific cybersecurity needs. This guide will help you understand why VPN protection matters in Iceland and which services deliver the security, speed, and streaming capabilities you need.

# Why You Need a VPN in Iceland

Despite Iceland's reputation as a privacy-friendly nation, several factors make VPN protection essential for residents and visitors alike.

# ISP Data Retention Requirements

While Iceland implements strong GDPR protections, the country's Electronic Communications Act requires **ISPs to collect and store user data for up to 6 months**. This means your internet provider is legally obligated to log your connection times, bandwidth usage, and potentially browsing activities—regardless of Iceland's otherwise progressive privacy stance.

A VPN encrypts your traffic and routes it through secure servers, preventing ISPs from monitoring your online activities beyond basic connection metadata.

# Third-Party Five Eyes Contributor Status

Iceland serves as a third-party contributor to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, despite not being a full member. This relationship means that under certain circumstances, Icelandic authorities may cooperate with international surveillance networks.

For privacy-conscious individuals, this creates a compelling reason to use encryption tools that prevent any third party—domestic or international—from accessing your communications.

# Growing Cyber Threats Targeting Iceland

Iceland experienced its **largest recorded cyberattack in 2018** when thousands of residents—a significant percentage of the 350,000 population—were targeted by a sophisticated phishing campaign using Remcos RAT (Remote Access Tool). The attack specifically targeted Iceland's banking system, demonstrating that cybercriminals understand the country's digital infrastructure well enough to craft effective attacks.

More recent threats include:

* **Ransomware attacks** increasingly targeting businesses, media outlets, and government agencies
* **Credential theft campaigns** exploiting Iceland's advanced digital economy
* **Attacks on critical infrastructure**, including the 2024 assault on [mbl.is](http://mbl.is), one of Iceland's major news portals
* **NTLM relay attacks** targeting the country's business sector

With Iceland's cybersecurity market projected to grow 12.58% annually through 2029, the threat landscape continues to evolve alongside the country's digital transformation.

# Public WiFi Security Risks

Iceland's tourism industry welcomes over 2 million visitors annually—nearly six times the resident population. While free WiFi is widely available throughout Reykjavik's cafés, restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, these networks pose significant security risks:

* **Unencrypted connections** allow hackers to intercept banking credentials, passwords, and personal data
* **Fake hotspots** mimicking legitimate networks can steal information from unsuspecting users
* **Limited security in rural areas** where travelers depend on hotel WiFi for navigation and emergency communication
* **43% of free WiFi users have experienced security breaches**, according to Forbes research

A VPN encrypts your connection on any network, transforming vulnerable public WiFi into a secure communication channel.

# Streaming and Content Access

Iceland's Netflix library contains significantly fewer titles than larger markets like the US. Icelandic travelers abroad also face challenges accessing:

* **Local services** including RÚV, Stöð 2, and Nova TV
* **US-exclusive platforms** like Hulu and Paramount+
* **Banking and government services** restricted to Icelandic IP addresses
* **International streaming libraries** with different content selections

A quality VPN with servers in both Iceland and target countries enables seamless access to content regardless of your physical location.

# What Makes a VPN Ideal for Iceland

Not every VPN service meets Iceland's unique requirements. Based on extensive testing across Iceland's digital infrastructure, these factors determine VPN effectiveness:

# Server Presence in Iceland

Physical servers in Reykjavik or Akureyri provide **low-latency connections** essential for:

* Accessing Icelandic services while traveling abroad
* Maintaining fast speeds for domestic use
* Bypassing geo-restrictions on local content

# International Server Network

Iceland's compact size makes global connectivity crucial. A robust international network enables:

* Access to streaming services worldwide
* Fast connections when traveling
* Alternative routes if specific servers face congestion

# Strong Security Standards

Iceland's evolving threat landscape demands comprehensive protection:

* **AES-256 encryption** (military-grade standard)
* **Audited no-logs policies** verified by independent firms like PwC or Deloitte
* **Kill switch protection** to prevent data leaks if VPN connection drops
* **DNS leak protection** ensuring all traffic remains encrypted
* **Modern protocols** like WireGuard or NordLynx for speed and security

# High-Speed Performance

With Iceland ranking 6th globally for internet speeds at 297.5 Mbps average, your VPN shouldn't create a bottleneck. Look for services maintaining **at least 90% of baseline speeds** to preserve Iceland's world-class connectivity.

# Streaming Capabilities

Effective VPNs should reliably unblock:

* Icelandic platforms (RÚV, Stöð 2, Nova TV)
* International services (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer)
* US-exclusive content (Paramount+, Peacock, HBO Max)

# Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction

VPN headquarters location matters. Services based in Panama, British Virgin Islands, or other privacy-respecting jurisdictions face no mandatory data retention laws and resist government data requests more effectively than providers in surveillance alliance countries.

# Best VPNs for Iceland in 2025

After rigorous testing against Iceland's specific requirements, these VPNs emerged as the most reliable options for 2025.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall VPN for Iceland

**Why NordVPN Excels for Icelandic Users:**

NordVPN dominates our testing with **14-15 strategically placed servers in Reykjavik and Akureyri**, providing exceptional local connectivity. Independent tests show the service maintains **92-95% of baseline speeds** with only 5-7% performance degradation—remarkable for encrypted traffic.

**Key Advantages for Iceland:**

**Server Infrastructure:**

Since Icelandic ISPs must retain connection data for 6 months, VPN use is the most effective way to maintain browsing privacy:

1. Enable **auto-connect** on startup
2. Use VPN for all internet activities
3. Select servers in privacy-friendly jurisdictions (Panama, Switzerland, Iceland itself)

Your ISP will see encrypted VPN traffic but cannot determine which websites you visit or what data you transmit.

# Secure Public WiFi in Tourist Areas

Iceland welcomes millions of tourists annually who rely on public WiFi at popular locations:

**High-risk locations requiring VPN:**

* **Airport WiFi** (Keflavik International)
* **Hotel networks** (passwords shared with all guests)
* **Café and restaurant WiFi** (Reykjavik establishments)
* **Tourist attraction hotspots** (Blue Lagoon, Golden Circle stops)
* **Gas station WiFi** (rural areas with limited alternatives)

**Protection strategy:**

1. **Never connect** to public WiFi without VPN active
2. Verify network names with staff to avoid fake hotspots
3. Disable automatic WiFi connection on all devices
4. Use mobile data for sensitive transactions when possible

**Best VPNs for Iceland torrenting:**

* **NordVPN:** Dedicated P2P servers in Iceland
* **Private Internet Access:** Port forwarding support
* **Surfshark:** Unlimited bandwidth for large downloads

# Common VPN Questions for Iceland Users

# Is using a VPN legal in Iceland?

**Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Iceland.** The country's strong privacy protections and democratic values support citizens' rights to encrypt their communications and browse anonymously.

However, using VPN for illegal activities (copyright infringement, fraud, cybercrime) remains illegal regardless of encryption. VPN use should protect privacy, not facilitate criminal behavior.

# Will a VPN slow down Iceland's fast internet?

Iceland's average internet speed of 297.5 Mbps means most users won't notice VPN overhead. Quality providers maintain **90-95% of baseline speeds**:

* **Without VPN:** 300 Mbps typical
* **With quality VPN:** 270-285 Mbps
* **Performance impact:** Minimal for most activities

Modern protocols like WireGuard and NordLynx minimize speed loss while maintaining strong encryption.

# Can I use free VPNs in Iceland?

**Free VPNs are not recommended** for several critical reasons:

**Security risks:**

* 38% of free VPN apps contain malware (CSIRO study)
* Many sell browsing data to advertisers
* Weak encryption or no encryption at all
* No kill switch protection

**Performance limitations:**

* Severe speed restrictions (often under 2 Mbps)
* Data caps (typically 500 MB - 10 GB monthly)
* Overcrowded servers causing constant buffering
* Limited server locations

**Better alternatives:** Premium VPNs like Surfshark ($2.19/month) or NordVPN ($3.69/month) provide comprehensive protection for less than the cost of a coffee in Reykjavik.

# Which VPN is fastest for Iceland?

Based on extensive testing:

1. **ExpressVPN:** 95-98% speed retention (fastest overall)
2. **Surfshark:** 800+ Mbps on optimal servers
3. **NordVPN:** 92-95% speed retention (best balance of speed and security)

Speed varies based on server selection, time of day, and distance from server location.

# Do I need a VPN if I'm just visiting Iceland?

**Yes, tourists should use VPN in Iceland** for several reasons:

**Protection needs:**

* Public WiFi security at airports, hotels, tourist sites
* Safe access to online banking from abroad
* Protection against fake hotspots in crowded tourist areas
* Secure navigation and communication in rural areas

**Content access:**

* Streaming home country content (Netflix libraries, local news)
* Accessing banking and services restricted to home IP addresses
* Maintaining normal digital routines while traveling

**Setup before arrival:** Install and test VPN before departing for Iceland. Airport and hotel WiFi networks are most vulnerable to interception.

# Can VPN help me watch Icelandic TV abroad?

**Yes, connecting to Iceland VPN servers provides access to:**

* **RÚV:** National public broadcaster
* **Stöð 2:** Major commercial channel
* **Nova TV:** Entertainment programming
* **Icelandic news websites**
* **Streaming services with Icelandic content**

**Setup process:**

1. Connect to Reykjavik or Akureyri server
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Visit Icelandic streaming platform
4. Content appears as if accessing from within Iceland

# How does VPN interact with Iceland's data retention laws?

Iceland's Electronic Communications Act requires ISPs to log connection data for 6 months. **VPN encryption prevents meaningful data collection:**

**What ISPs can still see:**

* You're connecting to VPN server
* Connection timestamp
* Amount of data transferred
* VPN provider's IP address

**What ISPs cannot see:**

* Websites you visit
* Content you access
* Data you transmit
* Your actual online activities

The encrypted tunnel prevents ISPs from fulfilling the spirit of data retention requirements—they see only encrypted traffic, rendering the logs meaningless for surveillance purposes.
