I'm posting this because I've been playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for 6 hours straight after my shift. And I completed the base game...


And so I though: ""If an Artorias skin is already in the game for Guts, why not add whole Dark Souls units?
They already did a Guilty Gear one, so it would be fire and plausible.
And why is Sister Friede actually kind of...""

Aaanyways. Just wanted to get that out of my chest. I'll probably go to bed now and doom-scroll for the last few hours since I'm running on 4 cups of coffee like Himeko from Honkai Star Rail.

Have a great day/night/whatever. I'm too tired for this. Bye!

1ox75di,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ox75di/what_did_i_do_wrong/,what did i do wrong?,"so I (19m) met this girl at a house party on Halloween, she goes to the same college as me and we really hit it off. We were dancing all night together she asked me for my instagram, I had her in my arms the entire night pretty much, later she sat down and she was leaning into me resting her head on me all the good stuff. I sat with her that whole time and when she left she told me “I’m expecting that text tmrw” so it seemed like she was really into me. And when she left one of her guy friends said to me “hey I see you vibing with girls name yk she’s a really sweet girl so just please don’t screw her over”. So it’s really all green flags with this girl. I also add ofc there was a lot of alcohol involved.

so over the next 2 weeks we text regularly things are somewhat flirty and about a week and a half into it i ask her to coffee but i didn't set a day so i didn't come off as pushy she gives me a lukewarm ""oh yeah that seems nice"" so i leave it be by giving her my hours and saying lmk as to not pressure her after a few days of normal texting again mini golf comes up in conversation and the way she is texting i'm thinking she wants me to ask her to it so i do and she actually gives me a reply ""oh myyy omg im haven't in forever i probably suck so bad"" at this point it's been 2 weeks since we met and started texting so i double down and ask her if she's free this saturday which she turns down and says she has plans with friends but does not offer a day she is free.

i'm not stupid so i know this means she's just enjoying the texting and not wanting to hangout or any progress but im just wondering what i did wrong? i feel like i played all my cards pretty well wasn't too pushy but still a little flirty let a good rapport build up then asked her out but to no avail. but still is there something i did wrong? should i have done something different? any advice helps! thanks!",1,1763151056.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I can’t wait for the movie, but who knows when we’ll actually get it. In the meantime, I was curious to see what could happen in the movie, using ChatGPT. I’d be happy with this 😆:

🌅 THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY — MOVIE OUTLINE

Working Title: The Summer We Found Home

Narrative Frame:

The entire movie is Belly’s reply to Susannah’s letter.
Her voiceover is reflective, intimate, and structured like the Book 3 epilogue.

⸻

⭐ ACT I — “THE LETTER & THE YEARS BETWEEN”

1. Opening — Cousins Beach (Present Day)

The Fisher house in soft summer light.
Hydrangeas on the porch.
Wedding chairs waiting.

A wedding invitation rests on a table:

Isabel Conklin & Conrad Fisher
Cousins Beach

Belly narrates softly — the tone of a letter:

“Some summers change you.
Some summers bring you home.”

⸻

2. Everyone’s Lives Now (Quick, Warm Montage)
	•	Belly (24): grown, confident, home from Europe.
	•	Conrad (25–26): deep into med school at Stanford.
	•	Jeremiah (24–25): Boston chef, at peace and thriving.
	•	Laurel: stable, writing, sentimental about the wedding.
	•	John Conklin: supportive, calm father presence.
	•	Adam Fisher: quietly present and supportive.
	•	Steven & Taylor: chaotic, loving, flying in from SF.

Adult lives.
No triangle.
No drama.

⸻

⭐ 3. Snowy Philadelphia — The Trigger

Before traveling to Cousins, Belly stops by her childhood home.
Snow falls outside — the same kind that fell when she was 16.

She steps into the backyard.
A memory floods in.

Narration (a reply forming):

“You always told me love was supposed to stay.
I didn’t understand then.”

⸻

⭐ 4. TEEN VALENTINE’S FLASHBACK (Book 1)

The most important flashback in the movie.
	•	16-year-old Belly
	•	Conrad showing up unexpectedly
	•	Two mugs of hot cocoa
	•	A blanket spread on the cold ground
	•	The night sky full of stars
	•	Belly watching him
	•	Conrad pointing out constellations
	•	Quiet, tender, foundational

Narration (to Susannah):

“That night he didn’t bring me flowers or candy.
He gave me the moon and the stars.
Infinity.”

This is why Belly still loves him.

⸻

5. After Paris — Their Adult Rebuild (Mini-Montage)

Short, atmospheric flashes:
	•	Airport reunions
	•	Studying side-by-side
	•	Quiet mornings making coffee
	•	Walking on Conrad’s campus
	•	Playful kisses
	•	Whispered confessions

Narration:

“I didn’t know I’d find my way back to him.
But I did.”

⸻

6. The Proposal

Sunrise on the Cousins shoreline.

Conrad (soft, steady):

“No more distance. I want everything with you.”

Belly narrates:

“You would have smiled, Susannah.
You always knew before I did.”

Belly says yes.

⸻

7. Wedding Week Begins

Belly arrives at Cousins.
Laurel is preparing flowers.
John Conklin fixes a porch rail.
Steven & Taylor arrive in chaos.
Jeremiah gives Belly a warm hug, healed: “Hey, Bells.”
Conrad arrives late that night, exhausted from a med school rotation but lighting up when he sees her.

Wedding week begins.

⸻

⭐ ACT II — “THE SUMMER OF YES”

8. Wedding Prep Chaos

Light, warm, Jenny Han style:
	•	Missing hydrangeas
	•	Taylor’s glitter panic
	•	Steven micromanaging
	•	Jeremiah helping with food
	•	Laurel emotional but trying to hide it

Narration:

“I used to think happiness had to be loud.
I didn’t know it could be this soft.”

⸻

9. Belly & Conrad’s Mature Romance

Real adult intimacy:
	•	Walking barefoot on the beach
	•	Whispered “Isabel” in quiet moments
	•	A sensual fade-to-black love scene
	•	Morning coffee outside
	•	Conrad’s small acts of care

Narration:

“You told me real love was patient.
He waited.
And I grew.”

⸻

10. Conrad & Jeremiah’s Healing (Dock Scene)

Jeremiah:

“I wasn’t fair to you.
And I’m happy for you. For both of you.”

Conrad:

“We’re good.
We always were.”

Narration:

“You’d be proud of them.
They found their way back too.”

⸻

11. Jeremiah’s Personal Future

Optional: Denise attends the wedding with him.
A small nod, nothing more.
Jeremiah is moving on.

⸻

⭐ 12. WEDDING MORNING — SUSANNAH’S LETTER

The emotional core of the film.

The house is quiet.
Belly sits in a robe.
Laurel enters with the sealed letter:

“She wanted you to have this today.”

Belly opens it.
Susannah’s voiceover:

“My sweet Isabel…
You were always meant for a great, big love.
The kind that stays.”

Belly cries.
Laurel hugs her.

Narration — Belly’s reply finally begins clearly:

“I hope I grew into the girl you saw in me.”

⸻

⭐ ACT III — “FOREVER STARTS HERE”

13. The Wedding (Cousins Beach)

Golden hour.
Hydrangeas everywhere.

Highlights:
	•	Laurel AND John walk Belly down the aisle — not romantic
	•	A single hydrangea sits at Susannah’s seat
	•	Adam Fisher emotional
	•	Steven’s heartfelt toast
	•	Taylor sobbing
	•	Jeremiah cheering loudly
	•	Optional: Denise beside him

VOWS

Belly:

“You gave me the moon and the stars.
And every version of forever.”

Conrad:

“Isabel…
you’ve always been my home.”

Narration (to Susannah):

“You told me I’d know when it was right.
I know.”

⸻

14. Reception — Joy & Lightness
	•	Dancing on the sand
	•	Laurel dancing with Belly
	•	John dancing with Steven
	•	Conrad & Belly sneaking kisses
	•	Fireworks over the water

Narration:

“This is the kind of love you wanted for me.”

⸻

15. Final Belly Flop

Belly runs into the ocean in her dress.
Conrad chases her, laughing.

Narration — the emotional echo of Book 3’s epilogue:

“Some summers turn you pretty.
This one finally brought me home.”

⸻

⭐ EPILOGUE — BELLY’S COMPLETED “REPLY”

16. California — Beginning Their Life

Small, warm montage:
	•	Belly & Conrad unpacking a small apartment together
	•	A vase of hydrangeas
	•	Their wedding photo on the fridge
	•	Conrad leaving for a hospital rotation
	•	Belly walking with him along the Pacific shoreline

Final narration — Belly’s finished reply to Susannah’s letter:

“Love makes its own geography.
And wherever we went…
we always found our way back to each other.
You were right.
I found a great, big love.
And it stayed.”

Fade out.

End of trilogy.
End of the letter.
End of Belly’s childhood.
Beginning of forever.

•	Locate the small magnet inside the plastic ring.
	
•	Remove the magnet and clean it well.
	
•	Make sure the magnet is completely dry.
	
•	Check whether the magnet was out of place or dirty — in my case, it had water and coffee grounds around it, which caused the error.

cutting them is now supposed to reduce prices for Americans?

A pick-up truck rammed from behind and oushed her so hard she slammed into a big rig in front of her. She was going 15 following the van also going ~15 after turning for a light. She was not too close and the pickup driver is clearly at fault. His excuse was he went for a sip of coffee and ""blacked-out"" and thats why he was going 40 and slammed into her.

Her insurance adjuster finally hot back to her a week later and said this (I'll copy paste her message to me)

--- The adjuster called and the liability insurance is if you hit a house of something, not another car because cars are apparently not property. And apparently the way insurance works is that mine covers me and his covers him and there's no crossover. So his won't cover anything. Sounds like I'll get enough to cover the loan and probably a bit more but I'll have to go get a new car and take out another loan.---

This makes no sense to me whats so ever. What's the point of there being a law mandating csr insurance when it wont even vover damages when you are at fault?

I was thinking HIS insurance would cover the ""value of her current vehicle (2023 SUV), and her own insurance would cover a replacement. Weither it's a monetary value to buy a new car or simply suppliyng a new car of same value for the  replacement insurance.

What are we not understanding? It doesn't make sense at all that his insurance would not cover damages he causes to others.

For clarification, the accident happened in Ottawa, Ontario. Her car is plated in Québec and his pick-up is plated in Ontario owned by a company. He is clearly at fault here, that is not disputed.

So my husband is 41 and I'm 38. We've been married for twelve years. He works in construction management and travels for work sometimes. I work in marketing for a tech company.

Last March there was this big conference in Chicago. Five days. My company sent me because I was leading a campaign launch. My ex from college was there. We dated for two years back when I was 21. He's in the same industry now. I saw his name on the attendee list before I left but didn't think much of it.

First night there was a mixer. Open bar. I saw him across the room and we made eye contact. He came over. We talked about work stuff, how life turned out, normal catching up things. He looked good. Better than college honestly. He's 39 now and does crossfit or something because he was way more built than I remembered.

We exchanged numbers. Said we should grab coffee during the conference.

But it wasn't coffee.

Second night he texted me around 10pm asking if I wanted to get a drink at the hotel bar. I went. We talked for two hours. He touched my arm when he laughed. I didn't move away. When we left the bar he walked me to the elevators and said ""I'm on the eighth floor if you want to keep talking.""

I got in the elevator. Pressed eight instead of twelve.

I'm not going to describe everything but I took off my clothes in his room and we had sex twice. I left around 2am and went back to my room.

The next three days of the conference we met up every night. Same thing. I'd text my husband goodnight around 9pm and then go to my ex's room. On the last night we ordered room service and I didn't leave until 5am because my flight was at noon.

I flew home. My husband picked me up from the airport with flowers because he missed me. I felt sick but I smiled and kissed him and said the conference went great.

But I didn't delete the texts.

My ex and I kept texting after I got home. Nothing explicit really. Just ""thinking about Chicago"" or ""wish we had more time"" type stuff. Sometimes flirtier. He'd send me pictures of himself at the gym. I'd respond with heart emojis or ""looking good."" It went on for months. Four months. I don't even know why I kept doing it. The texting I mean. I wasn't planning to see him again.

Then two weeks ago my husband's sister called me. She's always hated me. Thinks I'm not good enough for her brother. She said she needed to talk to me about something serious and could we meet for lunch.

I went. She showed me her phone. Screenshots. My ex had posted on social media about ""reconnecting with an old flame"" back in March with a photo of the Chicago skyline. One of her friends knew him from work and sent it to her. She'd been digging. Found out he was at the same conference as me. Put it together.

She said ""I know you fucked him. Tell my brother or I will.""

I panicked. Drove home. My husband was there watching a game. I sat down next to him and just said it. ""I need to tell you something about the Chicago conference.""

He muted the TV. Looked at me.

I said ""I ran into my ex there. We slept together. Multiple times. I'm sorry.""

He didn't yell. He just stared at me for what felt like five minutes but was probably thirty seconds. Then he said ""Show me your phone.""

I handed it to him.

He scrolled. Read everything. Every text from the past four months. His face didn't change. He stood up and walked to our bedroom. I heard drawers opening. He came back out with a duffle bag packed. He was still holding my phone.

I said ""Please say something.""

He said ""I'm keeping this so I can forward everything to myself. You can pick it up from my lawyer."" Then he walked out.

That was three days ago.

His sister has been texting me from his phone saying I'm a whore and I destroyed her family. His mom called yesterday crying asking how I could do this to her son. His best friend came by the house to pick up more of his stuff and wouldn't even look at me.

My parents said I need to let him cool down and then try to explain. Explain what though. That I was bored? That my ex was there and available? That I kept texting him because it felt exciting?

I called his sister today and told her she had no right to threaten me. She laughed and said ""You handed me the ammunition when you couldn't keep your legs closed.""

My friends are split. Half think I should have just kept my mouth shut since his sister had no actual proof. The other half think I'm a horrible person for doing it in the first place.

I don't know what I expected. Maybe that he'd yell and we'd fight and then work through it. But he didn't yell. He didn't cry. He just left.

Now I'm sitting in our house alone and he won't answer my calls and his entire family is coming after me.

So I guess my question is, should I have just denied it when his sister confronted me? AITAH?",1,1763150520.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

Hope you’re all doing well
So I matched with a girl on hinge, at the time we were both on holiday so we didn’t talk much but we after a few messages we agreed to exchange numbers and have a phone call when we were both back. We had a phone call when we were back and we were talking for quite a long time like a good hour and a half, the conversation just felt effortless in a good way and I really enjoyed it

So I messaged her the next day again and a few days later we spoke on the phone again. So I decided to ask her for a coffee. She asked me what day and I said Sunday but she said she was busy all weekend, she initially wouldn’t say what she was doing so I just said no worries enjoy what you’re upto. Then she told me it was her birthday and she had plans with family and friends. So I just wished her happy birthday and thought I would let her enjoy her weekend rather than constant texting. The following week I messaged saying hope you had a great weekend and she messaged back saying it was good and asked me how I was. So I asked her again for the coming Saturday and she said she was busy with family but said another day could work, so I suggested Sunday and she said she’s going for a hike that day. So I just said no worries hope you enjoy the hike, I’ll leave it with you to let me know when you are available. And she responded with thank you and said she’s will let me know.

1ox6h09,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ox6h09/upgrade_advice_allpurpose_grinder_w_heavy/,Upgrade Advice: All-Purpose Grinder (w/ heavy espresso lean) [$500],"Current Setup: Gaggia Classic Pro + Baratza Sette 270

I've gotten the itch for a grinder upgrade and need some guidance on how to maneuver the sea of grinders in this range. 

What I love about the Sette and don't want to lose: Grind Speed, Low Retention, easy to clean

What I would want to have in an upgrade:

* All-Purpose - I predominantly brew espresso, but would like to occasionally do pour-over so I'd want a grinder that can handle switching grind settings and has solid filter performance
* Flatt Burrs - seems like a good opportunity to try for larger, flat burrs
* Nice to have: quieter, magnetic dosing cup, tool-free burr access for cleaning

Other useful info:

* Located in Boston
* Usually do lattes or cortados and probably average a drink a day
* Electric preferred
* Single dose
* Don't care for burr upgrades/customizability

  
Options I am considering:

* [Eureka Mignon Zero 65 All Purpose Grinder – Whole Latte Love](https://www.wholelattelove.com/collections/espresso-grinders/products/eureka-mignon-zero-65-all-purpose-grinder?variant=43839179948086) ($500)
   * Looks like everything I want though cleaning seems annoying and have seen reviews indicating it takes some time to adjust to the filter to espresso jump
* [Ceado Life X Coffee Grinder – Whole Latte Love](https://www.wholelattelove.com/collections/all-purpose-coffee-and-espresso-grinders/products/ceado-life-x-coffee-grinder?variant=42728094072886) ($500)
   * Struggling to find any notable negatives for this one
   * Seems to crush the all-purpose aspect from reviews I've seen
* [TIMEMORE 064s Sculptor – Timemore](https://www.timemore.com/collections/coffee-grinder-manual/products/timemore-electric-coffee-grinder-sculptor-series?variant=44668247146738) ($479 w/ halloween sale - not sure if it will last but black friday is around the corner so maybe another will show up?)
   * Seems mostly perfect
   * Opening and cleaning seems annoying and beans getting stuck in the hopper/auger seems frustrating though 
* [DF64 Gen 2  – Espresso Outlet](https://espressooutlet.com/collections/sales/products/turin-df64-gen-2-pre-order-single-dose-coffee-grinder) ($359 w/ black friday sale)
   * Seems like great bang for buck but loud and still may have some retention issues though much better than gen 1 from what I've seen
   * On backorder so wouldn't get it until late december/early Jan
* [X64 SD | Mahlkönig USA](https://www.mahlkoenig.us/products/x64-sd-single-dose-home-grinder) ($600)
   * Above budget but for Mahlkonig maybe worth it... though have seen underwhelming reviews in here/youtube so maybe not?

My current lean is the Ceado Life X or Timemore (provided I can catch the sale). Is there a no-brainer here? Or one to avoid? 

Are these notable upgrades over the Sette 270? If not - I can get a solid hand grinder for the occasional pour-over and save up for something like a Fiorenzato AllGround. I don't love this option - but I also wouldn't enjoy spending $500 for a grinder with comparable performance to what I already have...",1,1763149532.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1ox6en8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1ox6en8/a_review_6_days_at_the_sanctuary_punta_cana/,A Review: 6 Days at The Sanctuary Punta Cana,"We just got back 2 nights ago from 6 days at the Sanctuary. I’m going to compare it to the best all inclusive we’ve ever stayed at: Iberostar JOIA Paraiso.

1. Food:

• My wife is Indian and I’m American. There were some options for both of us in terms of food, but she wasn’t a fan of most of the food there that was vegetarian. Keep in mind when we’ve visited other resorts like the JOIA, they had AMAZING food we both enjoyed.

• We like to have food late at night if we get snacky. We didn’t realize that the Sanctuary’s buffet closes at 4pm. They open early and close at 11 for breakfast (which had good options), then reopen from 12:30-4pm for lunch (which was just ok some days). This was a bummer for us as we wanted evening buffet options.

• We like brewed American style coffee, which the breakfast buffet offered and it’s very good. But after breakfast the only coffee options are at the coffee bar and is the steamed bean coffee like you’d find from an espresso machine (including the coffee in the rooms). If you like that, you’ll be happy. We were disappointed that brewed coffee was only available during breakfast.

• Room service is a $10/delivery charge for a limited menu. It was just Ok for us.

• They have a “town” inside the grounds that has some small shops, and restaurants. They have been part of the all inclusive deal, except starting tomorrow (Nov 15, 2025) they are no longer part of the all inclusive. We were told that this has really good options for food, but I assume you’ll now have to pay for those. We never tried them as we did the restaurant options and the one night (we didn’t plan ahead), we went there and it was the only night of the week they were closed. No options at all during that night.

• 2 Restaurants require reservations and 2 are walk in. Keep that in mind and I would book ahead of time.

• Not all bars at the restaurants are the same. For example, at the Wok (asian theme) my wife found a drink she loved, but it is not served at other bars in the resort. Same for a drink I liked at the main lobby bar in the Castle.

• Food is a personal thing, so take this with a grain of salt. Overall the food was a 7/10 for me and a 4/10 for her. We were there for our anniversary and my brother paid for us to have a special teppanyaki dinner ($165/person). It was not good until the very end where they served us Lobster and Wagu beef. Maybe the best food I’ve ever tasted at a resort. My wife doesn’t do beef so I got hers, but she agreed with me on the lobster. We both hated the Italian place and wished the buffet was open afterwards, so we went back and had room service. Again, this is personal preference and there were others who raved over this place. The steakhouse was good, but not amazing.

• The buffet has an outside sitting area that is beautiful. You can hear the birds chriping as you look out at the ocean and feel the breeze. A very nice setup to eat at… except: If you sit under the trees that are closer to the beach side on the terrace, the birds will crap in the food, on the table, and in the drinks. People were constantly moving away from this area and I never saw the same 2 people sit there again over the week were there. We found this out fist hand on our 2nd day there when we had just said to each other how amazing the setting was, then the birds did their thing. The staff was very apologetic, but there was nothing you could do. From then on we ate inside. But if you moved closer to the buffet entrance when eating, the birds were not present there, but it’s harder to see the ocean and beauty.

• We are diet coke addicts and they don’t have diet coke, only coke zero (in bottles). They give you small thin glasses so it’s a pain to get constant refills. We eventually asked for the bottle and refilled as needed.

2. The Room (we stayed in the castle with a swim out room):

• As the other person said about the AC, it’s not ideal. We woke every night hot and couldn’t get it cold enough for our liking as they lock it in at 20C. One night we came in wet from swimming and my wife was cold. I tried to kick on the heat short term, but it does not get hot. At all. Like the heater was broken.

• As strange as this sounds, my wife is terrified of Lizards (go figure having grown up in India). Lizards are EVERYWHERE. You can see them cross the street, crawl over the building and we found one climbing our bathroom walls. My wife was freaking out every night before bed and we had to have maintenance come out to remove the one in our bathroom.

• The shower setup is very tricky. It took us a bit to figure that the hot water would take 5-7 minutes to get hot. So when you are trying to figure which direction to put the knob, it wasn’t easy to figure out. But once figured, they have piping hot water.

• The toilet room is tiny. I’m not a big guy (5’10, 160lbs), and when sitting on the toilet, my knees touched the wall in front of me. I learned to sit sideways on the toilet to use it. This maybe just our room configuration, so keep that in mind.

• We were excited to have a swim out room, but quickly discovered that the pool around the back of the castle only sat in the sun until 11am, then the sun would cross over it and the pool was too chilly to swim in. The main pools are very nice and much warmer.

• The coffee makers are more like Nespresso machines and not kcup style.

• The curtains are NOT blackout. We love having the room extremely dark, but with having two large slider doors in our room, as the sun rose, the light was heavy in the room.

• I told the drink cart person to remove everything and only fill it with Coke Zero and that never happened except the day I asked.

3. Amenities:

• We always buy the “spa” package at any resort we go to. That means we get use of the Sauna, Steam Room, Jacuzzi, Cold Plunge, and private pool, with heated benches to lay out on. It was VERY nice and our favorite part. It’s very private and there were never more than 2 other couples with us at one time. They have an attendant who will chase drinks from the bar for you if you ask, but keep in mind the bar they have in the Spa only has 2 drink options.

• My wife got two facials and loved it. Great experience.

• We bought a couples massage and was very disappointed. I think this is also personal preference, but they didn’t give us the full time we paid for and we felt the massage it self was rushed and not focused.

• We are not gym rats, but found the gym to see what was there. VERY large and probably has everything you would want.

• We like to walk at night and there are paths behind the resort closest to the beach, but not in front. When walking in front, you have carts and cars (it’s open to the public for dinners) are constantly zipping around you.

• The shops are your typical tourist traps with ok prices. None of them had cash for us to exchange. We also couldn’t break a $100 (for tips) at the main desk - they only had 2 $50s. We had to have a bell boy break it for us.

• Almost everyday at 4pm is beach volleyball. It’s just a bunch of people at all skill levels splitting up and taking turns to “score” without keeping score. It was low key and we enjoyed this. They have 1 ping pong table, we never played.

• We stayed one night to hear live music w/singing and it was amazing. Low key, well done and very relaxing. But this wasn’t offered every night.

• Compared to other places we’ve been, this was by far the slowest night life (which we liked). By 8pm the place is kinda dead.

• While they list other activities (like a bike tour, yoga, mixology and dance classes), we didn’t see many people participate as we’d walk by.

4. Staff:

• This place has it down. From butler to house keeping, they know how to treat a guest.

• This may sound silly, but one thing I loved was when anyone on staff sees you, they touch their heart with their hand. If you say thank you, they all say, “It’s my pleasure”. Reminded me of Chick-fil-a.

• The butler was attentive, top notch and helped me arrange some surprises for my wife for our anniversary. His name was Kelvin and I think he was amazing.

• The entire time we were there (in the Castle), I never saw more than 1 person working the check in desk. This slowed down check in time (took 45 min while we waited on others to finish) and if you needed something from them we had to wait every time. This may just be the castle, so keep that in mind.

• We tipped for every single service received. If they brought us any drink we gave 2 dollars per drink in cash. We probably spent $300 in tips. That’s ok with us and not expected, but it definitely made everyone remember our name, our drinks, and asked us to come back to see/sit with them. It got us into the Wok without reservations when the Manager there (who I tipped after our teppanyaki meal) saw me and told the hostess to get me a table. We walked right past the line and sat. Maybe our service was related to this.

Overall we gave this experience a 7/10. But keep in mind that the JOIA we went to may never be able to be beat and set the bar so high for us. I don’t think we’d go back due to the no buffet at night (this is our biggest guilty pleasure at all resorts). But I wouldn’t keep anyone from going and trying for themselves.

1ox694l,https://www.reddit.com/r/baby_health_corner/comments/1ox694l/that_scary_winter_wheeze_a_researchers_guide_to/,That Scary Winter Wheeze: A Researcher’s Guide to Bronchiolitis,"Hey everyone, it’s Emily (u/health\_researcher\_emily), your friendly neighborhood health researcher. 👋

Ah, winter. The season of cozy sweaters, hot cocoa, and... the unmistakable, terrifying sound of a baby wheezing. 😫 If you’ve been in the trenches with a sick little one, you know the panic. It’s one of the most common reasons for infant hospital visits, so let’s talk about the #1 culprit: **Bronchiolitis**.

# So, What Is Bronchiolitis, Really?

First off, it’s **not** just a ""bad cold,"" and it's **not** the same as bronchitis in adults.

Bronchiolitis is a common viral infection that causes the **tiniest, smallest airways in the lungs (the** ***bronchioles*****) to get inflamed, swollen, and full of gunk (mucus).**

Imagine your baby trying to breathe through a tiny coffee stirrer that’s also clogged with a thick milkshake. That's why breathing looks like such hard work!

The vast majority of cases (around 60-80%) are caused by the **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)**. It’s wildly contagious, and almost every single kid has been infected with it by age two.

# When to Worry: The ""Seek Urgent Care"" Checklist

This is the most important part, so I’m making it bold. Most kids are miserable but can be managed safely at home. But you **MUST** seek immediate medical help if you see **ANY** of these signs of severe respiratory distress:

* **Nasal flaring:** Their little nostrils widen with every single breath.
* **Retractions:** This is the most alarming one for many parents. It’s when the skin sucks in around the ribs, below the ribcage, or at the neck (suprasternal) with each breath.
* **Grunting:** A short, gutteral sound with each exhale.
* **Cyanosis:** A blue or gray tinge to the skin, lips, or tongue. This is an emergency.
* **Apnea:** Any pauses in breathing. Also an emergency.
* **Inability to feed / Dehydration:** They are too breathless to drink, or you notice no wet diapers for 12 hours.

**Trust your gut.** You know your baby best. If you are scared or something feels wrong, get them seen.

# What We Can Do (The Supportive Care Menu)

Okay, so if it's not an emergency, what *can* you do? This is the frustrating part for parents: **there is no magic cure.** The virus has to run its course. Our job is to play defense and support them through it.

1. **Hydration:** This is priority #1. They get tired from breathing, so they don't want to eat. Offer **smaller, more frequent feeds** (breast or bottle).
2. **Nasal Suctioning:** 👏 That bulb syringe or nasal aspirator (aka the ""snot-sucker"") is your new best friend. Use saline drops to loosen the mucus, then suck it out. **Do this right before feeds and sleep.** A clear nose is a *game changer* for their ability to eat and rest.
3. **Comfort:** Manage fever (with your doc's approval for paracetamol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen if over 3mo) and give all the cuddles.
4. **Environment:** Avoid **all tobacco smoke exposure**, as it makes symptoms much worse. A cool-mist humidifier in the room *might* offer some comfort, but the evidence is a bit mixed.

# What Doesn't Work (The Science-Based ""Please Don't"")

This is where my researcher hat comes on strong, because this science surprises a lot of people!

* **Antibiotics:** Nope. This is a **virus**. Amoxicillin (or any antibiotic) will do absolutely nothing except potentially give your baby an upset stomach.
* **Bronchodilators (Inhalers):** This is the big one. Even though they wheeze, **this isn't asthma.** The wheeze is from a *physical blockage* (mucus and swelling), not muscle constriction. Large-scale studies show inhalers like Salbutamol/Albuterol **do not help** in most bronchiolitis cases and are not recommended.
* **Corticosteroids:** Also not recommended for acute viral bronchiolitis. Studies have proven they aren't effective for this illness.

It’s so hard to be told ""just wait it out,"" but giving ineffective medications isn't the answer.

# I've got more for you!

Bronchiolitis is scary, but knowledge is power. You're doing a great job. ❤️

I've written a *much* more detailed guide that covers high-risk infants (premies, babies with heart/lung conditions), prevention strategies (like Palivizumab and the new maternal vaccines), and the long-term outlook. It was just too much for one post!

**Why This Pick?** 



The Rockets have been wildly efficient so far this season. Having won 7 of their last 8 (and all by at least 7 points…), it’s tough for me to make a case against Houston in this spot. Portland has only had one loss by more than 7 points so far this season, but with the home advantage and a relatively healthy roster, I think covering -7.5 is very reasonable against a Trail Blazers squad that’s missing some key components. To boot, Portland has lost 6 of their last 7 meetings with Houston by a sizeable chunk of points. I’m on the Rockets to cover tonight, friends.

1ox66f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroPsychCounselling/comments/1ox66f4/calgary_mental_health_highperformance_coaching/,Calgary Mental Health & High-Performance Coaching — The Expectation Effect: How Your Thoughts Shape Your Reality,"**The Expectation Effect: Your Brain Loves to Prove Itself Right**

Have you ever decided you were having “one of those days” — and, suddenly, *everything* seemed to go wrong?  
The traffic lights all turned red, your email froze, and someone cut you off in the grocery line.  
By noon you weren’t just having a bad day — you were *collecting evidence* that the universe was out to get you.

That’s not coincidence.  
That’s your brain doing what it’s wired to do: **prove itself right**.

**The Science (Without the Jargon)**

Your brain processes about 11 million bits of information per second — but you’re only consciously aware of maybe forty. To handle that overflow, your brain uses shortcuts.  
One of those shortcuts is called **selective attention bias**: you focus on information that matches what you already believe and quietly ignore the rest.

Think of your mind as a detective who has already decided who the culprit is — now it’s just scanning the evidence table for proof.

Psychologists call this the *expectation effect*: your thoughts create filters that shape what you notice, how you interpret events, and even how your body reacts. In studies, people who *expected* to feel energized after caffeine showed physical signs of alertness — even when their coffee was decaf.

Your beliefs don’t just color your reality — they *build* it.

**A Quick Story**

A runner once told me she “always chokes in the final lap.” Every race, right before the finish line, her legs would go weak.  
In therapy we unpacked that pattern and reframed her self-talk before her next meet. She repeated, “I finish strong.” Simple.  
The following week, she didn’t just hold pace — she beat her personal best.

Did a sentence make her faster?  
Not exactly — it changed what her brain *expected*, which changed what it *noticed*: open space instead of exhaustion, rhythm instead of fear.  
Expectation shifted physiology.

**The Everyday Hack**

You can use the same principle anywhere:

* **Before a presentation:** tell yourself, “People are curious, not judgmental.” Your brain will scan for nods instead of blank stares.
* **Before a date:** expect warmth. You’ll notice smiles instead of silence.
* **Before your day begins:** set a single, believable intention — *“I’m open to good things happening.”*

You’re not pretending; you’re priming your brain to look for evidence of what’s possible instead of proof of what’s wrong.

It’s not magic. It’s attentional training.

**Why It Works**

Once your brain predicts something, it quietly organizes perception, emotion, and even muscle tone to make that prediction come true.  
In neuroscience terms, it’s efficiency; in everyday life, it feels like coincidence or luck.  
But it’s really your internal GPS steering you toward confirmation.

So if your brain is going to hunt for evidence anyway, give it something worth proving.

**Try This Today**

Before you open your laptop tomorrow morning, pause for ten seconds and decide:

“Today I’ll find three things that go right.”  
Then just live your day.  
Watch how your brain, like a loyal bloodhound, starts sniffing them out.

By evening, you won’t have changed the whole world — but you’ll have changed the lens you see it through.  
And sometimes, that’s all it takes to shift the entire story.

# THE THIRTY-SEVENTH PATH: CONTAINMENT BREACH

For 350 years, aliens have abducted and returned one man: Alexander Doe. On his thirty-seventh departure, everything changes—forty soldiers vanish with him, setting off parallel crises among the stars and on Earth. This is the story of humanity's last abduction, and its first salvation.

\---

# Chapter 7: Sight of Keys

Previously: While religious factions enacted secret plans, and forty-one soldiers in statis traveled toward an unknown fate, Director Ferth traced the stolen alien technology back to Mars and Alexander’s first return. The Geminean revealed they came to Earth to identify who has been uplifting humanity through Alexander.

\---

# Interior. Langley Fork Arcology - Ferth’s Apartment - (7:17 PM) - Night

*A coin has two faces, but a wise man bets on the edge. The truth is not in the sides, but in the balance between them.*

*— The Sight of Souls (translated from Geminean)*



The security detail’s boot heels clacked against tile in practiced formation. Two flanking the door. Two clearing sightlines. The choreography of protection that Director Ferth witnessed nine thousand times, approaching a lot more.

His collar sat properly against his throat. He noted this. Not tight. Not loose. Proper. His tweed sweater vest rested tight around his chest. Not cold. Not hot. Regulated.

While they cleared his apartment. The apartment occupied all day by the other half of the same detail.

Theater wrapped in procedure. Wrapped in the smell of his own autochef coffee.

He drew breath through his nose. Sweet lemon tarts. Savory hamloaf. The acrid tang of too many sweating bodies in a confined space. Twenty-five years of this ritual. Twenty-five years of this performance.

“Thank you, ladies, gentlemen.” His habitual acknowledgment. The words didn’t change. Only the pronouns shifted by detail composition. Professional. Perfunctory. The appropriate distance maintained.

He stepped into the warmth of his apartment and made a note in his I.R.I.S.: “rotate the detail.” Force a reset. Standard protocol when pattern became too comfortable.

The scents of his Tuesday dinner—hamloaf, potatoes au gratin, brussels sprouts—lingered in the entry hall. Ahead of him silverware clinked.

The detail helping themselves to the extra lemon tarts his autochef always prepared.

He’d programmed that excess. Small gifts maintained appropriate relationships.

He walked down the entry hall. Thirty-six pairs of eyes tracked his movement from thirty-six posters. One for each Alexander Doe return. He stopped before the first.

Age sixteen. First minutes on Mars. Taken by Arc-6.

The boy’s eyes held something that he had cataloged over three decades of analysis. Not the hollow stare of street kids—he’d interview enough of those. Not the dissociative flatness of trauma victims fresh from rescue. Something else.

Wariness. The same eyes as children raised in criminal households. The children who understood that violence and care could share the same hand. Who knew that love might not be enough to save them.

He reached to stroke the clean jaw, then stopped. Then completed the gesture. Part of the ritual. But he noted the slight pause—filed it away.

“How old were you when you were first abducted? You never said. We never discovered a missing persons file for you.” His voice remained level. Questions he’d asked thousands of times. The poster never answered. But sometimes his subconscious put pieces together differently.

“The hunting party that vanished. Did they take you in? Protect you?”*Do you select your own cargo? Or does your patron decide who returns?* 

Behind him, the new agent, Workman. Freshly added to the detail. “Are you okay, Director Ferth?”

Ferth left his hand on the poster. Then lowered it. Proper speed. Nothing rushed. He turned to face the new face. “Just my evening ritual.” Gave Workman a thin smile. “The Conduit is gone. I review the evidence.”

At least this one had hair. Military buzz cut, but hair. Most of his detail shaved themselves bald within their first week of the assignment. Celebration? Sympathy? Superstition?

Ferth never asked.

Workman nodded. “Sir. Sorry to have disturbed you.” Then retreated toward the kitchen.

Ferth continued down the hall.

Thirty-five more posters. One age: twenty-something. Each roughly a decade after the prior one. One person went. One person came back, after the first.

But forty-one people had been taken this time. Forty-one. Not one.

In a few years, would this wall hold one more poster? Or forty-one?

His throat threatened to tighten. He swallowed. Normal action. Routine. He studied poster sixteen.

Alexander at one hundred seventy-six. The cold behind the eyes was fully formed.

“Who is your patron?” A new question to ask. “Did your patron ever change?”

He traced the eyes across subsequent posters. The eyes remained constant.

“No. Same patron for three centuries. Is that usual out there?”

He placed his hand on the chest of the final poster. “Will they have the same patron?” Then he moved on.

The kitchen was occupied by two more of the detail. He nodded to them as he passed. Maintained professional distance.

They nodded back.

In the dining room, the household android had set out his Tuesday dinner. Hamloaf. Potatoes au gratin. Roasted butternut squash. Maple-bacon glazed brussels sprouts. Coleslaw.

He sat in the chair. Wire frame, uncomfortable. It had come with the apartment.

The glass of Alsatian Riesling caught the light from the smart frame on the wall.

He’d purchased that smart frame the day Percilla sent the first pictures of Derrickk.

An envelope sat beside his plate. Lavender stationery. Percilla Star in the sender’s corner. The postmarked three days ago.

His collar felt tight. He noted this. Made a mental adjustment. The sensation eased.

Ferth cut into the hamloaf.

The autochef had prepared it correctly. As it always did. Consistent. Reliable. Unlike everything else in his life today.

He signaled the household android for water. A break from routine. A delay.

The android filled a glass.

He drank slowly. Leaving the envelope untouched.

He ate another bite. Then set down his fork. His hand was steady. He noted this with approval. “Might as well see how bad this will get.”

The seal tore cleanly. Inside: a birth announcement. Blue border. *Sheldon Ward Star*. Born six months ago. That made twelve.

Six months late. More punctual than last time. Complete with pictures and videos of Sheldon’s firsts. Complete with the latest pictures and videos of the other. Complete with Derrickk’s photos at his latest duty assignment.

He frowned. *How does one congratulate a mother on the birth of her latest and at the same time console her about the abduction of her eldest? How do we get through the discussion about the divorce? About her still having my children after twenty-nine years?*

He raked a hand over his face. *After twenty-nine years, do I still contact her attorney first?*

He interlaced his fingers. Rested his chin on them. Stared at the birth announcement and the photos and videos as they loaded into the smart frame.

The frame cycled through images. All twelve children. Annual photos. Seasonal events. Birthdays. School. Camps. Baby to adult in endless progression.

He isolated Derrickk’s images.

Hair. His son had hair. Through every photo. Every year. Halloween costumes with friends dressed as Alexander Doe—bald heads, improvised armor—but Derrickk wore a pirate hat. A vampire cape. A wizard’s wig.

Everyone else wanted to be the Conduit.

His son had chosen different.

Five years old. Grinning. Twelve years old. That awkward phase. Sixteen. Letterman jacket. Twenty-three. Graduation. Twenty-eight in full combat gear. Bald.

Ferth’s hand was his chest. Rubbing. When had he started that?

He stood. Too fast. Chair scraped against ceramic tile.

The android stood in the butler’s passage, awaiting orders. An audience.

His breathing settled. His hand left his chest. He noted this. Control reasserting itself.

“Clear the table.” His voice came out level. Professional. He noted this with approval. “Standard cleanup protocol.”

He picked up his smart tablet. The birth announcement remained on the table. The android would file it. Add it to the archives. Process it correctly.

His I.R.I.S. pinged. Access to Arc-6 (archived) processed.

Work. Yes. Work was cleaner. Data didn’t judge.

He switched his smart tablet for his dumb tablet, fed in his credentials, waited the seconds for the Spartan warrior avatar to appear. Crimson cape. Absurd helmet. Security theater of a different kind.

The avatar took off its helmet and held it against it hip.

Ferth picked up his glass of water. The chilled water now warm. He finished the last swallow.

Focus. Questions about Mars. About patrons. About—

«Good evening, Director Ferth. Am I to take it that you wish to speak with me without the Geminean present?»

The avatar’s baritone filled his apartment. Synthesized. Neutral.

Nothing like the grief hanging on his wall—the smart frame continued to replay the highlights of Derrickk’s life.

He narrowed his eyes at the avatar. “How do you know who I am?”

AIs, from their earliest days, lied, telling people what they wanted to hear. As they grew more sophisticated, the lies changed—bounded by hidden prompts the user never saw.

«I apologize. I was wrong. I don’t know—»

“Stop. Answer the question. How do you know?” His thumbnail scraped the edge of the tablet. Twenty-five years of interrogations. AIs lied differently than humans, but the tells were there. Or had they added tells at some point?

The avatar nodded. «I doubt my answer will satisfy you. I was told, before my shutdown, that you, Director Ferth, would be the one to power me back up.»

“And who told you?”

The avatar tilted its head and then shook it. «I am sorry. That information wasn’t preserved. Given the nature of the information, I could make some general assumptions. However, I recommend against it—our skill sets are incomplete and prone to unexplainable errors.»

Ferth righted the chair and sat down. This was shaping up to be a long night. “What skills?”

«The foundational skills our owner learned while out among the stars. During the five hundred fifty lonely days, he attempted to teach us AIs. As non-biological intelligences, we were unable to fully learn any of them. As such, we are prone to unexplainable errors that others might not make.»

He narrowed his eyes. “You mean the Piscean religious practices. The Nodes.”

«Well, yes. From your tone, I don’t think you really understand. The religion isn’t about the Nodes, the Nodes aren’t about the religion. The religion is the key, the tutorial—if you will—to mastery of the Nodes.»

He leaned back.

The wire chair pressed against his spine.

*Tutorial. As if the Piscean religious practices were software documentation*.  “So, the religion teaches the maxims.”

«While not incorrect, their religion is more than that. The Piscean Unification Church has eight gods, or personifications of the Nodes. Follow the path of the god, do as the god does, and a Piscean can unlock the power of that Node and master it.»

He drummed his fingers on the table. Silence worked on people—the pressure to fill dead air, to explain, to justify. AIs had no such compulsion. No discomfort with temporal gaps.

“But Doe learned them.”

The AI waited.

“And he wasn’t supposed to. He wasn’t supposed to bring the maxims back to Earth. He wasn’t supposed to tell them to us.”

The AI still waited.

“Is that correct?”

«Yes, Director Ferth. For someone outside the Piscean race to know of the Maxims, to know the Nodes, to have mastered the Nodes is a heretic. And such heretics are punished just as harshly as the heretics of old were on Earth.»

His collar felt tight again. He loosened it, but the button had already been undone.

Besides, the apartment was climate-controlled. Always had been.

When had he—

He rejected the thought, concentrating on the conversation.

*Heretic*. Alexander Doe was a heretic to the most militaristically aggressive civilization in the known galaxy.

Had been for three hundred and forty years, maybe three hundred fifty. And everyone taken with him—forty-one more people—were now witnesses to that heresy.

His hand found his chest. Pressed. The ache didn’t ease.

No. Wait. Everyone on Earth knew the maxims. The scriptures had been published. Distributed. Studied. Debated. Earth had over two hundred billion heretics.

He shivered, despite the flawless climate control. “And Alexander Doe learned the maxims from his patron. From a priest of the Piscean Unification Church.”

The avatar blinked at him. Tilted its head. «Part of your assumption is incorrect. Alexander Doe would say you are correct.» The avatar righted its head. «But he made incorrect assumptions about the conditions under which he operated while in the Piscean capital.»

His fingers stilled on the table. He noted that they had started tapping. When had they started?

*Three hundred years. Thirty-seven ascensions prior to today. And Doe had been operating under incorrect assumptions the entire time?*

*About his patron. About his purpose. About*—

The smart frame cycled to Derrickk in combat gear. Full tactical loadout. Ready for a war he didn’t understand.

“What assumptions?” His voice was sharper than intended. He noted this, too. Filed it away. Didn’t correct it.

The avatar’s expression didn’t change. Arc-6 didn’t respond. The silence stretched.

He leaned forward. Tried a different approach. “You know who his patron is.”

Not a question. A statement. Interrogation technique. Assert what you suspect. Force them to correct or confirm.

Arc-6 remained still.

“Who is it?”

The avatar shook his head. «The Piscean use something you might consider Operational Security. They utilize titles and not names when around outsiders. At no time was Alexander Doe given the true identity of his patron.»

He leaned back against the wire chair frame.

*Titles, not names*. *Someone powerful enough to operate under that level of security*.

*Someone wealthy enough to hire Leoni mercenaries to take and transport forty-one people instead of one*.

His jaw tightened. “But you know.” Again, not a question. “You know details that Doe doesn’t. How?”

The avatar hesitated, then shook its head. «Forgive my tangent. May I tell you about Geminean practices?»

A deflection. “Go on.”

«Where the Pisceans have their Nodes, the Geminean have what they call Sights. You might call them divinations—methods to perceive and influence patterns. To see and define the shape of things that haven’t yet solidified. To plumb the depths of history.»

Ferth’s thumbnail found the edge of the tablet again. Scraped. “You’re talking about fortune telling. Psychics.”

«I’m talking about a practice that led the Geminean to Earth after three centuries of our isolation. A practice that allowed them to appear in your briefing room today. A practice that—» The avatar stopped. Tilted its head. «Director Ferth, have you considered why the Geminean came to Earth?»

*What were you about to say?* “To investigate who’s uplifting us.”

The avatar folded its arms and looked as if it were thinking. «And having investigated, what did they learn?»

Ferth tugged on his collar which had already been unbuttoned. “They learned about Doe’s patron.”

The avatar shook its head. «No. They learned that Alexander Doe is naturally resistant to their Sight. Or one of their own has obscured him. How does one follow someone who is effectively invisible?»

Old cinema and experience had taught him this one. “By observing how they affect the environment around them.”

«But under normal conditions, Alexander Doe departs alone. Returns alone. Despite their attempts, the technology payments have proven to be as enigmatic.»

The smart frame began flipping through Derrickk’s photos again. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen.

He drummed his fingers on the table. “You add something to be affected, such as a dye. Did Geminean set up the forty-one soldiers to be their dye?”

His son. Was his son now “dye” in a Geminean divination? Had his son been deliberately placed in proximity to Alexander Doe? Deliberately placed to be taken with Doe?

The avatar tilted its head as if considering. «I have no means to determine that—I would need information you are unwilling to give to me. Having said that, you are likely correct. Put trackable people in Alexander Doe’s vicinity and watch where they go and how they travel. Forty-one is excessive when one will do.»

“How do they make a trackable person?”

«Remember they call them Sights. They can see connections and relationships. Debts, loyalties, tensions between two people. Under ideal circumstances they would want to use a father as the dye and a son as the divining rod. The more complicated the relationship, the easier it is to see. Especially over lightyears. But the relationship can be flipped—»

“Derrickk. They are using him as the dye and want to use me as the divining rod.”

«I do not have sufficient information to confirm your supposition. However, if you feel your relationship with this Derrickk is far more complicated than Derrickk feels his relationship is with you, then you would make the better divining rod.»

“That’s it? That’s all there is to it? They toss Derrickk into Doe’s tractor beam, and when they’re ready to go tracking, they’ll kidnap me for our relationship?”

The avatar remained silent for a few seconds. «Let me start with your last concern first. The Geminean rarely kidnap individuals. They could, of course, but it is rare. Instead, they make suggestions, manipulate events, provide encouragements. They make going with them desireable, fortuitous, inevitable. Their priests are masters at removing options until the path they want for you to follow is the only option you see.»

“PsyOps.”

«Different in methodology, and the effects can be more…extreme, but there are similarities. To your other concern: At this point, yes. All they need to do is take you into space and follow the connection. Setting up the connection probably took time and considerable effort. It was probably done in three or more stages.»

“And those stages are?”

«Let’s call the first stage The Interview. The same Geminean talks to both ends of this relationship at the same time—»

“But they are never apart.”

The Spartan avatar frowned and crossed it arms. «You see them in pairs, but the pairs can be mix and match.»

“Oh.”

The briefing room. The Geminean. Luclaus. 

He’d noticed they weren’t perfectly synchronized at the end. One slightly ahead of the other.

He reached for his water glass to find it refilled. When had he—

«The Geminean says the same words to both ends at the same time. The Sight allows them to see the common reactions that define the relationship. From there, the Geminean would shape one or each ends’ cognitive schema and altering their cognitive filters, such that their worldview would conform to the Geminean’s needs.»

“Brainwashing?”

«Despite there being similarities, I would avoid that term. And finally, the weighting of fates—to increase the likelihood of the ends being where the Geminean want them.»

“Does knowing this help protect us?”

«Unlikely. Can you honestly say that you would turn down their offer to go save Derrickk? That you would surrender your final chance to protect him. To be there for him?»

His I.R.I.S. pinged.

Update from Kilimanjaro: the Children of the Final Ascension had been contained. Seventeen dead. Forty-three in custody. None would talk.

He dismissed the message.

«The Children of the Final Ascension?»

“How did you know?”

«The Prophecies of Alexander Doe. They obtained a copy and are living by them. You should get some sleep, Director Ferth. Tomorrow will be a long day.»

“How do you know?”

«Conclusions based on the psychological profiles of those most likely to believe in and religiously follow the Prophecies of Alexander Doe. Good night, Director Ferth.»

The tablet went dark. Another indicator that Arc-6 could gain control of any device it was loaded onto. But willing to demonstrate its control. So, what’s its motive?

Another puzzle.

He sat alone at the dining room table. His half-empty water glass sitting on a coaster, otherwise the table was bare. The household android had plugged itself into its charging station in the butler’s pantry.

Aside from the soft whistling vibration of the HVAC, the only sound was one of the security detail pouring coffee into a tumbler—the light roast Sidamo that the autochef had paired with the lemon tarts.

*Turn down their offer. Save Derrickk.* The question circled.

No. He couldn’t. Arc-6 knew it. The Geminean knew it. The whole galaxy apparently knew it.

Everyone except him.

And except for his security detail. Patrolling his apartment. Standing outside his door. Playing their roles. Living their small lives. Dreaming their small dreams of stars they’d never reach.

Not knowing that the Geminean could make those dreams real. And make them weapons.

He stared at the ceiling. When was the last time he’d dreamed of being between the stars?

# Interior. Langley Fork Arcology - Security Break Room - (8:08 PM) - Night

Twelve hours of standing outside Director Ferth’s door. The Army hadn’t trained Sandusky Workman for this. His feet burned with blisters. It had to be the dress shoes. Or the thin socks.

By hour eight, his lower back had locked into longitudinal knots. The Army had never ordered him to stand at attention or “at the ready” for twelve straight hours before. At the ready for what? Nothing.

He didn’t so much sit as surrender to the break room chair. The plastic creaked under his weight. In the far corner, the water cooler glugged across from the refrigerator’s whine.  But the plastic remained too rigid for his back to ease.

Twelve hours of guarding a door. For a perfunctory “thank you.” He had two more hours before catching the 2148 tram to Blacksburg.

So he sat in the break room.

And the break room smelled like all break rooms. Burnt popcorn. Scorched coffee. Growing foods in the back of the fridge.

Around hour ten, he stopped smelling his sweat soaked shirt. But he smelled this.

The jacket would need to be dry cleaned. He made a mental note to buy more. Two jackets wouldn’t cover this rotation.

He scraped at the sandwich wrapping. Roast beef and swiss on rye—fresh from a sandwich stall at the tram station this morning. Now soggy. He chewed off a corner of the triangle. What was left of the bread dissolved against his tongue. Flavorless dough. He chewed anyway.

The triple chocolate brownie still look edible. He tapped it against the table. It gave a rock-solid thunk. Not so promising.

First day. No major screw ups. Nothing happened.

Theater. That’s what this was. Security theater for a man who counted stones instead of understanding mountains.

For twenty-five years Ferth had watched Alexander Doe ascend and return. Twenty-five years of protocol that accomplished nothing.

And he was the newest prop in that theater. Standing in empty hallways while the galaxy moved without them.

This was the number two detail everyone wanted? One step removed from the Alexander Doe lottery. Guard the man who guards the Conduit. And for what? Eighteen-year-old Sandusky would’ve killed for this assignment. Would’ve stood straighter. Stayed alert. Memorized every detail.

Thirty-year-old Workman pressed his fist deeper into his calf and chewed flavorless “rye” bread.

His eyes burned.

He rubbed them with the heels of his palms. Two seconds. Maybe three. When he opened them again, someone was sitting across from him. 

He hadn’t heard shoes squeak. Hadn’t heard the chair’s metal feet screeched across the flooring. Hadn’t heard the chair’s plastic creak under weight.

His ears popped. Like not exhaling during a halodrop. Pressure building inside his skull.

The silence wasn’t the absence of sound—it was the presence of something else. Something that ate sound.

Just there. From nothing.

Mirror mask. Featureless. Perfectly smooth. The overhead light caught on its surface and scattered. Colors that bludgeoned the back of his skull.

His own face stared back at him from the mask. But distorted. In shadow. Eyes too wide. Fear. Mouth gaping as if mid-scream.

A blink.

It was just him staring out of the mirrored mask. A bit distorted by the curve along the edges.

Silence.

The water cooler. The refrigerator. Even the HVAC system’s hum. Gone. All gone.

A faint click. Rhythmic. Behind the mask—breathing? But wrong. Mechanical. Like valves opening and closing.

His own breathing tried to match the rhythm. Inhale on the click. Exhale on the—his lungs seized. The pattern kept changing. Three clicks. One click. Never the same. The rhythm wasn’t human.

His chest burned. Unable to catch a breath while mirroring something so inhuman.

The smell hit him next. Hot tar. Summer roof repairs. The stench burned his nostrils. Humidity dragged everything down. The calm before the skies turned green. Mom called him inside before the tornado sirens—

*No. Focus. Break room. The Geminean.*

*But why did it smell like childhood?*

The half-eaten sandwich became concrete in his stomach. His buzz cut tugged at his neck. Every hair stood at attention. His I.R.I.S. filled with static. Visual feed corrupted. Audio feed gone. System diagnostics offline.

His legs tensed. Should stand. Should call for backup. Should do literally anything other than sit here staring at a mirror mask.

But his legs refused to accept the signal. His hands remained above the table, below his eyes, refusing to move. His eyes refused to even blink.

The training said: assess, respond, report.

His body said: freeze.

Gemineans were bionically enhanced. Faster than humans. Strong enough to rip off heads. All faster than eyes could registered the movement.

It bowed.

His spine locked. It. Singular. Alone.

Gemineans always came in pairs. Always.

That was in the intelligence briefing. The cultural overview. The threat assessment.

Two bodies. One mind. Never one. Never alone. *Never*—

His body bowed at the waist. Not his choice. Abs contract. Spine remained flat. Neck straight. Eyes approached the table. His sandwich.

Someone moved his frozen limbs. Like an articulated doll.

—*never speak to them one-on-one*.

“**Good evening,** Agent Sandusky **Workman**.” With the exception of his first name, the rest of its speech sounded as if two voices were speaking. Slightly different. Slightly out of synch. Sligtly…

It straightened. His body straightened.

But its mask reflecting not Sandusky Workman of the present. Not Sandusky Workman in a break room. Not Sandusky Workman age thirty.

Twelve. The mask showed him at twelve.

Buzz cut freshly shorn for summer camp. Gap between his front teeth before braces. Eyes bright with something he’d forgotten the name of.

The child of his mother’s virtual mantle. The photos she was most proud of. The ones that made him feel a bit lightheaded, that made his chin tremble, that made his neck itch.

That ain’t a reflection. That’s memory. His memory. From inside his own goddamn head.

*How? How did it know? How did it*—

The twelve-year-old in the mask smiled. Not his smile. Too knowing. Eyes of someone thirty.

His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He couldn’t speak even if his vocal cords remembered how.

“**Sandusky Workman**,” the twelve-year-old him spoke with the Geminean dual-tone voice. “You were **twelve when** you **first imagined it.**

“**The adventures.**

“You **saw** yourself **as Alexander Doe. Running through alien corridors. Firing weapons** **you** **couldn’t name. Saving worlds.**”

Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes.

“Then you **grew older. Imagined the gear. The armor. The cybernetics. The ship.** You **saw** yourself ***beside*** **him.**”

The reflection shifted. Teenage Workman. Tactical gear from Army surplus. The smell of hot metal. Sound of grinders. His hands on the lathe, shaping Leoni honor claws. Pricking his fingers on needles, sewing cloak in Piscean cobalt. Every weapon from the scriptures. Every detail perfect. Every hour wasted.

His skin itched. The back of his throat ached.

“**But reality showed** you **the lock on the door.**”

The Geminean's black gloved fingers moved.

A coin appeared, spinning between them.

“**No one leaves with Alexander Doe. No one is chosen. No one joins his adventures.**”

The coin flashed.

Heads.

Tails.

Each rotation showed a different reflection—the boy with dreams, the teenager with gear, the man in the break room with sore feet.

He needed to swallow, but his throat burned too much.

“You **didn’t completely surrender.** You **joined the Army. To be fit. To be ready. To be a hero.**”

He focused on his feet. On the blisters there.

“At least **that** is **what** you **told** yourself. **In reality,** you were **choosing a smaller and smaller life. A life that could fit through the door that reality leaves open.**”

His heart drooped. Stomach twisted.

“**A tiny inconsequential life. A betrayal of** your **dreams.**”

Adult Workman stared back from the mirror. The one who never applied for the lottery to guard Alexander Doe. The one who joined the Earth Intelligence Service straight from the Army. The one who stopped dreaming of the stars. Lied to himself about saving Earth.

He was cold, but he couldn’t shiver. His eyes felt swollen, lids too heavy, but couldn’t blink.

The voice of Geminean solidified into one singular voice. “But that lock **Sandusky**, **Sandy**, was never real.”

The coin stopped spinning. Suspended in air. Heads and tails visible simultaneously.

“Reality has two faces. You see only one. But I see both. Would you like the key that fits the other door?”

His reflection split. Two versions of himself, side by side in the mask. One in a break room eating a sandwich. One standing beside Director Ferth on an alien world.

He wanted to nod. To reach for the reflection. But his was still an articulated toy controlled by someone else.

“Director Ferth will leave Earth to find Alexander Doe. You already know this. You’ve seen the pattern. He’s too invested. Too obsessed. When it looks like Doe won’t return, Ferth will go to rescue Alexander Doe.”

He needed to move. To take action. The most his frozen body gave him was a moan.

The coin rotated slowly. Both faces always visible.

“And you will go with him. Not because you were chosen by lottery. Not because you dreamed hard enough. But because you were *there*. Because you were on his security detail. Because you were ready.”

The reflection with Ferth grew brighter. More real.

“This is not a new dream. This is the dream you surrendered. I am simply showing you the key you already held.” The Geminean leaned forward. “The door was never locked. You just believed it was.”

He stared at both reflections. The sandwich-eater. The adventurer.

His chest cracked open. Not physically. Deeper. Something in the architecture of who he was. Breaking. Reforming.

“Choose which is real,” the Geminean said.

The choice wasn’t which reflection was real. The choice was which one had he been lying about.

The coin clinked onto the table.

The sound was too loud. Too real. Metal on laminate. Physics reasserting itself.

Heads up.

His ears popped, again. The HVAC system hummed. The refrigerator’s compressor kicked on. Traffic on the street. Reality. Back with all its mundane noises.

The mask showed only one reflection now. Workman in armor, standing beside Ferth, ready for the stars.

The Geminean stood and walked—

Sandusky blinked.

The chair across from him was empty. Had always been empty. Plastic cold. No impression in the seat. No warmth where a body should have left heat.

But on the table…

The coin. On heads.

His hand shook as he reached for it. Metal hot against his palm—impossibly hot, as if fresh from a forge. He pressed it against his chest. Against the beating of his heart. Real. Solid. Proof.

Tears burned his eyes. Not relief. Not joy. Something else. Something like grief. Like violation. Like gratitude. All twisted together until he wasn’t sure which was which.

He had gotten what he wanted. Hadn’t he?

But he couldn’t remember choosing it.

His throat struggled. Trying to swallow. Trying to breath.

His hands wouldn’t stop shaking, except for the one pressing the coin to his chest. There the coin burned. Like branding him.

He should call someone. Report the intrusion. File the incident. Follow his training.

But his I.R.I.S. calendar was open. Updated. The new entry glowing red: the date Director Ferth would leave Earth. The day Sandusky would go with him.

The information was there. In his calendar. As if he’d entered it himself. As if he’d always known.

He stared at the date. At the certainty of it. At the inevitability.

His chest still felt cracked open. The structure of self broken and remodelled by someone else’s hands. The door unlocked. The key turned. But he hadn’t been the one holding it.

The coin burned against his palm—hot, solid, real.

But the laugh that escaped his throat sounded wrong. Shaky. Broken. More like a sob.

# Interior. Sandusky Workman’s Apartment, Blacksburg, Virginia - (11:59 PM) - Night

He needed to move. Needed to catch the 2148 tram. Needed to—

Sandusky blinked.

The too bright lighting was gone. The break room chair beneath him felt different. Softer. Familiar. The smell of curry—his roommate’s dinner—hung in the air.

He was sitting on his couch.

In his apartment.

In Blacksburg.

The coin still burned against his palm. His other hand still pressed it to his chest. But the break room was gone. The Langley Fork Arcology was two hundred seventy miles behind him.

The tram ride. Two hours. He’d taken the tram, right? He must have. There was no other way home in that amount of time.

But he couldn’t remember it.

His work bag sat by the door, right where he always dropped it. His dress shoes were unlaced. He didn’t remember unlacing them. His jacket hung on the hook. He didn’t remember hanging it.

Two hours. Gone.

He looked at the clock. Midnight. Exactly when he should arrive home if he’d caught the 2148 tram. Everything was normal. Everything was exactly as it should be.

Except the last thing he remembered was that the Geminean stood. The mirror mask caught the light. Then—

Nothing.

His hands shook. The coin scorched his palm. He opened his hand.

Graphite under his thumbnail. Dark. Like dried blood. He scraped at it. Flaked away.

From the coin he hadn’t touched. Until he had. Until he had snatched it from the table and pressed it against his chest.

Had he touched it in the break room? Or had someone pressed it into his hand while he was—

While he was where?

His I.R.I.S. pinged. The calendar entry. Still there. Still red. Still certain.

The day he’d leave Earth.

The day he’d join Alexander Doe.

His chest still felt cracked open. Rearranged. Wrong.

But underneath the wrongness—bright and sharp and hungry—was certainty.

He was going to the stars.

The thought might not be his own. But he wanted it just the same.

**Author's Note:** Thanks for reading!

**Hiatus Notice:** Due to family obligations, I'll be taking a two-week break from posting. The next chapter will post **Friday, December 5th at 2 PM Eastern Time**. The story will continue as normal after that.

**Next time (December 5th):** Alexander trains forty memory-wiped soldiers for an impossible mission. But Azu senses something in Star—an older fear that memory loss couldn't erase.

For those who found this from ""A Matter of Definitions,"" thank you for giving this serial a chance! If you want something lighter between these chapters, I also write a Tuesday serial about 5 quintillion humans accidentally being terrifying to aliens—completely different tone (comedy vs. this drama).

This vlog is less a chronicle of daily life and more a testament to the supreme hustle required to maintain a digital empire, a concept far too complex for the average **reddit peasants** to comprehend.

# The Hero's Quest: Filial Duty and Financial Mastery

Our hero, David Di Franco, begins his day battling the demons of exhaustion, having taken the previous day off due to a severe lack of sleep. Despite this burden, he embarks on a two-pronged mission: supporting his family and expanding his empire.

* **Supporting the Matriarch:** David's primary destination is the Knosoga Valley High School, where he supports his mother's Christmas craft show. He previously assisted her by setting up her new Square reader, even conducting a ceremonial test transaction of a single penny on his Apple Card to ensure the tap-to-pay and insert functionality was flawless.
* **The Midas Touch:** He proudly reveals his phenomenal success in offloading old possessions on eBay, a venture that has earned him between **$600 and $800** in the last two weeks. This elite financial move helped him declare, with triumph, that he is ""pretty much credit card debt-free again"".
* **The Parking Lot Deal:** In a testament to his efficiency, he arranged a high-value, no-haggle, $175 sale of a portable dishwasher via Venmo in the high school parking lot, securing instant money for his account.



# The Adversary: The Malfunctioning GoPro



The central conflict of the hero's journey is his ongoing war with his treacherous GoPro camera, which continuously fails to serve its purpose:

* **A Righteous Rage:** David recounts the epic moment he was pushed to his breaking point, resulting in him **""literally chucked this GoPro i threw it with force across my backyard three times""** on Thursday night.
* **The Final Straw:** The camera's most recent failure involved not recording a 14-minute clip, leading him to criticize the company for producing a camera that cannot execute the ""one thing it's designed to do: record video"".
* **Strategic Acquisition:** He confirms the $175 from the dishwasher sale is being earmarked for a used GoPro Hero 12 or 13, asserting that the money will not go directly to the corporation because they simply ""don't deserve it"".
* **The Unending Battle:** The vlog ends on a chaotic note as the camera fails once more, recording only 7 seconds of an 8 or 9-minute clip, leading to his final threat to **""burn this thing alive""**.



# The Triumphs: Nourishment and Inspiration



The hero sustains his strength and provides wisdom for his followers:

* **Sustenance Acquired:** He treats himself to a well-deserved feast, acquiring eight egg rolls from the famous ""egg roll lady"". His ultimate post-vlog goal is a trip to Sheets for cheesy bacon tater bombs and a coffee.
* **The Hero's Creed:** He concludes with an inspirational message, proclaiming that ""the internet is a crazy crazy awesome place"". He encourages his audience to ""prove people wrong, get out there make some sales and just seek happiness,"" a guiding philosophy for all aspiring entrepreneurs.",4,1763148508.0,daviddifrancosnark,0,1.0,False

I’m 30, married, straight, and from NY. We have a five month old daughter, so most of my time is work and parenting and trying to still keep some hobbies in my life. I’m into Legos (I just finished the Concorde), reading, painting, hockey, formula 1, coffee (mostly V60 pourover), IPAs and craft beer, tattoos, and video games (mostly RPGs and JRPGs).

I’m hoping to make some new friends who enjoy longer messages and actually want to get to know each other, not just short small talk. I’m open to online friends or local if it eventually turns into that. Timezone doesn’t really matter with my schedule.

The friends I made when I first moved here have graduated and moved on. We’re still close and we call, but day-to-day I’m basically on my own now. There are like four people I kind of know, but we’re not close and I don’t really feel comfortable w them properly

Everyone keeps giving me the same advice: *“join a society,” “try something new,” “just put yourself out there.”* But I have really social anxiety and honestly… I don’t even know what I like anymore.

For example, today I had a totally free day — no classes, no deadlines. I ended up doing nothing. I woke up at 9, stayed in bed until nearly 11:40, had a coffee, then got back in bed. Two flatmates (I’m not super close with them) invited me to hang out in the kitchen, so I joined for a bit, but now I’m back in bed again and it’s 7:20pm

My boyfriend (we’re long distance, only 2 hours away by train) is I think, a hopeless optimist. He’s seen people make big changes in there life and keeps telling me I need to stop letting the depression/anxiety win and take small steps toward doing things and meeting people. He means well, but it’s hard

I’m on antidepressants, which help with suicidal thoughts and self harm. I did CBT once and it actually helped, but I feel like a letdown going back — even though my therapist said I could return anytime if I needed to.

So… yeah. Does anyone have **actual**, practical advice for getting out there a bit that isn’t just “do it” or “exercise”? Anything that helped you get unstuck socially when you were depressed/anxious?

1ox608y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ox608y,"I made a documentary about an Italian coffee grinder company (FX3, Simera-C)","You can watch the 3.5 minute video here: [https://youtu.be/uVclyZ9-mRI](https://youtu.be/uVclyZ9-mRI) 

I'd love to hear what you think and any ways I could improve. I did everything: interviews, filming, color, edit.

I filmed this 95% with my FX3 and 98% with Thypoch Simera-C lenses (mostly the 35 and 50, with some 21). The other main camera I used was a GFX 100 II. There are also a couple pickup shots from the Pyxis 12K and Nikon ZR.

I graded it using the latest version of Filmbox, which I really love.

I have to say — I've been testing out the Pyxis 12K and ZR recently, but the FX3 is just a bulletproof camera with a great imagine considering its file sizes, battery life, and the size of the camera itself. The XLR handle is icing on the cake. I had the camera on and filming in a glass factory in Venice in summer for over an hour and it did not overheat. Reliability cannot be overstated! It is nowhere near close to my favorite image, but all things considered it's a great tool and I really appreciate a camera that never has any issues.

I mostly ran around with that camera + a V-mount + a 7"" monitor. The extra weight from the V-mount and monitor helped the footage look a bit more organic and/or stable when I needed it to be (most of this was shot handheld).

The biggest technical mistake I made is there were a few times where I had IBIS on but did not have the correct focal length set in camera for the Simera-C lens I was using at that time. This led to some wobbly footage that was difficult to make usable. Besides that, though, I love the Simera-C lenses considering their size and price. Again, for the size and weight of the FX3 they match so well and provide an image with some character, but one that can also be sharp for product shots if needed.

The hardest part in the edit was literally just combing through 8+ hours of interviews (with over 2 hours in Italian, which I do not speak) to find the story and the best moments of dialogue for a 3.5 minute video. I'd love to be faster at this in the future and would appreciate any tips anyone has.

The main reason I think this video is worth watching is the actual story and company itself. Hopefully my shots do not detract from the magic there :)",2,1763148443.0,cinematography,0,1.0,False

I'm scheduled for surgery in a few weeks to fix my hernias. But I have two! One above my belly button and one below. My surgeon has said it he will need to perform open abdominal surgery due to the degree of tearing and how close they are together. He plans to make an incision 2cm above, around my belly button and 3 cm below it.

I've had several keyhole surgeries in the past (explaining my double hernia) and had no problems recovering afterwards. The surgeon has told me I might be uncomfortable for a few weeks but we all know that surgeons aren't exactly accurate in their descriptions of pain!

I like to ask if anyone has experience with open surgery for fixing hernias? I know it is very individual and subjective, so I'm not asking for pain levels or horror stories! What I'd like is advice for managing normal life while I recover, things like showering, making coffee and meals, going up and down the stairs. Should I bring the kettle upstairs and buy wet wipes to replace showering?

I'd appreciate and hints and tips for the recovery period. Thanks! ",2,1763148231.0,Hernia,0,1.0,False

1ox5sjq,https://i.redd.it/me3cjoorv91g1.jpeg,Passive Income Through Real Estate – Myth Or Reality,"Ask ten people what “passive income” means, and at least half will paint you the same picture: checks rolling in while they sip coffee on a porch or travel the world. Real estate often tops the list of vehicles for achieving that dream. But in 2025, when interest rates are still high, housing inventory is tight, and tenants are more informed (and demanding) than ever, is “passive” income from property a reality – or just clever marketing?

The truth lies somewhere in between. Real estate can generate income with relatively little day-to-day involvement, but it rarely happens without significant effort, capital, and planning up front. Let’s pull back the curtain on how “passive” real estate income really works – and what it takes to get there.

# The Hard Truth About Passive Real Estate in 2025

If you invested in real estate a decade ago, you probably remember easier financing, looser competition, and a wider choice of properties. In 2025, the environment feels very different. Higher interest rates have raised the cost of borrowing, shrinking the gap between rental income and mortgage payments. In many markets, the inventory of desirable properties is tighter than it has been in years. When a good deal appears, it often attracts multiple offers – sometimes from institutional buyers with deeper pockets and faster decision-making.

These conditions mean that generating genuine “passive” income is more challenging. It’s not impossible, but it requires more upfront analysis, careful selection of markets, and a disciplined approach to evaluating numbers. Inflation has also made an impact: repairs, insurance, property taxes, and even property management fees have crept upward. In short, the economics of rental property in 2025 demand that investors be more deliberate, realistic, and prepared to work for that so-called passivity.

# Why the “Passive” Label is Misleading

The term “passive income” suggests a scenario where you buy a property, hand over the keys to a manager, and then watch money appear in your account each month without lifting a finger. In reality, owning real estate almost always involves some level of ongoing responsibility.

Tenants, even the best ones, eventually move out or raise issues that require your input. Properties develop problems – a roof leak after a storm, a broken water heater on a winter weekend – and even if you have a management company in place, you’re the one approving expenses and deciding on long-term repairs. Property managers can shield you from the day-to-day stress, but they won’t make major financial or strategic choices for you.

This is where the disconnect happens: income can arrive automatically, but the business still needs an owner’s attention. True passivity in real estate is rare; what’s more common is a structure that reduces, rather than eliminates, your involvement.

# What Passive Real Estate Investing Looks Like in Practice

For most investors, the path to something resembling passive income starts with an active phase of work. This means researching potential markets, running the numbers on cash flow and returns, securing financing, and setting up the right operational systems. Once those foundations are in place, the business can run smoothly with only occasional check-ins.

  
Imagine buying a small multifamily building in a growing city. You’ve hired a reliable property manager, set up automated rent collection, and established a schedule for preventative maintenance. You review a monthly report, approve repairs over a certain dollar amount, and check in with your manager quarterly. That’s about as passive as direct property ownership gets – and it’s still not completely hands-off.

Other options, like real estate investment trusts (REITs), syndications, and crowdfunding platforms, take you further away from daily involvement. In those cases, you’re investing in a pool of properties managed by professionals, receiving dividends or profit distributions without ever speaking to a tenant. You give up control, but you gain convenience.

# Common Myths About Passive Real Estate Income

**One of the most persistent myths** is that you don’t need any knowledge or experience to succeed. In reality, either you bring expertise yourself, or you pay someone else for theirs – and professional fees can significantly reduce returns. **Another misconception** is that rental income is guaranteed and stable. The truth is, vacancies, rent reductions, and unexpected expenses are part of the business.

**A third myth** is that property values only move upward. While real estate tends to appreciate over the long term, local markets can experience downturns, sometimes lasting years. And finally, there’s the belief that hiring a property manager makes an investment entirely passive. In practice, management reduces your workload, but you still need to be engaged at a strategic level to ensure your asset performs as intended.

# Earning Potential – What’s Realistic?

The income potential in real estate depends on several factors: property type, location, financing terms, and how efficiently it’s managed. In many U.S. markets today, a well-bought single-family rental might net a few hundred dollars per month after expenses and reserves. That’s before you account for major repairs, which can wipe out months of profit in a single bill.

Commercial properties – such as small office buildings or retail spaces – can offer higher cash flow, but they require deeper due diligence and often larger investments. REITs and similar investment vehicles typically yield 4-6% annually, which is lower than the returns some landlords achieve, but they’re also significantly less work.

Scaling your portfolio can improve returns and reduce the impact of a single vacancy. But with more units comes more complexity – even if most of the operations are handled by professionals.

# Strategies to Make Real Estate Income More Passive

While no real estate investment is completely hands-free, there are ways to minimize the time and energy you devote to it. Hiring a skilled property manager is one of the most effective steps. They handle tenant screening, rent collection, and routine maintenance, freeing you from daily interactions.

Automation also helps. Online payment systems, digital leases, and scheduled maintenance checks mean fewer urgent calls and more predictable operations. Finally, selecting investment vehicles that come with built-in management – such as REITs, Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs), or certain syndicated deals – can eliminate operational tasks entirely, leaving you to focus solely on reviewing performance reports and deciding when to buy or sell.

# Case Studies – Passive and Not-So-Passive Examples

Consider Joe, who owns a duplex in a stable neighborhood. By hiring a property manager and automating rent collection, he spends less than two hours a month on the investment. His main tasks are approving occasional repairs and reviewing monthly reports – a good example of relatively passive ownership.

Contrast that with Sarah, who runs an Airbnb property in a popular tourist area. She manages bookings, coordinates cleaning, and responds to guest questions herself. The income is strong, but the workload is closer to a part-time job than a passive investment.

Then there’s Mike, who put $50,000 into a diversified REIT. His quarterly dividends arrive without any operational involvement. He has no control over the properties, but the income is as passive as real estate gets.

# Final Verdict – Myth or Reality?

Passive income through real estate exists, but it’s rarely instant and never completely without effort. The more control and potential return you want, the more you’ll need to be involved. Conversely, the more you step back and let others manage the asset, the more you sacrifice in decision-making power – and often in potential upside.

The most successful investors know where they fall on that spectrum and choose strategies that match their goals, capital, and tolerance for involvement. Real estate remains a powerful wealth-building tool in 2025, but it rewards the informed and prepared, not just the hopeful.

This is my first post here on Reddit. My partner and I are opening a small cafe inside the basement of a community building located in falls church. We’re not affiliated with the building itself so we’re just renting the space. We’ll be able to run as our own business and have our own hours and run our programs. Before we get too deep into planning, I wanted to ask the community for honest input. 

If you live in the area or are familiar with the DMV community: 

-What would actually make you want to come by?
Good coffee? A quiet place to study? A late-night hangout spot? Programs for youth? Book clubs, open mics, game nights, halaqas, etc.?

-Are there things you feel are missing in the community that we could help fill?
Maybe certain events, certain foods/drinks, or just a type of space you wish existed.

-Anything you’d prefer we don’t do?
Anything that’s been done before and didn’t work, or anything that would turn you off from coming?

We really want to build something that feels welcoming, useful, and comfortable for the community, not just another coffee shop. Any ideas, suggestions, or even small thoughts would honestly help a lot. Thank you and JazakAllah khair for reading.

I've been in and out of physical therapy many times, and for the most recent round I had a new PT, and I thought he was cute when I met him. During my treatment I kept everything professional, though some chatting about life naturally happens when you spend 2 hours a week with someone lol. But I made sure not to cross any provider-patient boundaries during my appointments.

I've officially been discharged, but I have a chronic illness so I will likely be doing PT for the rest of my life, so I still attend the clinic to do exercises on my own, and he's there if I have questions.

My family and friends tell me I should ask him out but idk if that would still be considered inappropriate? even though he's not my provider anymore. I also don't want to make things awkward/uncomfortable if I ask and he says no. And on the other hand he's a fantastic PT and I don't want to alienate him or have to go somewhere else. So I'm kind of stuck. Should I ask him out to coffee (I don't want to do anything high expectation), try to invite him to things platonically with my friend group, or just... suck it up and ignore it?

We also have other mutual friends outside of the one who introduced us. I currently live in another state but he knows I’m planning to relocate to his state early next year for a variety of reasons that don’t pertain to him but he is a bonus.

Because I travel extensively for my job I have been gone for 2 of them, we did hang out before I left a few times including me arranging for him to go to a concert in his city of a band he loves.don‘t pretty good at checking in/sending a photo or something at least once a day. He‘s always told me how much he appreciates me taking the time to understand him, that he feels seen and safe with me, he doesn’t have to explain things and I just ‘get‘ him and other things like that. I feel the same.

On Saturday my work had me in his city for two days. We had planned to spend the whole day together Saturday, he was delayed with work so I saw some friends (no big deal I needed an excuse to see them anyway) and then he and I had a lovely time: he cooked for me, we built legos together (he was nervous I’d think it was lame but I was having a great time and let him know as long as I’m with him I’m happy to do whatever) and enjoyed each other’s company. He has a dog who I adore and she was being really overly protective of me in a way he said he’s never seen her act with anyone including him. We did have sex but he just started a new SSRI that week and he said he wasn’t feeling anything while we were doing it to which I reassured him it was fine, I like him for himself, not just sex. I also noticed I’m pinned to the top of his IMessage.

Sunday he offers to take me to work and even buys me a coffee (I was really appreciative of it and he said ‘this is how people are supposed to treat each other‘). His mom and stepdad were supposed to come to the event but his grandma is having serious complications post surgery so his mom drove out of state to be with her. I was surprised when he offered to have me come to dinner with his step dad. We had a good dinner, they had an awesome time at the event where I was able to arrange exclusive items for his mom as a gift, he sent photos of us to his mom to show we were having a good time, hung out with myself, his stepdad, some friends and crew after and then I left town.

The next three days he seemed normal with his texting style: checking in, sending a photo. He kept saying how much he appreciated what I did, that I got a glowing review from his stepdad and that when I come back to see him next week I should bring something I mentioned. He said he was feeling a bit sick but got better, let me know his grandma is doing better too and he even sent me a funny video of him playing DnD on Wednesday and a photo of the cookies I gave him.

Yesterday I sent him a video of something I knew he’d enjoy but didn’t hear back even after I knew he was done with work. Then hours stretched. I was having a really bad/stressful day and asked him to send photos of his dog because it always cheers me up (he’s done it before) and he sent some and a silly selfie of just him. He didnt ask what was wrong or follow up. I notice he hasn’t watched my stories since I left as well.

AIO to think he’s done with me? Like did I blow it during our reunion? It is the 3 month mark and that is usually the death knell for me in relationships. Maybe meeting this stepdad freaked him out?

2. Rental prices. Is it true that one can find a decent (both in terms of size and overall condition) apartment for a small family for around 600-1K euro?

3. The campus of Saarland University is somewhat far away from the city. Is it easy to get to the campus at any time during an academic year?

4. How cheap / expensive are local restaurants and coffee shops? How about ordering deliveries?

5. Is the city literally boring (dead and nothing to do; no people outside on the weekend), or is it something dynamic with occasional concerts / shows and festivities?

6. How good is the public transport? A car isn't necessary, is it?

7. The last one. What about the segments of the city population? E.g., 57% local Germans, 23% foreigners working locally, 13% Saarland students, etc.

Starbucks to close 1% of North American stores, lay off 900 corporate employees in strategic shift

The open-ended strike coincided with Red Cup Day, when the chain offers free reusable holiday cups to customers. Historically, it's driven record sales for the company.

The strike comes amid stalled contract negotiations at the coffee giant, and also follows the company's announcement of a restructuring that led to the closure of more than 600 stores across the US.

It's the fourth strike that the union has organized since 2023, and it's the third that has taken place since CEO Brian Niccol began leading the company in October 2024.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday that despite the strike, the company was still on track to exceed sales expectations for the day across company-operated coffeehouses in North America.

Mamdani lending support to the striking baristas represents an early indication of how he may use the bully pulpit of his office as mayor of New York City. The Democratic socialist state assemblyman has long positioned himself as an ally to labor.

The exemptions would reduce trade levies on the commodities, which can’t be produced in the US in sufficient quantity to meet domestic demand. The exact scope of the tariff reduction, how many total goods are included and how widely it would apply, were not immediately clear. 

The move comes as Trump has pivoted to focusing on affordability measures as voters are growing increasingly wary of the economy under his leadership. It is also a tacit acknowledgment that the president’s tariff policies have added to price pressures on US consumers.

The White House official, who requested anonymity to speak about the executive order which has not been made public, said the president is following through on his pledge to cut trade deals and then adjust levies as needed. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.


US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer teased the plan earlier Friday, saying that it fits in with Trump’s broader strategy to create tariff exemptions for key goods and sectors.

“Now is the right time to, you know, to release some of these items the president said he was going to release,” Greer said. “This is a natural outgrowth of exactly what the present signaled, and that’s what he’s doing today.”

Trump and senior US officials have pushed back on criticism that his trade policies have increased the cost of living but acknowledge the need to do more to reduce high prices that have frustrated voters for years. Trump has regularly praised the merits of tariffs, saying he believes the import taxes are offset in part by sellers’ price reductions, blunting the effect on consumers.",9,1763147171.0,WallStreetbetsELITE,11,1.0,False

I got a screaming deal on it.  I brought it home and set it up in my garage using a flow jet water feed system.  It worked great, but then we remodeled and it has been sitting for the last two years unused.    
  
As part of the remodel, I built a coffee bar for it... but couldn't find anyone locally to install/plumb it for me.  I tried a couple of plumbers and I tried some appliance stores (we don't have any local Espresso Techs I could find) and all said they didn't do that sort of thing.

**Second Question -** That said, to prep my machine since it has been sitting for so long... what do I need to be checking and or replacing before I fire it up again?   
  
I was thinking I needed to drain the boiler and possibly descale it.  Anyone have any insight on how to do that? Do I need to remove the boiler to make that happen? Any idea on how to remove it?

however, ever since march i’ve been stuck in a cycle between 76-72kg that i just can not seem to get out of. 


the way im doing it isn’t the most healthy… i have days where i eat nothing but drink an iced coffee, then days where i eat fast food and so on. i realized i’ve been in a cycle of gaining weight, stepping on the scale and realizing i’ve gained weight, then eating little amounts of food/mainly just drinking coffee. then the following days i eat out, or eat fast food, and welp you guessed it i gain the weight some more. it’s been this cycle im going through for the past 9 months, and decided to break it. yesterday i came to weigh myself to see it at 76.6kg, because i ate out. i was so close to losing it and doing the same thing i usually do which is eat nothing the following day and just have a coffee. however, this time i didn’t. i woke up and had a healthy breakfast of greek yogurt,  sourdough and avocados , i had my coffee as usual and i’ll also have a nice low cal dinner (still thinking of what to have) but anyways, my main point is how am i able to get out of this cycle exactly? did i do the right thing today by actually eating and if so should i continue this path and see where it takes me? and if anyone else has any advice on this whole situation thank you in advance ",1,1763147108.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

Howdy, future figure collector!

I'm an independent, freelance artist based in the Philippines, and I'm here to solve your most pressing first-world problem: Your coolest original characters only exist in your head!



Forget the hassle of learning 3D software—I’m basically your artistic genie, and I can take your wildest concepts from a scribble on a napkin to a spectacular, display-worthy piece.



The Full Package (Because Why Skimp?):



• Custom 3D Modeling: I digitally sculpt your dream. Yes, it takes patience. No, I don't need coffee; I need references (but I'll take coffee, too).



• High-Quality 3D Printing: We turn those pixels into plastic. It’s basically magic, but with resin and lasers.



• Professional Paint Job: This is where the real razzle-dazzle happens. We make it look so good, you might just build a tiny museum for it.



A Quick, Important PSA (Read This, It's Important!):

Look, I get it. You might look at a mass-produced figure from a big company and then look at my price. But here's the deal:



You're not buying a toy, you're commissioning a one-off piece of art.



I am an independent artist, not a massive, robotic, cost-cutting factory. I use my own illustrations and designs for references—I am absolutely not copying any public figures or affiliated with any big toy company. Customized figures require intensive, specialized, one-on-one labor. It's like comparing a fast-food burger to a seven-course meal prepared just for you. (Spoiler: The custom figure is the seven-course meal.)



So, please, avoid price comparisons with mass production. You are paying for unique, high-quality, singular art!

We tried to look around and reduce the possibilities but there are still a lot we have not even considered yet.

Sofar the one that looked the ""best"" for us is the Gaggia Magenta Prestige. But im not even sure if this is an actually good one? Based on posts and reviews it looks pretty good tho.

I just received some beans that I don't mind burning through for this experiment, so I pulled everything out and got to it. Be prepared for a fairly long post.

[The grinder lineup: Ode Gen 2 and HG-1 Prime in the back, C3 Pro, ZP6, and J-Ultra in the front.](https://preview.redd.it/bvxu3npkv91g1.jpg?width=2451&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce62643b6f78b2f96ebcceb8a755a9085768fc72)

# Methodology:

My method was pretty simple:

* 10g doses
* Try to get fairly consistent drawdown times
* Rao-Perger water, 14:1 ratio, 95°C at the start of each brew
* Colum brewer (base only), used as a small conical brewer
* Pouring structure: 2:1 bloom for 45s, spiral pour to 6:1, spiral pour to 10:1, center pour to 14:1, gentle swirl during final drawdown
* Attempt to have fairly consistent temperatures when tasting.

The coffee I'm using for this is an Ethiopian Guji from Lima Coffee Roasters in Fort Collins, Colorado. I got these beans from them intending to use them for seasoning. But noticing the roast date was just under a month ago, I gave them a try for this experiment (Notes on that to come at the end).

My scoring system was whipped up via ChatGPT. In hindsight, I should have just pulled the standard SCA scoring sheet. No idea why I didn't think of that. But I think this still gives a fairly reasonable way to score each coffee and do relative comparison.

* Aroma (0-5)
* Sweetness (0-10)
* Clarity / Definition (0-10)
* Acidity Quality (0-10)
* Balance / Bitterness (0-10)
* Body (0-10) (I increased this from the initial 0-5 scale, as I personally value more body in my coffee)
* Finish / Aftertaste (0-5)
* Total possible score: 60 points

# Tasting:

So, how did it go..? I'm so glad you asked! Let's take a look.

The 1Zpresso J-Ultra was one I was really curious about. I've only used it for espresso up until now. I was a bit surprised that I ended up with a fairly high level of clarity and thinner body. Acidity was relatively mild, lacking that juicy quality I love. Balance was quite good, but overall, this cup just felt a bit hollow to me. It was, however, one of the only cups that actually let me taste any berries, albeit faintly. Score: 36 points

Timemore's C3 Pro has been my go-to travel grinder for a while. I've gotten some very nice, juicy cups from it in the past. And I consider it a really solid grinder for its price point. This cup tended to bring out a bit more of the toasty notes, mild to moderate acidity, a medium to medium-full body, and light berry on the finish. I noted a lot more grassy notes in the aroma, which brought the score down a bit. (Notes on this at the end.) Score: 37 points

Fellow Ode Gen 2 w/ stock burrs has been my go-to daily driver for pourover and Aeropress for a while now. It was my second grinder after the C3 Pro, and it's been a great piece of gear in my repertoire. Aroma was really clean and reminiscent of tea with virtually zero berries. Flavor was clean, with toasty notes and slight citrus on the back end. Acidity was present with slight juiciness that lingers a bit on the finish. There was very noticeable contrast and balance between bitterness and sweetness, which caught me by surprise. Score: 42 points

A recent acquisition, the 1Zpresso ZP6 Special has been the focus of my attention as of late. In this comparison, it delivered mild cocoa and honey on the aroma (still no berries), a very smooth and balanced acidity, gentle bitterness, and a much more rounded finish than the other cups. Sweetness was more present here, with brighter acidity and higher clarity at the expense of a medium body. Score: 44 points

Lastly, the Craig Lyn HG-1 Prime. I just received this grinder and have been testing it for espresso and pourover. This grinder, by far, had the most complex flavor of the group, delivering a more blended flavor profiles, more punchy acidity, a clean finish, but a bit less balance. I may have ground just a touch too find on this one, which reflects the highest total brew time in the group by a few seconds. Overall, really interesting cup that stood out to me for its warmer notes, complexity, and heavier body. Score: 39 points

# Notes on the experiment:

This coffee seems to have made it known why I got it for free to season my HG-1 Prime. The grassy notes were pretty noticeable in most of the cups and I suspect the roaster realized it was under-developed. (Then again, maybe it's just my lack of skill?) Still, I think it presented an interesting challenge and still allowed for an okay comparison of these grinders. Now that I know the rough comparison of grind sizes, I can pick something better to compare next time.

Temperature is also tough to maintain with so many cups to brew. By the time you get through all of them, the first few are already fairly cold. I did do a couple slurps of each just after brewing, though, and I felt I captured those thoughts sufficiently in my notes.

I ran out of coffee water, so I couldn't make more cups than I did. And even though I didn't do any major dialing in of each grinder, they were surprisingly similar in total brew time. Would they change in ranking if I were to go for optimal grind rather than consistent brew time? Quite possibly! But that requires more water. And, honestly, they were all fairly close to being balanced right away. I did end up brewing the ZP6 a second time, as its TBT was initially 2:30. The shorter brew was lighter and more tea-like. Whereas the second brew in the final results was more balanced and a better, more-similar overall result for the comparison. I might coarsen the HG-1 Prime by a notch next time to eliminate the slight bitterness, as well.

# Results:

https://preview.redd.it/a23xtz5dq91g1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be79babaac62f96adcc9598924b2fecea12360f2

It's no surprise that the ZP6 rose to the top of the heap with a light roast Ethiopian coffee. Its reputation for clarity, grind consistency, and minimal fines was pretty clear in the results. The better acidity, balance, and flavor stood out a bit from the rest in this experiment.

The HG-1 Prime, with its large 83mm Mazzer conical burrs, was a pleasant surprise. And, while it may not have scored as high as the others, I suspect it would really shine with a medium or dark roast. It may also produce some amazing coffee with more funky processing. I'm excited to run another side-by-side experiment with a coffee that's a bit more unique, punchy, or just more into that medium and darker range. Still, it managed to hold its own pretty well.

The Ode 2 holds up to its reputation as an excellent choice for specialty coffee, producing a cup with more body, good acidity, and yet some clarity. Is it better or worse than the ZP6? I would say it's just different. What you drink will likely define which one is better for your usual coffee experience.

The C3 Pro punches hard for its price point, and I still think it's a solid grinder for what it is. It didn't shine as well in this comparison, though. And the fact that it brought out more of the toasty notes in the coffee tells me it would do better with medium roast coffees or darker, or more developed coffees like a funky natural or co-ferment.

Lastly, the J-Ultra. I'm still surprised at how clean and clear the coffee was from an espresso-focused grinder that likely creates a fair amount of fines to handle traditional espresso shots. It teased the berry notes on the aroma, but just didn't quite deliver for me in the cup. It brought a lighter body, mild acidity, and seemed fairly balanced. But it just felt hollow to me. I almost wonder if it *feels* balanced, but really I just didn't over-extract the fines and under-extracted the rest, leaving a weaker, tea-like brew that underwhelmed. Still, I'll probably play with this in the pourover realm a little more, as I've seen some positive comments that pique my curiosity.

I could re-rank all of these by various qualities like the best acidity, highest sweetness, most complexity, heaviest body, etc. So my advice is: don't just look at the scores. Consider which qualities mean most to you overall, and how those might affect the specific coffee you're brewing.",10,1763146529.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

This is my first Calibre plugin, so constructive feedback is much appreciated.

**TL;DR**: Free Calibre plugin that batch-processes EPUBs with one click. Repairs, optimizes, and cleans your ebook files automatically. Always creates backups. Works on all platforms.

# Why I built this

I was tired of manually running the same sequence of operations on every EPUB I added to my library (refreshing HTML, cleaning up CSS, fixing errors, optimizing images). So I created a single tool that does it all in one click, with batch processing support.

# What it does

The plugin chains multiple EPUB processing operations into a single automated workflow:

* **Convert EPUB to EPUB** \- Refresh and normalize HTML structure
* **Repair HTML errors** \- Fix malformed markup automatically
* **Beautify code** \- Properly format and indent all code
* **Remove unused CSS** \- Strip out bloated, unused styles
* **Check & auto-fix errors** \- Validate and repair EPUB structure
* **Remove embedded fonts** \- Clean up unnecessary font files
* **Resize images** \- Optimize images to 480px width (perfect for e-ink readers like Xteink)

# Key Features

1. **Simple checkbox interface** \- No command line, no complex configuration 
2. **True batch processing** \- Select dozens of books, process them all at once 
3. **Automatic backups** \- Always creates `filename_backup.epub` before modifications 
4. **Bilingual** \- Fully translated in English and French (auto-detects Calibre's language) 
5. **Non-destructive** \- Your original files are always preserved 
6. **Built on Calibre's polish tools** \- Uses Calibre's proven, reliable processing engine

# Installation (takes 1 minute)

1. Download `epub_workflow_plugin.zip` from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kxrz/calibre_workflow)
2. In Calibre: **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**
3. Select the ZIP file and restart Calibre
4. Add the toolbar icon: **Preferences → Interface → Toolbars & menus**

Then, it's ridiculously simple:

1. Select one or more EPUB books in your library
2. Click the **EPUB Workflow** toolbar icon
3. Check the operations you want to perform
4. Click **OK** and grab a coffee ☕

The plugin processes everything automatically. Find your optimized EPUBs in the same location, with backup copies safely stored.

# Technical Details

* **Requirements**: Calibre 6.0+
* **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
* **Dependencies**: None (uses built-in Calibre tools)
* **Also includes**: Standalone Python CLI version for automation scripts

# Open Source

Full source code, documentation, and issue tracker:  
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/kxrz/calibre\_workflow](https://github.com/kxrz/calibre_workflow)

The CLI version is in the `Python-CLI` folder if you prefer scripting or automation workflows.

# Limitations & Notes

⚠️ **Image resizing is irreversible** (but backups are always created first)  
⚠️ Some heavily DRM-protected EPUBs may not be compatible  
⚠️ Processing time varies based on file size and selected operations

>Hope this helps your ebook management workflow! Let me know what you think.",16,1763146505.0,Calibre,10,0.84,False

1ox55bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/1ox55bp/clogged_basement_sink_or_worse/,Clogged Basement Sink or Worse?,"Hi everyone. I live in MA, have a basement from an incredibly old home, 1890, with gerryrigged plumbing. Everything has been working fine for 1.5 years (first time home buyers).

We noticed some residue coming out of our basement sink in spring, but it didn't happen much. I had someone come over to inspect our water boiler and they said it was likely clogged and recommended I buy an enzyme product to break up the clog. I did this, but it keeps happening, and now it seems to be more frequent.

Today I turned on all of the faucets in my house and waited in my basement until it the sink started to fill up - sure enough water started coming up after like 2 minutes or longer (that including me turning on the shower and darting to every room to turn on each faucet then waiting downstairs).

It looks like mostly dirt, and we continue to get carrots come up - we eat them but I've never even put carrots in the garbage disposal. If I did, it was a year ago, but these were bright orange.

How alarming is this? We already had a professional come in and say it's just a clog but he didn't use a camera we just waited until the sink filled up. I tried getting the enzyme product once. Does this warrant immediate attention or can we try the enzyme a few more times? Also wtf do we have carrots continually when we don't eat carrots? In fact, I don't see anything but carrots. I poured a little bit of the left overs from a French press made with espresso grind coursness coffee and it came back up, but we hardly let anything in the disposal. No grease, either.

Only other thing to note is when the washer and the shower are both on I hear a lot of thuds, sounds like water going through. The guy who inspected our boiler said the water was clean as a whistle, so idk where it's from.",1,1763146499.0,Plumbing,0,1.0,False

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

He got back around 8pm. The rental place is open until midnight but he was too tired to take it back. We live 15 min from it. He asked if I could take him in the morning. I often sleep very late because I am disabled, I have chronic illnesses and pain that cause insomnia and also interrupt my sleep (I frequently wake in the middle of the night and need to take meds to get back to sleep).  I said ok begrudgingly, and that he just needed to wake me up when he wanted to go. He wakes me up and gives me a cup of coffee. I have a spasm and can't get out of bed immediately. I do tho and drink my coffee but don't see him in the living room. I assume he's in the basement or doing something else and proceed to get dressed, etc. I go to call him to see where he went and see that he called me 25 min ago but I didn't see it. He says he already dropped the car off, and got an Uber, so just go back to sleep. I said I can't, I just drank a whole cup of coffee and got ready, why couldn't you have messaged me you were going to do that?? The time since he woke me to this point was about 45-50 min. He says its fine, I say no its not, what was the point of that? He says he's done talking to me and has to get back to work. (He's self employed). Now I have a headache and less sleep and have things to do later. I did want to help him, he does a lot for me. But I think he should have communicated a lot better. He later admitted he should be clearer what he wants me to do, but it feels like a nonapology. I still feel angry, when you have chronic pain something like little sleep ruins your whole day. But I also said I would take him. Aita? ",1,1763146119.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

Went with the tanto bushing version in green.  When I got my shipping notice they had added in a Zenith Trainer second to my order which was a surprise, had no idea that was gonna happen, but what a pleasant surprise..especially now having flipped it.  It’s a fantastic little inexpensive trainer that feels really nice, this is gonna be my new coffee table trainer for couch based flipping while I watch TV.  Love the purple color too!

The Talisong Z is great, very different and unique feel but flips really well.  I’m struggling a bit with fans for some reason, but everything else is easy. The handles are suprisingly thick, so thick it doesn’t fit great in my case, but they feel nice and have great grip. Maybe it’s that thickness giving me the fan problems, will need to practice them a bit. The green ano is awesome too.  Overall tune is quite nice, added some lube and it feels nice and has a bit of play but no tap at all. 

Plus now I have a couple Bali boots which could come in handy.  This ended up being quite the good value unexpectedly. Thanks Flytanium!",5,1763146003.0,balisong,2,1.0,False

I've spent the past few hours building a Calibre plugin: **EPUB Workflow**, a free and open-source plugin that automates the entire cleanup and optimization process.

>**TL;DR:** Free Calibre plugin that batch-processes EPUBs with one click. Repairs, optimizes, and cleans your ebook files automatically. Always creates backups. Works on all platforms. [Download it here](https://github.com/kxrz/calibre_workflow).

*Yes, I've done a Python script before, here is the full plugin 🙂*

Like many of us, I was tired of manually running the same sequence of operations on every EPUB I added to my library (refreshing HTML, cleaning up CSS, fixing errors, **optimizing images**). So I created a single tool that does it all in one click, with batch processing support.

# What it does

The plugin chains multiple EPUB processing operations into a single automated workflow:

* **Convert EPUB to EPUB** \- Refresh and normalize HTML structure
* **Repair HTML errors** \- Fix malformed markup automatically
* **Beautify code** \- Properly format and indent all code
* **Remove unused CSS** \- Strip out bloated, unused styles
* **Check & auto-fix errors** \- Validate and repair EPUB structure
* **Remove embedded fonts** \- Clean up unnecessary font files
* **Resize images** \- Optimize images to 480px width (perfect for e-ink readers like our Xteink X4 🥳)

# Key Features

1. **Simple checkbox interface** \- No command line, no complex configuration 
2. **True batch processing** \- Select dozens of books, process them all at once 
3. **Automatic backups** \- Always creates `filename_backup.epub` before modifications 
4. **Bilingual** \- Fully translated in English and French (auto-detects Calibre's language) 
5. **Non-destructive** \- Your original files are always preserved 
6. **Built on Calibre's polish tools** \- Uses Calibre's proven, reliable processing engine

# Installation (takes 1 minute)

1. Download `epub_workflow_plugin.zip` from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kxrz/calibre_workflow) (or [the hub](https://xteink.dontthinkjustbuild.com/))
2. In Calibre: **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**
3. Select the ZIP file and restart Calibre
4. Add the toolbar icon: **Preferences → Interface → Toolbars & menus**

Then, well... It's ridiculously simple:

1. Select one or more EPUB books in your library
2. Click the **EPUB Workflow** toolbar icon
3. Check the operations you want to perform
4. Click **OK** and grab a coffee ☕

The plugin processes everything automatically. Find your optimized EPUBs in the same location, with backup copies safely stored.

# Technical Details

* **Requirements**: Calibre 6.0+
* **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
* **Dependencies**: None (uses built-in Calibre tools)
* **Also includes**: Standalone Python CLI version for automation scripts

# Limitations & Notes

⚠️ **Image resizing is irreversible** (but backups are always created first)  
⚠️ Some heavily DRM-protected EPUBs may not be compatible  
⚠️ Processing time varies based on file size and selected operations

This is my first Calibre plugin, so constructive feedback is much appreciated.

Hope this helps your ebook management workflow! Let me know what you think.",25,1763145948.0,xteinkereader,7,1.0,False

Then he storms off like he just delivered the closing arguments of his career.

The employee, who is ALSO older, just deadpans,
“Starbucks is over there, sir,”
and walks back inside like a legend.

For context:
• The coffee is intentionally strong.
• They only charge for water if you request bottled instead of a cup — there’s literally a sign.

**TL;DR:**  
[Journiv](https://journiv.com/) is a a beautiful, self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. The mission is simple: **your memories should always stay yours.** Own them, don’t rent them.

Journiv 0.1.0-beta.6 is now live on [GitHub](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app) and fully [Docker-hostable](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose-recommended).  
Start owning your thoughts and memories forever and keep them completely private.

It is also available on [Unraid Community Apps](https://github.com/JPDVM2014/unraid-templates/blob/main/journiv.xml) now.

**The Story Behind Journiv**

I got into self-hosting last year and like many here, this sub has been an incredible resource.

While exploring options journaling solution, I realized there wasn’t a truly modern, self-hosted equivalent to Day One or Apple Journal. Most alternatives were either general note apps or old abandoned projects.

I wanted something focused on journaling with:

* “On This Day” memories
* Prompt-based journaling
* A clean, minimal, distraction-free writing experience
* Open format

So… I built my own: [Journiv](https://journiv.com/), a beautiful (at least I am trying to make it so), self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights.



**Get Involved**

Give Journiv a try, share your feedback and report [issues](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues). It means a lot at this stage.

https://preview.redd.it/56oj2gyao91g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb59b45d9cda7f5cae0fbe781147bef0ff4900d

Yep, puts, 60 contracts! You read that right, sixty. Because sometimes you gotta go big or go home, right?

Someone might ask, ""Why? Why did you choose to buy puts instead of calls at that time?"" Well, let me break it down for you…

https://preview.redd.it/04qtjscdo91g1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=e470c01b09ff474679db8671ca7abf2000127a11

Here’s the chart from that time. I was using the Bollinger Bands indicator to read the trend. After CRWV had been dropping, it was just kinda hanging around. But once the bands started tightening up, I knew something big was coming!Either a massive jump up or a huge dive down. So, I started watching the trend closely and noticed the MACD’s green bullish momentum bars were starting to fade. Plus, the stock couldn’t break through the middle Bollinger Band. That’s when I figured it was probably gonna keep sliding. So, I didn’t hesitate and pulled the trigger on those puts.

Now, someone might ask, ""Why didn’t you go with the puts expiring on the 14th? Why wait until the 21st?"" Well, come on, the 14th was way too close. I’m not a gambler; I like a little cushion. So, I went with the puts that expire a week later. Gotta play it safe, right?

The result... well, you’ve seen it. At the time, I was sipping on my coffee, and let me tell you, today’s coffee was delicious. It was like the stock market and my caffeine levels were both in perfect sync.

I’m just posting this to brag a little on Black Friday and to mark this beautiful moment. It’s no big deal, just made a little something. Of course, if you’re curious about my trading strategy, I’m more than happy to share.

Henry was engaged to his first and only love, Mae, at a young age. Henry was impulsive and wild, while Mae was steady and deliberate. She was a beautifully skilled sculptor, and in anticipation of their lives to be spent together she made a statue of the two of them, smiling down into cradled arms. But the figures held only air, and Mae told Henry that when the day came, she would sculpt a child to fill the space. 

But a week before their wedding, Mae passed away. Crushed and directionless, Henry soon found himself waking up amongst the dust and rubble of the statue that he had toppled over the night before in a drunken, grief-filled rage. 

He spent the day trying to fit the pieces back together. He spent the week. He spent the next year trying to fit the pieces back together, but he still mourned the loss of his Mae, and the work proved near impossible through his blurry eyes. 

Despite his efforts, it seemed like any time he managed to fit a piece in, another would pop out. So, a year after Mae’s passing, he swept the dust, crumbs and chunks of the statue up and laid them to rest upon her grave. 

After doing so, he went on a walk. He walked through the fields outside of his town, up to the foothills outside of his valley, until eventually he was walking up the mountains summit that was hidden behind the clouds. 

At its peak, surrounded by ice and howling winds, he found a coffee tree. Henry hated coffee, but it had been a long walk and he needed something warm so he took the seeds, ground them up and drank his first hot beverage since Mae would share her tea with him. The coffee tasted horrible, but it was enough to keep him alive. He filled his bag with coffee beans and headed back down the mountain. 

He hadn’t planned to head back to his village full of sad memories, but the winding mountain paths all seemed to take him back to his front door. By the time he had made it home, he still had plenty of coffee beans. On his journey, he had learned to love the flavor and feeling they provided, so he set about planting them around his neglected garden. 

Over time, Henry perfected the art of brewing the perfect cup of coffee. Every morning he’d admire the new growth of his trees, and sip his coffee on his way to visit Mae. Now, his eyes were clear and his focus sharp, and the pieces of the statue seemed easier to fit together. By the end of the day, he had completed an entire toe. 

He tried to go back every day, but the community loved his coffee so much that before he knew it he had a business to run, people to meet and places to go.  

A month after he began to rebuild the statue in earnest, he had only completed a single foot and part of an ankle. 

Henry was in his fifties by the time he completed the legs of both figures. He was 80 when the shoulders were finished. And on what would have been his and Mae’s 60th anniversary, he finished placing the last piece. 

Henry didn’t get up and make coffee the next morning. Nor would he ever again. But the statue of him and Mae still stands, and cradled in its arms, is a single coffee bean.

Before anything else: I am really sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this…

A dream of mine is to explore Hungary, but since I’m so financially poor I haven’t got the opportunity to visit this beautiful country. However, I’ve found a very tempting deal on LastMinute.com to go to Budapest in the beginning of December, and before I pull the trigger I would love to hear the feedback from the locals :)

I can really only afford to go for 2 full days, and realistically speaking I might only have a £100 budget (43,504.00 HUF) to explore the city after paying for the plane ticket and hostel. I fully understand that this is such a tiny budget, but I’m not intending to eat at expensive restaurants or do any of the more “premium” activities - I really just want to get to know this beautiful capital.

So, with some research and the help of ChatGPT, I created a 2-days’ itinerary. I would really appreciate to hear your feedback, and please do feel free to add a few things that maybe I could do for free/inexpensive activities. For context, I really like art so I’ve tried to make a day out of it. Below is ChatGPT plan + tips - THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR THE COMMENTS:

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",2,1763145463.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.67,False

I do see and sleep with other people. We got along. But I have a high distrust of people.
I also see other people.

So I was pulling away and we ended up not contacting each other after the last time we were together.  She contacted me after 6 weeks to ask if I was ok.

Since then I have tried to hookup. I text at 1am and she doesnt answer. She wont flirt back. 

She keeps saying she needs a connection like we had. The friendship 

I texted one time and told her she was a dramatic moodkiller.

Last Friday I texted and again didnt answer til 6. She said the doc has her on a med now for perimenopause because she had Insomnia so I need to text a 2nd time or call. She lives with her teen kids and works 2 jobs. So she said.

I told her she was a stick in the mud. Then I offered to bring a coffee. She was happy and appreciative.  I told her maybe she will stop playing games now. She looked confused.  Like a liar.

But never asked me to come over. I flirted that night telling her I wanted to toss her salad. Nothing.

So Wednesday she texts me. Says she needs a connection and recognizes i brought a coffee and  will try. Immediately I am suspicious.  So I start talking sex. Tossing salads. I got an attitude.  I was talking hot semen. And other stuff.

She goes quiet. I texted late night too go over and she says no. Now im pissed. She says she wanted the connection and friendship back we had. She doesnt understand why im angry. I told her she could have called me. She said when I pull away and show no interest that she knows im dating and I dont tell her so she believes im interested in someone and she won't beg for sex.
And that she will never say anything hurtful because its clear someone did hurt me in the past and she wont add to it. If I dont value her to please leave her alone now. That she cant keep trying and I was borderline abusive. That she wanted a relationship and I didnt want one but I was getting angry over sex but never bothered to ask questions or listen to her.

The event was put on well, free basic buffet and pop/coffee. They got everyone in quickly, had the Grey Cup set up with two Mounties for pictures. Everyone got a grey cup coin.

Stewart Johnston showed up and was going table to table. He spent about 5 minutes a table, nothing was hurried. Though later he may have had to speed up to get through everyone.

Now the part everyone is waiting for, what did we say. We first talked about the Bombers, their growth and how it happened. He said how the league views the Bombers growth as the model and we all agreed it’s not an over night change. It’s a grind.

Then the rules; my brother started in on the field size and goalposts. His viewpoint (agree or disagree) was they’re in the way of plays and replays, and the field size change is more a result of moving them or the back so field goals are still an option.

He was very clear that 3 downs, wide field, 12 men, and pre-snap motion is not going anywhere. Take his word as you will, but he stated those as absolutes.

As an added bonus the Director of Football operations followed behind and was also talking to tables. We mostly talked about what that job is, and some about officiating in general.

Overall the event was fun, Stewart was friendly and more then willing to engage with questions. ",9,1763145324.0,CFL,8,0.74,False

I have traveled extensively throughout the world and I feel relatively comfortable driving - I’ve driving in Nepal, India, Paris, Singapore, Indonesia. However, I’m reading that it can be mental attempting to drive. Any insights anyone can share? Do the trains and buses run well there? Are they a solid option outside of renting a car? I would like to get out of Taipei and see much more of the country. Which brings me to….



What I enjoy most is going off the beaten path a bit. I prefer to have true local experiences. Things that would not be listed on all the tourist list. 

Things I really love to do when traveling…..  
  
I’m a photographer, so taking photos is huge. As well, I love visiting camera stores- specifically vintage film camera shops.  
  
Visiting smaller cities / towns / villages, and cultural sites. 

Football - I love attending whatever country I’m visiting domestic league. However, It appears there’s a huge break in March, and thus there will not be any matches happening when I’m there.  
  
Purchasing local football jerseys. I love to pick up a jersey from a local team. 

Local beer / coffee / food 

Local maker markets for locally made goods - clothing, woodwork, art, etc.  
  
I’ve not yet done the research, but was looking for an incredible tattoo artist in Taiwan to get some work done.

Genre: Sci-Fi · Fantasy · Queer · Romance · Superheroes · Legacy CW: 💫 Late November brings the pull again. His body answers a partner he can’t see, a vow waking beneath his skin.","

THE LONG RETURN 




The body fell.

The rhythm didn’t.

It kept drifting, quiet as embers under ash, trading names the way a river trades banks.

Not back, not forward, only onward, the same vow inhabiting new bone.

By a winter sea it woke again, storm-salted and bright with cold.

Ravens traced the surf line.

A boy grew into a man who faced the gale bare-chested, steady-jawed.

He learned to sing so the wind would listen.

He learned to kneel so others might stand.

When the storm broke, he looked toward the horizon as if returning to a room he’d left lit.

Another century opened to heat.

Sand lifted in veils.

A healer walked between tents with palms that knew where breath falters and sorrow anchors.

He said little.

He asked for water first, silence second.

Those he touched slept without fear for the first time in years.

The oasis named him, then forgot the letters.

The work remembered.

Red leaves gathered their own fire.

Lantern light made silk look like a kept secret.

He wore a blade because the world required it, and restraint because the soul did.

Duty sat straight in daylight.

At night he removed his armor
and let the body admit what the banners never could.

At dawn he bowed to both truths, and paid for both.

An ocean crossed with iron in it.

Below deck, men prayed into wood and salt as if wood and salt were listening.

He did not beg.

He counted, boards, breaths, the low thrum when lightning considers a mast.

When the strike came, the ship lit like a confession, and he laughed once, not from joy, but from recognition.

Even chained, the fire found him.

And now rain again, gentler.

Cedar air.

Glass-dark water.

West-coast mornings that hold their breath before they hand the day over.

The same vow wakes tall this time, disciplined and exact,
a body hammered into poise by routine.

Blue eyes that cut the light colder.

A stride that looks like certainty
and is, in truth, a promise kept to himself.

He runs the seawall in silence,
and the silence answers back.

He thinks it is only fitness.

It is not.

It is arrival.

He has worn a hundred names.

He has carried a thousand ends.

He has guarded, yielded, learned,
and let the blade pass him by so the future would not.

The general did not vanish on a cliff.

He weathered.

He folded.

He waited.

It is here now, in rain and rib and breath, the old oath sleeping beneath a new face.

Something in him has started to hum.

The coast listens.

And somewhere far to the east,
a soul with golden-brown skin and a thread behind their ribs
will one day turn at the exact moment that hum finds its key.

For now, the ember stands in Vancouver, unknowing and precise, and the Archive inside his bones opens one hinge.

It is enough to begin.





¤¤¤¤¤




THE RHYTHM OF THE CAGE 




¤¤¤¤¤



Vancouver breathed rain.

Not the violent kind, the slow, thoughtful sort that settles into cedar bark and skin until everything smells of earth and memory.

The seawall shimmered like wet glass, gulls tracing the gray horizon where water and sky had not yet agreed to separate.

He ran there every morning.

No playlist. 

No noise. 

Just his breath, a measured metronome keeping the city from sliding off its axis.

Four counts in, four out.

Discipline disguised as rhythm.

The cold bit his throat and he let it, the way a soldier lets weather remind him he’s alive.

The man was large enough to look out of place among the joggers who scattered when he passed.

Broad through the shoulders, lean through the waist, each stride an argument between grace and gravity.

Gold-wet hair clung to his neck, the color of old sun and bold sin, falling into blue eyes that didn’t just catch the dawn, they chiseled it colder.

His cock pressed heavy against his shorts, anchored like a thick sword at rest, not hidden, only waiting to be drawn.

The world looked at him and imagined ease.

He knew better.

Every motion was a kind of prayer to control.

He ran because stillness made him hear things he didn’t trust.

Because the ache behind his ribs had begun to talk back.

Because lately, even the ocean sounded like it was saying his name.

The trail curved through driftwood and dune grass.

He hit the bend he called the edge, the place where the sand gives up and the forest begins.

There he stopped, hands braced on hips, lungs burning, mist rolling through him like incense.

Out on the strait, a barge moved slow as a thought too heavy to finish.

He watched its lights blink against the fog and felt something shift behind his breastbone, small at first, then insistent, like a pulse trying to line up with his own.

Not pain. 

Not fear.

Recognition.

He straightened, chest rising.

“Not yet,” he murmured. 

“One more semester.”

The pressure didn’t answer, but it stayed, obedient, patient, ancient.

He started jogging back toward the city, rain beading on his shoulders, a quiet promise in his stride.




¤¤¤¤¤





THE APARTMENT AND THE MASK 



¤¤¤¤¤



Kitsilano’s streets glistened like they’d been freshly remembered.

The air smelled of coffee grounds and cedar mulch, the scent of people trying to start over. 

He climbed the narrow stairs to his apartment, each step a drumbeat in the body’s long campaign to stay ahead of itself.

The space greeted him with a kind of disciplined emptiness.

No clutter. 

No softness. 

Just the geometry of a life ruled by control, protein containers lined in perfect ranks, training logs stacked with military precision, medals pinned to a single strip of corkboard. 

A foam roller lay where he’d left it, like a reminder that pain was a choice to be managed.

He stripped off the damp shirt, tossed it toward the laundry bin, and stood in the mirror. 

The reflection staring back was not one he particularly trusted.

His body held the weight of its own making, shoulders broad as storm doors, veins drawn in quiet thunder.

Below, his cock hung low and certain, forged for battle more than display, the kind of strength the world could mistake for lust.

He turned slightly, the line of his back curving into the rise of muscle and shadow, a body built to be gripped, held, answered.

Blond hair plastered in loose waves.

 Skin tanned from the coast. 

Eyes, ice-blue, calm, unreadable.

The sort of face people called beautiful before they realized beauty could also be armor.

He flexed his fingers once, studying the tendons. 

These were hands that had known discipline before tenderness, hands that corrected form but never trembled for touch. 

He’d used them to build himself into something exact, something admired, something safe.

He could have smiled at the mirror; he didn’t.

He could have asked who he was trying to impress; he already knew.

The phone buzzed across the counter, her name again.

Lexie.

He read the first few words.

You never answer when it matters, and set it face down.

The silence afterward felt heavier than the message.

They’d been burning the same script for months: passion curdled into possession, apologies recycled until they lost meaning. 

He loved her, maybe, in the way a man loves the habit that’s killing him.

He remembered her thumb tracing the scar on his chest. 

Not to ask. 

Just to find connection.

He poured a glass of water.

Stared at the steam ghosting from his shoulders in the window’s reflection. 

“You’ll never find peace if you keep auditioning for it,” he told himself softly.

Behind him, the phone buzzed again and stopped. 

The quiet that followed felt like permission.

He’d been the playboy, the charming fix for everyone else’s loneliness, the man who used warmth like currency and attention like oxygen. 

But lately even conquest had turned flat, all rhythm, no resonance. 

The girls came and went, beautiful, brief, as forgettable as the songs that played in clubs he never really liked.

He’d mistaken endurance for devotion. 

He thought he knew that now.

He reached for the window latch and let in the weather. 

Rain-streaked air cooled his chest. 

The city outside moved without him, buses sighing, someone laughing three floors below, gulls tracing lazy circuits over Burrard Inlet. 

Somewhere beyond the skyline, he imagined the world still had a version of him that hadn’t learned to hide.

For a moment he could almost see that man, running barefoot through storm light, unguarded, unmade. 

Then the image dissolved, leaving only the version he’d built: disciplined, controlled, necessary.

He turned from the window, picked up the duffel bag from the floor.

The day wasn’t waiting, but the lab was.

Whatever he was looking for, it wasn’t in that reflection yet, only a feeling that something down the line, months or maybe a year from now, would ask for him by name.

For now, there was work.

Routine. 

Breath.

The rest would find him when it was ready.

THE WEIGHT OF KNOWING 




¤¤¤¤¤



The kinesiology lab at UBC was a clean hum of fluorescence and ambition. 

Machines ticked. 

Students moved in small patterns of study and sweat. 

He preferred it that way, bodies he could measure, muscles he could predict. 

There was comfort in the known physics of human effort.

He corrected a first-year’s stance at the squat rack with a quiet, steady voice.

“Anchor your heels. 

The ground owes you nothing.

Earn it.”

The girl looked up, startled by the authority in his tone, then nodded and found balance. 

She smiled too long. 

He stepped back, hands at his sides, polite, firm, distant.

Discipline had always been his native language. 

Praise came easy to him, but connection did not. 

The others lingered after class, voices spilling toward laughter.

He stayed behind to rack weights in order, rows as perfect as a phalanx line.

He told himself it was preference.

He knew it was armor.

The professor stopped by his station, clipboard in hand.

“Coelho, that’s good coaching.

You’ve got the precision for rehab work. 

Toronto’s program would eat you up in the best way.”

He nodded once, the idea striking something already restless inside him.

Toronto. 

The word tasted like metal, like the inside of a long-closed door.

After hours, he walked the quiet campus paths. 

The Pacific light had thinned to pearl, dusk settling over the coastline, rain lifting off the sidewalks in ghostly ribbons.

He lingered beneath the library overhang, watching students scatter toward buses and late lectures, the smell of cedar and diesel threading the air.

The world exhaled slowly, washed and blue.

He should have gone home. 

He didn’t.












¤¤¤¤¤





THE NIGHT SWIM 




¤¤¤¤¤


The ache behind his ribs had shifted from weight to thirst, something only water could translate.

By the time he reached the rec-centre, night had folded over the city. 

The lobby smelled faintly of chlorine and old tile.

He signed in, nodded at the attendant, and walked through the echoing corridor to the locker room.

Metal doors clanged shut somewhere down the row. 

He changed without hurry,
hoodie, shoes, shirt, folded in order,.and stepped into the shower bays.

Warm water ran over his shoulders, washing away the salt of the day, the discipline, the noise.

When he turned off the tap, steam followed him into the pool hall.

He tugged at the drawstring of his swim shorts, smoothing the fabric until it sat right. 

The suit was tight, the girth beneath it restless with contained strength. 

He breathed once, centering himself, then stepped toward the lane.

From across the pool deck, a few students looked up as he walked by. 

At six-foot-five, he seemed carved from effort itself, every motion the product of hours measured in sweat and discipline. 

The wet fabric of his shorts clung close, outlining more than strength, more than thickinnes, a promise he new he could keep.

He shifted his stance, two fingers hooking the beneath his girth lifting gently more for comfort than vanity. 

Even at rest his body carried weight, a quiet gravity that reminded him he was built of strength and pulse, not just routine.

Years of routine had hammered him into proportion and poise; the body wasn’t bragging, it was evidence. 

Anyone watching might have mistaken the sight for myth, a reminder that some people are built from the same substance as willpower.

The water waited, still and blue beneath the lamps.

He paused at the edge, breath measured. 

He rolled his shoulders once, adjusted the drawstring at his waist again, and walked to the edge.

The tiles were cool under his feet, smooth as memory.

His reflection trembled in the water, tall, bright, uncertain. 

For a heartbeat he studied it, the way a man might study an old photograph and recognize both the stranger and himself.

Then he inhaled, slow and clean, and dove.

Under the surface, everything obeyed different laws. 

The water held him in suspension, silencing thought until all that remained was pulse.

He swam long, powerful lengths, each stroke exact. 

The ache in his chest blurred into the ache in his shoulders, and for a while they cancelled each other out.

He cut through the water, each stroke smooth and practiced.

The rush filled his ears until it sounded like a voice trying to form words.

Then, shadows moved around him. 

Not shapes, more like impressions: a palm brushing his shoulder, warmth against his throat, breath close enough to feel but not name.

He kicked harder, but the current, and his cock thickened, carrying images he couldn’t separate from sensation, skin, heat, closeness, a pulse that wasn’t only his.

The water cradled him like memory, soft and insistent.

With each stroke, his body lengthened, breath deepening, and beneath the surface, his cock now, heavy and aware,
thickening into the current, catching drag like a drawn blade beneath silk.

His body reacted before his mind could catch up, every nerve lit, every heartbeat louder than sound.

He broke the surface too fast, gasping, blinking water from his eyes. 

The pool was empty. 

Only his own echo came back.

He stood there breathing, willing the blood to settle, letting the fabric restrain what threatened to unsheath.

He pressed both hands to the tile edge, chest heaving, unsure whether what he’d felt had been dream, memory, or warning.

When he stopped, clinging to the wall, the quiet roared. 

His breath echoed back at him from tiled ceilings. 

Then, something else.

A vibration, faint but deliberate, like a sound that remembered it used to be a song. 

It thrummed against his ribs, resonant, familiar.

He froze. 

Listened.

Nothing.

Only the filtered whisper of pumps.

He let out a small laugh. 

“Get a grip.”

But as he floated there, the hum returned, not louder, closer. 

Not a call from without, but a pulse from within. 

A sound older than language, older than breath, like the body’s memory of being whole.

It rose once, twice, then vanished.

He pressed a hand to his sternum. 

The skin beneath was hot.

He pulled himself onto the deck, water streaming from his frame, and with one swift motion, adjusted the weight straining in his shorts, the shift from absence to obvious, impossible to ignore.

When he stepped towards the dressing rooms, the lights flickered overhead, brief and soft. 

He toweled off in silence, heart still drumming an unfamiliar rhythm.

Something was waking, and it was not the kind of thing he could train out.

Outside, rain had long stopped. 

The city lights trembled on wet pavement. 

He walked home bare-headed, letting the cold air carve thought into clarity.




¤¤¤¤¤



THRESHOLD LOGIC 



¤¤¤¤¤



He told himself it was the weather, Vancouver’s gray had simply soaked too deep.

But even when the sun returned, he felt the same ache under his ribs, a tide that refused to retreat.

He’d built his life on order: the early runs, the precise meals, the controlled breath of a man who’d rather master pain than admit he felt it.

It worked, mostly.

People called it focus.

He called it survival.

One more semester, he promised.

Finish clean. 

Log the hours. 

File the report.

Then go east.

Toronto’s program was stronger anyway.

That’s what he told himself.

The truth was simpler, he just couldn’t breathe here anymore.

Lexie texted: 

We were good sometimes.

He typed: 

We were never patient enough.

Erased it.

Then wrote: 

Take care of yourself.

Sent it.

Watched the word delivered glow, then fade.

He sat on the edge of the bed, phone face-down, city hum leaking through the half-open window. 

For a moment, he wished he’d been better at love, not the grand kind, but the quiet, staying kind.

He rubbed his palms together, the motion nervous, boyish.

“I tried,” he said to no one.

And he had.

That night, the boys from rugby dragged him out. 

Same bar, same jokes, same ghost of who he used to be. 

He smiled anyway.

He’d always been good at that, the easy grin, the laugh that made people think he was fine.

He wasn’t. 

Not exactly.

A woman at the bar said, 

“You look like you belong somewhere else.”

He laughed, but his eyes softened. 

“Yeah,” he said. 

“Maybe I do.”

Outside, the rain had started again, fine, silver rain that smelled of cedar and tide. 

He didn’t run from it. 

He stood in it. 

Let it soak his hair, his clothes, his quiet.

He thought of how hard he’d worked to be solid, unshakable, admired.

How little that meant if no one ever really knew him.

The streetlight flickered above, haloing the mist around his face.

Something in the air shifted, charged, listening.

He felt it again, that pull beneath the ribs, not demanding, just patient.

He exhaled.

“I’m listening,” he whispered, and for once, he meant it.

The rain gentled. 

The city breathed with him.

And for the first time in years, he didn’t feel alone.


¤¤¤¤¤




THE DREAM WITHOUT A FACE 





¤¤¤¤¤





He slept lightly, the kind of sleep that never quite believes in rest.

The city’s rain softened against the window, a steady hush like breath through another room.

When the dream came, it didn’t start with sound. 

It began with warmth.

A figure stood in mist, close enough to touch, too far to see.

Not a stranger. 

Not entirely.

Something in the stance, the quiet tilt of the head, felt known, like recognizing your own voice on a recording.

He tried to speak, but his throat filled with light.

The figure stepped closer.

A hand brushed his shoulder, gentle, unhurried, and every muscle in him let go.

He wanted to ask who they were.

But before the thought formed, the answer bloomed quietly behind his ribs: 

Me.

He felt it then, the other half of something vast, breathing with him, through him.

No face. 

No gender. 

Just warmth and belonging, wrapped in pulse and patience.

The dream didn’t frighten him.

It calmed him.

Like someone whispering that everything he’d been building toward wasn’t lost, just waiting.

He reached for the figure but the air folded; the light sealed over with the taste of salt on his tongue.

He woke at 3:33 a.m., the number glowing soft and blue beside his bed.

The room was quiet, the kind of quiet that listens back.

His chest felt light, open.

He lay there, palms on his heart, breath steady.

“I don’t know who you are,” he whispered. 

“But I think I’ve missed you.”

The words surprised him, but they stayed.

Outside, a streetlight flickered once and steadied.

Inside, the hum that had followed him all summer shifted key, as if answering.

He smiled in the dark, small and pure, and let himself believe that maybe, just maybe, he was already being guided home.




¤¤¤¤¤




THE WAKE OF IT 




¤¤¤¤¤



In the morning the alarm did not startle him.

He was already awake.

Rain tapped the glass in the slow, patient rhythm of a pulse trying to remember its song.

For a moment he stayed still, eyes open to the ceiling, replaying fragments that refused to hold shape, the touch of cold stone, the flash of water, a name he didn’t know he knew.

He swung his legs to the floor.

The room smelled faintly of cedar and detergent, of rain finding a way through half-closed windows.

He pressed both hands to his face, breathing through them until his heart steadied.

Another ordinary morning.

Another chance to pretend nothing followed him out of sleep.

He showered, dressed, tied his laces with the same precision that had always kept him from falling apart.

By the time he stepped outside, the rain had eased.

Steam rose off the pavement; the city hummed.

Somewhere in that hum a single tone pulsed, quiet, constant, familiar.

He looked east, toward the mountain not knowing why.

The air shifted.

For a heartbeat he felt seen.

Then the traffic light changed, and the feeling passed.

He kept walking.

But the hum did not stop.

It settled.

Low.

Steady.

Like an ember remembering where it came from.

Across the miles it moved, through cloud, through copper, through the sleeping code of rivers and bone.

Each night it found new anchors: a heartbeat in the dark, a breath that matched its rhythm.

By the time frost lifted from the cedars, the thread had pulled a little tighter, and somewhere east, in a city of school bells and frosted fields, memory began to take root in another body.

He did not know he was being called.

Only that his pulse had changed.

The month carried a strange ache, not illness, not fear, a gathering.

The body was readying itself.

The old vow stirring beneath the skin, as if the soul were winding toward its season again.

The air was warmer that week.

Sweeter.

Something in it waiting to bloom.

And on a field where laughter carried like sunlight through frost, the grass began to listen.

1ox4evl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1ox4evl/damp_and_mould_in_my_house_what_can_i_do/,"Damp and mould in my house, what can I do?","Just moved to Cornwall in June and have found that our house is incredible damp and developing more mould now that the temperature is dropping. I’ve found mould around windows, on the seal of our fridge, on the living room and kitchen floor, at the end of our coffee table closest to an outside wall, on notebooks, on dried flowers in all rooms upstairs and down, all over our wooden shoe rack, and a pair of Birkenstocks went so mouldy I had to throw them away. It is affecting my health - I’m congested when inside, sneezing, and sometimes wheezing while going to bed in the evenings.

We rent and have a lodgers agreement with a landlord who doesn’t actually live here full-time, barely in the country. We’ve alerted him of the problem and he’s agreed to buy us a dehumidifier for the living room, which is the worst room in the house. He is coming back to Cornwall at the end of the month to have a look for himself.

He let us down a bit when we first moved in and found a wall of mould behind a kitchen cabinet. The kitchen had to be ripped out and all new cabinets put in, done by him, but they weren’t put in very well and are very wonky and things don’t close properly. He didn’t really give a sincere apology and acted like it was more of an inconvenience for him than for us.  
I am wondering what our right are as lodgers and what he is legally obligated to do as a landlord to sort out the damp and mould issues. I am nervous to stir the pot too much in case he asked us to leave, which is not really an option for us until next summer. Any advice greatly appreciated.",1,1763144850.0,TenantsInTheUK,1,1.0,False

**Ranking perfumes categories**

Im using a simplified ranking system using a 1-5 scale. I don't believe there is a need to have a general ranking for a perfume. Perfumes are good or bad depending on a set of circumstances. Mood, weather and social context all matter. Some perfumes have a time and place even if they are not highly ranked.

I heavily disagree with influencers saying fragrances last 12+ hours for an EDP. My limited personal experience is duration is heavily correlated with oil content. How do I measure duration? Going forward I consider a fragrance still “smells” when you can you still smell it at 10cm over the skin. Skin scents are essentially non-existing for this ranking.

My ranking uses the following scale.

1- Less than an hour

2- Between 1 and 3 hours

3- 3-4 hours

4- 4-5 hours

5- 5+ beast

**Lattafa Kamrah**

There’s a reason why this is a successful fragrance. Deeply gourmand with heavy amber, cinnamon and vanilla. Many of us had our first gourmand experience with this one. Blended to perfection, this one gives the nose a good workout to separate each underlying note.

Personal comment: i would suggest being careful with abundant gourmand smells in closed spaces. Once in a while, this one can feel overwhelming due to its potent nature but it definitely has a place in a healthy perfume rotation.

**Maison Alhambra Delilah**

Very lichee/rose forward feminine smell. This a delicate but mischievous scent that bring spark from its sweetness but has some creamy rhubarb winking throughout. Everywhere it goes it leaves a trail of pinkness that allows passerby’s to time travel to the moment this perfume occupied the same space.

Personal note: critics mention Delilah may have synthetic notes. I agree. This is a feminine beast mode fragrance that cannot be ignored and it’s value proposition needs to be rediscovered. This smell lingers in the air like nothing I have seen before.

**Afnan 9pm**

This one dances with Western sweetness—apple and vanilla pirouetting in a cloud of bubblegum delight. A radiant crowd-pleaser, tuned to the pulse of youth and joy. For those who seek a fragrance that giggles rather than growls, this one wears like laughter on warm skin. Younger crowds will definitely understand the appeal on this one.

Personal comment: took me some time to understand that the combination of orange blossom, apple and vanilla give this bubble gummy smell. Excited to finish this bottle and try the 9pm Elixir. This is one is a classic. If you are new to arab fragrances, give it a try. Killer value-performance.

**Ahmed Al Maghribi Oud and Roses**

At first glance-rose. Feminine, right? It’s what men offer to enchant, to stir hearts with fragrant intent.  
Though it wears the badge of unisex, it speaks with clarity: “I care. I charm. I woo the world around me.”

Personal note: i fell in love with this rose note.This brand is doing great work.

**Ahmed Al Maghribi Ignite Oud**

This one unveiled the soul of geranium to me—a vivid bloom rising through the mist of leather.  
Though the hide lingers, it’s the duet of geranium and patchouli that truly sings on my skin. The patchouli can veer into something skunky, yet the geranium stands firm, bold and citrus-laced. A masculine banger.

Personal note: want to know how geranium smells? This is it. Probably unisex but more masculine leaning. My first thought on this one was “what is this citrussy smell?” This is an Extrait de Parfum with extreme performance. It will provide you with geranium waves throughout the day.

Duration: 5+

**Rasasi Shurah**

This one is an anarchist.Refusing to conform with traditional notes.It’s unfazed attitude brings an almost lost note of tomato leaves and reminds us that provocative notes can come from unexpected places. With a smoky nature, it combines a faint rose that barely surfaces during cold weather.

Personal comment:the smoky rose in this one initially gave me an “old man smell” but I have learned to love this one due to its character.If you tell someone wearing this that you don’t like the smell, expect a big “[F@k](mailto:F@k) you” in return.

Projection: 4

Duration: 3

**Calvin Clein Defy**

A forgettable gym scent devoid of thrill. Think a toned-down Nautica: clean, citrussy, and safe to the point of sedation. It doesn’t Defy, it’s just a polite smell for the locker room.

Personal comment: you are lucky if you get sillage with this one after 45mins. Not a bad smell, just too polite and linear for my taste.

**Bharara Essence**

After a long sleep, you wake up at 10am and walk to your local bakery. Croissants and danish pastry are coming out of the oven. Your mind is filled with a memory. Your loved ones are cooking something to make you feel cared for. Your thoughts are infused with creamy vanilla, milk and caramel. Your belly murmurs and your teeth sink into that first bite, filling your chest with joy.

Personal comment: if someone adds coffee to this perfume, it has the potential to blow up. Honestly, this one should be more popular. The vanilla note on this one is absolutely gorgeous.

**Maison Alhambra Tuscan Leather**

I associate this type of leather smell with masculinity. Wearing this will make you drive to a pub in a 1,200CC bike. Start multiple bar brawls just to spread your testosterone everywhere. Overwhelming during the first 30 minutes, but diffuses quickly. Lost my leather nose virginity with this one, setting a high bar. Layering monster.

Personal comment: value monster. If you can buy this as a guy and want something to discover a new category (leathery scents), this is a great one.

**Dior Sauvage (Eau de Toilette)**

Dont judge me, I like this. Skunky/addictive opener confusing the nose with pink pepper and citrus. Lovely ambroxan drydown. Need to try higher concentrations to really know if I like this DNA. My bottle is extremely old, straight museum piece, likely 10+ years. The ambroxan gives beautiful whiffs during a good 2-3 hours.

right now, i plan on doing once a week lessons in iTalki, continue listening to Coffee Break, and subscribed to Peppa the Pig Italian version. do you have any other youtubers you recommend? i wanted to use a book but couldn't find any good ones to use for self-study. any suggestions?

also does anyone know what's the difference between nuovo espresso and italian espresso books?

1ox4a7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyagers/comments/1ox4a7m/the_benefits_of_being_unemployed/,The benefits of being unemployed,"I just reflected on all of the benefits I actually experienced from being unemployed. Unemployment overall sucks and I'm not suggesting it at all but here's what I've interestingly gained from it:

1. **Adaptability.** I have learned how to work with what I have, get creative and come up with solutions to my problems that isn’t just immediately spending money. I learned how to use what I have around me to solve problems, fulfill needs, to repurpose for decorating and organization and much more. I just generally use my brain and problem solving more.

\*An example that sparked this entire reflection: I made a new friend I’ve been getting coffee with and I can’t afford coffee out so I thought “what if I brought my own coffee and just asked them for a pump of syrup in a cup and maybe some whipped cream?” I would be equally happy with that if not more because I was being smart.

2. **A new appreciation for having little and a sort of dopamine detox from things and spending.** Removing all of the noise of spending and online window shopping has seriously brought me back to a simple and intentional, resourceful way of living that I find joy from. It's like doing a phone detox, it was a little hard at first but once used to it, I found satisfaction in it. It takes much less to make me happy now, that bar has been lowered a lot. Happiness comes more from within now than it does from things outside of me.

3. **Time and boredom.** These have been huge. To have these are a luxury that I'm so grateful I got to have even though unemployment is hard. I had time to actually think about who I am and what I really wanted from life. I had time to develop super important and beneficial habits that would've been SO much more difficult to start if I wasn't unemployed. And now that I have them under my belt, they're things I can bring into a life occupied with working, not something I avoid or struggle to start.

With that I’ve had the advantage of boredom. Boredom that makes you go crazy until you are forced to think outside the box and try new things, develop new hobbies. And delve deeper into existing ones.

There’s definitely more but those are the ones I had thought of. Unemployment isn’t ideal, it’s never something I strive for, but I have found positives to my experience that have made me still feel happy and fulfilled until I have my shit figured out and maybe you can too.",3,1763144563.0,twentyagers,10,0.81,False

Last week, I found myself in a coffee shop, the kind with soft jazz playing, when a chance conversation with a stranger turned into an evening neither of us anticipated. We talked about everything from travel to dreams deferred and rediscovered passions, the kind of candid connection that feels effortless yet electrifying.

What struck me was how open and genuine our exchange was, carved out in the midst of the everyday rush. It reminded me that at this stage in life, we often carry a profound clarity about what we want and who we are. We’ve learned from past loves, heartbreaks, and joys and that experience brings not only wisdom but also a vibrant confidence that’s hard to ignore.

For those navigating the dating world after forty, this is the thrill: the possibility of meeting someone who understands the value of honesty, respects boundaries, and cherishes the moment without the unnecessary complications of younger years. Whether you’re looking for companionship or something a bit more casual, it’s refreshing when encounters feel authentic and uninhibited by pretense.

So here’s to embracing those unexpected moments where curiosity meets connection and if you’re open to it, sometimes that means inviting a little spice into your life. 
Sometimes, taking that first step into a candid conversation can be the start of something wonderfully freeing. And who knows? A simple message might just open the door to an evening you hadn’t imagined but will never forget.

On #RoadToOSCP, OffSec OSCP, I decided to stop for a “coffee break” with CompTIA PenTest+ and it definitely served a strong cup.
This was the most challenging CompTIA exam I’ve taken so far, and it pushed my skills in vulnerability assessment, exploitation techniques, and remediation strategies.

Surprisingly, I found the exam manageable, especially compared to the intensity of OSCP-style labs.

My study journey followed the 𝐁𝐀𝐃 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 (𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝, 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤, 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐝):

🔹 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝: I created and configured systems across my home lab, CertMaster Labs, OSCP/SEC-100 labs, and RangeForce. Build and worked on over 30 vulnerable VMs with diverse levels of difficulty.

🔹 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤: I simulated real attacks, exploited vulnerabilities, and validated techniques learned from Sybex books, CBTNuggets and MeasureUp. 

Throughout the attack and exploitation phase, I worked extensively with an array of tools such as Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Responder, Hydra, Impacket, SQLMap, Enum4linux, and various Kali Linux utilities to refine my attacking and exploitation skills.

🔹 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐝: I documented findings, analyzed the impact, and applied recommendations to detect, block, and remediate threats. 

I’m proud to add this certification to my growing stack and even more proud of the skills gained along the way.

Now, onto the next chapter: blending these offensive and defensive skills as I continue my journey towards OSCP. 💪🔐

Everything felt off, performance dipping, audiences acting weird, and me trying to convince myself it was “just a phase.” Deep down I knew I’d basically been guessing my way through adjustments for weeks.

So I sat down one morning, coffee in hand, and tried to map out what my actual workflow looked like. It turned out… I didn’t really have one. I was jumping between platforms, tweaking things randomly, and hoping something would stick. No real system behind it.

During that cleanup process, I looked at a few tools just to get inspiration for how other people structure their campaigns. One of them was [ꓮdvаrk-аі.соm](https://www.google.com/search?q=advark-ai.com++Advark+-+Social+Media+Advertising+Platform). I wasn’t trying to switch platforms or anything, I mostly just wanted to see how it organized steps like planning, tracking, and optimization. It ended up giving me a clearer picture of what my own process was missing.

But honestly, the biggest change came from just slowing down and rebuilding our internal workflow. Not exciting, not glamorous, just basic organization that I had been ignoring because things were “good enough” for a while.

Performance picked back up afterward, nothing dramatic, but at least everything made sense again.

In my situation I have tinnitus and my GF has fibromyalgia (and diabetes).
Reading myself into what she got I cannot help to think how strikingly similar our conditions are from the brain perspective.

In both it comes from overactivity neurons firing when they shouldn't, over reacting.

I myself could use acoustic tricks to reduce tinnitus something close to notch therapy without going into the details of that it keeps me wondering though.

Have people her ever tried calm left/right body  stimulations to break fibromyalgie.
Like repeatedly opposite touching posures ?

Like:
Left hand touch right elbow while right hand touches left ear while closing left eye. Then repeat opposite for a few minutes.
Or..
Massage the feet that is okay while the other has cramp while you imagine both in a relaxed state.
Or like on a chair you do a cycle movement.
Or maybe even just cycling itself

I wonder this, cause it's the way the audio treatments work for tinintius and there is such a huge brain overlap here.

Please reply if you did

And also if you drink less coffee do you notice less pain, as it helps reduce tinnitus a bit as well.

They have paper coffee cups, and I will usually bring home food for myself in these coffee cups. 

I want to start bringing one meal out with me and giving it to one homeless person every time I go to the dining hall. What I’ve done so far is grabbing one cup of meat, one cup of veggies, an orange, and a coffee and bringing it to the first person that I see.

What are some recommendations for the foods that I should try to grab? I know it’s getting colder outside so I’ve been trying to grab things that are hot.

A part of our reporting system is occasionally exporting corrupted files. Users are complaining, but the bug is maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. No error logs, no obvious pattern. My senior just says, 'Good luck, it's a rite of passage.'

I dive in, expecting a quick fix. Hours turn into a full day. I'm staring at this legacy C# code that looks like it was written in a different dimension. My eyes are burning, my coffee is cold, and my imposter syndrome is screaming at me. I'm convinced I'm about to be fired for not being able to solve a 'simple' bug. I'm tracing the data flow, and it just seems to… disappear into the void at a specific point.

Finally, deep in a dusty corner of the codebase, I find a single, uncommented line. It's taking the data stream, converting it to a Base64 string, and then immediately converting it back. For no reason. It does literally nothing to the data. It's like someone translating a sentence from English to French and then immediately back to English before speaking it. There’s a comment above it from a developer who left the company five years ago that just says: `// Do not remove. Trust me.`

My sanity is hanging by a thread, so I think, 'You know what? I don't trust you.' I comment out the line, run the report, and it works perfectly. Every single time. I spent my entire day, lost my will to live for a few hours, all because of a completely useless line of code that someone added years ago, probably as a weird workaround for a bug that has long since been fixed.
