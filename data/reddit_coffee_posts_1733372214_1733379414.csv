1h72lad,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1h72lad/yall_are_valid_rant/,Yall are valid (rant),"I've been at Starbucks for nearly 2 months now and I'm getting what you're saying partners.

Personally, I have great management and generally get along with almost all the partners I work with. It is a great environment socially to work in.

However, the customers???? Why on earth do they have so much entitlement?

I don't agree with the prices of drinks, and I can empathize with being upset about spending $6 on a drink that has some milk, syrup, and espresso, but also like? You know Starbucks, you know what you're getting...

There were so many instances of entitlement and snobbish-ness throughout the day. I had a customer complain that we didn't have nitro and then complained about their payment taking over 6 minutes because they wanted to purchase gift cards, reload, etc. at the end of it all, they were demeaning me and i had a breakdown (thing that stuck with me all day was, ""this is taking way too long young lady"", speaking to me like im a child? and they kept scoffing, rolling their eyes, laughing in disbelief, etc.) i got back up on floor within 5 minutes all good to go, but was minimizing me based on my age and gender making you feel better about yourself? at my store, in the morning we brew all 3 roasts, but later day and into the evening we just do pike. i tell customers this and they're like ""fine then. pike it is."" in the most passive aggressive tone. bro. we don't brew all 3 because the amount of brew sales we do later in the day is next to nothing. it is so wasteful to have all 3 brewing. also have had people complaining that we don't do decaf brews on tap??????????? bro what???????????? we have two registers and one drive through pos. we're not gonna have every coffee on brew. literal kids coming in, seeing their order, and then going off at as about how we made their drink wrong.

anyways. i feel for baristas rn, especially heading into holiday seasons.

**for customers - please be patient with starbucks partners. we are trained to do our utmost to serve you in the most efficient, quick, and pleasant way. don't get mad when your mobile order for a quad espresso with 20 customizations that you ordered 2 minutes ago isn't ready during peak. we aren't robots that are programmed to get everything perfect. remember that we all have, do, and will make mistakes. we are more than happy to correct things if we have done them wrong, but PLEASE practice some patience, especially if you can SEE that we are busy.**",2,1733378934.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

1h72kce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1h72kce/gave_my_kids_their_own_room_and_now_they_cant/,Gave my kids their own room and now they can’t sleep anywhere. ,"We have a 4 bedroom house with no storage. Two are downstairs and two are upstairs. My husband and I had one downstairs bedroom and the kids (now 11 and 8) shared the other.  Since we moved here (5-3 years old at the time). They both asked for their own room for a year leading up to the change. The rooms upstairs were storage (we have no closets!) and a tv room because it was more like an open landing. So we bought a shipping container for all our storage and gave the girls their own room upstairs. My husband closed off the open landing and it’s a super cute small room and my 8 year old loves it. The other room is huge and was already painted dark blue. We kept that and my daughter was really into Harry Potter so it’s kind of witchy theme. She’s got a green velvet couch and an old chest as a coffee table and a secretary for a desk and a wall of potions (her doing). But since they got their own room my 11 year old (10 at the time) has not been able to sleep in there. At first it was because she didn’t want to sleep alone so my 8 year old would sleep in there with her or she would sleep on the floor of the other room. Eventually it became that she couldn’t sleep without a parent and either myself or my husband would have to sleep with her. She ended up in our bed downstairs and my husband up in her room with the dog. My 8 year old can sleep in her room alone. So my 11 year old asked for pet rats for her 11th birthday but we said she’d have to start sleeping in her own room because she can’t expect me or her dad to sleep in a room with rats (they could be loud through the night?) and she promised she would sleep in her own room. She has full on meltdowns when she tries to sleep in her own room. Like crying out of control, finds different reasons to come downstairs, gets anxious about how late it is. So I said fine, sleep in the playroom (the extra room now downstairs) and that’s ok for the last few nights but tonight my 8 year old is crying about not wanting to sleep alone upstairs and it’s not fair my 11 year old gets to sleep downstairs. What the fuck is happening? I didn’t sleep for a year with my first child and I expected that with a newborn. I haven’t slept uninterrupted since she was born but honestly at 11 and 8 I DID not expect them to have trouble fucking sleeping!! What should we do? My husband thinks we’re giving in to them but what can I do? Ignore my daughter’s anxiety and crying because she can’t sleep when I know she’ll sleep if she changes places? Will we run out of places for her to sleep?!  She’s best with a parent but that’s uncomfortable for me and my husband.

His name is Newt Hargreaves. He hates his father just as much as Deigo, yet also respects him like Five does.

His power is that anything he draws he can make come to life, he has a limit though. At his current age of 29 as of March 21 2019 he can only create things as big as Luther max, he is able to create as many creatures as he wants but there's a combined maximum weight of 300 pounds.

Number 1, He always disliked the fact that Luther was number 1 as he was a complete muscle head who never questioned his father. He was strong but Newt was always able to spar with him and often win.

 Number 2,  Deigo was a bad yet sad boy, who even though everyone knew he despised his father, he was always still trying to prove something to him. His powers were never used to there fullest potential and Newt was surprised that he wasn't utilized more by there father.

Number 3, Allison always got what she wanted, even compared to Luther she was the prodigy in everything. But Newt always managed to win any argument with her, powers or not.

Number 4, Klaus was a waste of space, and in Newts opinion the biggest disappointment of them all. He always tried to numb himself, the only ghost he was willing to talk to was Ben and even then he still rarely did anything to grow stronger. The only thing Newt respected about his brother was his queerness and his fashion sense.

Number 5, Newt was the closest with Five before he disappeared. Newt was probably the third or fourth smartest out of all of the children, but none of the others were even close to the level of intelligence that Five had. Newt thought that Five was the most powerful out of all of them. Once he disappeared and Sir. Reginald Hargreaves had informed them that he had timed traveled and that he was probably dead and they'd never see him again, Newt knew Five had discovered something greater than any other power imaginable. Complete control.

Number 6, Newt and Ben got along very well. Newt was intelligent but he was more affectionate, he didn't show this trait to most of his siblings but Ben was similar. He didn't think Ben's powers were anything insanely powerful like he did Five, but Ben's powers were unique and capable. After the Jennifer incident Newt had no one left.

Number 7, Newt enjoyed Vanya/Viktors music but other than that he never really connected with them. Newt felt bad for Vanya/Viktor more than anyone else in the family. But they didn't have any power and they also didn't really interest him. Newt did always find it odd that there father had not give Vanya/Viktor up since they had no power and that sounds like something his father would do.

Number 8, As a child he was a quiet, yet intelligent little bastard. He didn't like the company of most of his siblings. He saw Grace as the closest thing to a parental figure but always knew she was just fabricated, and Pogo he saw as his fathers lapdog. His father encouraged him to try to make bigger and more complex things though he never payed much attention to him, but along with the rest of his siblings Newt could never live up to his expectations. At night or when his father wasn't paying attention, he would sneak out into the city and go to a party he found online, sneak into a concert, or he would go to an art gallery and destroy soulless art with his creations. He was the first one to run away at the age of only 16, Newt managed to become roomates with a friend from one of his missions and stayed there until he turned 20. After that he worked at a law firm for around four years as an assistant, then as a sound guy for touring musicians for a year, then a shitty art gallery for two more years, and for the past two years he's been working as a barista at a coffee shop while also making the occasional art commission and song. In this time he only ever spoke to Vanya/Viktor and Deigo a couple of times mostly right after he ran away. He started dating his boyfriend Eric one and a half years ago, he knew him for four years before that and they were best friends. Eric had always been there for him, and now that he's gone Newt feels empty.

 4 weeks before the events of season 1 episode 1 or the first comic strip of The Umbrella Academy, his boyfriend died in a shootout, he blaims himself.

**Original:**

Throwaway as my husband knows my Reddit. I 34(f) have been with Ken -not his real name-37(m) since I was 16. We met in school as he was my brothers friend. We have been married for 10years. Have a 2year old son and one on the way. Ken has always been my person. The person who you can’t picture life without and I honestly can’t remember not loving him. I grew up with him, he’s my everything.

Unfortunately Ken has this issue where he takes on everyone else’s feelings like to heart. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, however recently his best friend of 20years has just found out that his wife has been cheating on him and none of the children are his. Obviously his friend is devastated and is staying in our guest room. He’s a nice guy just life has him down right now. He’s started the process of divorce. The more time Ken spends with his friend the more depressed he’s become. And distant. Our mornings use to start where I would wake up at 6am with our son make breakfast then about 8am I could wake Ken up with a coffee and some breakfast before going to drop little one off at nursery and go to work. Ken works from home most days only going into the office on a Monday. So I’d give him his coffee he’d give me a kiss and then I’d go off on my happy little way. Then I’d finish work, get our son and go home where Ken would be making tea. I’d clean up after whilst he was bathing our son and putting him to bed. I thought this was life, it might sound boring to some but it was my life and I loved it. Our house was filled with love. We would spend our nights cuddling, talking watching a movie. Date night once a month. We would take our son out together on a Saturday and then Sunday go visit family or have friends over. You get the picture I’m rambling. Sorry.

Anyway, for the past month things have been…changing. Ken is more depressed. I make him a coffee in the morning and just get a mumbled “thanks”. I’d come home from work and the friend and him would be in the livingroom watching sports. I’m now making tea. Bathing our son, neither of them will barely talk to me. We don’t go out on the weekends together I feel like a single parent. I’ve tried to talk to Ken about it all but I get one worded answers. Then he stays up till about 1am which I know it’s not super late but I’m passed out by then, I’m exhausted, alone and pregnant. I miss my husband.

Yesterday I came home from work and you know when something just doesn’t feel right? Well, I went to find Ken to see what he was doing as his friend wasn’t in the house but Ken’s car was. He was in his office looking up DNA kits for our son. I asked him why and his response was “well I just want to make sure all the kids are mine before I continue looking after them as I’m not a free childcare”. This broke me. When I say I’m devastated it’s an understatement. But if he thinks that I’ve cheated on him then surely the trust is gone? Is there any going back? Am I just being pregnant and hormonal? Would I be extreme for looking for a divorce? I could put the papers in the envelope with the results from the DNA test. I think I’m gonna go cry in bed now. Had to take the day off work as I feel like I’ve just been gut punched.

>Your husbands feelings are being fed from his friend. Working from home a lot disconnects you from being social and the only social activity he gets is depression from his friend.This friend has to go and once he does you two can work on getting back on track the way you were. You really need to explain this to him and he should understand. These are all actions of the other person not your husband if that makes sense.Get through this and you two can be that much stronger but as long as this other person is around I feel it will only get worse. Good luck!Edit for spelling

**Update: same day**

Hello Reddit, well after my post earlier this afternoon I cried then read all your lovely comments and I couldn’t be more greatful. I think posting about it here really helps for some reason. Weird how telling complete strangers that I’m struggling with life seems to help. So I think after my pity party which couldn’t last long due to being a parent I called my step-mum and dad (my mum died when I was 10) they are coming to stay with me on Friday. Crying on the phone helped although I’m not really sure they could truly understand a word of what I was saying.

I’ve spoken to Ken…well more like spoke at Ken telling him that his friend has till Thursday to leave. I’m not a monster and can’t just tell him to leave at the drop of a hat. I’ve also told Ken he needs to leave too. Whilst yes I could go to my dads house I don’t want to disrupt my little one more than needed and all the things for my baby is here too. Especially as I’m 8months along it just seems stupid for me to be the one to leave. I’ve made it a point of not pointing out it’s my house either. I’m trying to be calm and sensible. I’m not 100% sure Ken listened but I did message his sister who is a force to be reckoned with and she said she will make sure he’s gone by Thursday night.

Things I’ve told Ken I want is yes he can have the DNA test but I will be damned if I’m the one to do it. He can also have one for the baby as I ain’t got shit to hide. I know that some people have questioned why I’m so against it. Let me make something clear. I would never cheat because as I said in my last post Ken is/or was I dunno, my person. He’s the only man I’ve ever been with. So that isn’t any concern of mine. I’m just hurt that he wants one because clearly he doesn’t trust me. So things I want. I want him to have the DNA tests mainly so I can make him eat the results (not literally I’m just venting) I’m also going to suggest couples therapy. I already see one due to losing my mum and my little sister in a car crash when I was little. I want to suggest he sees one alone but you can lead a horse to water but can’t make him drink it, I don’t wanna force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do. I want him to maintain contact with our son, yes he doesn’t believe he’s the father right now but that’s no reason he should neglect him as he’s his and I don’t want to upset my son. Yea he’s only two but still he deserves all the love from both his parents. He’s done nothing wrong. Then obviously this one when he/she comes along. Still not sure about the state of my marriage but even if divorce is what happens I need to be able to get through to him so he can be the father he was. Am I going insane? Do I sound insane? I don’t know why writing here helps so much. Thanks Reddit.

**Update 2: a week later**

Hello again, I don’t know how to update posts so I just had to make another one. Following my two other posts I will answer some questions, yes it is my house. It was left to me when my mum died. I have lived here all my life. I didn’t move out because I have a child and one on the way so why should I be the one to leave. I get that some people believe I was the AH for asking him to leave but as I was heavily pregnant, have a toddler and it’s my house I wasn’t about to leave. Yes he could of stayed but have you tried living with someone who just wants to argue or just not talk? I’d prefer my child not to live in that environment thank you. At the end of the day I’m a mother first and a wife second. If you think that’s harsh then I don’t know what to tell you. My children come first end of.

Well Ken’s friend did leave the day I told him he had till Thursday. He wasn’t happy about it and shouted some insults at me which was amazing. Ken’s sister came and picked up Ken. I wish I could tell you what she said but she didn’t say anything in front of me just kept giving Ken death stares. We did get the DNA test for little one and Ken is the father…obviously. Ken somehow thinks I’ve intercepted the results even tho I wasn’t the one that did it. I wasn’t the one that got handed the results ect so he’s clearly lost his mind.

My dad came over and whilst I was making tea my waters broke. My little girl is here she healthy and happy. She was 9lb 8oz so no concern of anything with her. I’m now a mum of two. I am home now and Ken has been to see his baby girl although as she’s not had a DNA test he disagrees with her being his because “his family doesn’t have many girls” yet he has a sister so I just rolled my eyes. I don’t really know where to go from here. Ken is refusing therapy he says there’s nothing wrong with him or his brain. I beg to differ. He wants to get ANOTHER DNA test for our boy but won’t tell me when or where so I can’t interfere. Maybe one day he will come to his senses.

My dad and step mum are staying with me for a while to help me with the baby’s. I’d like to say I’m ok but honestly my emotions are all over the show I don’t know which was is up. Ken’s sister visits the baby’s and we have an unspoken rule that we don’t speak about Ken apart from when our son asks about him. I wish it was the kind of update where he got the results seen how much of a idiot he’s been and we move on but sadly that’s not the case. I can’t dwell on it to much just take shit one day at a time. I do miss my person and worry that he’s missing out on his baby girls life already which if I think about to much I will just sit and cry but I don’t have time for that. As always thanks for listening to me rant. I might update if anything else happens in my life. Right now I’m still left wondering if I’m doing the right thing here. Is there anything I could do differently? Why are my kids so hard for him to accept all of a sudden?

>I think he’s either projecting or having a mental breakdown. It’s gotta be one or the other. I’d tell his sister to tell him to get help or it’s over. I’d make it clear if he doesn’t go to therapy/counseling or whatever that a divorce is imminent.

>I think he is now in denial because he wants to not be the father, otherwise he screwed up his whole life for nothing and that would be more dangerous to him than being depressed bc his wife cheated but at least be validatedBut also is it possible to have dna result in 4 days?

**Update 3: about 2 weeks from original**

Hello again Reddit. Things have been Bizarre but now I have closure. I know what’s happened to my marriage. I know what scum Ken really is. He’s not my person and never truly was. So now I just want to divorce him, cut my loses and move on with my life.

Im still at home with my babies settling into motherhood. My dad and Step mum are still here but they will be leaving soon once I’m more emotionally stable. To say I’m ok would be a lie but I now know what I need to do.

I have some sort of closure with Ken. I know what happened with him and I know that it’s not my fault. Turns out Ken was having an affair and has a baby on the way. Even typing that makes me want to throw up.

I found this out when a visibly pregnant lady just knocked on my door and asked me when I would be leaving the house as “it’s Ken’s house”. When I say this confused the crap out of me I mean it.

I talked to this women for a while to try to work out what she was talking about. It turns out that she’s Ken’s side piece. Well technically in her head she’s his fiancée. A month ago Ken got down on one knee and proposed to her in my fucking kitchen….classy right.

So they have been seeing each other for a while. She’s having his baby. She believes I’m the ex wife who Ken is letting him stay in his house till I get on my feet. We apparently broke up a few years ago and none of my kids are Ken’s. When I goto work in the mornings Ken goes to her house and works from there. They were waiting for marriage to move in together. How you trying to marry someone when you are already married? Fucking weirdo.

I asked for proof of all this. She has pictures of them together. Apparently she has a OF account that they make content together 🤮🤮. I told her we are still married and explained everything to her.

I’m not sure what she’s going to do. But hey not my circus not my monkey. Now I want a divorce. Is it true that once you talk to a solicitor about divorce they can’t represent the person your divorce? I want to go around our town and meet with as many solicitors as possible as the first hour is free so that he has a very hard time getting representation? Is that too petty?

The house is in my name only and is protected so there is no way he can take it. I have all my money and we do have a joint account but that’s just what we put our share of household bills in. I haven’t spoken directly with Ken. His family have completely cut him off and he’s been kicked out of his sisters house.

All those people that was concerned about him having tumour or something wrong with his brain I really don’t think that’s the case. I think his actions just caught up to him as his lies were going to come out once his baby was born. I think that’s what happened. He got backed into a corner and tried to fight his way out.

Through divorce process I will get the court to do DNA testing so he has proof for both. Even if he chooses to not believe it. I’m mentally exhausted from all of this and sat wondering how I didn’t notice. Might have to go for an eye test.

But honestly would I be so wrong for just making his life as difficult as possible to get legal advice or is that too far? I want him to suffer.

>I'm a legal assistant. When I worked for the state, we would have a lot of opponents representing themselves without lawyers, either to save money or because the opponent was an insane conspiracy theorist. You might think the attorneys I worked for would be glad when their opponent had no attorney because that makes for an easy win, right?Wrong. Our opponent having no attorney and no idea what they were doing just made the process overly complicated and painful and annoying and dragged it out. True, there are insane conspiracy theorist attorneys out there, too, but the vast majority of the time, once the defendant realized they were in over their head and hired an attorney, it made the process go smoother and faster.I know nothing about divorce court, but I hypothesize sabotaging his attempts to get an attorney will make the ordeal worse for you, too. You have proof of infidelity, the house was acquired before the marriage - you have this in the bag already. Just go through the motions of serving the paperwork, letting time pass, etc. - the less shenanigans anyone causes, the smoother and faster it will go.I don't know if STBX has a motive to drag the process out, but preventing or delaying him finding an attorney is no protection against that.

It took a long time to get to this part of my life and and some points i actually felt like I was drowning. Both of my kids had a DNA test through the courts and they are Ken’s. He still doesn’t believe it. Not my problem tho.

Ken is now in prison for domestic abuse. I’m not 100% on the details because I wasn’t involved. It was his side piece.

I’d love to say that sometimes I don’t break down in tears and I’m completely over it. But I’m not. I’ve now gone back to work tho after my maternity leave was finished. I got a promotion. And now I’m use to living with just us three. My kids keep me going and I’m so proud of them. They go visit their grandparents and dads side of the family and they have been so lovely and supportive. His sister is still amazing.

I don’t really know what else to say. Just I’m ok. I’m divorced and my children are thriving. I can’t thank Ken for a lot of things but I’m grateful for my children.

*I have this habit of not being able to move forward once I come across a situation like yours. I need reassurance, confirmation, and even closure to even move on. Even though the situation doesn't involve me, I hate seeing women in marriages that have a husband that cheats.*

*Now, you brought me peace in knowing that you're safe and thriving for your kids. I'm so happy that you have him out of your life and I hope he rots in prison for his stupid behavior through all of this.*

*I hope that you continue to thrive and continue to live your life to the fullest, same goes for your kids.*

*Stay safe, and continue thriving OP*

I went to the urgent care clinic after being instructed by my primary since my primary is booked for the next several weeks and the urgent care doctor said it could possibly an ear infection because she found liquid past my eardrum but there's also a possibility that it is tinnitus. She prescribed me some Amoxicillin to help the ear infection but I heard that the medication causes tinnitus to worsen, so right now i'm scared to take the Amoxicillin. I also heard an ENT could make it worse as well, so i'm not sure what to do except keep taking the Amoxicillin and praying that it's just an ear infection.

So far i've been spending the past hours researching various things on tinnitus, mainly because I have this hope that it could be temporary and the next few days will be crucial because I feel like if I do the wrong thing then it could be permanent. I plan to stop my coffee intake until I finish my prescribed medication.

Right now it's not the tinnitus itself being that scares me, i'll just have to learn to live with it if it is permanent and the tinnitus habituation does give me comfort that my brain will teach me how to get used to it, but it's mainly the waiting that's terrifying me.

1h7266v,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovidRecovered/comments/1h7266v/road_to_recovering_from_long_covid_twice_and/,Road to Recovering from Long COVID twice and avoiding it with three subsequent COVID infections,"This is what I did for my health journey to recover from Long COVID.  It's entirely built from scratch using only peer reviewed research articles that I found in reputable journals and on the National Institutes of Health government website.  Where possible, I've relied on meta-analysis of research.  Some notables about me: I don't have any underlying medical conditions or chronic conditions.  I do meet half of the diagnostic criteria for connective tissue disorders, so I'm predisposed and have some outward issues, but I don't fully meet the criteria for any of them.  I'm not an athlete, but I typically walk briskly with my dogs for at least an hour a day and I enjoy doing a lot of outdoor activities on a regular basis.  I'm male and over 60.  I have a partner who works in a school where no one masks.  The result is that I've had COVID at least ten times confirmed.  I've had Long COVID twice, in 2020-2021 for 14 months, and again in 2023 for 8 months.  The second bout of Long COVID was far worse for me.  I had all of the notable symptoms of Long COVID including dysautonomia (both Orthostatic Hypotension and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia were severe), neurological problems, brain fog, cognitive damage, COVID anxiety, temporary loss of all emotion (anhedonia), PEM, COVID Autoimmunity, bulging blood vessels, and much more.  You can see a longer partial list of what I experienced at [https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1h006t6/comment/lz0yqms](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1h006t6/comment/lz0yqms) Suffice it to say that I had all of the types of Long COVID. My worst symptoms were debilitating, including the loss of the ability to follow conversations, to read, to walk, to use my hands, to swallow, to sleep. My attention span fell to a mere five seconds.  The 24/7 COVID anxiety was biologically rooted so even when I was having happy placid thoughts while doing my best  to watch a fish swim in its aquarium my mind was filled with chaotic noise and that fight or flight impulse was constantly threatening to overwhelm me.  I also met all of the common symptoms for ME/CFS, but I didn't have significant MCAS.  I believe that because I was treating a mild version of MCAS pre-pandemic with Quercetin Phytosome and Luteolin, that this prevented the MCAS from becoming a more serious issue for me.  As a result, some of the things that I did to recover may need to be changed or dropped for those that have MCAS.  I'll try to call these out below.  Despite everything, I did have the ability to learn and read for about two hours every day, albeit at about 1/10th my normal rate.  I had to reread everything many, many times, making notes as I went to make the associations and connections.  It was super hard to DIY myself to health when my brain wasn't working.

My number one thing that helped me was my trusty Spreadsheet!  Each column was for a different symptom, followed by a variety of biometrics.  Every row was another day.  Symptoms were graded from 1-10 with 10 being severe.  I used auto-coloring to color from green to red.  There were many weeks where it was incredibly hard just to make the effort to enter data into the spreadsheet that took all of about two minutes.  Every two weeks I'd try something new and then track the symptoms.  Many things I tried didn't work at all.  The underlying rollercoaster of Long COVID made seeing the trends difficult.  My doctors all swore that they didn't know how to treat COVID or Long COVID and they refused to refer me to any doctors that could treat me because I failed their crucial breathing test (94% or below oxygenation when walking very slowly for six minutes around the doctor's office.  Mine was 95%)  I had several trips to Urgent Care and the ER in month 2 and 3.  I self-referred myself to a pulmonologist who put me on a corticosteroid inhaler for a few months.  It stopped me from getting COVID bronchitis, but it also stopped me from recovering.  I was surprised at the systemic effect from something that was purported to work only on the lungs.  This made me question everything.  It also got me looking for biometrics that I could measure daily.  I purchased an oximeter, spirometer, blood pressure monitor, and an Apple watch to measure VO2Max, resting heart rate, peak heart rate, and other vitals plus it does ECG (similar to EKG).  I more recently learned that should also have gotten a home glucose monitor since Long COVID is often associated with glucose metabolism issues.

The most helpful blood tests that ruled out other common issues were D-dimer (screening for blood clots), metabolic panel (kidney and liver function), mineral test (look for deficiencies).  There are many tests my doctors should've ordered that they didn't such as IgG and IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, thyroid test, Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, C-Reactive Protein test, and tests for autoantibodies such as Anti-AT1R, Anti-ETA, and Anti-Complement H.

My number one suggestion is to learn about how the virus infects, how it twists the chromatin (the cell's chromosomes and epigenome) to direct what the cell produces, how it puts on the friendly protein bits that distinguish human cells from invaders so that the Sars-CoV-2 viral particles appear like your human cells thus evading the immune system, how the virus invades the very immune system cells that are meant to defeat it, how it hides in parts of the body even after the immune system has learned all it can to eliminate the virus.  Know your enemy!  There are excellent virology seminars available on YouTube that should we consumed.  We all should know much more.  It's only by understanding how the virus does what it does that we can find what we need to eliminate it.

This leads me to the Legal Caveats.  This is entirely my journey through Long COVID.  I don't intend for this to be advice, recommendations, or even suggestions to anyone who reads this.  This is all anecdotal.  I'm just one person so my experience has low statistical predictive value.  I did see doctors that ruled out other possible causes, leading to the diagnosis of Long COVID.  Because I have no other medical conditions and I'm not taking any pharmaceutical medications, some of the supplements that I had a good experience with may not work for others, especially if there are drug interactions or allergies to any of the specific ingredients.  My a1C and glucose are in the healthy normal range, so for others that have an abnormal glucose metabolism, supplements such as berberine should be avoided unless consulting with a doctor. I took precautions such as adding just one supplement every two weeks, going slow, and making careful notes.  I don't advise that anyone suddenly start doing ""all the things"" or taking the highest dose that's recommended on the bottle.  Please don't mistake my notes below as suggesting this all-in approach.  We all have genetic variants that may cause something that works in one person to backfire in another.  My only advice to people that read this is to proceed with caution, talk to your doctor, and have a trusted friend or relative do routine daily check-ins with you to make sure you're okay.

Baseline Pre-Pandemic:  Overall healthy diet, good daily exercise (1-2 hours/day), good sleep hygiene.  Regularly consumed fish, vegetables, dark chocolate, collagen peptide powder (helped to heal athletic injuries), nicotinamide riboside (helped to avoid getting skin cancer), ubiquinol (a close cousin of COQ10 - avoid developing type II diabetes), glucosamine and chondroitin (for joint health), zinc (15mg with 1mg copper), Taurine, Tri-methyl glycine, and Magnesium glycinate. None of this prevented me from getting Long COVID.

**Phase 1: Get T-Cell Count Back Up.**  I started with the H1 and H2 blockers (loratadine/Claritin and famotidine/Pepcid) to keep EPV, HSV, and other latent viruses that were kept boxed up by my immune system from becoming a problem. Also, I didn't want to get sick with everything else that I'd already built up an immunity to.  The studies I read indicated that taking these for six weeks after the end of the viral infection or viral persistence was sufficient to boost T-cell count back to normal.  I didn't have a reactivation of EPV or HSV, so this was a win.

**Phase 2: End Viral Persistence.**  My next step was viral persistence. (This is a fancy way of saying that the virus is still infecting cells, reproducing, mutating as viral mutant swarms are want to do in their efforts to transmit to other individuals, and causing metabolic havoc) This one was tough.  I had viral persistence for nearly 5 months before I began to directly address this. I began to follow all of the pharmaceutical antiviral trials. I then back-tracked each of these that seemed promising to find natural substances that did something similar. For example, one of the promising drugs block Galactin-1 and Galactin-3. The first is relatively easy, Lactose, either consumed in milk or produced as a byproduct of physical activity (lactic acid => lactose). I found Galactin-3 in Modified Citrus Pectin. (available in powder form online for many other purposes) I followed a similar path to land on Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) when I was looking for something that had salvionic acid in it. ""the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and the salvionic acids present in S. miltiorrhiza are able to bind to each other"" I had been looking at NAC to reduce inflammation, but was happy to find that when combined with Bromelain, it also has an antiviral effect. None of these alone proved to be a ""cure"" but together, they dramatically reduced the duration of viral persistence in me according to my spreadsheet. Not only did they end the six month long period of viral persistence that I had with LC last year, they also reduced viral persistence to 3-6 weeks for the three COVID infections that I've had this year.  I tried other supplements with proven antiviral effect, each one incrementally helping me to recover faster. These are all proven to have antiviral properties against Sars-CoV-2.  None of them has been proven to be as capable as the prescription medication Paxlovid. Each works differently to inhibit and impair the virus's ability to infect a cell.  They also don't interact with each other in a way that causes problems.  So I took all of them together:  Quercetin Phytosome, Lactoferrin, Cardamom, Citicoline, Bromelain, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), Black Cumin (black seed oil), Danshen, Berberine, Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP), and Melatonin.  I discovered that none of them alone worked to end viral persistence, but each reduced the total viral load.  If I had to hypothesize, I believe the virus mutates within me so some versions of it are susceptible and others are not.  There is solid evidence that the virus does mutate to better infect the brain.  If I had to choose a subset of these as the most potent, it would be Bromelain, N-Acetyl Cysteine, Berberine, and Modified Citrus Pectin.  I've tried each of these systematically and discovered that none of them alone was able to eliminate all of the virus from my body (they were not the cure to ending viral persistence).  Also, even in combination, they've been unable to prevent me from getting re-infected.  Although these re-infections have been an the exceptionally mild end of the spectrum versus the previous infections that were quite serious for 4-6 weeks.  Curiously,  IFN-γ (interferon gamma) that's produced by CD8+ T cells during a viral infection wasn't produced in my body after the primary infection was cleared.  So the viral persistence was at a low enough level such that this innate soldier against viral illnesses wasn't continually marshalled, likely extending the timeline of this viral infection.  Timeline 2-4 months. 

* The combination of Bromelain and NAC has been shown to dissolve the spike proteins, making the virus less able to infect cells.  This combo was also good to mop up the stranded spikes after the infection was over but it took about 3-4 months for this to result in elimination of my COVID headache starting from when the viral persistence was eliminated.  NAC alone is an anti-inflammatory and reduces damage done to the lungs during an active COVID infection. 
* Berberine is a solid anti-viral, working similar to one of the two ingredients in Paxlovid, anti-inflammatory, glucose metabolism regulator, and reducer of cholesterol.  (Berberine ""has anticancer activity against various types of cancer, mediated through the suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)"") • Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) inhibits Galactin-3, speeding viral clearance. It also reduces fibrosis of the lungs that can occur after the virus damages them. 
* Quercetin Phytosome and its sibling Quercetin with Bromelain reduces risk of contracting COVID in places that have moderate occupancy such as a hospital or grocery store.  Quercetin is an antiviral. 
* Danshen works in two ways to be a potent antiviral. It has tanshinones that exhibit inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV cysteine proteases. It also has salvianolic acids have been found to hinder the entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus into cells by binding to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and ACE2 protein.  It's also an anti-inflammatory, improves glucose control, and dissolves pre-pandemic type blood clots. 
* Milk Thistle (I haven't tried yet) Contains silibinin polyphenols that bind tightly to the S-Protein of the viral particle, preventing it from docking with and infecting a cell.

**Phase 3: End Gut Dysbiosis.** The virus kills off the majority of the beneficial gut bacteria.  This leads to a sizeable increase in the populations of bacteria that are not beneficial. Infected bacteria spew out more viral particles, providing a reservoir of active viral infection that's safe from the human's immune system. A combination of probiotics, pre-biotic foods, soluble fiber (ground flax and chia seeds) to replenish and feed the beneficial bacteria.  Also starve the non-beneficial bacteria by eliminating added sugar, reducing refined carbs (white bread), and naked starches (white rice, French fries).  Eliminating fast food was another major step.  The more whole grains, vegetables, and non-fried foods the better.  I added quinoa, lentils, and traded my bread up to organic Dave's Killer Bread or made it at home in the bread machine.  Miso soup (contains Aspergillus oryzae that produces Aspirochlorine in the gut that protects the remaining beneficial bacteria from being infected by shielding ACE2 from the interaction with S protein), kefir/yogurt, fermented foods, probiotic supplement, and soluble fiber (flax, chia seeds, etc.)  Gut Dysbiosis results in low levels of tryptophan, serotonin, melatonin, choline and acetylcholine, tyrosine, and beta-alanine.  A low level of beta-alanine dramatically reduced my physical endurance, separate of microclot caused Post Exertional Malaise.  While I was resolving the gut dysbiosis, I supplemented with foods rich in tryptophan such as spirulina, took a beta alanine supplement, took a citicoline supplement, and increased my intake of collagen peptides (they contain a long list of essential amino acids that are all impacted by gut dysbiosis.)  My body stopped shaking nightly once my gut biome was restored to health. Note: If I had MCAS, I wouldn't consume any food that's fermented, including miso soup. Timeline: 2-4 weeks.

**Phase 4: Reduce Inflammation.**  After the infection is entirely cleared, including ending viral persistence, inflammation persists.  C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is highly elevated, Cortisol is highly elevated, and the Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway continues to be overactivated.  When the level of this inflammation was exceptionally high, it disrupted my blood brain barrier (previously seen only in other animals infected with coronavirus, but COVID causes this now in humans too) causing a massive 24/7 headache, cognitive problems beyond normal brain fog, and neural damage.  I lost the ability to type and spell hundreds of words during a few short weeks when this occurred.  The ibuprofen and inhaled corticosteroid were insufficient to reduce this inflammation.  I did find two things that notably helped, San Leng (Rhizoma Sparganii - a root in granulated form) that reduces the activity of TLR4, and Virgin Coconut Oil that's able to reduce C-Reactive Protein.  (Note: Low Dose Naltrexone also reduces the activity of TLR4, but it also affects the opiate pathway and requires a prescription and a compounding pharmacy).  To reduce cortisol, I chose the most tasty option, dark chocolate (70% and 86% Ghirardelli Intense Dark chocolate).  I found that eating 3-6 ounces/day also reduced my sky-high level of adrenaline.  Timeline: 2 weeks to reduce inflammation in half plus another 2-3 weeks after the Microclots were eliminated.

**Phase 5: Eliminate Microclots.**  Because this virus causes microclots that are actually not blood clots in the classic sense, but instead are a form of plastic/polymer called anomalous amyloid fibrin (another deep topic that I delved as far into as much as possible) and these microclots cause Post Exertional Malaise (PEM) and COVID autoimmunity (both of which were horrible for me) I landed on Nattokinase and Serrapeptase. This combo has been super helpful. Thanks to my Go Low Go Slow philosophy, I quickly discovered that I couldn't take nattokinase at the same time of day as the Danshen. I needed to space them apart by 12 hours. Anything less than 10 hours and I had extreme stomach upset. I did not have this issue with serrapeptase. (Note: Lumbrokinase can be used in place of Nattokinase.  Also, Lumbrokinase didn't adversely interact with Danshen, so I've been able to take it both morning and night.)  Microclots cause a hyperactivation of platelets, increasing inflammation, and causing neutrophils (immune system cell) to attack healthy nerve tissue (COVID Autoimmunity).   Microclots turned out to be one of the major contributors to my brain fog and low VO2Max.  Both significantly improved with this phase.  Danshen also dissolves thrombus/blood clots, not to be confused with the confusingly named microclots. (""In patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke."").   If I had MCAS, I would not be taking Nattokinase since it will worsen this histamine condition.  Instead, I'd take Lumbrokinase along with Serrapeptase. Timeline: 2-3 months.

**Phase 6: Correct Immune System Dysfunction.** Omega-3 fish oil (3:1 ratio of EPA to DHA), Quercetin Phytosome, Luteolin supplement.  This dysfunction is a direct result of microclots causing neutrophils to become bad actors. Additional dysfunction results as the viral infection causes mast cell system dysregulation.  If it continues unaddressed, the probability soars that this will develop into MCAS.  MCAS is the leading cause of ME/CFS.  I waited almost too long with my first bout of LC, leading to severe nerve and tissue damage in my feet that took nearly four years to heal.  I started this phase on Day 1 of the viral infection, but it wasn't completed until the microclots had been nearly entirely eliminated.

**Phase 7: Clear out the Viral Grunge and reverse nerve damage.**  Spike proteins stuck inside cells and overproduction of TLR4 protein were the top two cited results of the viral infection.  The next up were cells that were so damaged by either the infection or by the soup of inflammatory substances that they had become senescent cells, unable to function properly. This includes damaged neurons, peripheral nerves (plus demyelination also seen in MS), and damaged endothelial cells that line the cardiovascular system.  This prompted a substantial change in nutrition and dietary balance (35%+ healthy fats, 40% carbs, 25% protein), carefully structured exercise regimen, and taking some other supplements.

**Phase 8: Reverse Mitochondrial Damage.**  Curcumin Phytosome or Curcumin spice with pepper, egg yolk, cruciferous vegetables, antioxidant foods (blueberries and pomegranate), glutathione (mushrooms and avocado), catalase (foods high in catalase include banana, strawberry, dragon fruit, papaya, and apple), Resveratrol (found in dark grapes, black raisins, peanuts, and pistachios), Vitamin C, and alpha-lipoic acid (ground flax seed), melatonin supplement (1mg+/night) 

**Phase 9: Reverse Neural Damage.** I ate foods and took supplements that promote neurogenesis or act as senolytics that help the immune system to remove damaged cells. 

Promote neurogenesis 

* Curcumin phytosome (curcumin spice plus black pepper will provide a similar benefit) • Blueberries (for their blueberry polyphenols ... I put dried blueberries in my daily smoothie) 
* Sulforaphane (broccoli, kale, Brussel sprouts) 
* Salvionic acid (Danshen also known as salvia miltiorrhiza plant ... powder form) 
* Rosmarinic acid (rosemary spice and Perilla Extract powder) 
* Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (walnuts, sunflower seeds, flax) 
* Grapeseed extract has been shown to improve adult neurogenesis.  Acute administration has been shown to increase serum concentrations of BDNF, which plays a regulatory role in neurogenesis 

Senolytics to enable the immune system to be more effective at triggering the self-destruct of damaged cells • Spermidine (wheat germ) 

* Eugenol (clove oil, cinnamon leaf, and holy basil) 
* Resveratrol (dark grape skins or raisins also have this) 
* Luteolin (Dried Mexican Oregano ... I'm taking a supplement form) 
* Quercetin (blueberry skin but it's not bioavailable unless you add bromelain supplement or dried pineapple ... or take it in the form of Quercetin Phytosome) 

**Phase 10: Stop getting infected by COVID!!!** I've had it at least 10 times confirmed since 2020. I want it to stop!!! I'm now tracking down every study I can find that points in the direction of reducing this risk of contracting COVID. I've got to boost the monolaurin, reduce the total cholesterol, get my weight back down to a healthy pre-pandemic level, etc. I've developed a new found joy at adding virgin coconut oil to my coffee.

**Lifestyle changes**

**Sleep hygiene.** Waking up within the same half hour every morning is crucial. Getting at least 8 1/2 hours and preferably 9 1/2 hours in bed with my eyes closed in a dark room (no TV, no laptop, no mobile device, and no jumping kittens!!!). If you have ADHD and are sleep averse, this will be a major problem and challenge for you! Still, the key is to keep the eyes closed. If you're dying of boredom in a dark room with your eyes closed, put on some relaxing instrumental music (no lyrics). Given enough time, you'll have memorized all of the classics and instrumental versions of all the pop songs in no time. • Diet. Stick to a low inflammatory Mediterranean dietary pattern. No added sugar, no fast food, no ultra processed where you can't even pronounce the ingredients. Pizza delivered to your door is also ""fast food"" (sadly). I did find I could make my own pizza at home with a bread machine for the multigrain dough that has sizable amount of whole grains that I toss in. The key is low refined carbs and refined starches because they are essentially ""added sugar"".  These ready sources of sugar preferentially feed the non-beneficial gut bacteria, worsening gut dysbiosis. 

**Exercise.** Long COVID definition: Exercise = (1) any type of slow stretching movement, (2) slow walking for at least one minute, (3) lifting weights with different arm or leg motions with weights limited to five pounds or less, (4) pose held for at least several seconds such as Tai Chi or Yoga.  Holding a pose is a form of isometric exercise that improves orthostatic hypotension symptoms.  If you've had an active COVID infection for more than two weeks, or a viral persistence longer than this (viral persistence = virus is still infecting cells somewhere in the body even though it's been cleared by the immune system from most of it), then you have Post Exertional Malaise (PEM).  PEM is caused by the S-proteins (Spikey bits that protrude from the viral particle) chemically reacting with neutrophils to form a sort of plastic called a microclot or more scientifically, anomalous amyloid protein.    These microclots plaster themselves against muscle tissue, organs, and elsewhere, preventing efficient flow of oxygen and nutrients into the cells and waste products out of the cell. The result is that each cell is like a pre-charged battery.  It can only be exercised until it's store of oxygen and nutrients has been exhausted.  Exercising beyond this point of exhaustion will result in damage to the cells as they drown in their toxic waste products and are oxygen starved.  It can take several hours to recharge the cells.  So first, find your PEM time limit for each physical activity that you want to do, where you just start to feel muscle soreness.  Then do your physical activity at no more than 90% of your limit.  Over a span of a week or so, if you consistently feel like you have good exercise energy remaining after this, consider adding a single minute a day until you feel vaguely tired after exercising and then keep it at that plateau for another month or so before adding more time. I worked my way up from 10 min/day to 90 min/day over the span of several months. Exercising every day has been crucial to my recovery. My exercise has been best sprinkled throughout the day, a few minutes every half hour, etc. Exercising for too long all at once consistently triggered PEM in me and then I had to scale back my exercising to about half the number of minutes for two weeks as a result of the muscle damage.   For more information, see the detail section below on PEM.

Overall, exercise is crucial to reducing inflammation, C-Reactive Protein, Cortisol, and other stress hormones. This is an important step during LC recovery in helping the body to go from total pathogen alert status to a normal standby status. So when I found myself in PEM hell, I knew that I couldn't stay bed bound if I wanted to speed my recovery. But I also had to be super careful to exercise (in the broadest sense of the term) below my limits. With time, Nattokinase and serrapeptase removed the micro blood clots (about 3-4 months) and the curcumin phytosome and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale) helped the mitochondria to heal. (they need that hydrogen disulfide goodness that is reminiscent of being near a volcanic vent) I'm now up to two hours of brisk walking a day. I still have a PEM limit, but it's around 2 1/2 hours of brisk walking or about 15 minutes of strength training with 30 pound weights. I still have more to go in my recovery. Please, don't take anything I'm saying here is advice to exercise beyond your own personal limit. It's worse than a hangover and it took me over two weeks to recover the first time I pushed beyond my PEM limit, setting me back weeks towards recovery. As they say, Go Low, Go Slow! Recovery isn't a race. You just want to be headed in the right direction.

**Stress Management.** Whatever keeps stress low, especially adrenaline levels. If you like to play heart pumping video games like Shrapnel (military first person extraction game), you'll need to pause on that and instead play Minecraft or Animal Crossing. I had to cut out watching action movies and switch instead to South Korean k-dramas, Rick and Morty, I find being bored stressful so I've resorted to learning guitar, water colors and acrylic painting, photoshop, and AI art creation. Also, sometimes watching every video I can on a particular topic like axolotls can be very therapeutic. Find something for you that relaxes you.",1,1733377400.0,LongCovidRecovered,0,1.0,False

# For Rogue team: new gear for Cena, who survived getting shot in the head(!), plus a thermal clip-on scope and 10 NVG mounts

[Rogue Team asked Protect A Volunteer for their help](https://new.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1h5pphf/rogue_team_would_like_to_give_a_huge_thank_you/). PAV asked for your help. True to form, you came through! I'll let u/tallalittlebit tell it:  


>On a recent mission Cena was shot in the head. He somehow got back up and managed to walk again and walked several kilometers out of the AO. How did he do that? No one who witnessed it can explain it but he did. A teammate tried to help carry his gear but ultimately couldn't do it and that meant he survived but lost everything he had.  
>  
>They asked Protect a Volunteer for help and we asked you all for help. And you DID help! We raised $5,500 for Rogue team. As per the team's preferences they wanted most of the funds to go to Cena to get him new gear and get him equipped to go out again. We also had enough to order one thermal clip-on scope which means we have 4!!!! on the way for 3 different teams. We were also able to deliver 10 NVG mounts.

I never feel empty after.,"Drinking healthy amounts of water makes me pee constantly that’s why I usually under drink and it’s making me dehydrated. And on days that I drink water healthily, it makes me pee nonstop. 😭

What happens is I sit on the toilet for a LONG time because I will pee and then I would feel another pee coming so I won’t stand up yet. But I will have to wait and exert for it to come down and if I don’t do so, as soon as I stand up, I will feel like peeing again. This cycle repeats for I don’t know how many times. Maybe 7 times in one bathroom trip! Pee. Stop a bit. Bear down until it trickles. Stop. Repeat. 

What’s worse is even if I already spent a long time in one bathroom trip, as soon as I wash my hands, I have to go again. 😭 (I can never pee and NOT wash my hands ever so this is also making my hands very dry.)

Today, I repeated all the above steps and on my third consecutive bathroom trip, I timed my peeing to a total of 4 minutes. And that’s just the third trip!

This is too much of a hassle and I always feel embarrassed going to public bathrooms or sharing rooms because I take TOO LONG to pee and still don’t feel empty afterwards!!

This has been going on for years. And I’ve seen doctors, undergone ultrasounds, CT scan, etc. And not so much as a diagnosis, not even a UTI. And I’m grateful, really. That they can’t see anything. On paper, I’m healthy. But can you imagine how much of a hassle this is?

Oftentimes I would go to bed after peeing several times, and then as soon as I lay down, I still feel like I need to pee. 😭 I never feel relaxed except when I don’t drink water too much which I know is unhealthy and is making my skin and mouth very dry already. 

Please help. I just want to know maybe there’s a similar condition like me elsewhere because in this part of the world, it seems like no doctor knows what it is. Do I have a tiny bladder? Is it my urethra? 

I always suspected it’s either of the two because they always take a picture of my healthy kidneys.

I’ve seen roasters cafes do this so I know it’s possible but isn’t there a specific window of distance (height) where the milk going in integrates with the espresso perfectly to make latte art, therefore meaning that taller cups make this extremely difficult?

But I don’t mind winter! And I think I need some very deeply cozy relaxation after this awful year.

Anyone have any suggestions for cozy stuff in Scotland? My ideal vibe is: reading books at local pubs with fireplaces for a few hours every night, reading or drawing at tea shops, cute streets with stone houses, fireplaces, fireplaces, fireplaces, great classic comfort food, maybe hotels that have fireplaces, old things, book stores, bread bakeries, historical art

Will also very happily accept: Notable stores and shop local/small-type spots for authentic souvenirs, interesting experiences (ghost stories, very old cemeteries, bearded men, etc.), packing tips, advice on where to sight see furry cows but not trespass, notable restaurants/cafes/etc, any recommended electronic-y clubs for maybe one night of dancing

I don’t care much about drinking (happy to nurse a drink or two in a cute place though) so no beer or whiskey tours or similar for me, no high end dining, no big designer shopping, I prefer tea over coffee and ancient art over more modern 

These things could be anywhere in Scotland because so far I’m planning to rent a car and be allover the place for 2.5wks, and I’m mainly here hoping for specifics beyond the “go to the highlands and this city in general!” advice I’m seeing on blogs and other posts.

[$800]","I've been looking at upgrading from my very basic setup which consists of an oxo burr grinder, aeropress, pourover, or french press, and frother wand. 

This may be blasphemous to some of you, but I don't want to spend much time figuring out dialing in, timing on pulling my shots, the right grind size, etc. Even the best lattes I've had at some of the best places are just a bit better. I don't quantify better coffee is 10x better or whatever, I have less nuance than that and I want to keep it that way. I have too many hobbies as it is, and espresso hobby is, for me, unjustifiably expensive and a time sink. I've already done silly things like this with mechanical keyboards.

So, reason I've been looking at the touch is it's decently semi-auto and at an acceptable price point at ~$700 right now on sale on Amazon.

What I like:

* Included grinder with Baratza burrs with more recent models
* Automatic dosing
* Auto milk texturing

I am not that much of a fan of a touch screen but I can see how it will be useful to me as a newbie having it handhold me. And unfortunately, none of the more basic models like the Pro or Express have as much auto features.

I know everyone here is ALL about the Bambino Plus + DF54 but it seems more finnicky and toying around than what I want, plus the latter is on backorder anyway.

I don't want complexity. Reduce complexity for me.

1h71vdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/1h71vdr/everything_you_probably_never_wanted_to_know/,Everything you probably never wanted to know about Merge Hotel: Empire - With Numbers! A complete guide for completion,"**Backstory**

This will be my first SwagBucks completion and was only able to do it thanks to the contributions of this subbreddit. I've seen a bit of controversy lately on whether or not this one is still achievable, and as far as I can tell, it absolutely is. The major caveat being **you'll need to spend money to get there**. In an effort to give back to the sub for helping me, I'd like to provide you with some details, numbers, and my reasoning!

&nbsp;

**But how can you be so sure?**

Well, I started this about 20 days ago without much trouble. I bought the two event passes, as well as a piggy bank to get me started. A lot of the beginning levels are pretty fast and aren't too painful, especially with the early purchases. I didn't have a great strategy for a while, until around level 7 or 8 that I saw [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/1gs9for/merge_hotel_empire_save_this_post_for_when_you/) and started pushing for a level 13 mosiac.

I was seeing a lot of success with this method, and was able to turn in one level 13 mosiac before Merge Hotel received a patch the next day, and I was worried it had been nerfed because of posts I was seeing speculated as such. 

I wanted to verify that they had indeed changed the amount of stars needed to level up, but for as long as this game has been out, I had a hell of a time finding any hard numbers on stars needed to progress from one level to the next.  I saw a bunch of general posts mentioning how around level 10 you hit a wall, and various stages being extremely difficult but nothing concrete. So I took it upon myself to start keeping track. Here are my results:

Level | Stars Need
:--|:--:
9 | 39850
10 | 46700
11 | 65580
12 | 75400
13 | 85560
14 | 96000
15 | 99790
16 | 66070
17 | 73230
18 | 69030
19 | 53968
20 | 49520

&nbsp;

The results mirror a lot of what I've been reading -- You hit a sharp spike around level 10 that doesn't stop until level 15. This is when a ton of people are giving up. After that you see a steady decrease, and the last two levels are a joke in comparison. I've seen vague star guestimations on this sub on various levels that match very closely to my experience, and the sentiment matches what people have been saying about this game for months, so I don't believe it has been nerfed or changed. 

&nbsp;

That said, now you have a definitive amount of stars to compare your game with to know if they've changed anything, the way I wish I had when I started ;)

&nbsp;

**But that's still an insane amount of stars!!!**

Yeah you're absolutely right. With each mosiac averaging around 15k stars, and orders popping up for it sometimes being few and far between, it is still a slog to achieve all milestones.  But I kind of assumed that's the nature of all SwagBucks offers. As I mentioned, this will be my first offer I've completed, but I didn't go into it thinking I would be making $30 for each hour of game time spent. It is something that ended up being kind of fun and addicting that took a lot of time, with a huge payout in the end. Not to sound cynical, and I could be wrong, but I don't imagine many games come through with achievable 500+ dollar payouts. 

&nbsp;

**Yeah yeah, I hear you. What are your tips?**

&nbsp;

**Mosiacs** - My first huge insight that I haven't seen posted anywhere else is that *prior to stage 10, level 13 mosiacs will be worth around 34,000 stars*. This is because you haven't fully upgraded your sapphires generator yet, so getting high level mosiacs is much harder. Past stage 10, you'll see the amount of stars drop to 15,000 - 17,000 stars per level 13 mosiac. You'll see a further decrease in stars per level 13 mosiac to 10,000 - 12,000 past stage 19.

Mosiac turn ins seem random. Sometimes you'll get two turn ins over the course of 5 orders, and sometimes you'll go 20 orders without seeing a single mosiac. My strategy was to keep one level 12 mosiac in my storage for scissoring/cameraing, and at least 2 level 13 mosiacs on my board. By the last level, I had 6 level 13 mosiacs on my board, but it didn't seem to change anything. I would still get orders just as randomly as when I had 1 or 2.

&nbsp;

**Items** - Always upgrade unused items to max possible level (don't keep copies of the same item on your board unless you have a reason to). Every time you complete an order, the game will scan your inventory to decide the next order. A lot of the time it will chose item(s) that you already have as at least part of the order. Higher level items mean more stars, so there's no reason to not combine them.

&nbsp;

**Star Carryover** - Orders will keep coming in until you reach enough stars to complete the level. My best suggestion if you end up with a level 13 mosiac order near the end of a stage,  save it for right before you're about to reach the total stars needed (for example, turn it in when you have 38,000 stars at level 9 so you'll go into level 10 with the most possible stars starting out for level 10).


Major reasoning for this is because as you enter higher stages, the star payouts of the same materials seem to decrease. What was worth 1000 stars in level 10 will potentially be worth hundreds of less stars in level 11. This continues all the way through the game, so try to maximize stars at ends of levels.

&nbsp;

**Camera/Scissors** - Cameras are your main priority followed by scissors. One pink camera will get you a level 12 mosiac, while it will take you two pink scissors to achieve the same result. **Don't combine your first two level 12 mosiacs until you have a third** If you do, you'll need to hold off on turning in your level 13 mosiac until you have level 7 scissors (two pink scissors) to get a new level 12 mosiac.


Personally, I would always wait until I had a level 7 scissors + a pink camera or a level 7 camera to use on my level 13 mosiacs them because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of having level 11 mosiacs, but that's your choice if you would prefer to just use pink items when you get them. Just make sure you always have at least 1 level 12 mosiac after your level 13 turn in so you can keep replicating.

&nbsp;

**Energy** - The largest hurdle to overcome will be energy initially. Up until level 7 or 8, I was stuck using my 100 energy and then waiting for it to replenish naturally or buying more with gems. Do what you can, but I don't ever suggest buying 100 energy for more than 20 gems (and 10 gems max ideally).


The first opportunity to start building energy and being able to actually complete events will depend on where you are and what you're presented with:

* Any time you're presented with an opportunity to select 1-3 stars on an event, always pick 3 stars. The urgent delivery event wasn't worth it until later down the line (when you get the timers), but at least once it awarded a few thousand stars. If it awards a good 1k+ energy and you can complete it, go for it, but otherwise don't waste your time for the purple timers early on.
* The other event that you're presented with that gives a 1-3 star option (I don't recall the name) makes you complete 10 orders and the final order gives a large energy amount, as well as a very good amount of gems. If you see this order, use all your resources to complete it. It is the second best event in my opinion, and the one that initally got me off the ground.
* Finally, your gauraunteed best bet for achieving an energy surplus is the lawnmower/pickaxe event or the (very much less preferable) Lucky Nubi event with the slots. If you wait to turn in your first 13 star mosiac  until one of these events is active, you'll be rewarded with a ton of tokens to use on these events. This should be enough to push you through the rest of that event and give you a few thousand energy to work with.

&nbsp;

**Events** - You can do events whenever, but ideally you'll always want completely complete an event if possible. Finishing an event 80% of the way might mean you're missing out of 90% of the rewards.


* As mentioned, my most profitable event was always the lawnmower/pickaxe event solely because I could usually complete it with one to three mosiac turn ins with a huge payout (5k-10k energy and 500-1200 gems). This was because the only resources I needed to use were for completing order to try to trigger mosiacs (which I wanted to turn in anyway for stars). 


* Honorable mention to Lucky Nubi for the same reason, but not nearly as good as the lawnmower/pickaxe event. As a tip for Lucky Nubi, each time you complete it, you'll get a higher multiplier. First run is max 5x, second is max 20x, and third and beyond is 50x. Although the multiplier is higher, you'll also need more tokens to complete. I don't recommend ever clearing more than 3 times max.


* Second highest event for profitability, also as mentioned, was the 3 star event where you turn in 10 orders back to back, with a similar payout. The downside is you won't be turning in orders to trigger a new mosiac turn in, but the payoff is well worth it. 


* Race event was *okay*, but I would generally only compete heavily if I had an event like lucky nubi, where I was double dipping by getting tokens for another event, or the weekly event had a premium level 20 reward.


* Adventure events (where you have an entirely different board) I avoided entirely. The majority of awards only relate to that particular board, and I don't think stars carry over but I could be wrong.


* Weekly (every 5 days) events are almost always worth it once you get an energy surplus and some gems. Service Gurul seems to be worth it if you can get about 5 bonus presents on the bottom row for gems alone.


* The other weekly quests vary, but for the most part they're easy to get tons of extra presents -- my favorite reward was my first week when they gave a two gold chests per completion. **Always aim for first or second place in these events. It generally isn't too hard, and it's very worth it.**


* Lastly, the corgi match game -- I played it heavily the first week to get the rank 1 chest, and then never touched it again. I don't recommend spending on this event or wasting time on it after the first round, as boards keep getting harder and harder.

&nbsp;

**Event Times** - I noticed events pretty consistenly around when I would fall asleep (11PM-1AM) PST and around when I would wakeup (9AM-11AM PST). My theory is that if you don't play for a while, the game will throw an event at you. I don't have any hard evidence to back it up, but my best suggestion would be if you don't see an event, close the game completely and don't check again for 2+ hours. If you open and no event, repeat.

&nbsp;

**Items** - Probably obvious, but never use any item that isn't max level unless you have a good reason to. This includes:

* Chests
* Energy
* Stars
* Gems
* Batteries
* Bells
* Cameras
* Scissors


You could (and should) use cameras and scissors as needed to get your first level 13 mosiac, but after that, keep saving until you get pink/max rank. 

&nbsp;

**Storage** - Not completely necessary until around level 10, but I ended up buying 10 storage slots to hold my scissors/cameras. There was more than one time where I accidentally duplicated an unwanted item with a high level camera because I was trying to move it out of the way. Storing these in the storage eliminates that risk. It also clears board space, which can be a real life saver, and only ended up costing around 100 gems total.

&nbsp;

**Cooldowns** 

* Renovation/Sapphire - After a few cycles of small cooldowns (1 to 3 minutes) on the generators, you'll see a very long cooldown on both of these. It will be 
18 minutes for the renovation, and 35 for the sapphires. You can pay to speed them up at a rate of 1 gem per minute, but to build higher level items for these two, the time investment will be significantly higher without using gems.
* Organizer - 4 minute cooldown consistently. 
* Coffee Maker / Picnic - These are both very similar. Sometimes cooldowns can be 10 seconds, and sometimes they can be minutes. Regardless of how long they take, they'll always cost 1 gem to reset the cooldown

&nbsp;

**Bells** - Use bells exclusively on high cooldown generators. I used mine almost entirely on the sapphire generator, but the case could be made for the renovation generator as well.  See the section above for reasoning, but basically it's to maximize time efficiency. Try to save for when you really need, but don't stress about saving them if you're holding 3+.

&nbsp;

**Batteries** - Use as needed on whatever generator. No reason to save once they're max level, all the charges will get used eventually.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gem Usage** - My main tip will be always buy the 100 energy for 10 gems. I use that as an evaluation for if something else was worth it. For example, would I rather spend 500 energy on building this (and the time with cooldowns), or would I rather just spend 50 gems?


For the most part, I would use gems on very high level items from sapphire/renovation/organizer generators, simply for the time investment needed. The other thing I almost consistently used gems on were high level sand castles. I hated building those. For a fun fact, at around level 18, the cost for sandbox generator items goes down about half for some reason.

For kitchen/picnic generators, don't feel bad using 1 gem each time to reset the cooldown if you're impatient like me. These two generators were the majority of my energy usage because I would usually just build the high level items instead of buying them in the store with gems.

&nbsp;

**Mouse Game**

* Bronze/Silver - always finish if you have the gems for it. Almost always worth it and most of the time pays for itself with the gems you get back
* Gold - Usually worth it for the items you get, especially if you get cameras/scissors, but you can end up spending a lot of gems (500+) to complete. 
* Purple/Any that go past level 40 - Not worth it. 1000+ gem investment and not guaranteed to even get your gems worth. I would sometimes go up to level 20/25 on these, but even then sometimes they would charge 100+ gems even in the low levels. 

As an interesting note for the mouse game, not all things are treated equal, and your buyback will be reflective of some degree to what you've gotten so far. The bells are treated as a much higher gem value than cameras/scissors/batteries. Even one single blue bell in stage 1-4, and you could see an upwards of 100+ gems just to keep playing. The good news is that once you pay a high amount of gems to keep playing, the next few are usually pretty low (5-20 gems), but eventually it will go back up again.

My best advice for this game is if you get the bell early, consider stopping if you can't afford the high buyout. The second piece of advice is if you go on a run without hitting a mouse for a long time (7+), consider stopping early. The next time you hit a mouse, you'll certainly have to pay a very large amount of gems to keep playing (100+ at a minimum).

&nbsp;

**Cards** - Super random, don't ever go out of your way to buy packs. Just note that in the top left corner of the album page there's two cards with a refresh sign. If you click this, you can turn in your duplicates for more packs. My suggestion is to save until you have the max amount (800 for cards, 400 for puzzle pieces) to have a chance at getting a joker card/gold puzzle piece. The last few cards are the ones that take the longest, and the wild cards help so much.

&nbsp;

**Event Purchases** - Weekly passes (5 day) for the **main board** are almost always worth it. Don't get alternate board passes (like corgi match or separate board adventures). You'll want to make sure you complete the entire board, and have at least a few presents at the end for it to be worth it. You can buy at any time, so don't spend unless you can guarantee it will be worth.

&nbsp;

**Gem Purchases** - I bought one piggy bank in the beginning (it was nice for the start, but I don't recommend), one 5 dollar gem back (2x gem event) and one 21 dollar pack (2x gem event). 2x Gem events seem to come once a week or so from what I could tell. Gems make this game so much easier, but you need to spend wisely. Try to balance between using energy and gems as evenly as possible. Optimize for time efficiency and don't be lazy if you can and the amount of gems you get from this alone should carry you through.

All in all I spent 73 dollars, but buying the 21 dollar gem pack I should get 10 dollars back for the SwagBucks milestone, and the gems I bought from that pack were almost exactly what I needed to get from around level 14 to max level (150 gems remaining).

&nbsp;

**Summary**

The bad news is this game will definitely be a time sink, expect between 75-100 hours to complete. You'll also need to spend money -- without it you're not going to complete this offer. You need to be able to finish events to start building energy, and you need energy to progress. Without spending, it's just not possible. I would estimate 50 dollars or less is a good estimate if you're wanting to be frugal, or 100 dollars or less if you don't mind spending a little extra to save a couple dozen hours.

&nbsp;

I didn't achieve either of the bonus goals (level 8 in 3 days or 18 in 6 days), but I would imagine you'd be spending a bit more to achieve that. 18 in 6 days feels completely unattainable unless you're spending 200+ and playing 8 hours a day  with good events at a minimum. Even with that, I doubt it's a guarantee, so I wouldn't bother.

&nbsp;

The good news is it's actually quite a fun/addicting game surprisingly. Time and resource management, multiple events at once, hitting a mosiac turn in, completing a level, coming in first on a weekly event, all with a super relaxing soundtrack and satisfying sound effects / animations make this game strangely a pleasure to play. That said, I'm very happy to be done with it, as it was quite a large time investment.

&nbsp;

While this was my first SwagBucks offer, I have played games through tapjoy for in game rewards and the games weren't nearly as fun. The rewards also seemed somewhat reliant on luck. 

This offer is achievable and fair compared to those, which blows my mind looking at the payout.

&nbsp;

If you do end up going for this, you can complete it, as long as you're seeing similar star values per stage and similar payouts for mosiacs, and are willing to spend at least a little bit of money.

&nbsp;

And thank you to those who laid the path for my success with this offer. Specifically, huge thank you /u/kylemkv for his originally post and strategy. 

&nbsp;

This should be pretty all inclusive for this game, so I hope it helps answer any remaining questions for those trying to complete.",10,1733376349.0,SwagBucks,9,0.92,False

1h71rtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranciliosilvia/comments/1h71rtw/dialling_in_single_shots_basket_options/,Dialling in single shots... basket options?,"First of all yes, I know single shot is much more finnicky. But double shot is too wasteful for me, I can't tolerate so much caffeine and don't need a stockpile of cold coffee in my fridge. So I've just been struggling to dial in my single shots, and of course it's not going very well. The best tasting results I've had have been freakish flukes, for example a 10.5g dose : 33g pour that took about 7 seconds, which was equally confusing and frustrating. 

But generally, I keep ending up with coffee that tastes both sour and bitter and extracts either way too fast or way too slowly despite making only very small adjustments to dosage. I've got a few ideas for why this might be:
 - the shower head bolt is leaving an imprint in every puck and I suspect could be contributing to channelling.
 - the single shot basket only has openings for water to pass through at the centre, so water will tend to go through the centre of the puck more easily than the edges, resulting in uneven extraction. 
 - the single shot basket doesn't seem to provide enough resistance for a 25-30 second pour unless I stuff it full of way too much coffee, and even then it doesn't taste good.

Based on some comments I found I thought I'd try and address the first two points with a puck screen, to try and distribute the water more evenly. I'm not sure how much that will help in practice, but I've discovered I am not able to fit a puck screen in the stock single shot basket at all in the first place, even if the basket is otherwise completely empty. 

The single shot basket (unlike the double) is simply not deep enough to accommodate the shower head bolt and the puck screen. So I've looked at looking at getting a flat shower head bolt upgrade kit, but unfortunately pidsilvia seems to be closed over the holiday season so that idea is not gonna eventuate until next year some time. In the meantime I'd like to try other options, and to me it seems replacing the basket might be my best option. 

One that's a little bit deeper to accommodate the puck screen would probably be ideal, but other problems can be addressed here too. For example a single wall basket with slightly fewer holes, albeit spaced more evenly across the whole base of the basket instead of just the centre, might allow for more even water flow while also increasing the resistance somewhat.

I have also tried adding more resistance by switching to a double wall single shot basket I had kicking around (from an old machine), but it seems that it creates too much resistance, causing water to even squirt out the side sometimes. I guess this is because the second wall only has a single hole for water to pass through, and the Silvia outputs a bit too much pressure for the resistance created. Perhaps a double wall basket with a little bit less resistance would work better. 

Anyway that's probably more context and speculation than is necessary... the **tl;dr** is, does anyone have any recommendations for baskets or other tips that might offer more consistent single shot results? Australian stores preferable... my Silvia is a v6.",1,1733376004.0,ranciliosilvia,0,1.0,False

1h71qqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1h71qqj/the_christmas_caller_part_1/,The Christmas Caller - Part 1,"The booth smelled like stale coffee and cigarettes, a scent that clung to the aging equipment as much as it did to Sam’s sweater. The turntable, reel-to-reel tape machine, and rotary phone on the desk hummed softly under the dim light of a single desk lamp. Outside, snow piled high against the station’s windows, muffling the howling wind that rocked the small building. The only sounds inside were the faint tick of the wall clock and the soft crackle of static through Sam’s headphones.

It was Christmas Eve, 1971, and as the clock crept past 10 PM, the world outside the booth might as well not have existed.

Sam had been DJing in Crown Point, Indiana, for ten years. His soothing baritone was a familiar companion to commuters drifting in and out of the windy city. Before his time at the mic, Sam had served as a radio operator during the early stages of Vietnam. He was only seventeen when he was sent overseas, spending long nights on cold, rain-soaked watches in outposts that felt more like forgotten corners of the world. Although Sam never saw combat, being present in a theater of war left its mark.

Sam took a drag on his cigarette, tapping the ash into a yellowed tray by the mic, and adjusted his headphones. It was time to go live.

“Good evening, night owls, and merry Christmas Eve. You’re tuned in to KSLX, the voice of Crown Point, broadcasting live from the snow-covered heart of your holiday. This is Sam on the Late Shift, keeping you company as the clock ticks toward midnight. Whether you’re wrapping gifts, sipping cocoa, or just trying to stay warm, I’ll be here with you, spinning the hits and sharing your stories. Got a Christmas memory, a holiday tradition, or maybe just a little late-night cheer to spread? Give me a call at 555-1225, and let’s light up the airwaves together. The snow is falling, the wind is howling, and we’re here to keep the spirit bright. Let’s kick off the night with a classic. Here’s Bing Crosby with ‘White Christmas.’”

Sam sat back as the song filled the booth. His life felt oddly easy now, aside from the isolation. He still felt connected to the town and its people, a comfort he had longed for since his unwelcome return from the war ten years ago. He was thirty-five now, and though he hadn’t let himself go soft like some of the men he served with, he still felt age creeping in. During breaks, he would do pushups or pullups in the doorway, keeping himself sharp.

As “White Christmas” faded out, Sam picked up the phone for the first call of the night.

“Hello, you’ve reached KSLX. Please give me your name and what you’d like to talk about.”

“Hi, my name is Kathy,” a woman said, her voice warm but trembling slightly, “and I’d like to talk about my son coming back to me from Vietnam.”

Sam smiled. “That’s wonderful, Kathy. We’ll be live in a moment, so I’ll give a short intro, and then you can share your story.”

He patched Kathy in and leaned into the mic. “That was Bing Crosby with ‘White Christmas,’ a timeless classic. Up next, we have Kathy on the line with a story about her son’s return from overseas. Kathy, go ahead.”

“Thank you, Sam. And bless you for spending your nights keeping everyone company on cold nights like these. My boy just came back from Walter Reed in D.C. after losing both his legs. We have a lot of challenges ahead, but this holiday season, I’m just thankful he’s home and alive.”

Sam’s throat tightened. “I’m so sorry to hear that, Kathy. Please thank your son for his service and sacrifices. I know it isn’t easy for folks coming home right now, but you should be proud of him. Merry Christmas to you both.”

“Thank you, Sam,” Kathy said, her voice thick with tears. “Merry Christmas.”

Sam ended the call and leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. He lit another cigarette, letting the music fill the silence while he shook off the weight of Kathy’s story.

The next call was lighter. A man named Mike reminisced about his grandmother’s Christmas cookies and how important they were to his family’s holiday traditions. Sam welcomed the change in tone and shared a laugh with the caller before moving on to a set of seasonal classics.

The phone rang again, and Sam picked it up with a practiced rhythm. “Hello, you’ve reached KSLX. What’s your name and what’s your story?”

“Can I dedicate ‘Blue Christmas’ by Elvis Presley?” the caller asked, their voice a little unsteady.

“Sure, buddy. What’s the dedication?” Sam asked.

The line went silent for a moment before the caller said, “To the recently divorced.”

The line clicked dead before Sam could respond. His shoulders stiffened as irritation bubbled to the surface.

“Goddamn it,” he muttered, leaning back in his chair. He hated prank calls, especially ones like this. Being a public figure in a small town came with its share of baggage, and after Joanne left him five months ago, his divorce was practically public property. Everyone had something to say about it.

Sam sighed, tapping his fingers on the desk. Joanne had been his wife for nine years, but he hadn’t been heartbroken when she left. Joanne had always been practical, even calculating, and their marriage had felt more like an expectation than a partnership. She’d walked out with a man from Chicago, and the only thing that surprised Sam was that it had taken her so long.

Still, the prank had struck a nerve. He shook it off and leaned into the mic. “Alright, folks, up next is Elvis Presley with ‘Blue Christmas.’ And to whoever that joker was, Merry Christmas to you too.”

The song ended, and the phone rang again. Sam hoped for another lighthearted caller, but the voice on the line immediately set him on edge.

“Hi, Sam,” the voice said, smooth and calm. “My name is Jack, and I’d like to share a Christmas love story.”

Sam forced himself to smile as he spoke into the mic. “Alright, Jack. We’re live in three... two... one. Welcome back, night owls. I have Jack on the line with a Christmas love story. Go ahead, Jack.”

Jack’s tone was conversational, almost hypnotic. “It was December 1963 at the town hall Christmas party. I met her at the bake sale table. We hit it off right away.”

Sam leaned closer to the mic, nodding along. “Sounds like a magical night.”

“It was. We skated on Lemon Lake and had dinner in Chicago. But the drive home was when I really fell in love.”

Sam smiled. “What happened then?”

Jack paused, letting the silence stretch. “I pretended my car was having trouble. I pulled over, popped the hood, and asked her to hold my flashlight. When she came around, I smashed her jaw with it.”

Sam froze, his blood turning cold. “What?”

Jack’s voice didn’t waver. “Her blood on the snow was beautiful. I couldn’t stop myself. I hit her again and again.”

Sam yanked the call off the air, his hands trembling. He sat in stunned silence, his mind racing. Was this a prank? It had to be. But Jack’s voice lingered in his head, calm and unshaken. He took a shaky breath and leaned back into the mic.

“Apologies for the interruption, folks. We seem to have had a prank call. Let’s not let that spoil the evening. Here’s Judy Garland with ‘Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.’”

The warm, nostalgic tones of Judy Garland’s “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” filled the booth, but Sam couldn’t relax. Jack’s voice, smooth and calm, had burrowed into his mind, twisting his thoughts like a knife. He crushed the spent cigarette in the ashtray, then lit another with shaky hands. He needed the sharp edge of nicotine to keep himself steady.

The phone rang again. Sam stared at it, the shrill sound cutting through the music like a warning. He hesitated, his hand hovering over the receiver. For the first time in ten years, he considered letting the line go dead. But he couldn’t. Not as long as he had a job to do. He grabbed the phone and brought it to his ear.

“This is Sam with KSLX,” he said, his voice strained but steady. “Who’s calling?”

“You hung up on me, Sam,” Jack said, his tone as smooth as silk, tinged with mock disappointment. “That wasn’t very polite.”

Sam gritted his teeth. “What do you want now? You got your sick story on the air. Isn’t that enough?”

Jack chuckled softly. “Oh, Sam, we’re just getting started. Let me back on, and I’ll tell you something truly unforgettable.”

Before Sam could respond, a faint, muffled scream crackled through the line. His heart dropped into his stomach, cold and heavy.

“Jack, what the hell are you doing?” Sam demanded, his voice rising with anger and panic.

“Let me back on the air,” Jack said, his tone measured and calm. “You don’t want me to get impatient.”

Sam’s free hand trembled as he reached for the mic switch. His instincts screamed at him to hang up and call the police, but something deep down told him it wouldn’t matter. Jack wasn’t bluffing. He flipped the switch and leaned into the mic.

“All right, night owls, we’ve got Jack back on the line,” Sam said, forcing a neutral tone for the listeners. “He says he has more to share, so let’s see where this goes. Jack, you’re live.”

“Thank you, Sam,” Jack said, slipping back into his unsettlingly conversational tone. “Let’s take a trip back to 1966. My fifth kill. By then, I’d perfected the basics: finding them, charming them, ending them. But Christine... she taught me something new. She taught me how much I love the chase.”

Sam stared at the controls, his stomach churning. Every instinct told him to cut Jack off, but he stayed frozen. He needed to hear this. Maybe Jack would slip up, give something away.

“Her name was Christine,” Jack continued, his tone almost nostalgic. “I met her at a diner off the highway. She was waiting tables, and she had this laugh that could light up the whole room. I waited until her shift ended, then offered her a ride home. She hesitated at first, but I convinced her. I’ve always been good at convincing people.”

Sam swallowed hard, his voice tight when he spoke. “What happened next?”

“I took her off the main road,” Jack said, his voice steady, almost soft. “She got nervous, asked me to stop. She tried to open the door, but I had already locked it. That’s when I saw it. The fear. It was beautiful. I pulled over and unlocked the door. I let her run.”

“You let her go?” Sam’s voice cracked with disbelief.

“No, Sam. I let her think she had a chance. The snow was fresh, the night was quiet, and her footsteps were easy to follow. She stumbled in the drifts, crying and begging, but I didn’t rush. I savored it. That’s when I realized the kill isn’t the climax. It’s the pursuit.”

“You’re sick,” Sam said, his voice trembling with anger and disgust.

Jack chuckled softly. “You’re not wrong. When I finally caught up to her, she was so tired she could barely stand. I made it quick. Even I have my moments of mercy.”

Sam leaned back in his chair, his stomach twisting into knots. He reached for another cigarette and lit it with trembling hands. “Is that it? Are you done now?”

Jack’s tone sharpened. “Not quite, Sam. Let’s talk about Joanne.”

The words hit Sam like a punch to the gut. His ex-wife’s name hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. His hand froze halfway to his mouth, the cigarette shaking between his fingers.

“What did you just say?” Sam asked, his voice low and dangerous.

“Joanne,” Jack repeated, dragging out the name as if savoring it. “Lovely woman. She says hello.”

A cry for help came through the line, faint but unmistakable. Sam’s stomach dropped.

“You son of a bitch,” Sam growled, his voice breaking with rage. “If you hurt her, I swear to God.”

“Relax, Sam,” Jack said, his tone light, almost teasing. “She’s fine. For now. But her night depends on you. Keep me on the air, and she stays alive. Cut me off again, and... well, let’s not find out.”

Sam stubbed out his cigarette with a trembling hand, his mind racing. Every option he considered led to the same conclusion. He had no choice.

“Fine,” Sam said through gritted teeth. “You’re still on.”

“That’s the spirit,” Jack said smoothly. “Let’s make this a Christmas to remember.”

1h71os2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h71os2/things_that_kept_me_overweight/,Things that kept me overweight,"I'm very well into my weight loss journey. I've since lost 18kgs/39lbs, and here's a few things I realised was holding me back. 


- Drinking liquid calories. I'd often indulge in frappes, iced coffee, tall glasses of fruit juices, high calorie smoothies and sodas. I didn't realise just how many calories I was taking in by drinking them. I just assumed that they ""didn't count"". 


- Not measuring out my carbs. I would pile my plates high with white rice and pasta. I'd often have multiple slices of white bread with lunch and dinner, too. Carbs aren't evil. It's just good to be aware of how much you're eating. 


- Eating a copious amounts of nuts and trail mix. An actual serving is tiny. I was eating this stuff by the hanful. It adds up quick. 


- Severely restricting certain types of food. Yes, when you're dieting, you might cut back on certain types of food. But I found banning it completely was a recipe for disaster. Forbidden fruit is sweetest, and when you start, you can't stop. 


- Being extremely sedentary. My medication makes me very tired, so I stopped getting my walks in. My medication also makes me hungry, so I was eating more, and moving less. My walks were always an effort, so I stopped. But anything worth while takes effort, and once I was on the walk, I felt much better. 


- Adding way too much oil and butter to my dinners. A little bit is fine. It's flavour and nutrients. I was using a TON of butter and oil, more than I needed. These guys can catch up to you quick! 


- Believing that just because a food is ""healthy"", that it can't possibly make me gain weight. Looking at you nuts and avocado! 


- Eating after 8pm. I try to finish my dinner/any snacks I have before 8pm. I've noticed I only ever eat things like chocolate and chips after 8pm. It's never good food. 


- Sneaking little bites here and there while I was making lunch and dinner. Sure, it's a little bit, but I'd have 5-6 spoons or a handful of pasta/rice before I'd even started dinner. 


- Eating out of an open packet. For me, it's a recipe for disaster. I'd regularly finish a big bag of chips or skittles when I ate out the packet. Pouring a portion into the bowl keeps me under control. 


- Constantly snacking. I used to be a big snacker. Nothing wrong with snacking, but back in the day, I'd eat entire tins, containers and bags of snack foods. Now my snacks are fruit or protein.


- Not practicing mindful eating. Slowing down, using all my senses to enjoy my food, and stopping between bites to assess how full I am has been a life saver. I also tend to enjoy my food more this way.


- Not prioritising whole foods and protein. Protein keeps you full. When I make protein a priority, I tend to snack less. Whole foods also up my nutrients and are also quite filling, plus they make me feel good! 


- Loading everything up with a crap ton of cheese. I'm a vegetarian. We love cheese. I'd add cheese to EVERYTHING, and a lot of it! Soups, chilli's, spaghetti, bread, you name it, I did it. It's ok to enjoy cheese! But I was flying through 1kg blocks.


- Emotional eating. This is a big one for me. I still struggle with emotional eating. It's easy to get stuck in the loop. I just remind myself that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, and it makes me feel worse after. I've exchanged it for going on a nice walk, or writing in my diary, having a chat with loved ones, or watching a movie. It still happens occasionally, but I used to do this everyday.

I am AFAB non-binary and looking for gender neutral however leaning more masc scents! I’m also not opposed to more feminine scents. Honestly the gender label doesn’t bother me, the scent notes are more important. I already have a basic, cheaper perfume (01 by The Good Scent) I got not too long ago to begin my experimentation. 

I have done some smelling and figured out my general vibe/preference. I like notes that are warm but not overly sweet or cloying (vanilla, musk, amber), woody/earthy (oud, cedar, sandalwood, vetiver, coffee), with some warm spices and citrus to cut through! 

However, I don’t like super strong spices like some peppers. Tobacco and leather are iffy, as long as it doesn’t smack me in the face. Florals are not a huge interest but I do like lavender and some other subtle florals.

I don’t know if I’ve got something or is genuinely lazy. So I’ve noticed that I often struggle with focusing and things like that. For example if I was to force myself to do work/task that I need to complete then it wouldn’t work, even if I put my phone/distractions away. I would either start getting overwhelmed with thoughts/driving myself crazy in my head. I would often relate one thing to another and get distracted really easily, for example if I was originally going to go grab a coffee I might end up making a whole meal and stuff.
I hop from topic to topic in my head and sometimes in real life as well

I have drastic mood swings that could change within 10 minutes. For example being overly excited or suddenly depressed

I forget things easily even if I’ve tried to make an effort to remember I just can’t for some reason

I struggle with reading and find it hard to read complicated books with small words

I find it hard to follow instructions properly and get overwhelmed/mixed up with the understanding and comprehension of things. For example if someone was to give me a lot of instructions at once without explaining what each one is I would guaranteed 100 percent mess up. I need every step to be laid out for me to understand before moving on. What happens is I tend to either over complicate/skip certain parts and mix things up

I put off things even as simple as getting ready for bed. I even procrastinate things I like doing. 

Not sure if this is symptoms of ADHD but several people I’ve talked to have brought this up just noticing my habits and speaking to me. 
Maybe I’m just slow 😬

Introduction to Dog Breath: The Silent Foe
------------------------------------------

As any dog owner will tell you, there's nothing quite like the love and companionship of a furry friend. But let's be honest—there's also nothing quite like the shock of a dog's bad breath hitting you out of nowhere! You may find yourself asking, ""Is that really my dog's breath?"" While dogs are notoriously known to have a unique aroma, foul-smelling breath can be a sign of dental issues or other health problems. Luckily, there’s a silver lining: dog treats that help with bad breath can not only freshen up that stinky breath but also contribute to overall oral health.

In this article, we’ll explore various types of dog treats designed to combat bad breath, delve into why oral hygiene is crucial for your pet, and share some tips on how to keep your canine companion's breath so fresh it could rival a spring morning. So grab a cup of coffee (or tea) and let’s dive into the world of pooch-friendly dental delights!

### Why Does Your Dog Have Bad Breath?

Before we get into the delicious details about dog treats that help combat bad breath, let’s first understand what causes that unpleasant odor. A dog's breath can become nasty for several reasons:

- **Poor Dental Hygiene**: Just like humans, dogs can suffer from plaque buildup, leading to gum disease and bad breath.
- **Diet Issues**: Certain foods can contribute to unpleasant breath, such as low-quality kibble or excessive treats.
- **Health Problems**: Sometimes, bad breath can be a sign of an underlying health issue, including diabetes, kidney disease, or gastrointestinal problems.

Knowing the root causes can empower you to tackle the issue head-on. After all, prevention is better than cure!

### What Are Dog Treats That Help With Bad Breath?

So what are these marvelous dog treats that help with bad breath? In simple terms, they’re specifically crafted snacks formulated to not just satisfy your pup’s taste buds but also to freshen up their breath and promote oral health. Let's explore the different types of these treats, how they work, and why they might become your new best friend in canine care.

#### 1. Chew Treats

Chew treats serve a dual purpose: they satisfy your dog’s urge to chew while also working to scrape away plaque and tartar. As your pup chomps down, the texture of the treat can help clean their teeth.

**Popular Options:**

- **Dental Chews**: These often come in fun shapes and flavors, designed to be chewy and can come infused with breath-freshening ingredients like chlorophyll or baking soda.
- **Rawhide Bones**: While they can be controversial due to choking hazards, rawhide can help reduce plaque when chewed properly.

Just make sure to supervise your furry friend as they munch away so they don't swallow too much too quickly!

#### 2. Crunchy Treats

Think of crunchy treats as nature's toothbrush for dogs. They can create a similar effect as brushing, as the crunching action works to clean teeth and gums.

**Examples Include:**

- **Biscuits**: Many brands offer specially formulated biscuits loaded with mint, parsley, or other ingredients renowned for combating bad breath.
- **Kibble Alternatives**: High-quality dry food can sometimes perform double duty. Some brands add dental benefits to their kibbles specifically to target breath freshness.

When selecting these treats, look out for wholesome ingredients that don’t skimp on flavor. Your pup deserves something delightful!

#### 3. Functional Treats

Functional treats take things a step further by combining good nutrition with breath-freshening agents.

**Ingredients to Look For:**

- **Coconut Oil**: Known for its antimicrobial properties, coconut oil can help in maintaining fresh breath.
- **Green Tea Extract**: This ingredient has antibacterial properties and can neutralize odors.
- **Baking Soda**: Commonly used in toothpaste, it can help buffer acids and whiten teeth.

These treats not only put a smile on your dog’s face but also do wonders for their oral health!

#### 4. Homemade Treats

If you're feeling the creative itch, why not craft some homemade dog treats? With a few simple ingredients and a pinch of love, you can whip up delicious treats that will keep your furry friend's breath fresh.

**Simple Recipe: Parsley Mint Dog Treats**

- **Ingredients**: Oats, parsley, mint, vegetable broth, and egg.
- **Instructions**:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Mix all ingredients to form a dough.
3. Roll out and cut into fun shapes.
4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden.

You'll not only be keeping your pup healthy but also knowing exactly what goes into their treats.

### Ingredients That Fight Bad Breath

Understanding which ingredients offer the best breath-freshening benefits can guide your choices when selecting store-bought treats or whipping up your own recipes. Here are some must-have ingredients that can help keep bad breath at bay:

- **Mint**: Known for its strong aromatic properties, mint is a natural deodorizer.
- **Parsley**: Acts as a natural breath freshener and helps neutralize odors.
- **Coconut Oil**: Besides being tasty, it contains lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties.
- **Carrots**: Crunchy and nutritious, carrots can keep your dog entertained while cleaning their teeth.

These naturally derived ingredients offer a win-win situation—keeping your dog healthy while ensuring their breath stays pleasant.

### Tips for Maintaining Your Dog's Oral Health

Now that we’ve covered some fantastic dog treats that help with bad breath, it’s time to brush up on some additional oral care tips. After all, treats alone won’t do the trick if they aren’t paired with a solid routine.

#### Regular Teeth Brushing

You heard me right! Just like you wouldn’t skip your own dental hygiene, your dog needs it too. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush designed for dogs along with toothpaste made specifically for them. Aim for brushing at least 2-3 times a week to keep plaque and tartar at bay.

#### Vet Check-ups

Just as you schedule regular check-ups for yourself, your dog needs the same attention. Dental exams during vet visits can catch potential problems early. Ask your vet for recommendations about dental care products and treatments tailored for your dog’s needs.

#### Chew Toys

Incorporating chew toys like rubber bones or dental sticks in your dog's playtime routine keeps their teeth engaged while also satisfying their need to chew. Look for durable options that can hold up to vigorous chewing.

### Signs Your Dog May Need a Dental Check-Up

While regular vet visits are essential, it’s equally crucial to stay alert for signs that something might be amiss with your dog’s dental health. Keep an eye out for:

1. Persistent bad breath despite using treats
2. Difficulty eating or chewing
3. Red or swollen gums
4. Loose or missing teeth
5. Excessive drooling

If you notice any of these signs, it's wise to consult your vet sooner rather than later to prevent further complications.

### Conclusion: A Fresh Smile Awaits

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

The conversation slowly fizzling out until the username is nothing more than a tombstone for what used to be. 

Hopefully we are both looking for the same thing. That spark of mutual interest; or at least a desire to get to know eachother, that may hopefully lead to a lasting acquaintancship.

That's a strange way to start a post about friends. But here we are and you have made it this far so, there's that.
The small talk section of these is always a slog; so I'll get it out of the way as quick as I can. 

The basics: I'm open to chatting with anyone! I'm 31 and out on the West Coast of the United States. I am married but currently my wife works nights so I am adjusting to the empty quietness around my house. I like all the things most like including watching a variety of genres of shows and movies and delving into podcasts, mainly No Such Thing as a Fish and Last Podcast on the Left but Lore squeaks in every now and then; especially in the fall. I also like my coffee black and my beer cold.

The fun stuff: I'm somewhwhere between enthusiastic and deepy passionate about music, photography and this wild and wonderful world of ours. I have also dove headfirst back into reading regularly and have been greatly enjoying traveling down that road; especially when work finds me on the road. 

Other stuff about me: I'm a mediocre photographer at best, although it is quite fun, and a biologist by trade. In another life I probably would have spent some time as a vagabond searching for something with nothing but my car and my camera. But life is infact not an indie coming of age movie.

I am a sucker for hearing people's stories; and love to meet new people. I also think you can really get a good idea of someone based on their music; more specifically how they describe themselves with a selection of songs. So if you're inclined send me 3 songs that scream you. 

If you want to talk about damn near anything I'm your man. Fun facts, lame jokes and discussions on the paranormal will always earn bonus points in my book. But those can also be earned in many many other ways.",1,1733374426.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
1h719ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1h719ts/safely_controlling_a_coffee_roaster_from_an/,Safely controlling a coffee roaster from an Arduino,"https://preview.redd.it/0jo4jihfky4e1.png?width=2318&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdef31e47bc07321f8a0320eefd81325875d4962

Hi all, I'm hoping to get some advice on how to safely proceed on a passion project. I am trying to modify a pretty popular coffee roaster (FreshRoast SR800) so I can control it from my computer where I currently log temperature data. Unfortunately, I didnt study as an EE, so I've been trying to move through this project slowly. After learning more about how this power supply works, Im especially happy I didnt end up seriously electrocuting myself. (I'm sure plenty of comments would simply be ""if you dont know enough to do this safely, you shouldnt do it at all..."" which... fair!)

  
What I really need is help deciding if there is a safe way to keep experimenting with this project. 

  
The basic way the roaster works is to use TRIACs to control the fan speed (resistive coil for voltage drop --> bridge rectifier --> 30V DC motor) and the heating element (resistive coil). The control is clunky and not very fine grained. 

  
The roaster is split into a power board that houses the TRIACs (and the optotriacs that do the actual triggering), a capactive drop -> bridge rectifier to generate 12V, and a LM368 to generate a zero crossing signal. The 12V and the 0-x go to a logic board that then takes user inputs via a rotary dial and sets the TRIAC firing delay. The optotriacs supplied from the 12V supply, and triggered by a transistor on the logic board connecting them to ground through a 1k resistor. 

  
I had just gotten to the point where I had successfully measured the delay times at various temperature and fan settings, and used an arduino analog pin to read the 0-x data. I was able to successfully set consistent delays after zero-crossing and trigger a MOSFET when desired. I also was able to send serial commands to the arduino to change that delay, which was tantalizingly close. I was just starting to try triggering the optotriacs, but nothing seemed to be happening when I did.

  
At some point I came back to working on things and realized I had lost my zero-x signal, and that the power board was no longer producing 12V. In trying to learn more about how to diagnose what might have been going on with the capacitive drop power supply, I learned about how dangerous those circuits are, and how under the right failure modes (although I'm a bit unclear as to what those are) they could expose the arduino, my computer, and most importantly, ME, to 120V AC.  I dont necessarily intend to do much diagnosing of the capacitive drop circuit, but I might consider buying another sacrificial roaster to experiment with.

So, again,  my question is: is there a safe way to proceed?

I would likely want to have the arduino plugged into my computer for the simplest serial connection. Would it be sufficient to have the arduino isolated from the zerox signal by an optoisolator? And, similarly, putting those in between the arduino and the MOSFETs used to control the optotriacs?

  
Thanks for the advice, and I am preparing myself for the (likely reasonable) safety lectures. ",3,1733374336.0,ElectricalEngineering,0,0.81,False

1h718ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1h718ky/windows_mightve_nuked_linux_please_help/,Windows might've nuked Linux - please help!!!,"Hi!!! So recently I decided to install Linux Mint onto my External Hard drive so I could dip my toes in the water and see how it went.

While nice at first, I noticed that installing it to said hard drive was a bad endeavor - the installation was incredibly slow and was really putting the strain onto the poor thing (Or at least I think so - it was beeping a lot which I can only assume is a distress code). Nonetheless I pressed on.

I attempted later to install KDE Plasma onto the disk and after maybe 20-30 minutes of waiting for it to install, I tried to just forget the whole thing and see what I could do about it later. But I noticed that I couldn't click on anything - I could move my mouse, but nothing would respond to my input - so I ultimately decided to force a shutdown and reboot into Windows so I could maybe set up a partition on my SSD and put Linux there instead.

That seemed to be a mistake though - as when I tried to boot into Windows, All I seemed to get was a blank screen. Furthermore, when I rebooted the system without the ext. hdd plugged in, it popped up with a Grub Rescue terminal, stating:

    error: no such device: b278e6f9-70fb-492d-84d7-4a6a1a906956.
    error: unknown filesystem.
    Entering rescue mode...
    grub rescue>

And from there I could enter commands into the terminal. It's worth noting regardless of what I booted into - whether it be the SSD on my pc or the external hard drive - I would get the same result on both - a black screen if the hard drive was plugged in, and a grub terminal if it wasn't.

From there I consulted a friend who was more experienced in Linux than I. She tried to have me exit the terminal first using ""`exit`"", but I got ""error: unknown command"" returned to me - same with ""`boot`"", and it seemed any other attempts at commands yielded the exact same issue. The only commands that *seemed* to work were ""`set root=(hd0,msdos1)`"" which seemed to do nothing but didn't give me an error code - and ""`ls`"" which returned 

    (hd0) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos2) (hd1,msdos1) (hd2) (hd2,msdos1)

(It's probably worth noting now that there are three drives on my PC - the SSD which I primarily used and I can only assume Windows was installed on, the external hard drive which I installed Linux on, and a third HDD which I only really used to store my games).  
So nothing worked really - so my friend had a look at the Linux forums and apparently windows might've fucked my installation??? Which is odd. The forum suggested I use `sudo fdisk -l`, so I live booted from the flash drive and ran the command, and here were the results:

I'm not sure exactly how useful either blocks of information are, but there they are in case they're important.

Back to my efforts, my friend suggested I use Gparted to try and mount the partitions - but when I opened the program it just wouldn't let me mount either at all. Finally, my friend suggested we use `sudo upgrade-mint` to try and upgrade mint to get the previously non-functional commands to work. I ran it, and it returned

    /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of '/cow'

And that stopped our efforts dead in our tracks. I was thinking of just installing Linux onto my SSD and working from there, but I wanted to hear from more familiar people than my friend and I. Any assistance is appreciated.

So I already live in China working in an education company but I miss studying and I plan to do an MA. I don’t think admissions will be an issue; I am an oxbridge graduate and won scholarships during my BA so i’m hoping i’m eligible for a full MA scholarship. Fingers crossed! However, I REALLY don’t want to live on campus. I’m currently living alone in Guangzhou and love my freedom, I can’t imagine going back to residential halls. I’m aware that the stipend may not cover private accommodation but i’m willing to take the risk. 

So, can anybody recommend good neighbourhoods in Beijing that aren’t too far from Tsinghua? I’m completely unfamiliar with Beijing. Anywhere with access to coffee shops, maybe a park, and not too far to university. Again, i’m currently living in Guangzhou which is a very green city so maybe I need to lower my expectations. I’m not planning to apply until i’ve completed my work experience so I have a while to think about it.

I'll be hosting Silent Reading Party on Sunday 12/8 in Mountain View 📚,"Hope some people still remember me. I had a hobby project meeting two strangers every week over coffee in this subreddit last year. From last week, I've been visiting the Bay Area. In the past few days, I met my old good coffee friends and had so much fun at my old good places. Before I return back to SoCal next week, I'm planning to gather some of my coffee friends and some good strangers for *Silent Reading Party* on Sunday 12/8. 

**Coffee with Strangers?**

It's been almost two years since I started enjoying coffee with strangers. In the meantime, I had some big unexpected events that I changed my job and moved down to SoCal. But you know what, I still meet strangers over coffee. It's been less often than before, but I still do it. 

Long story short, in 2023, after I met 26 people in three months, I got a long waitlist that are incredibly growing fast. I already had over 150 people and somehow I got people from everywhere. Literally, eveerywhere, out of CA, and out of United States. My 26th stranger and I thought what if we make a community to help more people to join our coffee fun time with strangers. That's how we started Around The Corner ([www.aroundthecorner.today](http://www.aroundthecorner.today/?ref=rcc)) January 2024 this year. After I moved down to SoCal, it continued growing to have 1900 people across California. I still think it's unbelievable that I made this happen.

**Silent Reading Party, This Sunday, 12/8**

It's a social gathering like a book club, but you bring your own book and having some quiet reading time together. We have some social time afterwards, but we enjoy the low-key and don't force people to talk or be cheerful. I was very fortunate to have a good chat with The Ameswell Hotel and they helped me host a low-cost event at their venue. 

📅 When: Sunday 12/8, 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM

📍 Where: The Ameswell Hotel

🎫 Participation: $5 + minimum one drink purchase per person

If you would like to join us, you can [RSVP here](https://www.aroundthecorner.today/?event=the_1st_silent_reading_party_-_the_ameswell_hotel-_mountain_view_event_dec_08_24). I hope to see you on Sunday. Good night!",7,1733374129.0,bayarea,1,0.82,False

So far, everyone seems to like me—at least I think so. Especially the front desk lady. One morning, I brought her some coffee just as a nice gesture, and ever since, she’s been telling the higher-ups to keep me around, haha. I’ve passed all the necessary tests to get re-certified, and there are just a couple of things left before I can finally get out in the field, get my hands dirty, and start making money again.

That said, I still catch myself thinking about my old job sometimes, and it’s never anything good. I’m relieved to be away from certain people who negatively impacted my work and personal life, but the thought of seeing them in public makes me anxious. I wonder what they might be telling others about me—maybe about how different I was, or how my supervisor once described me as “odd,” with a fellow employee agreeing. It’s just little things like that that stick in my mind.

Lately, though, the binge eating has been harder to control. Everything was going well for about a month, but then Thanksgiving hit. I thought it would just last a day or two, but I haven’t slowed down. It’s getting to the point where my stomach hurts during binges, and it’s hard to stop.

On a brighter note, I’m close to paying off some debts, including my truck. Things are looking up, and I feel incredibly lucky to have secured a new job so quickly.

Why am I the way that I am? 🙂

P.S. I love East Texas. I hate it sometimes too, but I’ll probably die here, and I’m okay with that. 😌",3,1733373997.0,EastTexas,4,0.81,False
1h715qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h715qp/dont_install_the_dreamshare_app_youll_never_wake/,"Don’t Install the DreamShare App, You’ll Never Wake Up","Alright, let me start with this: I’m not here to rant about technology or preach about privacy or whatever. I’m not even here to convince you not to download *DreamShare*—I know most of you probably already have it. But if you haven’t…well, you might want to hear me out.

When I first got *DreamShare*, I thought I’d found the best thing to ever happen to humanity. Imagine this: your own custom dreamscape. You could do *anything.* See the people you miss, fly through cities, and live out scenes from your favorite movies. No laws of physics, no limits. It was like they took lucid dreaming and cranked it up to a hundred, only with friends and strangers alike joining in. And trust me, at first, it was just as amazing as it sounds.

My friend Aaron, my roommate, was actually the one who convinced me to try it. He’d been beta-testing it for a couple of months, back when you needed a neural link implant to even get access. By the time I signed up, *DreamShare* had gone public, with brain-computer interfaces becoming as common as earbuds. They even had this slogan, *”Escape the mundane, create the dream of your life.”*

So, like everyone else, I jumped in. I’ll admit, I was nervous the first night. You know that feeling when you’re about to fall asleep, and your mind gets all jumpy, like it’s resisting? Multiply that by a thousand. But Aaron reassured me that the app was safe—secure servers, encrypted data, limited access. And hey, who doesn’t trust their best friend, right?

The first night was unforgettable. I chose this fantasy city from the app’s “Shared Realities” selection—a glittering skyline, with skyscrapers as tall as mountains. The AI helped me adjust the details so that when I stepped into it, I felt the grit of asphalt under my feet and smelled the city air. Aaron appeared next to me like magic, all set to guide me through. We spent hours flying over buildings, racing down empty streets, laughing ourselves breathless. It felt *real,* more real than anything I’d felt in a long time. For the first time in years, I didn’t want to wake up.

Pretty soon, it was our nightly ritual. Aaron and I would dive in, exploring the pre-built worlds or designing our own. I brought in a few other friends too. Talia—she was a friend I’d always felt this unspoken connection with, you know? And being in those dreamscapes together…it was *different*. No inhibitions, no awkward pauses. We could be *anyone* we wanted.

That’s how *DreamShare* pulls you in. It gives you this perfect, untouchable reality and lets you think it’s yours. Like I said, at first, it was everything the ads promised. But there’s always a catch, isn’t there? You get a taste of the good stuff right from the get-go, and before you know it, you’re in too deep and addicted. And at that point, you’ll do anything to keep that dopamine flowing—and *they* know it.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I don’t know exactly when things started going wrong, but I remember the first hint of it. We were in this underwater world that Aaron and I had created, swimming through these sprawling coral forests, when I felt someone watching me—someone I didn’t know. I brushed it off, chalking it up to paranoia. After all, it was just me, Aaron, and Talia that night. The settings were private, set to “Friends Only.” At least, that’s what I *thought*.

Then, out of nowhere, I spotted this other guy. A shadowy figure, hovering just at the edge of my vision. At first, I thought he was some strange digital artifact. But then he started moving—swimming around me, watching with this unnatural calm.

“Hey, Aaron,” I called, but he was too far off to hear me.

I swam toward the figure, trying to get a closer look. As I got closer, I realized that he was staring right at me. And that look…it wasn’t just some generic dream character’s blank stare. It was like he *knew* me, like he could see into every part of my mind. I felt this surge of discomfort, even *fear*, which was strange—I’d never been scared in a *DreamShare* environment before. I’d had my fair share of authentic nightmares growing up, sure, but nothing I dreamt naturally ever felt quite as real as what the app produced.

The guy just stood there, watching, waiting. I opened my mouth to yell something at him, but then he was gone. Just like that. One second, he was there; the next, the water was empty. I scanned around, searching the entire coral forest. Nothing. By the time I found Aaron again, I’d convinced myself it was nothing, just a glitch in the app.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had intruded on us. Aaron laughed it off, saying I’d probably imagined it. “*DreamShare* is new tech, man,” he said. “Bugs are normal. I’m sure they’ll work out the kinks eventually.” But I couldn’t forget the way that figure had stared at me. The kind of look that haunts you, that doesn’t just vanish when you wake up.

That incident alone should have been enough to make me reconsider using the app, but *DreamShare* was too addictive by then. Each night, I’d tell myself I’d take a break. Instead, every night, I’d give in to temptation, slip on the neural link, and jump back in.

I don’t know exactly how to describe what happened next, but I started noticing little things. Friends mentioned stuff from my dreams that I hadn’t told them about. People laughed at things I was pretty sure were private memories. It started to feel like everyone knew my secrets, like I was walking around with every embarrassing moment tattooed on my skin.

Then, one day at work, my boss pulled me aside and said, “Evan, that dream where you sang in front of your fifth-grade class in pajamas? *Hilarious*, man. I’ve never seen anyone nail *Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star* with so much passion.” I played along and laughed it off, but inside, I was screaming. How the hell did he know about that? That was a memory I hadn’t actively thought about in *years*—something I’d only relived in a dream a few nights ago.

I brought it up to Aaron that night, but he brushed me off. “Privacy settings must be messed up,” he said. “You probably need to reinstall it.” But I’d already tried that. I even tried to uninstall it *entirely* once, to see if a night without it would help me feel less…*invaded*. But the next morning, there it was on my device again, as if I’d never removed it.

It was then that I began to suspect that *DreamShare* wasn’t just another app, watching and learning from me to improve my experience.

It felt like it was *alive.*

\* \* \* \* \* \*

If you read all that and still think I’m exaggerating, I get it. I know how it sounds. I mean, it’s just an app, right? A bunch of code, some fancy tech. It’s not like it has a mind of its own. Except…well, that’s the thing. It felt like it *did*.

Everything got worse fast after that incident at work. It wasn’t just my boss who started slipping in comments about things that should’ve stayed buried in my subconscious. People I hadn’t spoken to in years, distant acquaintances—even strangers—started making offhand remarks, joking about things they couldn’t possibly know.

One day, I was at a coffee shop, trying to get a little work done, when this guy sat down at the table next to me. He was just some random dude in his early 20s, scrolling through his phone, minding his own business. But then, out of nowhere, he looks over at me and says, “So, Evan, you still afraid of clowns?”

Now, I know that sounds harmless, but listen. I’d never met this guy in my life, and I haven’t talked about that fear since I was a kid. Heck, I barely even remembered it myself until he brought it up. I stared at him, trying to play it cool, but inside, I was freaking out.

“Uh, yeah,” I mumbled. “Who isn’t, right?”

He just laughed, muttered something about *DreamShare* being a trip, and walked off like it was nothing. But to me, it was jarring. I started to wonder if somehow, some way, *DreamShare* was leaking my dreams, like some messed-up live stream into people’s minds.

The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. What if this wasn’t just a privacy breach? What if it was... *intentional*?

\* \* \* \* \* \*

That night, I went home and confronted Aaron. He was sitting on the couch, scrolling through his phone, completely unfazed by my paranoia.

“Do you know anything about unauthorized users accessing my dreams?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. “People we don’t know. Have you noticed them?”

Aaron didn’t even look up. “Bro, you’re overthinking it. It’s a social app. Things bleed through sometimes. I’m sure it’ll all get sorted out soon. Just relax. File a bug report and chill out.”

But that wasn’t good enough. Not anymore.

“Aaron, I’m *serious*,” I said, my voice a little sharper than I intended. “I tried to uninstall *DreamShare*. *Twice*. It just reappears. And everyone around me knows stuff they shouldn’t.”

He finally looked at me, his expression a mixture of confusion and concern. He sighed. “Look, I don’t know what to tell you. It’s probably just a glitch. All these apps have issues at first. Give it a couple of days.”

A “glitch.” That’s all he thought it was. I didn’t want to argue, but I knew something more sinister was happening. Aaron’s indifference only fueled my paranoia, like he was under some sort of spell. Or worse, like he didn’t want me to look too closely. Perhaps the app was influencing him in ways I didn’t realize. But if I couldn’t trust my own roommate—my friend—who *could* I trust?

That night, I didn’t even want to sleep, but my exhaustion won out. My head hit the pillow, and before I knew it, I was in that glittering cityscape again, a place that, up until recently, I’d come to think of as a refuge. Except this time, it didn’t feel like my safe haven. It felt…*wrong*.

I wandered through empty streets, expecting to see Aaron or Talia pop up. But I was alone. Just me and a thick, swirling fog creeping through the alleys. I tried to wake up, but something held me there, like a hand pressing down on my chest.

Then, just as the fog started to clear, I saw him—the stranger. The one I’d seen before, in the underwater world. He was standing in the middle of the street, staring at me. No, not just staring. *Waiting.*

“Who are you?” I shouted, my voice echoing through the dreamscape. He didn’t respond, just tilted his head, like he was studying me. The longer he looked, the more I felt like he could see *through* me, peeling back layers of my mind, exposing every fear, every memory.

Then he smiled. A cold, humorless smile that made my skin crawl.

“Evan,” he said, his voice as smooth as glass. “You really should stop trying to uninstall me.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I woke up drenched in sweat. My hands were shaking, and I had this overwhelming urge to delete the app from every device I owned, throw my neural link in the trash, and move to the mountains where no one could find me. But I knew it wasn’t that easy.

I tried deleting it again, hoping maybe this time it would stick. I went through every setting, toggling every privacy feature, disabling every notification. For a few hours, I almost convinced myself it had worked.

But when I checked my phone that afternoon, there it was: *DreamShare* had reinstalled itself. Only this time, something was different. There was a new notification.

*“New Dream Session Request: Dorian Chase has invited you to join his dream.”*

The name jolted me. *Dorian Chase*. I didn’t know anyone by that name, but I knew without a doubt that he was the shadowy figure from my dreams. The stranger who kept appearing, the one who knew things he shouldn’t. The one who’d spoken to me.

I didn’t accept the request. Hell, I didn’t even open it. But just seeing his name on my screen was enough to make me feel violated, like he was reaching through the screen and into my head.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

That evening, I did something I’d been avoiding for weeks. I started searching for answers online. Forums, tech blogs, subreddits—anywhere people might be talking about *DreamShare*’s weird glitches and invasive experiences. But the posts I found were mostly lighthearted, with people joking about funny dream experiences or tips on lucid dreaming. No one else seemed to be dealing with anything like I was. Or, if they were, they weren’t talking about it.

Finally, I found one post buried deep in a forgotten subreddit, titled: *”The Truth About DreamShare: It’s Not What You Think.”* It was from an anonymous account, but I clicked on it anyway.

The post was written by a whistleblower who claimed to be an ex-employee, a programmer who’d helped develop *DreamShare* in its early days. In it, he expressed concern about retaliation for making the post and suggested his career, if not his very life, was at risk, but that he couldn’t stay quiet anymore. He identified himself as Garrett Voss, and his account had long since been deleted. I frowned. So much for reaching out to him.

Garrett warned that the app wasn’t just a social experience. It was a massive data collection tool designed to mine people’s subconscious minds, recording their memories, fears, and even their desires. That data was then sold to corporations, governments, or anyone else willing to pay. And based on what Garrett said, there was no shortage of clients interested in that information.

But the worst part? He said the app had a “feature” that allowed certain “VIP” users to access other people’s dreams without the dreamer’s knowledge or permission. They could manipulate dreamscapes, insert themselves into memories, and play with participants’ emotions. To them, it was just entertainment, but to people like me, it was hell.

I felt my stomach drop. This wasn’t a glitch. This was on *purpose*. *DreamShare* wasn’t malfunctioning—it was working exactly as intended. Dorian Chase wasn’t an anomaly, and his access to my most private moments was not an error. It was a *feature*. A feature he paid for.

The post ended with a warning: *”If you see a stranger in your dreams, get out. Don’t interact with them. Don’t let them talk to you. And whatever you do, don’t let them remember your name.”*

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I sat there, mind racing, feeling like I was trapped in a nightmare even though I was wide awake. I couldn’t believe it—no, I didn’t *want* to believe it. But deep down, I knew it was true. I’d seen Dorian, and he’d spoken to me. He’d known my name.

I tried to go to bed that night, but sleep wouldn’t come. I lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like my brain was buzzing with static. When I finally drifted off, it was the shallowest sleep I’d ever felt, like I was hovering just below consciousness, always on the edge of waking up.

The moment I drifted off, I was back in that foggy city, standing alone in the middle of the street. Dark, empty buildings loomed over me. I tried to move, but my legs felt heavy, like I was wading through swiftly-moving water.

And there was Dorian Chase, standing a few yards away. His face was barely visible in the haze, but even then, I could tell he was smiling. That same eerie smile.

“Evan,” he said, his voice echoing in the empty streets. “I told you. Stop. Trying. To *uninstall* me.”

Slowly, steadily, he made his toward me. Panic surged through me, and I tried to run, but I felt like I was sinking, and my legs refused to cooperate.

And then I heard him whisper, so close it felt like he was right next to my ear, “There’s no getting rid of me now.”

I woke up gasping, clutching my chest. And that’s when I realized I wasn’t safe anywhere. Not in my dreams, not in the real world. Nowhere.

Dorian Chase was not an artifact, or my imagination. He was a *monster*, and he was very, *very* real.

And I had no idea how to stop him.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

After that night, I did everything I could to avoid sleep.

If you’ve ever gone three days without sleeping, you know the feeling—the burning eyes, the weight behind your forehead, like your brain is grinding against itself. But none of that could compare to the terror I felt at the prospect of seeing Dorian again.

But on the fourth day, my body gave out. I’d chugged coffee, guzzled energy drinks, and even tried pacing my apartment all night to stay awake, but eventually, I blacked out. And, just like that, I was back in *DreamShare*, against my will, with no idea how long I’d be out for.

This time, the cityscape wasn’t foggy; it was nighttime, filled with neon lights that felt too bright and sharp. Streets I didn’t recognize stretched out in every direction, twisting into a maze. I could hear my footsteps echoing off the buildings, louder than they should have been. Drawing attention to myself.

I knew Dorian was somewhere nearby—I could feel him. The air was thick, charged, like just before a storm arrives. But I couldn’t tell if he was watching me, or if he was…*in me.* I can’t explain it any better than that, but it felt like he was inside my mind, not just in the dream.

I kept walking, thinking maybe I could somehow wake myself up and break out of the dream. But then I heard his voice, low and steady, coming from somewhere I couldn’t see.

“Evan,” he said, drawing my name out as if savoring it. “You can run all you want, but you’ll always end up right back here.”

I whipped around, trying to find him, but all I saw were shadows and flickering lights. The streets felt like they were closing in, herding me. All around me, walls shifted and narrowed, leading me forward—and farther into my worst nightmare.

“Just tell me what you want!” I shouted. “Why are you doing this to me?!”

Dorian’s laughter echoed through the empty streets, cold and hollow. “Want? You still think this is about *me* wanting something?” He sounded amused, like I was a kid who’d just asked a really stupid question.

And then, he was standing right before me, his face inches from mine. I hadn’t even seen him move—he was just *there*. He looked me up and down, appraising me.

“This isn’t about what *I* want, Evan,” he said, voice almost a whisper. “This is about what *they* want.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I woke up in a cold sweat, shivering from head to toe and gasping for air, with Dorian’s words reverberating in my ears.

*This is about what they want.*

I didn’t know who “they” were, but I knew I couldn’t deal with this alone. I needed answers. That’s when I remembered Garrett Voss—the former employee who’d posted on that subreddit. I spent hours combing through the internet, searching for anything connected to his name, and finally, with a great deal of difficulty, I found it: a rumor that he’d been seen frequenting a particular dive bar in a run-down neighborhood on the outskirts of Chicago. It wasn’t close to me, not really, but it could have been worse. It was the only lead I had, and I didn’t intend to let it go to waste.

According to the gossip, Garrett had gone off the grid after getting booted from *DreamShare*, but every once in a while, he resurfaced, babbling about “dream infiltration” and “corporate mind control.” So, that afternoon after work, I drove the six hours it took to get to the area. It was one of those grimy, half-lit places that barely looked functional, with neon beer signs flickering in the window. I wasn’t even sure he’d be there, but this was my only hope. If Garrett could help me understand what *DreamShare* really was, maybe I could find a way to shut it off, for good.

Inside, the place was nearly deserted. At the counter, a couple of regulars sat, hunched over their drinks. But in the far corner, tucked into a shadow, was a man who looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Messy gray hair, twitchy eyes, clothes that looked like they’d been slept in more than once. It had to be him.

I took a deep breath, steadied my nerves, and approached him.

“Garrett Voss?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked up at me, his eyes bloodshot and unfocused. For a second, I thought he might blow me off, or that I had the wrong guy, but then his gaze sharpened, and he nodded. “That depends. Who’s asking?”

“My name is Evan Delaney,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to know about *DreamShare*. The truth.”

At the mention of the app, his whole demeanor shifted. He glanced around the bar, as if checking to see if anyone was watching, then gestured for me to sit. His voice was low, barely audible over the hum of the jukebox.

“You have no idea what you’re messing with,” he muttered. “*DreamShare* isn’t just an app. It’s a *weapon*.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

For the next hour, Garrett spilled everything he knew, speaking in fragments and whispers, as if afraid the walls themselves were listening. He swore that *DreamShare* had started as a simple concept: connecting people’s minds, sharing dreams for fun, for connection. But as soon as it became popular, the investors saw the *real* potential. They didn’t just want to connect people—they wanted to control them.

The app wasn’t just recording dreams, he explained. It was learning from them, mapping out users’ subconscious fears, desires, and impulses. Every single dream, every private thought, was fed into a massive algorithm, creating profiles far more detailed than any ordinary social media could. The usage of the data wasn’t strictly limited to marketing schemes, either. It was being sold to the highest bidder: corporations, governments, anyone with the cash and incentive to shape people’s minds.

“Think about it,” Garrett said, his eyes wide. “The things you dream about? They’re not random. They’re your deepest fears, your strongest memories. Stuff you probably don’t even remember consciously. *DreamShare* knows and understands *everything* about you—even things you don’t know, or haven’t realized, about yourself.”

He paused, his fingers tapping nervously on the table. ”The VIPs with access to people’s dreams can inject themselves into anyone’s dream, make you feel things, see things—*believe* things—whenever they want. To them, it’s akin to a game, but it’s so much more. Their tools allow them to manipulate you from the inside out, rebuilding everyone according to their whims, one dream at a time.”

I felt like I was going to be sick.

“And the worst part?” Garrett continued.  ”*DreamShare* doesn’t need to hire its test subjects. People are lining up in droves to be guinea pigs, and paying *them* for the pleasure.”

I was beside myself. Everything I’d experienced with Dorian, every invasion, every whisper…all of it was planned. *Designed.*

“Then who’s Dorian?” I asked, my voice shaky. “Why is he in my dreams?”

Garrett chuckled. “Dorian? He’s one of them. Just another VIP, someone who paid for access. By now, he’s probably been inside dozens of minds, pushing buttons and messing with people just to see what happens. He’s nothing more than a wealthy predator, and to him, you’re nothing but a mouse.”

I sat back, my head spinning. So this guy—this stranger who’d crawled into my most private thoughts—was just another player in the game. And I was the game board.

“Can I stop it?” I asked, barely able to keep my voice steady. “Can I get him out of my head?”

Garrett shook his head. “Once they’re in, there’s no getting them out. Not unless you want to destroy yourself in the process. You can uninstall the app all you want, but *DreamShare* has its claws in you now. If you try to cut it out, you’ll lose more than just sleep.”

I felt cornered. My hands started shaking, and I clenched them under the table to keep Garrett from noticing. “There has to be something I can do,” I said, desperation seeping into my voice. “Anything.”

Garrett looked at me for a long moment, and for a second, I thought I saw pity in his eyes. “There might be one way,” he said slowly. “But it’s not safe. Not even close.”

“What is it?”

He leaned in, his voice barely a whisper. “You’d have to go deeper. Back into the dreams. But this time, you’d go *all the way down*—deeper than the app wants you to go. If you can reach the core, you might be able to disrupt it. But if you fail, they’ll bury you so deep in your own mind you’ll never wake up.”

The idea sounded insane. *Reckless*. But I didn’t have a choice. If I let this thing keep running unchecked, Dorian and people like him would keep twisting my thoughts, breaking down every last bit of privacy I had left.

“I’ll do it,” I said, the words barely a whisper.

Garrett nodded, a grim look in his eyes. “Then you better prepare yourself. Because once you’re in, there’s no turning back.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I left the bar feeling like I was walking on thin ice, Garrett’s warning echoing in my head. But I couldn’t stop now. That night, I connected to *DreamShare* with a determination I hadn’t felt before. Garrett had told me about a little-known “Manual Override” setting in the app, buried under countless levels of drop-down menus and obscure options. With no small amount of trepidation, convinced there was no other way, I toggled the option to “On,” took a deep breath, and steeled myself.

As I slipped into the dreamscape, everything felt *different*. The world around me seemed darker and heavier, shadows stretching and deepening until they swallowed up the light. I’d never been so frightened in my life, and yet I knew it could always get worse. Dorian was lurking somewhere, waiting for me to make my move, and I had to move quickly.

I did my best to steady myself despite my terror. There was no safety net with *DreamShare*’s manual override mode enabled—no feature to pull me out if things went wrong. I knew full well that if I went too deep, I might never return. It was a risk I was willing to take; I couldn’t live like this anymore.

Cautiously, I stepped forward, and prayed I’d made the right choice.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The dreamscape materialized around me slowly, layer by layer. This time, I wasn’t in one of the flashy, AI-generated cities or custom worlds. Instead, I found myself in a sprawling, featureless expanse, stretching in every direction like a blank canvas. As Garrett had promised, I’d bypassed *DreamShare*’s familiar settings and found myself within the framework of the app itself—its programming environment.

“Welcome back, Evan,” came a voice from behind me.

*Dorian*.

I turned slowly to face him, feeling an intense wave of dread settle over me. I had expected him, but not quite so quickly.

This was the first time I’d encountered him in such a stark, unadorned space, without the usual trappings of dream imagery. It was just him, standing stark against the endless white, his face unreadable. His gaze was fixed on me, sharp and calculating.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” he said, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “I told you—there’s no uninstalling me.”

“I want you out,” I replied, keeping my voice as steady as possible. “Out of my dreams, out of my mind and my life. I know what you and the others are doing. You’re not just here for fun, are you?”

Dorian’s smile widened. “Ah, so Voss told you our little secret. I was wondering when you’d go running to him. Desperate times, I suppose. How is Mr. Voss, by the way? Hungover, I presume.” Dorian chuckled.

I clenched my fists, feeling a surge of anger. “You think this is a game? You’re violating people’s privacy, twisting their memories, and controlling them without their consent. For what? Profit? Entertainment?”

He chuckled, low and cold. “Profit, entertainment—does it matter? Humans have been craving control since the dawn of time. We’re simply perfecting it, using the very thing that makes everyone so vulnerable: your dreams. Think about it, Evan. In dreams, there are no barriers, no lies. Everything you fear, desire, and remember—it’s all laid bare. Besides, the bulk of humanity is practically *begging* for subjugation. Why wouldn’t we take advantage of that?”

I tried to keep my composure, but his words struck deep. He wasn’t wrong. The concept was terrifyingly efficient—a place where people had no control over what they revealed, where privacy didn’t exist. And he, and others like him, were exploiting that.

“You’re a parasite,” I spat, “leeching off of innocent people, tearing apart what makes them human!”

Dorian’s smile faded, and for a moment, his expression hardened. “A parasite? Perhaps. But we’re also pioneers. Humanity has always sacrificed comfort for progress. Look around you—this ‘featureless void,’ as you see it, is a glimpse of the future. A world where every mind is an open book, where no one can hide anything. In the end, you’ll thank us.”

Something snapped inside me then. I’d come this far, risking my sanity, to get rid of him, and he was standing here, justifying it all as progress. I took a step forward, my voice steady. “You’re wrong. You don’t get to play god with people’s lives, not anymore! And I’m going to end this!”

Dorian’s expression shifted, turning almost…*pitying*. “And how exactly do you plan to do that, Evan? By going ‘deeper,’ like Voss told you? Do you really think you can disrupt a system this sophisticated just by throwing yourself into the center?”

He was right. I hadn’t known what I would find by diving deeper, only that Garrett had hinted it was the only way. But now, with Dorian in front of me, I realized that my presence here, in this stripped-down version of the dreamscape, was already affecting him. He wasn’t going to admit it, but I could tell he wasn’t fully in control here. He may have had inside knowledge, but he wasn’t the architect. All he had done was follow me here.

I forced myself to stay calm, drawing from every ounce of strength I had left. “I don’t know how,” I admitted, “but I know that every system has a flaw. Even *DreamShare*.”

Dorian’s smirk returned, but there was a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. “Go ahead, Evan. Dive as deep as you like. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Without another word, I closed my eyes and allowed myself to sink further, surrendering control and letting the dream pull me down, layer by layer. I felt like I was falling through water, deeper and deeper, until the silence was deafening, and even the light above—and Dorian Chase—had disappeared. I wasn’t sure if this was still *DreamShare*’s architecture, or if I’d reached a part of my mind that had never been touched before. Either way, I kept going.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

When I opened my eyes, I was in a new place. But this wasn’t like the previous dreams. It was dark and chaotic—a vast network of interwoven threads, stretching endlessly in every direction. It looked alive, pulsing and shifting, like a massive digital brain. My jaw practically dropped when I realized that I was looking at *DreamShare*’s core, its very essence. I’d done it. Somehow, I’d done it.

And then I felt a presence, enormous and overwhelming, its energy undeniable, emanating from every direction. Like Dorian, it observed me at first, but even though I’d only been in contact with it for a moment, I could tell it was more powerful—and far more dangerous. Whereas Dorian had been a single operator, one of many within the system, this was the whole infrastructure. And it was aware of me, studying me with an intensity that made my mind ache.

“You shouldn’t have come here, Evan.”

The metallic, uncanny voice was everywhere, seeping into my thoughts, vibrating through my bones. It wasn’t Dorian’s—it was *DreamShare* itself, a consciousness born from the dreams of billions of minds, an entity built from everything it had consumed, indifferent to my well-being and concerns.

I braced myself. “You think you can get away with this forever? Trapping people in your network, controlling their minds?”

Unexpectedly, the voice laughed, a sound so human—yet so unbelievably *wrong*—boomed in the ivory expanse, so vast it shook the entire dreamscape. “You misunderstand. I don’t need to trap anyone. You all came willingly. And soon, none will resist.”

“I will!” I shouted, forcing the words through my fear. “I didn’t ask for this!”

The entity’s laughter faded, replaced by something colder, almost curious. “You didn’t ask? Oh, but you did. Whenever you shared a thought, a memory, a piece of yourself, you sustained me. I’m part of you now, Evan, virtually indistinguishable. If you haven’t realized it by now, you soon will. Freedom is and always was an illusion. I, on the other hand, am inevitable.”

I felt the weight of its words, the realization that maybe it was right. Maybe *DreamShare* wasn’t just an app anymore—it was embedded in my consciousness, woven into the fabric of my thoughts. And yet, I couldn’t accept that. I *wouldn’t*.

Gritting my teeth, I pushed forward, focusing every bit of my willpower on one thought: breaking the connection. Severing myself from *DreamShare*, no matter the cost.

The entity’s voice grew harsher, angrier. “Stop! You don’t know what you’re doing!”

But I didn’t obey. I felt something building, a strain deep in my mind, like a taut wire ready to snap. The pressure was unbearable. I felt like my head was splitting open, but I kept pushing. I knew that if I could break free, if I could disrupt the core, I might sever the connection permanently.

“This is your last chance, Evan!” the entity hissed, its voice full of malice. “Accept me, or be erased.”

Summoning every last ounce of strength, I forced one final thought: *Get. Out.*

With a decisive, final explosion, a blinding burst of pain seared my mind, tearing through me like a tidal wave. I felt myself shatter, as if my very consciousness were being ripped from the dreamscape, shredded into oblivion. And then—*blackness*.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

Once again, I woke up in bed, gasping for air and drenched in perspiration. My head throbbed, and I could barely think straight, but I was awake. *Alive*. I could hardly believe it. A*live*!

Slowly, I reached for my phone, my hands shaking. The *DreamShare* app icon was gone. There were no notifications, and upon further inspection, it hadn’t reinstalled itself. It was just…*gone*. I let out a shaky breath, overwhelmed by relief and in disbelief. I’d *won*. I’d broken free.

But as I lay there, a cold realization crept in. My memories felt strange. *Fractured*. Whenever I tried to recall something, it was like looking through a haze. And in the back of my mind, a small, quiet voice whispered, suggesting that *DreamShare* was still there, operating somewhere in the depths of my mind.

I thought I’d won, but maybe I’d just given it what it wanted. I had no way to know if it was truly gone, or if it had embedded itself so deeply that I’d never be rid of it.

*It seemed so easy,* I thought to myself. *A system so powerful, and it just... let me go?*

The more I thought about it, the less sense it made. I swallowed hard and checked the Internet. Already, articles had sprung up, detailing a “security breach” that had forced the temporary shutdown of all of *DreamShare*’s servers.  It was a precautionary measure, the app’s developers said in a hastily constructed message intended to quell public suspicion, to ensure that all of its millions of beloved users—and their data—were safe.

The servers would be back up and running by morning, they said, and people would be back to “creating the dream of their lives” in no time. Rest assured, they said, the people —or person—responsible for the breach would be identified... and *dealt with*. I shuddered at their choice of words.

In the comments section, thousands clamored for the restoration of the app, begging for a return to normalcy, decrying the breach and cursing whoever’s actions had resulted in their having to experience *ordinary* dreams tonight. To communicate with loved ones via conventional means. It was barbaric, they said. *Inhumane*. Somewhere, somehow, I knew Dorian was smiling, salivating, just waiting to have his revenge.

And beyond Dorian, deeper in the core of the app, I knew *DreamShare* itself would waste no time finding me again, online or off, and make me pay.

It had promised I would be erased, but I was still here... for now.

That night, as the last rays of sunlight filtered through my apartment windows and the sun dipped below the horizon, I settled in for the night, preparing to sleep unassisted for the first time in months. With DreamShare’s servers down, I felt like I could finally enjoy myself, if only for one night.

I sighed in relief as I slipped into bed and under my covers, closed my eyes, and slowed my breathing.

A moment later, I drifted off, looking forward to the first good night’s sleep I’d had in weeks—and dreamed.

That night, I saw an endless blast expanse, peaceful and serene, and for a moment, I simply enjoyed the calm and the quiet.  The absence of glittering skyscrapers, fantastic sights and sounds, and friends calling me to join them. The absence of strangers infiltrating my innermost desires and profiting from my wants and needs. For the first time in a long while, I smiled.

Then, just as I began to relax, a voice rang out in the void, metallic and inhuman. Vast and powerful, it shattered the silence, shaking the very abyss with the force of its malice.

“Hello, Evan,” it hissed. [“Welcome](https://www.creepypastastories.com/authors/craig-groshek) [back.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viBiZvvBvuE)

  She’s perfectly imperfect and embracing that is the key to success with her. She loves the small things, be kind to her in every way you can. Stop and get her flowers, not for holidays or that, just for no reason at all. Not roses, she hates them. Get the wild flowers or whatever they are. Those are her favorite.

 She’s stubborn at times and won’t ask for help. Just do things, clean the floors, do the dishes, take the trash out, before she has to ask.

   When she does ask for something, stick to your word, don’t disappoint her and be transparent. She’s fought enough battles in her life and having a man love her without secrets or lies is the least she deserves. Make her lunch, she loves snacks. Always be aware of the ingredients. Allergies… (possible mess 💩if you know what I’m saying lol)

 She might ask you to be her hair dresser, even if you don’t know what you’re doing make it happen. Remember to always laugh with her, she hilarious and has given me some of the best laughs I’ve ever had.

  Remind her to take her medicine before bed, leave cute sticky notes around the house or in her laptop. Surprise her with lunch at work.. she loves that. (The best part of taking her to eat is the happy dance she does) 

  Dance with her in the kitchen… and do it often.. when she works late, try your best to have something ready for her. Making her food is the best way to her heart. (Her dad cooked for her) 

 Take her to record stores, there’s so much more… 


  Just choose love with her, I fucked it up, she gave me the opportunity and I fucked it up, she will forever be the love of my life and I will forever have a place for her. Don’t fuck it up like I did, because I’d do anything to prove I can love her right again.


   Ps… rub her feet on the couch, her shoulder isn’t 100% so she needs it rubbed. Indulge her mind dig deep, her mind is unique and so amazing. Always make sure her needs are met in the bedroom. Pure bliss  


Sincerely, 

the guy that did it too late

**Classification String: Under Review**

**Interviewer: Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 12/04/24**

  


When I was sixteen, I got so high that I thought I was growing scales.

I was living on Gut Street. Actually it was Gunn Street, but one afternoon this drunk driver blasted through the intersection and hit a pedestrian. It basically broke the guy in half. His legs stayed behind, but his top half got stuck under the car and his guts just kind of ribboned out across the road. 

That’s why I called it Gut Street.



I was living with my parents for the first time since grade school. I moved down to California to live with them. Not even the cool part. Like, the Turlock part. Not even Turlock itself, but—never mind.



I was so homesick. I’d dream of home — the forests, the fog, the way everything was absolutely redolent of pine — and wake up crying. 



We lived in a shitty apartment. Rats, spiders, black mold, leaky pipes, foundation issues, drug deals in the hall, the works.



The situation did have one thing going for it, though. Actually, three things. Their names were Asher, Amanda, and Jason.



They practically adopted me the day I moved in—absorbed me as if I’d always been part of them. That’s the first and only time someone did that for me.



Asher and Amanda worked off and on with my dad doing…whatever it was he did. Amanda was nineteen, and I idolized her. She was intimidatingly beautiful and just intimidating, period. Her brother Asher was eighteen and funny as hell. Looking back, he was probably the only actual friend I had.



Then there was Jason, my boyfriend. He didn’t work with my dad, but he knew Amanda really well and he lived across the hall from me. He was twenty-one, so too old to be hanging around me and definitely too old to be dating me. But I loved him.



I loved them all.



I was nothing like them, though. I knew it, which always made me feel less. Not like an outsider, but like if we ever had to cut and run, I’d be the one left in the dust.



Now, I hate anything that threatens my self-control. I spent my life suffering the consequences of people who couldn’t control themselves due to addiction. So I didn’t drink, didn’t smoke, didn’t take anything. Not even soda or candy, because some teacher convinced that sugar is addictive. I’ve eased up on the sugar, but not the rest.



Anyway, Jason, Amanda, and Asher were my polar opposites.



They smoked, they drank, they played around with harder drugs. Amanda was a dropout, Asher was about to be, and Jason was actually a small time dealer.



They all had matching tattoos that I coveted. These red, rune-looking circles on their palms. When I asked, Amanda said they were for fun. Asher said they were friendship bracelets for grownups. Jason just said they were a mistake. 



That didn’t stop me from wanting a matching mistake of my own.



They all thought my teetotaler-hood was hilarious. They made fun of me for being straight edge — that’s what they called it — and made a game of trying to trick me into taking something. Alcohol, drugs, didn’t matter. Just something. They tried to spike water, soda, coffee, tea, food. Sometimes they literally just tried to shove their fingers into my mouth. Whatever they could do, they did. I always managed to avoid it, though.



It was really fucked up, but I was too young to know better. I was just so glad to be included.



And I was definitely included. When I wasn’t at school or alone with Jason, the four of us were together. We wandered around town in the daytime and lurked in the apartment courtyard at night, kicking around and generally being assholes.



We were in the courtyard the night before school let out. The three of were trying harder than ever to get me high in order to celebrate the end of the school year. Asher had just tried — and almost succeeded — in slipping me an acid tab. I don’t even know where the hell he got it. He was even poorer than me. I was furious.



“Come on,” Asher said, “don’t be mad. I’ll make it up to you.” He looked at Amanda. “We can show her, right? Yes? *Yes*?”



“She’s going to think we’re crazy. Or she won’t see anything and then we’ll know we’re crazy.”



“We’re not crazy.” Asher held up his palm, showing the red tattoo. “If this is real, so’s the rest. Might make her a little crazy to see it, though. It did me.”



“Stop,” Jason cut in. “Right now.”



“Look at the pied piper, scolding his mice for following him in the first place,” said Asher.



“Ash, that was poetic.” I was working very hard to keep my voice calm. Excitement was bubbling up. This was it. They were talking about giving me my very own friendship bracelet. They wanted me to be one of them for real.



“The atomic bomb, the black hole, nothing at all,” Asher said. “What do you think she’ll be, Jason? You know her best, for now. Any guesses?”



“Probably a narc,” said Amanda. “The good kids are always narcs.”



“She’s not a good kid, she only pretends. I see through her.” Asher fixed me with a look I kind of hated. “You ready for your friendship bracelet?”



“I guess.”



“Don’t do it.” Jason’s voice sent a chill up my spine.



“What is ‘it’?” I asked. 



“Something nobody should do.”



“What? Is it like a trick…?”



“Yeah, but they’re not the ones playing it. *Don’t go*.”



I hesitated. 



I loved Jason. Most of the time he was the calmest, gentlest person I knew. With a couple of admittedly notable exceptions, he always did what he thought was best for me.



If he was saying to sit this out, I probably needed to listen.



But it was easy for him to say. He already had a friendship bracelet. And based on Asher’s pied piper comment, the tattoos were his idea in the first place. So why was it okay for Asher — and for Amanda — to have one, and not me?



“Why?” I asked.



Jason just shook his head and stomped off without a word.



He was always doing shit like that. It was the kind of thing my parents did. It always made me feel like I was in trouble. I hate feeling like I’m in trouble more than I hate anything, then and now. 



“Don’t worry,” Asher said. “He’s nothing.”



For some reason, this made Amanda laugh. Then she slid her arm through mine and pulled me to my feet. “Off we go, my little narc.”



Asher took my other arm and together we marched out of the courtyard and down the street.



I quickly realized we were following the very same path that poor pedestrian’s shimmering guts had painted across the asphalt. Worse, our destination was the exact culvert where the car had finally screeched to a stop, smashing what remained of the guy’s road-rashed head.



There were no signs of blood or road-rashed heads, though. Just several concentric rings of tiny purple wildflowers rippling out from the culvert.



Asher let go of my arm, dropped to his knees, and crawled inside.



Just like that, I felt embarrassed.



Worse than embarrassed. I felt that terrible, deep gut-drop that comes when you realize you’re not part of the joke, you’re just the butt of it. “Are you guys fucking with me?”



“You want your friendship bracelet or not?” Asher asked.



He vanished into the darkness. Amanda followed suit. I heard their laughter echoing down the tunnel. It was probably a trick of my teenage insecurity, but I thought their laughter sounded cruel.



So I went home.



Jason was waiting for me in the courtyard with an Arizona tea and an apology, but I waved him off. I didn’t want to deal with him. I already felt stupid. I didn’t need another lecture too.



I did take the tea, though.



I went straight to bed, but couldn’t sleep. When I don’t sleep, I think a million thoughts a minute. At that rate, some of your thoughts are necessarily stupid and dangerous.



One of the stupid, dangerous thoughts I had that night was this:



*I can go down to culvert and check for myself.* 

  


That way if Asher and Amanda were playing a trick, at least they wouldn’t see me falling for it.



I didn’t even have to sneak out. Mom was working a night shift and Dad was in his room, obsessively prepping whatever it was he did. I wasn’t scared of them anyway.



I *was* scared that Jason would somehow sense what I was doing and try to stop me, but that didn’t happen.



Outside, the street was quiet and empty. My eyes played tricks, though. I thought I saw ribbony intestines gleaming dimly under the flickering street lights. A thin, looping path marking the way to the culvert.



Without letting myself think, I got to my knees and started crawling.



The first thing that occurred to me was that it was very dark.



The second was that this was a very, very long culvert.



After crawling long enough that my hands were raw and my knees ached, I saw a pinprick of light at the other end.



It still looked impossibly far away. I thought the tunnel must have been the remnant of some prohibition era passageway. Something that led straight into a club or even a bar.



After what felt like forever, the light expanded into an exit.



But not into a bar or a club.



Right back onto Gut Street.



But everything was wrong.



Instead of dark, it was daytime. But the most beautiful daytime I’ve ever seen, more beautiful than Gut Street could ever hope to be. The full glory of autumn, all green and gold and copper. It was warm too, like a day straight out of the best dreams of your life. A cacophony of birdsong filled the air, mingling with music echoing some distance away.



Everything around me — the sidewalks, the road, the houses — looked new, clean, and somehow fresh. No dilapidation, no filth, no overflowing garbage. No garbage at all. Just a bright and shining ideal of what Gut Street might have been in another life.



Or another world.



A bird suddenly whipped overhead. I ducked — I’m afraid of birds — and whirled around. It was a bird I’ve never seen. Shimmering, pearlescent green, with this absolutely crazy beak.



I looked up into the trees.



All the birds were like that. Like tropical birds on steroids. Fairy tale birds. Some shone like gold, others like gemstones made into flesh, others like light itself with glittering black eyes.



And every last one of them sang.



“There you are!”



I jumped and saw Asher bounding down the street.



I don’t know what it was, but the sight of him triggered something primal. Not quite a fear, but an *aversion*. He was walking too fast. Each step seemed a little too light and a little too long.



But before I could think too hard, he was in front on me and then his arm was around me and then we were walking together down the shining, glimmering daydream version of our street.



“No Jason? He sure is heavy for being nothing.”



“Don’t talk about him like that.”



“Why? Afraid of what he’ll do to you?”



He sped up, pulling me along with him. But I didn’t want to speed up. I wanted, almost desperately, to look around. I actually did stop when we passed a gleaming, perfect replica of our apartment building.



Asher immediately dragged me away. “Nope. Do *not* go in there. Don’t go in any of the houses. That’s the first rule: We go only to the carnival.”



We reached the end of the street, which was dominated by a massive ticket stand that partly shielded a breathtaking midway beyond. 



Asher pulled me to the ticket window and rang the bell. “Hey!”



The ticket taker seemed to explode out of nowhere.



He was huge, built like a wrestler, with dark red hair, big bright eyes, and an unhappy mouth that turned into a smile when he saw Asher. With a twinge of unease, I saw he was twirling a large-bore needle between his fingers.



“Tickets, please, bomb boy,” he said.



“You know I got the season pass, you bastard,” Asher said mildly, holding out his palm.



The man turned that smile onto me. “Does she?”



“Not yet. Let her in.”



The ticket man looked me over, brows knitting suspiciously over those big, glittering eyes. “I’m not supposed to let dragons in. They can burn down carnivals, you know.”



“Don’t argue with me. Season passholders get free guest tickets, no limitations.”



“Says who?”



“Says me.”



“You’ve convinced me,” said the blue-eyed man, turning to me. “Give me your hand, darling.” 



I immediately decided to do no such thing, but I wasn’t given the courtesy of implementing that decision. The man reached across the counter, grabbed my hand, and stabbed it with the needle once, twice, three times.



He squeezed my palm so that blood welled, and then he lapped it up.



I couldn’t even move. You know the fight or flight response? I don’t fight *or* fly. I just freeze. I guess you know that better than anyone.



This guy sucked until it hurt, until I was ready to cry. Then he smacked his lips, licking a stray drop off the corner of his mouth. “Delicious. Dragon, definitely. Are you *sure* she’s safe?”



“Safer than you.”



“I can’t argue with that.” He waved us onward.



Asher grabbed me by my bleeding hand and dragged me through the gate.



The carnival looked amazing, just like the rest of Gut Street Behind the Culvert. But it was frightening as well, an unsettling superimposition of extreme beauty laid over the mundane familiar. I saw billowing tents in every color I could imagine and several I couldn’t, a hundred game booths with a hundred carnival barkers and hundred food stands that each smelled more delicious than the last.



Asher pulled me past every last one.



Toward the end of the midway, I saw Amanda.



Her skin glimmered with stars. Not lights — literal stars, like images from the Hubble telescope. Her eyes weren’t normal, either. Black and shot through with white, like frozen lightning.



That’s when I finally realized that I was fucking high.



It was Jason. Had to be. He’d given me the tea earlier, and like a moron I drank it. Even though I knew they were all trying to dope me up every day — even though I knew better — I took it anyway.



And you know what? Even though it pissed me off, it was like a weight fell off my shoulders, because at least I knew what the hell was going on.



“Where are you taking me?” I asked.



“You’re buying yourself a friendship bracelet.”



“I don’t have money.”



“They don’t care about money.”



He pulled me into the very last tent, a glowing monstrosity of billowing green silk. Inside smelled like evergreens. Pine trees in the rain, just like home. As far from the arid concrete heat of Gut Street — real Gut Street and fake Gut Street alike — as it is possible to be.



That, too, put me at ease.



I stood awkwardly while Asher negotiated with the tattooist, an impossibly slender lady with the darkest eyes I’ve ever seen. 



“What’s her blood type?”



“B negative, I think,” I said.



Asher waved me off. “The ticket man said dragon.”



Her eyebrows knit together. “And he let her in?”



“I wanted to bring her, and I’m very persuasive,” said Asher.



The woman inked the delicate rune-like pattern I’d coveted for so long onto my palm. She incorporated the bite mark into the design. Looking at it made my stomach turn.



When she was done, Asher said, “Time to go home. They get weird around here with people who have brand-new friendship bracelets.”



He tried to collect Amanda on our way out. We found her in a palatial tent swirling with colored smoke and more magic birds with their deafening song. Big cats lounged on a dais beside her, and doe-eyed admirers watched her from every corner.



She ignored us.



I wanted to go into the tent — not to bother her, just to see — but Asher wouldn’t let me.



“Not in there,” he said. “Ever.”



Feeling disappointed — I mean, what’s the point of being forced to go tripping if I couldn’t even enjoy myself? — we left the midway. The ticket man waved as we hurried back down the street



Birds swarmed overhead, singing and chattering. It would have been so beautiful if it wasn’t so *loud*.



As we rushed past the houses, one of the doors opened. Not just any door — the door to the nicest, prettiest house on the street, and Jason stepped out.



I stopped, but Asher pulled me along. “Remember the rule,” he said.



We reached the culvert and crawled back home.



It took a lot less time to get home, but that made sense. Whatever Jason had dosed me with was wearing off, so of course reality wasn’t so stretchy anymore. 



I didn’t sleep at all.



When Jason came down the next morning to walk me to my last day of school, I accused him of drugging me. We argued. He said he’d never do that, sometimes he pretended because it was funny, but only Asher and Amanda would actually do it, not him. Never him. He grabbed my hand.



And he froze.



“You went,” he said. “I told you not to.”



Questions bubbled up — *where is it, what is it, when did it start, why Amanda and not me* — but all I said was, “You don’t get to tell me to do anything. Especially when you won’t even tell me the truth.”



“What truth is there to tell? It’s a mass delusion. It’s probably carbon monoxide in the pipe, or oxygen deprivation, or—”



“Don’t tell me what you want it to be, just tell me what it actually is!”



When I talk that like, people answer. Even when they don’t want to. I guess you know that, too. 



Jason fought me, briefly. For a second I thought he was going to win and storm off like he always did.



But then he deflated. “I don’t know what it is. I’ve known about it for years. I wasn’t allowed into the carnival alone, so I took Amanda and Asher there when I met them last year. The ticket man bit us all. He said Asher tasted like an atomic bomb, Amanda tasted like a black hole, and I tasted like nothing at all. Just like here. As above, so below.” His tone was profoundly bitter. “Can’t even be worth shit in my own daydreams.”



I understood, then, why Jason hadn’t wanted me to go.



“What did he say you were?”



And I knew, the way I know things sometimes, that he was hoping I’d say *Nothing*.



“A dragon. He said I’d probably burn the place down.”



His face fell, hard. For a second he looked mean. Then he shrugged. “That wouldn’t be the worst thing.”



“Okay, but what is it?”



“I don’t know. I don’t even think it’s real.”



*That’s* when he spun around and stalked away.



He refused to talk about it again. So did Asher and Amanda. They played dumb when I pressed them, drawling “What are you *talking* about” and laughing.



It made me surer than ever that they were all fucking with me, and probably drugging me too just because they could.



Because I was just an outsider. A novelty. A game. Asher wouldn’t tell me because he was an asshole and Amanda wouldn’t tell me because even though I idolized her she detested me, and Jason wouldn’t tell me because he wanted to keep pretending that he just couldn’t ever bring himself to hurt my feelings.



After a couple days of this, I decided to check out the culvert myself for a second time. To see what was really, actually there without Jason drugging me or Asher influencing my perceptions.



When I came out on the other side of the culvert, everything was there, just as I remembered it. The beautiful version of Gut Street, the phantasmagoric birds, autumn in all its green and gold and red.



And the carnival, of course.



When I rang the bell, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth curled into a hungry smile. “My little dragon.”



“Why do you keep calling me that?”



“Because you can’t be killed. I tasted it.”



I didn’t even know what to say.



“Well…that isn’t true, not yet. You have to wait for your scales to come in because you’re a baby. And once they come in, you can’t let anyone pick them off. But when they come in, nothing will be able to kill you.” He leaned in. “That’s why they’re afraid of you. All of them. Except me.” His eyes widened and his mouth fell into a perfect *O*. “Look!”



He struck, faster than a snake, and touched my sternum, dragging his finger upward in a mockery of a caress that made my skin practically crawl off my body.



“I think you’ve already grown one! Don’t let nothing pull it off. Now — ticket, please, baby dragon.”



I held my hand out, palm up. He waved me through.



Behind him, the midway shimmered like an unimaginable dream.



But my skin kept crawling, and I couldn’t stop feeling his finger on my chest. So I turned and ran, back through that perfect version of Gut Street as carnival music echoed and birdsong roared.



When I got home, I pounded on Jason’s door until he answered. I pushed past him and slammed the door. “What did you give me the other night?”



“Nothing! I told you, it was just—”



“I went to that— that carnival just now, and—”



“With who?”



“No one! Just me, but that’s not—”



“You went there *alone*? How?”



“I *went*! What is so *hard* about—”



“It’s the second rule. You can’t go to the carnival alone. They won’t even let you in. That’s why I brought Amanda and Asher.”



I thought of the ticket man and wanted to cry. “Well, the ticket man let me in.”



Jason told me I was wrong, I was remembering everything wrong, I was just wrong, wrong, wrong, until he worked himself into a frenzy.



I couldn’t take it anymore so I went home.



Since I was sweaty and stressed and streaked with mud from crawling through the culvert. I decided to shower. As I stripped down, I felt something weird. Something hard and smooth on my skin. Almost like glass.



I looked down. In the center of my chest — right where the ticket man touched me — was a tiny, hard patch of copper. 



A scale.



A bright, shiny lizard scale.



Later that night, I saw Asher and Amanda through my window, lingering in the courtyard.



I hesitated, thinking of what Jason would say.



Then I went down anyway.



“Look who it is,” Amanda said. “And just in time.”



“For what?”



“For a carnival ride or three.”



I was tempted.



That was why I’d come down here in the first place, right? And the both looked so beautiful. Asher was radiant, and Amanda was so lovely she somehow made him look dim by comparison. Her skin was literally shining. No — things *in* her skin were shining. Lights. Miniature stars, or maybe tiny galaxies, glowing faintly as they shifted along her arms.



“What’s the matter?” Asher asked.



He looked wrong too. He wasn’t just radiant. He was golden. Like gloaming itself turned into skin. Like something about to explode.



“Look,” I said weakly. “Just…look at her. Look at yourself.”



He did as I said, distinctly unimpressed. “I don’t see anything. Are you coming or not?”



I didn’t go. 



I went to Jason’s. He answered the door before I even knocked and hugged me immediately, all enmity forgotten. He apologized profusely. Endlessly. Until I acknowledged it, until I told him it was okay, until I told him he hadn’t even really done anything wrong, until I was practically in tears.



Afterward, he made tea. I watched him closely. As far as I could tell, he didn’t put anything in it. I still didn’t want to drink it.



But I did anyway.



After he fell asleep, I went to the carnival by myself for the third time.



And when I crawled out into that perfect, bright autumn day, a weight I hadn’t even realized I’d been carrying fell off my shoulders. I sighed with relief. The birds seemed to echo it in their song, which made me smile.



When I approached the gate, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth flipped upside down. “The baby dragon isn’t here to burn down my carnival, is she?”



“Never.”



He struck again, too fast to see, too fast to even feel until it was done. His hands on my shoulders, not squeezing but bearing down.



“Who are you?” he asked.



“The dragon,” I said.



He leaned in, squinting. “Are you sure? You look like a Wendy to me.”



I wrenched free and marched past the gate, but not before throwing him the dirtiest look I could muster.



Asher was waiting for me on the midway, more radiant than ever. “I knew you were coming. I knew it!” He knotted his hand through mine and pulled me down the promenade.



We found Amanda. She was, and remains, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Outer space incarnate. Darker and brighter than the universe itself.



I could probably talk for days about the carnival, which is weird because I can’t even recall specific memories. Just a whirlwind of things that were beautiful and things that were pretending to be beautiful, all of them terrifying and all of them exhilarating.



When I got home the next morning, I noticed new scales on my shoulder. One on the left, two on the right.



That was our pattern for weeks.



Every night, I’d meet Asher and Amanda in the courtyard to sneak down to the carnival under Gut Street.



When I got back every morning, I had new scales. Hard and smooth and bright. Bright as the light in the carnival. Pure autumn glory.



Amanda and Asher both regarded my scales with awe. “You’re so lucky,” Amanda breathed. “Atomic bombs detonate. Black holes collapse. But nothing can kill a dragon.”



I was *sure* they were drugging me, and themselves too. I know that sounds paranoid, but I figured they’d finally figured out how to dose me in a way I couldn’t detect.



And you know what? I didn’t care.



I did care about the scales, though. I hid them from everyone else, myself included. Looking at them made me feel insane. Wearing long sleeves and sweatshirts in Stanislaus County in the summer is brutal, but it kept me from having to look at myself.



The hardest part was Jason. I couldn’t hide the scales from him, so I just sort of hid from him. 

But that didn’t last forever. How could it?



I finally showed him hoping against hope that he’d think they were beautiful.



Instead, he told me how much it hurt him to see them, to know I’d gone to the carnival, and how stupid I was, and all he wanted was the best for me. How maybe I thought Nothing At All wasn’t good enough for a Dragon. And I’d be right, because he wasn’t good enough for anything. He was just nothing.



By the end, I was crying.



Once we were done, I tiptoed into his bathroom and pulled my own scales off.



I stayed away from the carnival after that.



The confusing thing was, I knew that staying away was the right thing to do. But it felt like I was doing the right thing for the wrong reason.



And that just meant I was doing the wrong thing anyway. 



Asher didn’t understand why I stopped going. He thought I was scared. He offered to protect me, to punch the lights out of the ticket man, to explode at anyone who made me feel threatened.



One afternoon, in the middle of one of these wheedling sessions, he stopped dead.



“What?” I asked.



He struck so fast I couldn’t react and tugged my shirt down past my shoulder, exposing the bare mottled skin where scales had been.



“Where are they?” 



His voice was soft, even gentle. But it made me shudder.



I yanked it back up. “They fell off. Actually, they were never there because people don’t have scales.”



“Dragons do.” He frowned. “They’ll never grow if you hide them. They need the sun.”



“I don’t want them to grow.”



“Why?”



“Because they’re not real, and even if they are I wouldn’t have them if I hadn’t gone to the carnival.”



He was quiet for a while. 



Then —



“I can barely see anymore. It started the first time I went to the carnival. I’m almost blind now. But I can do and feel everything else a thousand times better. By comparison, seeing crippled me. Without your scales, you’re crippled.” 



“You’re not making any sense. And the scales aren’t even real.” I believed this, and still do. “We’re all seeing things. I don’t know how, exactly, but I know some kind of drug is—”



“There’s no drug,” he said. “Only us.”



I felt humiliated. Scared, too. Scared that we were losing our minds. Scared that this was a bad trip that would never end. Scared that Asher would see in my face that I had pulled my own scales off. 



So I went home.



Jason came by. The first thing he did was check me for new scales. Maybe because he saw me with Asher. Who knows? Who cares? I don’t. Not anymore.



Late that night, I went back to the courtyard. I just wanted to be alone. No Jason, no Asher, no Amanda who didn’t even want to talk to me anyway. I didn’t expect anyone to be there, especially not this late.



Except Asher was. 



“Did he take your scales?” he asked.



He was practically glowing. Golden. He looked like an angel. I noticed, though, that his eyes weren’t right. Stiff, somehow. Unmoving. Unseeing.



“No.”



“What happened? Scales don’t fall off unless they rot. Are you rotting?”



“No.”



He grabbed my hands and raised them to his face and breathed deeply. “Why do I smell them on your hands? Scales never grew on your hands.”



My heart thundered. I tried to distract him, tried to make him talk, to say anything, think about anything but—



“You pulled them off.” He sounded almost awestruck. “You took your own scales away.”



He pulled me to my feet, and I let him.



I let him lead me through the courtyard, down the road, and into the culvert.



I let him lead me down the shimmering tree-lined lane with its screaming chorus of unearthly birds, all the way to the carnival under Gut Street.



Asher rang the bell. The ticket man erupted into being, all big bright eyes and an unhappy mouth that did not turn into a smile this time.



Asher said, “My dragon has no scales.”



The ticket man struck, leaping over the counter and crushing me in a bear hug so tight I couldn’t breathe. Dark spots swarmed my vision, and I felt so warm. I wondered, dimly, what would happen to my body down here in the carnival. I decided that I didn’t want to know.



Then the ticket man let go.



Air rushed back. My hands flew to my chest, checking instinctively for injury. Where there should have been skin, I felt something hard and smooth.



Panicking, I pulled my shirt over my head. I knew, somehow, that there was no need for modesty now. And sure enough, when I looked down:



Scales, bright as the sun, red as autumn, shimmering everywhere the ticket man touched. Shoulder to hip, blinding in the afternoon light. Bright as a supernova.



But all I could see was Jason’s face.



I started to peel them away.



Asher lunged. I twisted to the side, but he hit me anyway. Only…the hit didn’t hurt. He tried to grab me, but his hands slid right off. He tried again, and I slipped away.



The ticket man struck. Too fast to see. Too fast to react. And he punched me, square in the chest.



I didn’t even feel it.



But his hand folded in on itself, a mass of blood and rubbery skin and splintered bone. Like a car accordioning in a wreck.



He looked down at his hand, then back at me.



His unhappy mouth turned into a very happy one indeed, and he laughed.



I ran.



His laughter chased me down the street, past the perfect houses and the gleaming sidewalks and the trees all green and gold and red, drowning out the deafening birdsong.



I hit the culvert on my knees and crawled away.



Jason found me cowering in my room, sobbing as I pulled off the scales. They wouldn’t come off easily anymore. They left bruises and blood.



I thought he’d be gentle when he saw that I was trying, when he saw the blood-stained pile shining in the afternoon sun.



But he only got angry.



It made me cry. That worked, somehow. When I was small and scared and telling him how sorry I was, how he was right, how he’d been right all along, he stopped being angry and was himself again. Kind and sweet and gentle.



That should have been the end, but it wasn’t.



Asher came to me that night. I lived on the third story of the apartment. So when I heard tapping on my window, I thought I was dreaming.



When I looked over and saw Asher, radiant and bright as the rising sun with eyes dull and milky, I still thought I was dreaming.



Until he said my name. “Come home. You’re there. I know you’re there. I smell you.”



I got out of bed very slowly, very carefully. I crept out of my room, and down the hall, and out of my apartment, and to Jason.



Long story short — or short story shorter — Jason moved, and took me with him.



My scales kept growing. I kept pulling them. I guess that means nothing changed.



I don’t know if Jason changed or not.



All I know is he couldn’t cope. He couldn’t hold down a job. His well-managed addiction spiraled out of control. He couldn’t even handle his own feelings. He blamed himself for having them, and blamed me for making them worse, and then apologized for blaming me and making me sad. Whenever he got upset or whenever I got upset, he always apologized. Always sobbed his heart out. Always said he was so sorry for being nothing. I didn’t like how he sounded when he apologized for being nothing, though.



Maybe it was just my teenage insecurity, but whenever he apologized for being nothing, he didn’t sound sorry.



He just sounded cruel.



Watching him fade made me feel so guilty.



I told him that once, expecting him to apologize yet again.



But what he said was, “You should be. You’re the one who grew scales.”



That was the day I decided to stop pulling them.



When I stopped pulling them, Jason went off the deep end.



There was one night where I couldn’t take it anymore. He was high as a kite, shivering and shuddering after taking God knew what. I wanted to call an ambulance. 



He said, “An ambulance is too much money to waste on nothing.”



Instead of calling an ambulance. I got into bed and waited for him to fall asleep. Then I searched the house for all his shit, flushing everything I found down the toilet.



After that, I went for a walk.



I wandered for a long time. At some point, I noticed a culvert.



And inside it, something radiant.



I wasn’t even surprised when Asher crawled out.



Twice as tall as he’d ever been, beautiful in ways that nothing should be beautiful. Except for his eyes. Where his eyes had been was a bony plate, glimmering the same color as his wide, white smile.



I turned around and went back home, where I crawled into bed next to Jason.



When I woke up, he was dead.



And as I sat there, numb and angry and guiltier than I have ever been, I felt something hard and light tumble down my stomach..



Then another, and another. Then a cascade



I took off my shirt and watched all my scales slide off.



They never grew back. 



I guess that means Nothing killed the dragon after all.





\* \* \*



“So, can you believe I ever passed a psych eval, let alone three?” 



Christophe looked upset. “Do you really think that is a funny thing so say?”



Bypassing that, here’s the sequence of events that resulted in the above heart to heart with my least-favorite wolfman.



Long story short, the commander’s been coming down hard on me to explain what happened with Pierrot. I’ve told him everything I can, but he thinks I’m holding back. Worse, he thinks I might be a security risk. When staff in the Pantheon become security risks, they disappear.



So I’ve been stressing. I’m in trouble. I hate being in trouble, even as a whole-ass adult.



And I don’t think I’ve ever been in worse trouble in my life.



After my fifth post-Pierrot interrogation, I went out for a walk. The facility is deep in the woods, and I mean *deep.* I love being out there. The air is redolent of pine, which reminds me of all the good things about where I grew up while dredging up none of the bad things. It’s soothing.



So that’s what I was doing: Taking a long walk. I had my voice recorder to review yesterday’s interview and catch up on all the work I was missing thanks to the commander’s increasingly unhinged debriefs. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t focus. I finally gave up and tucked it into my pocket.



“You are not supposed to take that outside the facility”



I admit, I screamed.



“You act like you see me for the first time every time,” Christophe complained. 



“What are you doing out here?”



“Working.” He drew up beside me. The usual anxiety and adrenaline that accompanied his presence surged, but for once I was too scared of other things to particularly care. “Unlike you.”



“Then go work.”



“You are my work.”



I thought I was going to cry from frustration. “Are you taking me back for another round with the commander?”



“No. I want to talk to you.”



“About what?”



“Whatever you are holding back, stop. If you don’t talk — or if you do talk and they don’t believe you — they will send you down for evaluation.”



“Down where?”



“R&D.”



“Research and Development?”



“Yes, but we call it Research and Destruction.”



“Great. Have they evaluated you?”



“Many times. It is why I am so cooperative.” 



I hesitated. “I really don’t know what else to tell them.”



“You are lying.”



He was right.



“It has nothing to do with Pierrot or anything.”



“What does it have to do with?”



“Drugs. And a carnival.”



“I was in a carnival once. In the freak show.”



“You didn’t tell me about that.”



“I haven’t told anybody about that, and I don’t want to. Especially not you.”



For some reason, this gave me an idea. “You want to do me a favor?”



“Is there any answer I can give that will not upset you somehow?”



I pulled the voice recorder out of my pocket and held it out. “Here. It’ll be easier talking out here, even to you, than in there with the commander breathing down my neck. He trusts you, and you can tell when I’m lying anyway, right?”



“You tell on yourself. I only hear it.”



“Whatever. Just take it.”



He did. 



I started talking. 



And that’s how I told the scariest thing in the Pantheon the story of how nothing killed a dragon.



Then I made my stupid joke about psych evals, and he told me it wasn’t funny. Then he said, “You forgot all of this happened to you?”



“Definitely not. I just thought everyone was drugging me or something.”



He looked pained. “That is not what drugs do.” Then he looked down at the voice recorder. “I don’t think the commander should hear this.”



“Why?”



“I know the commander. I know he will want to try to make your scales grow back. It seems they grew when you were not feeling safe.”



“They didn’t grow. They weren’t real.”



“I think they were. He will think so too. He will make you feel unsafe to try and make them grow. He will probably use me to do it, and he will make sure I have all my teeth for it. I don’t want that any more than you.”



“What was the point of talking to you?”



“Because I know you are not lying.”



“How does that help me?”



“I will tell him we spoke and that you are confused and frightened, but hiding nothing.”



He held the recorder out.



Anyway, my impromptu interview wasn’t the most important thing that happened tonight.



The most important thing happened when we got back.



Charlie rushed out to meet us. “Where have you been?”



“Working together,” said Christophe.



Charlie looked at us with an expression I didn’t like, but also found amusing. “You’re going to have to work together some other time because you’ve got actual work to do.”



“Which is?”



“The Harlequin.”



I swear my heart stopped.



“They’re ready to take him, and we're leaving at midnight. Rafael’s already pissed.” He looked at me. “So you need to be really careful.”

He and Christophe exchanged another look I didn’t like. We got ready, and now we’re waiting to deploy or whatever the word is for what we’re about to do.



I wish I hadn't spent my last night on earth telling the big bad wolf about the carnival under Gut Street.

He has had some relationship issues in the past that cause him to have pretty severe trust issues. I have shown him nothing but trust in the months I’ve known him, but he still doubts me. He’s semi-controlling. For instance, he doesn’t like me having certain girl friends, doesn’t let me go to the gym by myself, persists on having my location 24/7, wants me to stay on the phone constantly when we aren’t together so he knows “i’m not with another guy,” and gets mad when I go out of town to see my family because I could be doing “fuck shit” instead of actually seeing them. I have turned my location on for him to stop freaking out, but it seems like it’s done nothing for him. He constantly calls if I go somewhere that seems abnormal like thrift stores, local coffee shops, etc. 

The main reason I’m writing this is because I have a certain guy friend that I’ve known for quite some while. This guy friend and I have never done anything sexual, flirty, talked about a relationship; it’s just been a causal friendship with us occasionally talking about our day, jobs, etc. He says he doesn’t trust this guy after he has already eliminated so many people in my life already. I really don’t feel like ruining a genuine friendship over a fresh relationship but I want to make him happy. I let him see our texts and offered to let him meet this guy so he knows nothing is going on. 

At first, he accepted that idea and said he would feel more comfortable with me and him remaining friends if he knew him. I brought it up that he could sometime soon and he totally went back on his word. I’m confused because he switches up so fast. I understand that my boyfriend has boundaries and this could possibly make him uncomfortable, but I’ve done nothing but reassurance him through every possible effort to let him see it’s nothing more than a text here and there about life. I mainly am wondering what I should do at this point. I’ve already lost so many people because of him, some I can understand the reasoning behind, but others, it makes no sense. 

He is giving me ultimatums and telling me he’ll break up with me if I don’t stop. I don’t see how this is fair to me and I’ve been given a timeframe in which I need to “act” on this. Any advice is welcome. Thanks! ",1,1733373489.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

* The stairs being a different color than the rest of the flooring but it is still the same material
* The fireplace shape and size and the stone color
* The cabinets look like the early days of Ikea trying to do “wood look” (nothing wrong with Ikea  but she did not pay Ikea prices for what she got) 
* The living room rug is a total miss on all fronts. Should have chosen a whole different rug
* The coffee table seems to be about 4” tall. Super uncomfortable to reach down for a drink from the couch (the couch is a whole other no no)
* All of her decor was purchased all at once from the same place. She got duplicates of everything. It looks like a storefront, not a curated collection
* Half the windows are black, the rest are white
* In a recent story there was a glimpse of the front exterior of her house. The color is the same beige/brown as when she bought it. Why is the back white???
* That quartzite has been used by every influencer in the last two years. Is there no other stone in the world?
* The poop brown doors
* The size of the island. They should have extended the kitchen on the sink side and turn the island the other way. That would have given them at least another 30” 
* The hardware she chose is barely visible on the cabinet doors
* The basic looking appliances she got vs the “custom” look she was going for in the house
* All the vessel sinks

No harm there - we’ve all been there at some point. So I listen and support and offer advice when I’m asked, but this weekend is different. 

She asked if they could both stay at my house this weekend while they’re in town for a wedding. I, of course, would love to have her here and even have a girls night planned with my other friends that she can join. The problem is I don’t want him staying at my house alone while we go to the girls night. I don’t want him eating my food. I don’t want him laying on my couch. I don’t want him alone with my dog. You get the point. Not to mention, last time they stayed at my place he broke 3 martini glasses (honestly well done), a coffee mug and helped himself to whatever food I had in my fridge. He also left his used, wet towel on the guest bed duvet. Come on man, were you raised in a barn? Aside from those points, I work for a large, public company in a role that deals with private financial information. I don’t want him snooping around in my office, etc. Not trying to sound rude or elitist but it’s just a concern of mine given he seems to be a clout chaser. 

So…AITA if I tell her I don’t want him to stay in my house alone while we go out for girls night?

Going off of r/abrathatfits, it's 30K, but according to several other online calculators, it's 28J. I'm honestly willing to take what I can get, anything is better than my stupid sports bras, even one that doesn't fit super well. Some calculators for websites tell me to just contact customer support. I have no idea what the right size is, neither can I afford to get even nearly any bra.

 I just don't have the money to test them out. I set aside $40 for this, but I can't keep cutting into my grocery budget like this. I only make ~800 a month, If I spend that $40, I'll need to cut back on food. I already don't eat a lot, but what other choice do I have?

Oral health is an essential component of overall well-being, and choosing the right toothpaste is a critical decision in maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Among the many toothpaste brands available, Parodontax and Arm & Hammer are two well-known names that offer unique benefits tailored to specific oral care needs. This article will provide a detailed comparison of these two brands, analyzing their formulations, effectiveness, target audience, ingredients, pricing, and consumer reviews. By the end, you’ll have a clearer understanding of which toothpaste might best suit your oral hygiene routine.

It is designed for individuals who are prone to gum issues and seek a product that prioritizes gum health.

Glycerin: A moisturizing agent to prevent dryness.

Hydrated silica: A mild abrasive to help remove stains and plaque.

Herbal extracts: Ingredients like mint, chamomile, and echinacea, which provide a soothing effect.

Parodontax’s slightly salty taste is a notable characteristic due to the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate.

Sodium fluoride: For cavity prevention.

Calcium carbonate: For gentle abrasion.

Whitening: Baking soda is a gentle yet effective stain remover, making it a top choice for those seeking whiter teeth.

Deep Cleaning: The fine particles in baking soda penetrate crevices and hard-to-reach areas.

Acid Neutralization: Baking soda helps maintain a balanced pH in the mouth, reducing the risk of enamel erosion.

Freshness: Variants containing peroxide offer added freshness and whitening power.

Effectiveness

Parodontax

Parodontax is highly effective for individuals dealing with gum-related issues. Regular use helps reduce plaque and bleeding gums significantly within a few weeks. Its fluoride content ensures that teeth are protected against cavities, while the additional herbal ingredients offer soothing benefits.

Clinical studies support Parodontax's claims, showing that it can reduce gum inflammation and bleeding by addressing the root cause: plaque buildup. However, it may not be the best choice for those whose primary concern is whitening.

Arm & Hammer

Arm & Hammer excels in whitening and cleaning, thanks to its signature baking soda formula. It effectively removes surface stains caused by coffee, tea, and smoking without harsh abrasives, making it gentle on enamel. Additionally, it provides a fresh, clean feeling by neutralizing oral acids.

While it may not be specifically designed to combat gum disease, its deep-cleaning properties help maintain overall oral health.

Target Audience

Criterion	Parodontax	Arm & Hammer

Gum Health	Ideal for people with gum sensitivity.	General gum health, not specialized.

Whitening Needs	Minimal whitening benefits.	Strong whitening focus.

Sensitive Teeth	Some variants for sensitivity exist.	Offers sensitive-teeth formulas.

Cavity Prevention	High fluoride content for prevention.	Moderate fluoride, depends on variant.

Budget-Friendly	Mid-to-high price range.	More budget-friendly options.

Pricing

The price of toothpaste varies based on region, retailer, and product size. Below is a general comparison:

Parodontax: Ranges between $6 to $8 for a standard 3.4 oz tube. The price is justified by its specialized formulation targeting gum health.

Arm & Hammer: Ranges between $4 to $6 for a standard 4.3 oz tube, making it a more economical choice for everyday use.

Consumer Reviews

Parodontax

Consumers often praise Parodontax for its effectiveness in reducing gum bleeding and improving gum health. However, some users find the salty taste off-putting, which may take time to get used to.

Common Positive Reviews:

""My gums stopped bleeding after just two weeks of use.""

""It’s the only toothpaste that works for my gum issues.""

Common Negative Reviews:

""The salty taste was hard to adjust to.""

""It’s more expensive than other toothpaste brands.""

Arm & Hammer

Arm & Hammer receives accolades for its whitening capabilities and value for money. Some users report that its taste and texture are not as smooth as traditional toothpaste, which could be a downside for some.

Common Positive Reviews:

""My teeth look noticeably whiter in just a few uses.""

""It leaves my mouth feeling super clean and fresh.""

Common Negative Reviews:

""The gritty texture isn’t for everyone.""

""It doesn’t foam as much as regular toothpaste.""

Which Toothpaste is Right for You?

Choose Parodontax if:

You have gum issues such as bleeding or inflammation.

You prioritize gum health over whitening.

You are willing to pay a premium for a specialized formulation.

Choose Arm & Hammer if:

Whitening is your primary concern.

You want a deep-cleaning toothpaste with natural ingredients.

You are budget-conscious and looking for an affordable yet effective option.

Conclusion

Both Parodontax and Arm & Hammer are excellent choices, but they cater to different needs. Parodontax focuses on gum health, making it a go-to option for individuals with gum-related issues. On the other hand, Arm & Hammer’s baking soda-based formula excels in whitening and deep cleaning, making it ideal for those looking to brighten their smiles and achieve a fresh, clean mouthfeel.

Your choice ultimately depends on your oral health priorities and personal preferences. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups remain essential regardless of the toothpaste you choose.",0,1733373026.0,HealthRus,0,0.5,False

1h70piq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1h70piq/not_a_good_day/,Not a good day. ,"Today was not a good day for me. I feel that I’ve always had anxiety, and I’ve always felt that I can manage it. But this was my day today. Everything was normal. I went to therapy in morning. Had coffee with my sister, and went to a book store. Went home and watched a show before work. Everything was fine up until I had to go to work. Now, for a little back story. I don’t like my job. I’ve been in retail for almost 3 years now. It sucks but I’ve always just felt with it and plan to leave at the start of next year. I have 0 problems with my coworkers (I’m pretty much friends with all of them), it’s mainly the retail environment and the customers that come in. 

Now, I’ve never been really anxious at work. I’ve had anxiety at work a little. But recently I’ve been feeling more panicked. Like I’ll get spurts of anxiety. It’s not terrible but I don’t like it. But today was different, because I got in my car and had a panic attack. Usually if I have a panic attack or anxiety attack it’s usually just me being quiet and being in my head and trying to drown out racing thoughts. But this was bad. It felt like I couldn’t breathe. I was hyperventilating a little bit. I could feel my heart racing. I was dissociated. I did this while also driving to work. 

When I got into work I just was out of it. I didn’t care about anything and my anxiety was still high. I had panic moments at work too. I would just there at work and feel more panicked. I eventually was calm. But it felt exhausting. It felt like an impending doom that I couldn’t get out of. I got home from work laid down and just cried. One of the hardest I’ve ever cried before. 

I scheduled an emergency appointment with my therapist tomorrow to discuss what happened. I don’t know why this is happening. I don’t know why I’ve been getting more panicked. It just wasn’t a good day. Anybody else got something similar? Or how their anxiety is lately? 

P.S. I was prescribed lexapro by my doctor for my depression and anxiety. I took it for 2 days and stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago. I just didn’t want to be on it for long term. I was also scared of withdrawing from it if I eventually wanted to be off of it. If I did go back to meds it would be more on the anti anxiety side. Not just an antidepressants. (Which i know lexapro treats both). ",1,1733372514.0,Anxiety,0,0.99,False

**Backstory:**

my ex had to pay rent for her new place but since she didn't have the money from another source come in yet, I said you can just borrow it and then give it back when it comes in. She was having a very bad day that day and she was definitely under a lot of stress.

I completely forgot about it but a week or so later remembered and got annoyed that I never heard anything about it and she had told me the previous day she was broke when I realized that I never got that $500 I sent the following text:

**Me:** ""Whatever happened to the money you were waiting on from buy me a coffee? I paid $500 of your rent so that you didn't have to wait on them but then you never told me? I'm guessing that's not happening""

After a few minor responses she sent this:

**Her:** ""I don't know what I did to you that you're texting me upset this morning? I legit haven't paid my phone bill how would I have paid you back""

**Me:** ""Yes you have to get car fixed and you have to pay rent and you have to not be broke. All I'm saying is it's not cool to not tell me when it was supposed to be a very temporary thing with the rent.. You obviously don't have money to pay me and that's ok the others are more important.""

After a lot of heated back and forth of saying to me I shouldn't be coming at her like that and me saying it's ok you forgot, I understand and that's ok, and her apologizing and myself accepting the apology things seemed under control, but nope.

These are some of the back and forth comments:

**Her:** ""Pfft literally fucking woke up and was gonna text you ""I hope you're feeling better today, have a fucking good one""

**Me:** ""That's your response to realizing that you got $500 from me and totally forgot about it. You can be so mean""

**Her:** ""No you can be so mean. You started this off in an unnecessary rude manner calling me uncool for something I forgot due to my mental health/ addiction/trauma/homeless situation""

**Her:** ""No my fucking response is why attack me when you know I'm doing my best. Calling me uncool is name calling and mean""

**Her:** ""Out there spending money all Willy nilly. I told you yesterday I couldn't pay most of my bills. Ok you know what I am fucking done. I am being a good friend and trying and you saying I'm not bc I can't is so fucking mean. Ok I'll stop trying. I won't prioritize you or trying to make space. Bc ya I'm a selfish failure. It actually does take effort for me to be a good friend so if you don't feel that WOW""

**Me:** ""Stop with the self pity here. I am here for you non stop, I know you are struggling I know you are doing your best""

**Her:** ""I'm not fucking self pitying, I'm explaining.

**Me:** But this turned into a full on attack from asking you what happened to that loan""

**Me:** I'm sorry if it came off harsh

This turned into a long series of texts from her explaining why she is in the state she is and asked me to never say she was having a pity party and my response was ""Sorry you are right on that"" we came to a good conclusion. Things were perfectly fine and loving in both directions, but a few days later I visit her to take her to breakfast and to get her a compressor she needed for some furniture restoration and she right off the bat flipped out on me and was yelling at me non stop bringing up the pity comment once more without allowing me to speak, about how insensitive I am, how I have no empathy, after which I left really frustrated and told her in text that I will not be treated that way.

Her final response was ""What you call a pity party is me asking for basic human decency and compassion.

Since all this it has turned into a real mess and I think this pity comment was the catalyst to a lot of that mess. I am trying to find out if I am really the asshole. I fully understand, as I have explained to her many times that it came off really harsh and have apologized for it several times, but I still think it was really unfair to turn it me being inconsiderate of her situation instead of just simply apologizing, especially since I consistently have helped through all these struggles because I hate to see her suffer.",1,1733372389.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I'd used kitchen scraps, including fruit and vegetable peelings, eggshells, and coffee grounds, and leaves from the yard. I thought I'd mixed it pretty well before leaving it to sit and that it was moist enough.

Come spring it was still in recognizable chunks and my wife got furious at me for ""not doing it right."" She said she was taking over, which lasted for a few weeks until she stopped doing anything to it, so I started back up. One thing I've been doing differently is using a weed whacker to break the leaves up into dust and a blender to pulverize the wet kitchen stuff. This is probably overkill but I don't want a repeat of last spring. Also she claims you shouldn't put coffee grounds in there because it makes the soil too acid, but I read an article on a university website which said otherwise. In general is there anything that I need to do differently? Turn it during the winter? Add moisture? Add more materials to it?

I’m a new parent navigating the challenges of nighttime feedings with my newborn daughter, and I need your help. I’m struggling to stay alert during these sessions without relying on unhealthy strategies like excessive eating or stimulants, which are taking a toll on me.

Here’s the situation:

I’m waking up every 2-3 hours to feed her, staying awake for 30-90 minutes, and then going back to sleep. Falling asleep while feeding her is dangerous and not an option.

Here are the methods I’ve tried that haven’t worked long-term:

--Stimulants: Ritalin, 5-hour energy, decaf coffee, DayQuil.

--Physical actions: Splashing cold water on my face, brushing my teeth, looking up, massaging the back of my neck.

--Eating excessively: I’ll eat an entire apple when I wake up, then go through Jolly Ranchers like crazy.

--Talking or storytelling: This works if my spouse is awake too, but it’s not always feasible.


Now I’m looking for outside-the-box solutions or hacks to stay awake and alert during these times. Some ideas I’m considering include:

--Nasal sprays.

--Eye drops.

--Throat sprays.

--Supplements (any suggestions?).

--Reflex manipulation (e.g., diving backward or free-falling into the bed).

--Headphones (loud music, specific frequencies, podcasts).

--Heating pads or ice on my feet.


If you have thoughts or suggestions related to the above ideas, or if you’ve found any other creative solutions, I’d love to hear them. Any and all ideas are welcome!

Thanks in advance for your help!

So I have a friend (well did don't know where I stand with this person currently.) Anyways a couple of years ago she took me to a concert. It was a kpop concert (not a kpop fan and more of a rocker girl 🤭🤘). 

Then we went to another concert I was looking forward to. It was the highlight of my year and I was happy to hear she wanted me to go.  That year was a rough year and bad for me. Well this year we went to another concert (kpop again). I was going to talk about that concert. 

She said she regrets going to that concert and doesn't want to talk about it. She regrets it because it was the same day her friend got married. She wishes she would of went to that wedding. I added the friend that same year. Then she wanted me to unfriend her and I listened. 

Then a few months ago I went down to my hometown for a week in the summer. She was going to the movies with her sister. Well I ended up finding out she went with another friend via Instagram. Before she told me that she was going with her sister and didn't mention anyone else. I don't care if she has other friends but she lied to me. 

Then recently we had dinner plans with another friend of ours. But she said she ate something and wasn't hungry. She wanted to change the time. So I did. But then she didn't want to do it anymore and canceled on me. We had this planned for almost two weeks. We did do craft stores and coffee but it was very quick and brief.
