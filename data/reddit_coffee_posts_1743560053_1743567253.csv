I use cor-vital thera-coffee made as instructed with RO water. RO water (and I anticipate coffee also) is of low PH. I cannot handle even just RO water by itself. Hurts! 

Wondering if anyone has tried adding food-grade baking soda to increase PH? 

I have and it is soooo much easier- a way different experience. But I honestly don't know if I'm messing up my microbiome. 

Anyone have experience here? I can't find anything online about adding baking soda to enemas or anything regarding pH and irritating that sensitive lining.

I might have asked her out mildly for a cup of coffee and she straight up said no, which is fine. But the way she presented the replies straight up drove me downhill to a panic attack. I had no intentions in offending her in any way. 

So context is we have been socialising outside work, and recently she invited me over for dinner, it was pleasant and friendly, had decent time chatting, her not immediate family was there with her at that time (cousin and aunt). She cooked a lot for that night, which is nice. I was confused what her intentions are towards me. So I thought would be great to know her better outside work, so I texted her over WhatsApp, that last night dinner was great, and whether she would like to hangout over a coffee after office nearby, to which she replied “are you asking casually or is it a date 😂?”, I didn’t wanna push her further so I replied that I liked talking to her and nothing else. She replied that thanks for letting me know, that she appreciates the invite but she doesn’t think it’s appropriate. And that’s when panic attack hit me as to wtf have i done here. I was consulting a female close friend as well during the convo as to what is happening, she says to be chill. So I replied that “thanks for letting me know, I hope u didn’t feel uncomfortable, Goodnight! “, she replied “Not at all! Goodnight!”

I am super embarrassed with this exchange and I wish I could go back in time and not have done this shit. She looks up to me as colleague but I’m not sure how I’ll face her at office after this. My mind is racking all over. I hate myself now. ",3,1743566710.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,1.0,False
1jpfwsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jpfwsd/rosewood_manor/,Rosewood Manor,"December 24^(th), 2024  
  
The manor is dark, nearly matching the gray sky. Elena steps out of her old car, eyes locked on the building. The architecture is stunningly elaborate, it’s age barely putting a dent in the sight of the manor. Elena had strangely inherited the house from a very distant relative, one she had never met, and one that realistically wouldn’t have even known she existed, which gave her bleak expectations for the manor, but she was proven wrong. She walks up the cracked stone stairs, the doors standing menacingly in front of her. The key to the house was, appropriately, a skeleton key. She put it in the hole and turned it. The doors swung open automatically upon the key turning, adding to the mystique. The halls, the stairs and the carpet all felt grand, far too posh for Elena’s lifestyle. An envelope sits on the floor in front of her. She picks it up and peels it open. The letter inside is short, simple.  
*“Ms. Elena Jackson, you have inherited this house upon the death of Gerald Newman, who has invited you to a dinner at this estate at four PM. Sort of a housewarming party, if you will. Signed, Butler Ebeneezer.”*  
She was invited to dinner… by a dead man? It has to be a typo, she thought. But the letter also tells her that the manor has a butler, one Elena wasn’t informed about by Gerald’s laywer.  
  
At 4 PM, she sits down at the grand dining table, mostly thinking about how the chandelier above her could fall at any moment. She’d never heard from or seen the butler, even when doing a full solo tour of the house earlier, but yet the entire table was stocked with endless food, and then variations on that. The butler must be shy, or grieving over Gerald’s death.  
The wall in front of her is almost completely covered in a massive painting, a portrait of at least over forty people. The painting is old, from at least a hundred years ago, yet many of the people portrayed look very… modern. And very creepy, for that matter, like the eyes are following her.  
  
After the dinner, she sits down in one of the many bedrooms in the manor, the biggest one specifically. The bookcases and drawers of the house are a treasure trove of history and information, one she can’t stop pursuing. In one of the drawers in an old studying desk, she finds a newspaper, dated August 14^(th), 1923. The headline shocks Elena.  
**“NEWMAN FAMILY KILLED IN TRAGIC ACCIDENT”**  
She contemplates the tragedy and how it happened in the very house she’s sitting in. She continues reading.  
*“The entire Newman family, including visiting relatives and their beloved butler, Ebeneezer, were killed yesterday in a fire that started on the second floor of the house, burning through and causing the entire ceiling to collapse on them as they peacefully ate dinner.”*  
Butler Ebeneezer? The same butler who just signed the letter that invited her to a solo dinner? So many things rush through her mind but she knew one thing: She needed to leave. She rushed down the stairs and trips on a loose cord, falling on her face but Elena keeps running. She approaches the door and pries on the door. But it won’t open. She rushes to the lounge room with a massive window, but it’s gone, replaced by a wall. She slumps against the seemingly supernatural wall and starts sobbing. Why her? Why does she deserve this? She was so naive, she should’ve left the second she found the first letter.  
  
Later that night, she’s still crying. But there’s a rustling sound downstairs, along with the sounds of conversation, the kind of ambiance you’d hear in a coffee shop.  
She approaches the lantern lit dining room to find no one, only a spread of food fit for a king. She walks in, still horrified but hungry, more than she’s ever been. Elena is always having to look over her shoulder, but when she does, the dining room is closed off. No windows, no walls, and now, no light. A gust of wind flows through the room out of nowhere and blows all the candles and lanterns out. She feels multiple things grabbing her from the shadows, like dozens of hands, but feels nothing. She is consumed by the darkness.  
And Elena’s face is just another of the many on the portrait.",1,1743566694.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

----------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Hyz01vspBk): **March 23, 2025**

I’m 28M and I’ve been with my husband (29M) for 7 years, married for almost one. This has been a genuinely good relationship. I love him deeply, and we’ve built something I’m proud of. He fits in great with my family, and I’ve always felt at home with his. I’m close with his younger brother and his girlfriend, but the person I’ve always felt the strongest connection with is his mom.

A few years back, I went through a rough depressive episode, and she was one of the only people who truly showed up for me. She didn’t treat me like “her son’s partner,” she treated me like family. I’ve always loved her for that. I’m close with my FIL too, but with my MIL, it always felt like more of a friendship.

Then, everything flipped. Just after Christmas, my FIL sat us all down and told us that she had been having an affair, and that it wasn’t the first time. He said he tried to make things work, but he couldn’t do it anymore. He was heartbroken, and it shattered the whole family. My husband and his brothers were crushed. They all cut contact with her, and she moved out soon after.

I get it. Cheating is a betrayal, especially after decades of marriage. I’m not trying to excuse what she did. But I also couldn’t ignore the fact that, during one of the worst times in my life, she showed me care and kindness when I felt like I had no one. That stayed with me.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me directly. She said she was running low on rent and didn’t know who else to ask. She sounded anxious and desperate. I helped her. It wasn’t a huge amount, and she was incredibly grateful. She asked if I’d be willing to meet her for coffee. I said yes.

When we met, she broke down. She told me she’d tried reaching out to her sons, but none of them responded. I listened. I didn’t try to defend her or fix anything. I just tried to be there for her, the way she once was for me.

Later that evening, I told my husband about it. He completely lost it. He said I betrayed him and went behind his back, and he left the house. The next day, I tried to explain where I was coming from. I told him I wasn’t trying to choose sides. I just reacted to someone I care about being in a tough spot. He didn’t say much, just told me not to do it again.

When his brothers found out, they were disappointed in me too. They said I crossed a line and should’ve respected their decision to cut contact.

Now I feel stuck. I understand why they’re upset. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I just couldn’t turn my back on someone who once didn’t turn her back on me. I wasn’t trying to undermine their pain. I was trying to act with compassion.

I’m not here to justify what I did, and I understand why my husband feels hurt. I acted on instinct and compassion in a tough moment, but now I feel like I’ve damaged something really important.

I’d really appreciate advice as to what to do further? How do I navigate this?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Where you went wrong is not talking to your husband first before meeting your MIL. No matter if your decision was helping her out no matter what he said. You should have still let him know first how you feel and why. Going behind someone’s back and asking sorry later is not how loving relationships works.

**Commenter 2:** Probably should have talked to your husband first before going behind his back. I get you wanted to help, but he is your partner who is hurting and you deceived him just like his mother.

**Commenter 3:** In this kind of situation, people choose sides. Especially when it's fresh. You have to remember that cutting her out isn't just about them not wanting to see her, it's also about punishing her. That is part of why your husband's family is angry. I won't say whether punishing is right or wrong, ostracism can be very complex. When people in your orbit initiate something like this, your choices are to participate or to not. If you're not participating, then likely to them you are undermining their ""punishment"".

I think to your husband, she's HIS mother, your relationship with her exists through him, so if she is out of his life, he expects her to be out of your life too.

I'm sure to you helping her meant that your love for her was stronger than your disappointment in her actions. For people that were more hurt by her actions, it's just going to read like condoning.

Unfortunately, we don't really get to choose how our actions impact others.

Beyond that, you say you acted on instinct and compassion, but is that true? You make it sound like an involuntary action, that you took her call, met her for coffee where she talked about her songs not responding, and gave her money... all without thinking about how everyone else would feel about it? I don't believe that.

I think the first step is owning your actions. You either own them as a CHOICE you made that you deeply regret and wish you could change, or you own them as a choice you would make again in a heartbeat.

That means telling your husband either ""I regret meeting with your mother, I should have cared more about how it would impact you"" or ""your mother means too much to me and I'm not willing to cut her out of my life"". Then I guess you go from there.

There's no way to get out of this without hurting someone. But do remember who created this situation. It wasn't your husband or his brothers.

**Commenter 4:** The difference between your tough time and her tough time is that yours was brought on by mental illness (depression) and hers is the consequences of her own actions (cheating). I get that you wanted to return the compassion she showed you but you should let sleeping dogs lie

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/cIMJaQLkhf): **March 26, 2025 (three days later)**

Lost access to my previous account, so posting it from here

I didn’t expect my post to gain the kind of traction it did. I genuinely appreciate the advice many of you offered. Some responses were a bit… nuclear (understandably, Reddit), but I did take in a lot of perspectives that helped me reflect.

I want to share some context that I didn’t include in the original post, which I now realize was important. A few years ago, I went through a rough depressive episode. My husband and I were doing long-distance at the time—he was working abroad—and while he supported me as best he could, it was hard. His mom was the one who showed up in person. She dropped by often, made sure I was eating, even came with me to therapy a couple of times. It wasn’t some grand gesture, but it mattered. That kind of consistency stays with you.

So when she reached out a few days ago, anxious and saying she didn’t know who else to ask, I just reacted. I helped her with a bit of money—from my personal account, nothing major—and I agreed to meet her for coffee. I didn’t tell my husband before doing it, and that was where things really unraveled.

He was blindsided. We’ve always been the kind of couple who talks through the hard stuff, and I acted completely on my own. I see now how that felt like betrayal to him.

After a bit of space and some heavy conversations, we talked properly. He told me he’d spoken to his younger brother and finally got the full story about their last attempt to reach out to their mom. It wasn’t just an argument—it was bad. She said things that were apparently cruel and deeply personal, the kind of stuff that cuts years deep. I hadn’t known any of that. Neither of us had.

Hearing it changed something for me. The woman I saw at coffee was warm, vulnerable, even a little lost. But that’s not the woman his brother dealt with. And maybe both are real. Maybe she’s unraveling. Maybe she’s always been complicated. I honestly don’t know.

What I do know is that my husband’s boundaries are valid. He told me clearly that he’s not ready to reconnect with her, and that he’s not comfortable with me being in touch with her either. And after hearing what I’ve heard, I understand that. I’ve told him I’m stepping back. If she does reach out again, I’ll tell her that I can’t be the person in the middle—not unless something genuinely shifts between them first.

We both apologized. He for shutting down so quickly, me for making a decision without him when I shouldn’t have. We’re okay now.

I still think there’s something more going on with her—emotionally, maybe even mentally. She’s been a stay-at-home mom most of her life, her siblings live abroad, and from what I’ve heard, she’s already asked her friends for help before coming to me. That doesn’t excuse anything, but it does make me think about how lost she might be right now.

Still, that’s not something I can fix. Right now, my focus is on us. I can care about what his mom did for me in the past and still recognize that she’s hurt people I love.

This whole situation has been messy and a bit surreal. We didn’t walk away from it with everything fixed, but we’ve come out of it with a better understanding of where we each stand. We handled it the best we could, and at the end of the day, we’re still solid.

Still, I can’t lie—there’s a part of me that feels pulled toward who she was for me during that rough time. Letting go emotionally feels messier than I expected. How do you emotionally let go of someone who was once there for you, when the situation clearly calls for distance?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Couples resolving issues like adults (talking them out and listening to each other) is always nice to see in an update.

**Commenter 2:** I think your comment about ""maybe she's always been complicated"" is probably spot-on. Most people are complex, and you only see the side they allow you to.

**Commenter 3:** Tough situation for sure. In the end, you only knew the part of her she was willing to show you. Her compassion when you needed a friend was undeniable. However, there seems to be a lot more about her that you truly don't know and probably never will.

You tried to support her in a similar way that she supported you. That part is now done. And while you may not think of it as being in the same meaningful way, it was for her.

Let it go and feel good about being compassionate to her, but let your husband and his family dictate any further involvement.

Best wishes

**Commenter 4:** This is a healthy update and brave of you to recognize that the person you knew, who helped you, and the person who caused a lot of hurt are not mutually exclusive. They are both capable of existing at the same time, and they both come with their own type of grief in a situation like this. Reconciling the love and esteem you have for someone who fundamentally supported you through darkness is so challenging in light of them creating that darkness for someone else (many someones, really). Do you think maybe some therapy might help you short-term in processing these feelings?

I commend you and your husband both for communicating and giving each other grace during this. It’s easy to lose sight of things when we are fraught and emotionally charged. You both came together, created space and acknowledgement for one another, and came to the resolution you have now - however fragile it feels, it’s still progress. Things will become easier with time and a little bit of distance from it.

Good job!

And now my baby is 10 months and she's been drinking formula. I only breastfeed at nighttime when we go to bed and throughout the night. I drank a celcius at 11am today and it's now 930. Would it be okay to breastfeed? I had two Red Bulls recently but spread it out in two weeks I haven't touched an energy in over a year and they use to be my favorite. But man I missed them :( would it affect my baby ? I wasn't to concerned about Red Bull cause it's less caffeine and if I drink an energy drink that be the ONLY caffeine I have for the day. I won't drink coffee or soda. But the celcius is different than red bull so idk. 

I quit breastfeeding cause I went back to work at 2 months and I was full time and I'd pump ever two hours and then I started school and towards the end I was miserable and stresssed cause I felt like I wasn't making enough and my supply dropped and then baby stopped taking bottles and just wanted to breastfeed and stopped gaining weight and it was just to much. So I was only making 1-2oz every couple of hours and pumping all the time and cleaning stuff getting home late when I could be relaxing with my daughter just wasn't worth it anymore. So I switched. It was HARD and emotional. But we found the perfect bottle and formula. I probably don't make much milk at all now . I can hear her gulp so I'm surprised there's any at all.

While I'm making coffee I hear something off to my left. Turn my head to look. ""What?"" ""You're not homeless are you?"" ""Yeah, hitchhiking."" ""You hungry?"" ""Yeah."" ""I got you bro.""

Dude proceeds to make me a smoked pork, egg, and cheese croissant. I drop my gear down out of the way. Dude, ""Have a seat man. Relax and enjoy."" That shit was the bomb! Great start to the day! I give him my profuse thanks. ""That's the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had!"" Gear up. Outside. Cross hwy 1. Pick a good spot. Gear down. Thumb out.

Dropped off. Pick a spot. Gear down. Thumb out. I see a racing stripe on a Mustang coming my way. I didn't have real high hopes. I've been picked up in a lot of sweet rides, but generally the upper crust doesn't stop for me. The Mustang goes by. Barely a thought as it does.

Sure enough, a few minutes later, that Mustang makes a U-turn and pulls over right in front of me. ""Where you going?"" ""Eau Gallie. North end of Melbourne."" ""I'm going to Melbourne."" ""Cool. You can drop me on the One where you turn off. I'll try to remember the busses when we get there."" ""Ok. You can put your stuff in the back."" I maneuver the pack through the small opening in the trunk. Umbrella in. Water jug with me up front. I tell him a bit about what I'm up to looking for work. Some boat talk. 

He takes me farther than he's going and drops me at the end of the pier. ""What's your name?"" ""Akos."" ""How do you spell it?"" ""A-K-O-S."" ""Cool. Thanks again man!""

Gear up. Down pier. Past my friend's dinghy. Gear down next to a bench in the shade. Me on bench. Phone automatically connects to the wifi. Text sent to friend. Chillin'. Reddit. 

Text back from friend. Over to park near end of pier. Play with his four year old granddaughter. Chill and shoot the shit with friend for a couple hours. 'Most likely gonna need toilet paper on the boat. Should probably get some groceries and water for a couple days too.' 

Drop gear in friend's dinghy. Head for DG. It's the closest, and doesn't require two buses eight miles out of the way to get three miles down the road. Provisions. Back to pier. Down to finger docks. Me in dinghy. Provisions in dinghy. Friend and granddaughter already in dinghy. 

Me, as soon as we leave the dock, ""It sure is nice to be on the water again."" As we start to get close to my boat I notice two ends of a broken anchor rope.

""Good thing I came back."" ""Oh shit!"" And this friends, is why we run a backup rope. This rope went through hurricane Milton, and some pretty gnarly storms in the roughly six months it's been in use. One storm rough enough to break my dinghy rope. Some other boaters today were telling me about a storm recently that came out of nowhere. A boat broke loose and ground itself on the rocks and sunk. I think I got my money's worth out of this rope. Now I gotta figure out another backup rope, but I'm feeling like I can make it happen with something on the boat. Kinda sketchy.

We glide up next to my boat. I load my water and groceries on the deck. I climb aboard. My friend picks up my pack to hand it up to me. ""God Damn! What have you got in here?"" I reach down below the deck and grab the little center strap at the top. One arm it up on deck. ""How much does that thing weigh?"" ""About 47 pounds."" He gently pushes off. ""Alright man!"" ""Alright dude, thanks!"" A goofy wave to his granddaughter. She waves back.

Dig keys out of pack. Open companionway. Down stairs. 'Not as bad as I thought it would be. It's fuckin' hot in here.' Open hatches. One is stuck. Can't move the handles far enough to open it. 9/16 wrench. Loosen handle bolts a smidge. Hatch opened. Port lights opened. Lazarettes opened. Air flowing through boat.

Charge controller settings changed back to twenty-four hours instead of dusk to dawn. Bilge pump on. Open through-hull I closed last time I was here. (You may remember the whole me not liking the sound of water rushing into the boat late at night thing.)

Food off deck and in boat. Water off deck and in boat. Gear off deck and in boat. Chargers out of pack and plugged in. Interior lights tested. Sit down on four inch foam on settee at table. Smoke. Relax.

The wind has picked up a bit. It's dark out. Just a sliver of a moon. There's lightning nearby from two storms to the north and south of me. 'I think I'll set my anchor alarm...' 

My anchor alarm thinks I'm about thirty feet from my anchor. I have thirty feet of rope and one hundred feet of chain out. It's not windy enough to stretch out all of the heavy as fuck chain I have, but I'm sure I'm more than thirty feet from the anchor. Time to go up on the pulpit and reset it. Brb...

Thirty minutes later...

I come back down into the boat and my lights go off. Check charge controller. The voltage reading is scrolling up and down. When it's up the lights come on. Then it counts down, lights go out. Up and down. On and off. Over and over. I tried unplugging things and plugging them back in one at a time. Turned switches on and off one at a time. It might be something on the switch panel. Probably have some corrosion somewhere. 11:33 at night in the dark is no time to be in the bowels of the boat poking around an electrical panel. Looks like that's tomorrow's problem. Solar camping light out. (Anyone remember shit talking the idea of a solar flashlight when we were young? 😆)

I've got a full sized anchor sitting on the bow ready to get tossed in if anything happens to the backup rope. 🤞😬

Just got my full order in! Haven’t had the chance to wear most of them yet, so I can’t comment on performance. Here’s my ranking and thoughts so far, from favorite to least favorite:

**1. Ghost Spectre (10/10)**  
Smells absolutely delicious—sweet and fruity. I could still smell it on my shirt two days after spraying. I can’t quite describe the notes, but wow, it’s a banger.
Highly recommended!!

**2. Jene Lowe Immortal (10/10)**  
This one is amazing. It’s like ginger soda with lemon—super fresh and uplifting.
Highly recommended!!

**3. Nitro Red (9/10)**  
Smells like watermelon. A very nice fragrance overall.

**4. Sceptre Malachite (9/10)**  
A ripe, delicious mango scent, though it leans a bit feminine in my opinion.

**5. Jean Lowe Vibe (8.8/10)**  
Very fresh and reminds me of a green apple.

**6. Vintage Radio (8/10)**  
Powdery plum vibes. Quite nice.

**7. Odyssey Dubai Chocolate (8/10)**  
Opens with a strong dark chocolate scent, then dries down to a French vanilla coffee aroma.

**8. Odyssey Home (8/10)**  
Fresh and clean. A solid choice.

**9. Odyssey Limoni (7.5/10)**  
Straight-up lemons—almost like a house cleaner.

**10. Jean Lowe Azure (7.5/10)**  
Very similar to Limoni. Need to wear them out to see which performs better.

**11. French Whore (2/10)**  
Honestly disappointed. Smells like soap mixed with baby powder, and it made me feel nauseous. The atomizer is great, though. Hoping the baby powder scent fades with time.

**12. Maison Alhambra Cassius (1/10)**  
Another disappointment. It’s 98% patchouli and 2% vanilla. Fingers crossed it changes with time—hopefully a lot.

1jpfggc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1jpfggc/toujo_the_metal_man/,Toujo the metal man,"In the quiet early morning of a Tokyo summer, before the city's heart had begun to pulse with the rhythm of the rush hour, Toujo, a stoic man with a weathered face and calloused hands, stepped off the last train at the end of the line. His eyes squinted against the harsh fluorescent lights of the station as they flickered on in response to his footsteps. He was a creature of routine, his work boots echoing a familiar tune through the empty corridors.



Toujo worked construction, a job that had hardened his body and etched lines into his skin that spoke of decades spent under the unforgiving sun. His work ethic was as unyielding as the steel beams he raised, and his dedication to his craft was matched only by his commitment to his family. Every day, he donned his dusty hat and set out to build the future of the city that never sleeps, one brick at a time.



""Ohayo gozaimasu,"" he murmured to the convenience store clerk as he picked up a steaming cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes. The clerk nodded in return, recognizing him as a regular. Toujo's days often started with a jolt of caffeine and a silent promise to quit smoking, a promise that grew fainter with every drag. The warmth of the coffee mug between his palms was a comfort as he stepped outside into the cooler pre-dawn air.



On the walk to the construction site, Toujo's thoughts drifted to the pile of unpaid bills that had started to collect on the kitchen counter. His wife, Yuko, had become adept at hiding them from their young daughter, but they were never far from his mind. The payments had been getting harder to make, the overtime hours no longer enough to keep their lives afloat. His stomach tightened as he approached the towering cranes that loomed over the cityscape, a stark reminder of his own dwindling finances.



As Toujo rounded the corner, a rusty old car caught his eye, abandoned and forgotten on the side of the road. It was an unusual sight in this meticulously organized city, where every inch of space was either built upon or meticulously maintained. He stepped closer, curiosity piquing, and noticed the license plate was covered in a film of dust. The car looked like it hadn't moved in years, a relic of a bygone era, and something about it called to him.



With a sigh, he reached out to touch the cool metal, the early morning dew clinging to the chipped paint. His finger grazed against a sharp edge, and a thin line of blood appeared, staining his skin. He pulled back with a wince, a small price to pay for the brief distraction from his troubles. Toujo took a last look at the car and shrugged it off as he continued his journey.



When he finally arrived home that evening, the cut had become a constant throb, a reminder of the day's toil. Exhaustion painted his face, and the thought of dealing with it was almost too much to bear. But as he stepped into the house, the smell of Yuko's cooking filled the air, and he knew he had to push through. He washed his hands, the water stinging the wound, and wrapped it with a piece of tape from the first aid kit, telling himself it would be fine.



The dinner table was a place of solace, a sanctuary where the family gathered to share stories and laughter, if only for a brief reprieve from the day's troubles. As they ate, Toujo felt the bandage sticking to his skin, a persistent annoyance. But the warmth of his wife's smile and the sound of their daughter's laughter was enough to ease the pain. He knew he had to keep working, to keep providing, no matter what the cost to his body or spirit. And with that thought, he pushed the discomfort aside and focused on the moment, the rusty car and its mysteries forgotten for the night.



The next morning, Toujo awoke with a start, his stomach churning. He stumbled to the bathroom, retching over the toilet, his fingers throbbing in time with his racing heart. It was nothing unusual for a man who had spent his life working with heavy machinery and breathing in dust. He figured it was just his body's way of protesting against another long day ahead. After rinsing out his mouth and splashing cold water on his face, he examined the wound. The skin around it was inflamed, but he brushed it off as a simple infection. He didn't have time for the doctor's today, not with the deadlines looming at work.



He dressed quickly, the fabric of his clothes feeling unusually rough against his skin, and headed to the kitchen to grab his lunch box. Yuko had packed it with care, her love for him evident in every carefully folded corner and meticulously placed grain of rice. He kissed her on the forehead, and she looked up at him with worry in her eyes. ""Ganbare, Toujo,"" she whispered, a silent plea for him to be careful. He nodded, trying to reassure her, and stepped out into the early light.



The construction site was a maelstrom of activity, the air thick with the scent of diesel and concrete. Toujo felt his heart race as he climbed into the cab of his crane, the metal seat cold against his back. His fingers felt strange, as if they didn't quite belong to him anymore, but he ignored it. He had a job to do, a family to support. As the sun climbed higher, the pain grew worse, a constant drumming in his head that made it difficult to focus. But Toujo was no stranger to pain, and he gritted his teeth, determined to push through.



As the day wore on, the throbbing in his hand grew more intense, and he found himself dropping tools and fumbling with the crane's controls. His foreman noticed, shooting him a concerned look, but Toujo waved it off with a gruff ""I'm fine."" He couldn't risk losing his job, not now. The city's skyline grew blurry, the buildings around him seeming to dance in his vision. He took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his brow, telling himself it was just fatigue. But deep down, a seed of doubt had been planted, and it began to grow.



The rusty car remained a silent sentinel on the side of the road, a testament to the passage of time and the struggles of a man who refused to give in. Toujo's thoughts returned to it often throughout the day, a puzzle that gnawed at the back of his mind even as he wrestled with the cranes and steel. It was as if the car was speaking to him, whispering secrets of a life unlived, a path not taken.



But Toujo had a path to follow, one that was well-worn and familiar. He had responsibilities, and so he pushed the strange occurrences aside and focused on his work, the rhythm of the city's construction pulsing through his veins. The cranes creaked and groaned, a symphony of progress that echoed through the streets of Tokyo. Yet, amidst the clang of metal and the roar of engines, there was a quiet desperation that only he could hear.



As the sun dipped below the horizon, Toujo finally clocked out and made his way home, the pain in his hand now a dull ache that resonated up his arm. The sight of his reflection in a shop window made him stop in his tracks. His teeth had started to change, a glint of metal shining where once there had been white enamel. Panic flooded through him, his hand flying to his mouth to feel the unnatural transformation. He looked around, hoping no one had noticed, his eyes darting from side to side.



He wanted to go to the doctor, needed to, but the cold hard reality of his bank account slapped him in the face. He didn't have the money, not with the rent due and the lights threatening to go out. His pride was a heavy burden, one he hadn't shared with Yuko. He couldn't bear to see the fear in her eyes, the same fear that was now etched into his own reflection. The metal taste of his teeth was a constant reminder of his newfound predicament.



Toujo trudged home, each step heavier than the last. He tried to ignore the whispers of the rusty car, its riddle now a taunting reminder of his own decay. His hand clenched into a fist, the metallic teeth digging into his palm, as if in protest of his circumstances. He had to find a way to pay the bills, to get medical help, to keep his family safe from the shadows of the city's relentless march forward. The lights in the apartment complex flickered as he approached, a stark reminder of the fragility of his world.



The clock in the living room read 3 AM, a cruel mockery of the rest he desperately needed. He couldn't ignore the pain anymore. His hand had changed, morphed into something unnatural and terrifying. The skin was now a pallid imitation of the metal that surrounded him at work, and sharp claws had replaced his once calloused fingers. His heart hammered in his chest, the reality of his transformation sinking in with each pulse.



With trembling hands, he examined his new form in the mirror. The metal was cold, unyielding, and alien. Yet, as he flexed his fingers, the claws glinted in the moonlight, a twisted reflection of the steel girders he had spent his life manipulating. His mind raced, trying to piece together the events that had led to this moment. The cut from the car, the pain, the metal taste in his mouth. It couldn't be coincidence.



A soft knock on the bedroom door brought him back to the present. ""Toujo?"" Yuko's voice was a gentle breeze, a stark contrast to the storm raging in his thoughts. He swallowed hard, forcing a smile onto his face. ""I'm okay, just couldn't sleep,"" he called back. He knew he couldn't hide it from her forever, but for now, he had to keep the horror of his condition to himself. He didn't want her to see the monster he feared he was becoming.



The next day, Toujo's hand had grown more pronounced, the metal weaving up his forearm like a sinister tattoo. The pain had subsided to a dull throb, replaced by a strange tingling sensation that pulsed in time with the city's heartbeat. His movements were stiffer, less precise, but he managed to hide it from his colleagues, wrapping his hand in a thick bandage that made it difficult to work. His mind was a tumult of fear and confusion, but he knew one thing for certain: he couldn't afford to miss another day of work.



The whispers grew louder, the rusty car's siren song beckoning him back. It was as if the metal beast knew his secret, knew his pain, and was offering him a solution. As he worked, his mind wandered, conjuring images of a life where his body matched the steel he wrangled. He could feel the power, the strength, the invincibility. But the love for his family anchored him, keeping him from succumbing to the seductive whispers.



The job was more challenging than ever before, his hand acting of its own accord, the claws snagging on his clothes and tools. His foreman noticed his clumsiness and called him aside, concern etched into the lines of his face. ""Are you okay, Toujo?"" he asked. Toujo nodded, mumbling something about a bad hangnail. The lie tasted bitter in his mouth, but he had to keep his job, had to keep food on the table.



That evening, as he sat in the cramped bathroom, his hand submerged in a basin of warm water, he knew he couldn't hide his transformation much longer. Yuko would see, the doctors would see, and he didn't know what the world would make of a man turning into a machine. His thoughts spun, searching for a way out, a cure, a miracle. But all he found was the cold, hard reality staring back at him from the mirror, and the haunting image of the car that had started it all.



The itch grew more intense, like a swarm of ants burrowing into his skin. He couldn't ignore it, the metal on metal irritation driving him to the brink of madness. He gave in, using his new claw to scratch at the itch, hoping it would bring relief. But instead of the sweet release he craved, the claw dug in too deep, and he felt a warm trickle of blood run down his arm. He cursed under his breath, pulling his hand from the water to inspect the damage. The cut was deep, the blood a stark crimson against the silver of his new skin.



Toujo's panic grew as the blood mixed with the water, swirling into a tiny maelstrom of red and white. He grabbed a towel, wrapping it around his wound, applying pressure to stem the flow. His mind raced, trying to come up with a lie to explain the injury, but the truth was a beast he couldn't tame. His hand was not just metal, it was a part of him now, a part that was as much a weapon as it was a tool. And as he sat there, the fabric staining with his lifeblood, he realized that the power the car had promised was not without its cost.



The following day, Toujo's arm was a patchwork of bandages, a mottled mess of white and red that he tried to hide under his shirt sleeve. The whispers grew more insistent, the rusty car's siren call a constant presence in his mind. He was a man caught between two worlds, neither fully flesh nor fully steel. The itch had become a constant companion, a maddening reminder of his new reality. His hand trembled as he gripped his hammer, the claws glinting in the sun as he worked, a silent threat to the world that had shaped him into the man he was today.



The pain grew with each passing hour, a symphony of agony that crescendoed in his very soul. His work suffered, his mind consumed by the incessant whispering of the metal that now coursed through his veins. His foreman noticed his distraction, the quality of his work slipping, and called him aside once more. ""Toujo, what's going on?"" he asked, his voice tinged with worry. Toujo clenched his fist, the bandages hiding the truth beneath. He couldn't tell him, couldn't risk losing everything.



Finally, the moment of truth came. Toujo's hand, now fully transformed into a metallic monstrosity, had become too much to bear. The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of steel and despair that drowned out the sounds of the city. In a fit of rage and desperation, he ripped the bandages away, revealing the gleaming claw that had replaced his human hand. His foreman stared in shock, his eyes wide with horror. Without a word, Toujo turned and sprinted towards the nearest building, his legs propelling him upwards with inhuman speed.



On the rooftop, the wind whipped through his hair as he stared down at the city below. The steel and glass towers looked like a sea of sharp teeth, ready to devour him whole. The whispers grew louder, urging him to embrace his new form, to let go of his humanity and become one with the metal. And for a brief, terrible moment, he considered it. The pain, the fear, the struggle to provide for his family; it all seemed so trivial compared to the power he could wield as a creature of steel. But then he thought of Yuko's smile, their daughter's laughter, and the warmth of their embrace. He knew he couldn't leave them.



With a roar that tore through the quiet night, Toujo flung himself from the edge of the building, the wind rushing past him like a scream. The city lights grew distant, a twinkling mirage as he plummeted towards the unforgiving pavement. His heart hammered in his chest, the claw of the car's curse tightening around his soul. In those final moments, he realized that he had made a choice, to be a man of steel in spirit, not in flesh. He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer, steeling himself for the impact that never came.



Instead, the world around him grew quiet, the whisper of the wind replaced by a gentle hum. The metal in his arm surged, extending into gleaming wings that unfurled with a metallic shiver. He soared, the cityscape rushing below him, a blur of light and shadow. The pain was gone, replaced by an exhilarating sense of freedom that made his heart sing. He had become something more, something greater than the sum of his parts. He was not a monster, not a machine; he was a guardian, a protector forged in the fires of adversity.



Toujo hovered above the rusty car, his wings casting a shadow over its crumpled form. He knew now that the metal wasn't a curse but a gift, one that could be wielded for good or ill. The choice was his to make. With newfound determination, he turned towards home, the wind in his face a promise of the battles to come. He would fight for his family, for his city, and for himself, and he would not let the whispers of the past dictate his future. The metal in his arm was a reminder of his struggle, a symbol of his strength, and a testament to the enduring human spirit.



The next morning, as the sun painted the city in shades of gold, Toujo stood before his wife and daughter, his metal wing folded neatly at his side. They stared in awe, the fear in their eyes slowly replaced by wonder. He knew he had a responsibility now, to use his newfound power to protect those he loved and to keep the whispers of despair at bay. The world had changed, but his love for them remained unyielding, a beacon of hope in a world of steel and shadow.



And so, with a heart full of resolve, Toujo set forth into the day, the sound of his wing's metallic flutter a testament to his transformation. He had become something more than a construction worker, more than a man. He was a symbol of hope, a beacon in the ever-expanding concrete jungle.



But the world had a way of throwing curveballs, and Toujo was about to face the biggest one yet. As he descended from the skies, a sudden pain shot through his head, and the world around him grew dark. He awoke to the cold, sterile embrace of a mental hospital bed, the echoes of his own screams still lingering in the air. A doctor with a kind but weary face hovered over him, his eyes filled with concern. The doctor spoke softly, but the words were like nails on a chalkboard, shattering the illusion of Toujo's new reality.



""Mr. Toujo, I'm afraid your condition has taken a turn for the worse. The stress, the long hours, the accident... it's all become too much for your mind to handle."" The doctor paused, his gaze drifting to a clipboard that held Toujo's fate in its neatly scribbled notes. ""The construction site... your new... abilities... it was all a delusion, a way for your mind to cope with your injury.""



The room grew colder, the steel wing that had been a part of him just moments ago now a figment of his imagination. The doctor continued, his voice a monotone that droned through Toujo's shattered world. ""You've been with us for some time now, and while we've made progress, the infection from the cut has affected your cognitive abilities. I'm sorry, but the construction work... the flying... it was all in your head.""



The weight of reality crushed down on Toujo, his heart a leaden stone in his chest. He looked around the small room, the walls closing in, the smell of antiseptic a stark contrast to the diesel and dust of the construction site. The doctor was speaking, but his words were lost in the cacophony of Toujo's own thoughts, a maelstrom of doubt and despair. Had it all been a lie? His mind reeled, trying to grasp onto the threads of truth in a tapestry of madness.



The doctor's voice grew more insistent, but Toujo barely heard him over the screaming in his head. The whispers of the rusty car, the power, the freedom - all of it had been a mirage, a desperate attempt by his fractured psyche to escape the pain of his failing body. The doctor's eyes widened in horror, and Toujo followed his gaze to see his hand, the metal claw that had brought him such strength now a grotesque twist of his own mind's making, digging into the doctor's throat.



The world around him grew dark once more, the doctor's lifeless eyes staring back at him, a silent accusation. Had he done this? Was he capable of such violence? The whispers grew louder, the rusty car's siren call beckoning him back into the abyss. But as the darkness closed in, Toujo found a spark of light, a memory of his family's love, a love that transcended the boundaries of his own mind. With a roar of defiance, he ripped the metal from his flesh, tearing himself free from the delusion that had consumed him.



The room was quiet now, the doctor's body a grim reminder of the path he had almost taken. The whispers were gone, the power a mirage that had led him to the brink of madness. Toujo wept, the pain of his loss a physical ache that resonated through his being. But amidst the sorrow, a new resolve grew, a determination to face the world with the strength that had always been within him. The construction site, the cranes, the steel beams - they were his reality, and he would fight to return to them, to his true calling.



With trembling hands, he reached for the phone, his mind racing to piece together a plan. He had to escape this place, to get back to his job, to his life. The doctor's keys jingled in his hand, a symbol of the freedom he had lost and the power he had once believed himself to have. The hospital's fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting an eerie glow on the blood-stained floor. The metal was gone, but the scars remained, a stark reminder of the battle he had waged within himself.

I've always sorta personified Joann's because, as weird as this might sound, ""she's"" been a constant in my life. My earliest memories are sitting at the pattern table drawing princess dresses on scrap paper with golf pencils while my mom looked at patterns and chatted with the other customers and staff. I vividly remember some kind of old lady/SAHM coffee meet up at the Joann's. My first job was at Joann's (I lasted 2 months- I was immature). I quilt, crochet, bake, and paint so, I haven't gone more than a few weeks of my life without visiting a Joann's. 

It feels weird to admit I've bonded with a chain retailer but, I've probably done weirder things. 

Anyway, I lost my job 3 years ago and after a lot of job search agony, my husband supported me finishing my education and finally entering the field I want to be in. I just finished my bachelors and will start my masters in the fall. I was looking for something to keep me busy for a while so I went to Joann's to buy some (more) keep-me-busy-supplies when I saw the flier saying I could get an extra 30% off if I worked there. I figured it would be over before grad school started and I could stock up on cotton for grad school stress quilting- plus, my social skills are *rusty* after 3 years out of the work force and this job has been amazing exposure therapy lol.

**On to the miracle:**

So, if this opportunity wasn't enough of a great fit for me, I might have talked my husbands future step dad out of buying 88 yards of sunbrella. 

This very happy, friendly older man came in the other day and spent ages in the outdoor fabric aisle. I only noticed bc he was chatting with everyone and laughing a lot. At some point he carried a bolt to the cutting counter and asked me how to get **EIGHTY-EIGHT YARDS** of it. I couldn't help but laugh and ask what he was trying to do and he replied that he was recovering his boat cushions. When I asked him how many cabins his cruise ship had, he realized he might be in over his head. He asked for help and told me about his boat- I grew up in Annapolis so I'm very familiar with boats *and* I've reupholstered two couches so I told him he probably needs 15-20 yards. He asked if I'd take the job and I was like: hmm I didn't mean to offer but sure, why not. 

The very next day I go to his house with my measuring tape, clipboard, and a reasonable idea of what my labor is worth. I expected to either do a bunch of math and then haggle or maybe get murdered, who could know right? Well, I ended up hanging out with one of the very few decent boomer men I've ever met in my life. Like, usually their red flags (or hats) are quickly visible but this man was nothing but wonderful at every turn of the conversation and corner of his home. He gave me the grand tour of his legitimately fascinating time 90s time capsule home. It's like he lives in the nicest department store of my youth but it has a private beach and hibachi grill. 

We talked for like 90 mins, I took my measurements (15 yards of sunbrella and 7 of vinyl btw), and easily agreed on a price. Plus he invited me to bring my husband and kids to go out on the boat or fish off his dock AND he agreed to hand out my card at marinas (guess I need a waterproof card...). 

Before we parted ways I randomly asked if I could take a picture of his front gate because my MIL would love it. It's this beautiful painted metalwork piece of art that is incredibly colorful and kinda reminded me of her paintings. He asked me about her paintings and I replied that she was a professional muralist for years and mostly does abstract stuff now but I just knew she'd think it was neat... he goes ""is she single?""

MY MIL IS THE MOST SINGLE SINGLE PERSON WHO EVER SINGLED. 

She has not dated since her divorce from my FIL **thirty years ago**. She's done a lot of cool shit but she just never met a guy worth dealing with. She's told me for over a decade that her checklist for a date is simply:  
- age appropriate  
- was kind to first wife/still respects her but is over the relationship  
- good relationship with adult children  
- not totally destitute/can support self  
- not a Republican  
Would it shock you to find out that in 30 years she has never met a boomer man to meet her (imo, very reasonable) criteria?!

Yall- Joann sent him to me. A comfortably retired widower of several years who still has his wife's portraits and artwork in his home but is ready to love again. And he's a very pro-social justice Democrat!!! When I described him to my husband he said that he was ""as rare as a unicorn fart.""

Well, I took a pic of him and sent it to her- she thinks he's cute! She approved the idea so I sent him her pic and he said she was beautiful 🥹

This might sound nuts but, everything just feels so right. I feel guilty for being so grateful for all this while so many are struggling. My manager is such a wonderful person and a single parent who Joann's moved to our town for this job back when things were booming and in a month he'll have no job. I know he's one of many and this random story will do nothing to fix that. I just wanted to share this imo, fascinating series of events that somehow might end my MIL's three decade drought and might launch my marine upholstery side gig lol.

1jpfbq4,https://i.redd.it/hyzfzkxzccse1.jpeg,A recession hit my area and I’m incredibly lost.,"Let me start off by saying this, I don’t farm in the USA.  I farm in northern Mexico, on the border of the USA.  I started here because of cheaper inputs, labor and access to capital.  However, in 2024 overall commodities dropped, and they dropped hard.  We don’t get subsidies on anything, and if the government offers some it’s only for those who farm 40 acres or less.  Anyone above that is considered rich.  We still trade based off of CBOT prices so the prices in the US are the same here exchanged in MXN.  The basic price of diesel fuel for us is almost $6 a gallon, so we’re cutting costs everywhere.  Now for the worst part? We got a credit freeze.  Everyone, not just us, every single farmer BTO and STO alike.  I can’t can’t on one hand how many totally abandoned fields there are here and it’s very disturbing.  Grain elevators are abandoned as well and farm machinery has also been abandoned and slowly but surely getting dismantled by thieves.  My creditors supported my idea of taking on some abandoned fields and mid tillage to prepare for planting, I got the dreaded call.  “Operating lines have been shut down until further notice.” Are you fucking kidding me? I tripled the size of my operation with the hopes they’d stand behind me and we got left to hang dry.  The government is fully aware of the situation and they refuse to act.  Whatever, it’s Latin America.  We get together for coffee in the mornings and same talk, everyone got their credit lines frozen.  One neighbor who’s helped me a lot recently just had a heart attack and we all tend to feel it’s stress induced.  Thankfully we finished up planting nearly 3,000 acres and got some rain last week, but God help me from here to August.  I’m sitting here counting coins and debt collections up my ass daily, I don’t know how much longer I can do this.  I can’t explain that it’s not my fault, but yet somehow it does feel like it.  I don’t know what’s going on and it’s hard to see light at the end of the tunnel.  Thanks for listening, I’m just losing sleep over this total economic catastrophe.

4 months ago, I finished in 2:07:44 after previously doing a 15k and 3 10k distances the month before. The first try i was really slowing down towards the end (see last screenshot) and couldn't run any further maintaining ~6 mins per km. 

Attempt #2, I think I could have kept going. Maybe next, I'll just keep doing laps at around 6:00 pace and see how far I can go comfortably and maybe I'll get close to 3/4 of a marathon and re-evaluate. Or maybe I'll feel rekt and humbled if I continue much beyond half.

Gould's Goldberg Variations -. I've near memorized it. It was high time to taste something new from him. The particular piece that accompanied the following story was Bach's 6 Partitas.

My partner in crime has arrived in my new city from south of the border on an Au Pair assignment. I'd met her for a short walk a few weeks ago - nothing more than a friendly chat, but she surprised me with a direct suggestion for something further via a message shortly after the first time we met.

Today, I was pleased to find a message from her suggesting a brief meeting. I live a spartan existence in an old home - the greying wood floors of my room are ancient and the lead paint of my windows is flaking off. Music comes from my classical guitar or a beat up speaker I've toted through three continents.

While I swept and cleaned, Bach's 6 Partitas played. This was enormously pleasant during the mindless activity of cleaning and waiting for my date to arrive.

We drank coffee - and I'll save you the details, but I just want you to know that Gould played the entire time during our brief tryst.

Bit about the business: its a 6 bay building but only 5 bays are functioning as the 6th bay is being used as the drive thru for a coffee stand on site that is being subleased for $100 a month. The 5 operational bays are currently coin only, with a centralized coon machine that people can exchange bills for coins. There is no credit card payment option. 

My plan to increase revenue:

1. Increase rent on the coffee stand. $100 is too low and I think $500 is more appropriate for the location, especially since a car wash bay is being sacrificed for their use.

2. Install card readers to allow credit card payments. These are about $400 a piece times 5 bays and my own labor to install, should be $2000 and change to set up card payments. 

3. Increase minimum payment by 50 cents. Currently the minimum payment is $3 for 5 minutes, this would increase to $3.50 for 5 minutes. 

4. Install vending machine with car care products such as wax, micro fiber towels, interior wipes, etc. 

5. Sublease a bay to a detailer to use the spot for their detail business to offer to higher end clients and have a steady stream of rental income from the sublease. Con: this brings me to 4 functional bays.

To any of you car wash owners, what do you think about these ideas to increase revenue? Have you tried any of these and if so, how did it work? Which would you do and which would you avoid?",1,1743563661.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

1jpexyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jpexyz/my_husband_has_issues_with_my_schedule_how_to/,"My husband has issues with my schedule, how to communicate better about it?","Hi everyone! I'm S (Brazilian,37,f), married to S(Indian,42,m), we live in India and we own a gym together and I recently I started giving English classes online to people in Brazil. (So far I got only 3 girls as students)
Some context:
-I also have some chronic health issues: epilepsy and hypothyroidism. We just had a very rough year, due to a freak fire accident here at home, his Mom died not even a year ago.-
Giving classes was something I always thought about (because my mom also does the same), I read about but haven't really started doing it until a friend mentioned and reached out about helping her, so she is the one friend that refers these students to me, and obviously, due to the time difference (8h30m) between both countries sometimes the working hours could be odd. So far I have been lucky enough to have gotten times that were very easy for me to give classes ( morning in Brazil and afternoon here in India)
On this note, my friend was checking with me about giving classes starting at 6:30 am in the morning here, and the student would have his class at 10pm from there. This student happens to be a young adult man, looking for 3 classes a week.

This is the situation where I need some advice from:
The issue came up when I mentioned it to my husband: at first he was surprised someone wanted classes so many times a week, but then the issue was that I was a woman and he is a man and later on the problem was the timing. 

I am just so confused and he is kind of pressing on the matter for me to NOT take this classes, main reason being the time. 

My main issue is that when I brought it up (I got this refferal today) it all went downhill in a very exhausting exchange, starting with 'you don't even wake up to make me a cup of coffee in the morning, but now you will wake up to give classes and at 6:30 at that' to 'here in India, married women don't normally teach classes to men' to 'I worry about your health and you're not fit enough to do this like this, you need to take better care of yourself first', 'you should have better boundaries about your timings' and finished with saying: 'if we need that much more money I will go abroad and make more to give it to you... While at it, if you want to go to wherever, just go and just remember to get the divorce papers done'
And I was like whooaa I am so NOT having this conversation with you right now, let's cool down. 
After a while I tried talking again but to no avail. He just went to the gym and I guess he worked out his anger out of his system.

I don't know if it made him feel emasculated, or if he is just that resistant to change. I know he has some old fashioned notions, and thus far to me, it wasn't a problem.
But now that I am enjoying doing this, it feels like, just because he is not included, is that I am automatically excluding him. 

I'd like some advice on how to move forward with this conversation with him, in the most effective way without getting hurt unnecessarily?
How can I stand my ground and still have balance through the conversation and have a good compromise between the both of us?
How do I explain that I think I can do it - even with my low self esteem screaming otherwise- and be fine?

I might not take this classes, but I do want to be able to talk about stuff with my husband without feeling let down or that I need to ask for permission to do my own things.

Please send your advice on how to better deal with this 

Note: the fact that I have just started giving classes give me a bit of anxiety and I do need a lot of time to prepare for the classes and also having to have medicines at certain times and also enough hours of sleep otherwise it can trigger seizures, can be something to worry about but I think he is kinda overreacting.
For so long I feel like I am not capable of doing this, and now that I am having the opportunity I am  hesitant and feel stuck.

Note: my husband has said before that he makes enough money so that I don't have to do this, that I could kinda choose when to teach, but at the same time I also like to feel useful and help my friend with the classes ( it all started because she invited me to help her out with it.)

I wanted to share my personal weight loss journey, especially since I know how hard it can be here in the Philippines with all the tempting food (hello lechon, milk tea, and samgyup 😩).

I’m a 33-year-old guy based in Manila, and I lost 12kg over 4 months – without a gym membership, expensive supplements, or a strict diet. Just small changes, consistency, and a bit of trial and error.

Here’s what worked for me:

1. Intermittent Fasting (IF) – Filipino-style
I started with 16:8 fasting. My “kain window” was 12pm–8pm. It helped me stop snacking and mindless kain sa gabi. I still ate rice, just less of it. I just made sure to eat more protein (like itlog, chicken breast, tinola, or sardinas).

2. Walking Everywhere
I didn’t have time for workouts, so I just walked a lot. If you’re commuting, try getting off a stop earlier or doing 5k steps sa hapon. I averaged 8-10k steps a day. I used a free app (Pacer) to track.

3. Cutting Liquid Calories
This was a game-changer. I didn’t realize how much sugar I was drinking. I switched from milk tea/soft drinks to tubig with calamansi or black coffee.

4. Tracking Progress with Photos, Not the Scale
Honestly, the scale made me feel bad when I plateaued. Instead, I took weekly photos. Nakaka-boost ng confidence when I saw the difference.

5. Finding a Buddy or Community
I told one friend about my goal, and we checked in weekly. Having someone to kwento with really helped me stay on track.

What Didn’t Work for Me:
	•	Crash diets (I tried keto once – lasted 3 days lol)
	•	Detox teas (not worth it!)
	•	Comparing myself to others

Now I feel better, my clothes fit nicer, and I don’t get as winded climbing stairs.

I’m not done yet – still pushing towards my goal – but I just wanted to share in case it helps anyone here. If you have questions or want to swap tips, comment below! 👇

I'm coming to your city to eat some pizza, and entertain myself between eating them. Staying at the Hotel Marcel, around Memorial Day. I'd love input from the locals to make sure my trip is everything I could hope for. Feel free to give me advice on all or any portion of my itinerary. 

I've attached my [current proposed schedule](https://imgur.com/UrqeNsU) (yes, I'm a nerd) - all subject to change based on weather, my feelings that day, or information you fine folks provide me. Bolded underlined things are those I feel I must do while there. 

I will have a car, how will parking be in the places I'm going? I can parallel park :) Is it safe to park in a lot/garage downtown, leave the car, and walk/bus/bikeshare/uber for the day? Suggestions on which one(s) to utilize? Any challenges or suggestions related to parking for the schedule I have planned? Will I be allowed to utilize the Yale shuttle bus during the day? If so, do they stop at every stop or do you have to flag it down/request a stop? Are the stops clearly marked? Looks like blue shuttle would be most relevant for me.

Recommendations for my weekday breakfasts?  I don't drink coffee so the food is what's important.

Have I allotted enough time for my pizza choices (2 hours) for waiting in line and eating? It's fine if things move quicker but I don't want to miss out if a place closes before I get to eat. 

I am quite unlikely to change where I'm going for Apizza but feel free to suggest your favorite toppings - though I don't eat seafood. Sausage will probably be my go to. Don't worry, I'm bringing a cooler for all the leftovers.

I don't drink alcohol much, but will be trying plenty of Foxon Park soda!

Can I walk from my hotel to Long Wharf Park? It's unclear if I can get across the highway on foot.

As an avid board gamer I MUST check out Elm City Games. Are there likely to be people there to jump into playing a couple games with on a Thursday mid-late morning?

Any cool bookstores in the areas I'll be wandering?

I will not be eating at Louis' Lunch, it's not really my thing.

1jpevmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jpevmw/my_mormon_spanish_teacher_made_uncomfortable_in/,My Mormon Spanish teacher made uncomfortable in front of class because my boyfriend is not a member.,"A couple from a ward teaches Spanish class once a week among other members including my dad and I. Even though I don’t consider myself a member I attend the class because I sincerely want to learn Spanish and it doesn’t cost me anything and the subject shouldn’t be about church. My dad knows I no longer practice or intend the church. He doesn’t mind or question it and he likes my boyfriend whose family is practicing Catholics.  
 Today was class but I went alone because my dad had a doctor’s appointment. At the beginning of class, we go around in a circle and tell the teacher what we did last weekend in Spanish. It was my turn and I told her what I did, then she told me “l have a personal question to ask you.” And she asked me “Are you and your boyfriend progressing?” I told her I believe so and that I love him and I feel he loves me. There were signs like him asking what kind of engagement ring I liked and my size. And rumor has it he asked my dad for my hand. At first, my teacher was excited then her face turned and she asked me, “Wait, your boyfriend is catholic right? You can’t marry him then, you’re LDS.” And you can then feel the awkwardness in the room. And I honestly didn’t know how to respond to that, Do I call her out and make it more awkward? Do I get up and leave without saying anything? Or do I just sit there? Thankfully another classmate changed the subject. And the class went on as usual. After class,  the classmate who changed the subject came up to me and told me how excited she was for me. And it did make me feel better. And told her to listen, my dad likes him and if my dad told my boyfriend no when he asked for my hand, I probably wouldn’t be dating him now. I trust my dad’s judgment. She agreed. And we told each other goodbye. 
I believe my teacher was out of line. Even if my boyfriend and I get married it’s not like she’s paying for our wedding. She acts like it keeps her awake at night. It’s none of her business. I told my boyfriend what happened, and we both agreed we need to make sure we invite her so she can watch us happily get married In our non temple building, wearing our non temple clothes and sitting along side coffee and alcohol drinkers.

*Build To Wrestlemania XLI*

*Roddy Note: John Chena’s heel turn was a historical event, one that will be remembered for years to come so we shall keep it unencumbered.*

In the aftermath a brazen heel turn, foreign land that no seemingly no one expected WWE dare to tread, the following Monday Night Raw begins seemingly as usual showing us the arrival of the Intercontinental Champion Bronn Breakker, the new Women’s Tag Team Champions Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez, but there’s a sudden eerie shift in the demeanor. A loud commotion is heard as the camera shifts to the parking lot as an absolutely enraged Cody Rhodes armed with a sledgehammer in hand and Dusty’s Rolex covered in his own blood around his wrist, losing any semblance of professionalism he was once prided for is seen in a shouting match with a battalion of security officers as Adam Pearce appears to diffuse the scuffle. “John Cena, The Rock I’m sorry to say they are not in the building tonight Cody. Please I’m begging you to go home, collect your thoughts, you are enraged and rightfully so but now is not the time for blood, you are at risk of doing more harm than good right now.” Cody not pleased with Pearce’s answer rebukes him. “So now Adam Pearce finally decides to do his job, after years of chaos on Raw twiddling his thumbs. 
now of all times the buck stops with you. Didn’t you tell Bronson Reed you purposely let chaos fly on Raw to make it more entertaining? Well if you want chaos you got it so go fuck yourself Pearce!” Cody now fully enraged strikes down Pearce as Cody starts wailing on Pearce but as he does, he catches a glimpsed blood stained reflection of himself in the putrid mirror of the Rolex, 
as he recollects himself for a minute, guilt setting in as Randy Orton pulls him Cody off of Pearce, as Triple H vehemently scolds Cody. “What the hell has gotten into you? Get out of here and cool down, the time will come but that time is not now.” 

The following Smackdown we see Cody address his actions. “On Monday Night Raw my temper, my frustration get the best of my and I accidentally unloaded on an innocent man in Adam Pearce and I sincerely apologize for harming him. But let this not be a sign of weakness, let this is not be a sign of sweet mercy, a sign of blissful reprieve, for when John Cena eventually does set foot back in WWE, there will be hell to pay, for he betrayed me and the respect I had for him for being the face of this company, my inspiration, the man I aspired to return back to the WWE as, the proverbial North Star that guided an entire generation, he betrayed all of you, never gave up gave in when the going go tough and sold out when he had everything the world could possibly offer, he didn’t like that for once in his life he wasn’t the quarterback of WWE, he didn’t like that the talk of the town wasn’t about him but about me and he got desperate. The man who claims you can’t see him but now the whole world sees through you, sees the real you. In the Royal Rumble press conference John Cena said that him winning the Elimination Chamber was best for business, but come Wrestlemania there will be no professionalism, no corporate cheesy smile, you made it personal. He and The Rock disrespected and mocked my family name and legacy, parading my dead fathers name and death day on a waist belt, beating me bloody senseless with Dusty’s Rolex, the one I was gifted by Triple H when I won the title that he never did, finishing my story. The Final Boss constantly threatened to spill my blood in front of my mother, and gave me no choice but to tell a white lie to my daughter about how I got this black eye, saying I ran into a wall so she didn’t have to learn the harsh truths of this cold world, that heinous men like John Cena and The Rock unfortunately do in fact exist, I had to protect her from them. And at Wrestlemania I take them out of existence!” 

The following Raw, John Cena returns and gives his villain’s manifesto of why he sold out. “The truth is I simply did what’s best for business and what’s best for this company. Last year Wrestlemania 40 was heralded, lauded by many as the series finale of wrestling, it was the first time in a long time that wrestling had crossed into the mainstream, a record breaking and profitable year. So when the investors come knocking around the door, demanding we continue to break more records, sell out more arenas, how do we top Wrestlemania 40? Do you think any one of those men in the Elimination Chamber could carry a marquee match that could outsell Roman vs Cody? Seth Rollins only headlined a WrestleMania with the help of three other guys, fourth wheeling to Roman Reigns who was third wheeling to his older brother The Rock. Even a controversy by betraying his Shield brothers back in 2013 couldn’t propel him to superstardom as he is outshined by The Tribal Chief who has main evented ten times the Manias. CM Punk couldn’t be trusted with a glass of water nevertheless the main event of Wrestlemania, the minute he got hands on gold he threatened to up and leave with it, his back was too busy carrying his own ego nevertheless carry an entire company. CM Punk needs wrestling to stay relevant, I don’t. Drew McIntyre is too hotheaded and shortsighted, always blinded by his constructed misgivings. Damian Priest, who even is he? And Logan Paul a man mired in constant controversy, a 
terrible example to the kids, calls himself a global superstar yet he can’t even show his face in the great country of Japan, some ambassador.

I had no choice but to sell out to The Rock because no one is prepared to carry the burden that is the WWE Championship, not even the man who currently holds it as he crumbles beneath its weight, betrayal after betrayal, you simply aren’t strong enough because you aren’t a man of any convictions or morals, you aren’t a self made man, you are just a cobbled together mess riding around on the coattails of your dead father, of Bullet Club, of Tony Khan himself. If AI could spit out a main eventer it 
would spit back Cody Rhodes, it’s everything you would think is a main eventer without any of the passion of the soul.
And they dare claim this man is my successor, this man is this face of this company that I safeguarded for so long?
I gave in to give back to this great company what it gave to me, allowing me a platform to build a brand an image that transcends wrestling. I didn’t give up on my morals on my convictions, on protecting this company, 
I gave up on the fans who gave me nothing but chants of you can’t wrestle, who are never happy claiming I buried people or how I won too much, and for that the fans you will get nothing, no new music, no new look, you will get what you deserve which is nothing and when I walk away with the championship and I retire with it, you will get nothing. I said once I want to win Number 17 so I can shake the hand of the man who wins Number 18, but now I’m starting to believe there isn’t a man who can win Number 18, I will be the last real champ!” Cody Rhodes jump the barricade with a hammer in hand as he utters “Fine speech” driving it into the ribs of Cena! The two pummel each other, trading blow after blow but Cody gets the upper hand as he hits 
a Cross Rhodes on Cena! Cody mocking Cena uses his Dusty Rolex curled around his fingers bounces off the rope for a Five Knuckle Shuffle but is intercepted by The Rock flattening him out with a Rock Bottom! 

The following Friday, The Rock makes an appearance explaining his alliance with John Cena. “The reason why, The Final Boss, The Rock disrespects your family Cody Rhodes, the reason why I spit all over and tarnish your dead father’s legacy, threaten to make you bleed in front of your own mother, is because you stole mana from my family’s table, you and your blinding selfishness and arrogance stole my main event spot, embarrassing my toothless piss poor of an excuse of a Tribal Chief cousin suffering succotash son of a bitch Roman Reigns in the main event of the biggest Wrestlemania of them all. Did you think for a second The Rock magically forgot about your transgressions? Did you think for a second The Rock would leave you breathing after denying your chance at salvation in the name of your foolish pride? It could have been so easy, we could have been like this, like brothers man but because Cody wants to be the hero, he will die the hero. All the Cody Crybabies bitched and moaned, in crackhead unison they  cried for Cody to be given the grand stage of them all and congratulations Cody you have the grandest stage of them… but be careful what you wish for cause you got the biggest beatdown served properly from my Corporate Champion alongside it, and the Cody Crybabies they will get nothing but the resounding sound of disappointment. You didn’t want to give me your soul but now I take it from you.” 

After weeks of getting jumped by The Rock and Cena weeks at a time we see Cody seem out his mentor and ask him for his advice as he reassures Cody. “Look Cody you have come so far from being my protege in Legacy to leaving this company all together and turning this business upside down, you lead the charge the revolution in the wrestling industry and you lead the attack against the longest reigning champion of the modern day, bringing down the entire bloodline. You have taken this company to unprecedented heights and you have far surpassed me and my teachings, I am so proud of you and Dusty he too would be so proud of you, defending his honor and legacy, as a good son would. Yes you have insurmountable obstacles, but you always prevail and always come out even stronger than before and this time will be no different. I said it before I’m coming for Number 15th and I know and hope it will be you I will be fighting and I got your back as always.”

But Randy Orton turns around Cena and hits him with an RKO, standing up for his friend Cody Rhodes! Randy Orton closes the show with Cody vowing to avenge his fallen brother.

*Build to Payback*

After a rather dour ending to Wrestlemania, we see the WWE Draft, where Adam Pearce is set to make the announcement for the Number One Draft pick for Monday Night Raw! Pearce is at the podium as he is ready to select his pick. “The Number One Draft Pick to Raw is… Jac——“ IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING! The Final Boss brazenly struts out as he takes over the podium. “No no no as the member of the Board Directors, Jacob Fatu will not be the first round pick! The first round pick to Monday Night Raw will be the new WWE Champion, my corporate champion, John Cena. The WWE Championship is the most prestigious championship in all of sports entertainment and it is on the biggest draw in this company, so the biggest draw deserves to steer the flagship show. The Netflix executives paid a lump sum for a real champion than a walking catchphrase who betrayed his own flesh and blood by standing with Cody Rhodes, they will get their money worth!” From out of nowhere, Randy Orton drops an RKO on The Rock, as he sets him up and punt kicks The Final Boss! 

On Smackdown, Randy Orton announces his intentions of going after John Cena. “John we came along in this industry going all the way back to OVW, we were part of the same graduating class, and time and time again our paths crossed and uncrossed and now they have crossed yet again, and this time for the last time. We came into the wrestling world kicking and clawing at each other’s throats and apparently we will leave the wrestling world in the same manner or at least you will, because I will not leave wrestling till I surpass your world title record, for it is in insult to this entire business in the manner you disgraced my brother Cody Rhodes and his family, it is a disgrace to who you were what you once stood for aligning with The Rock. Despite our differences, I always respected you for you were a man of principle and values and you stood steadfast by them, despite the despicable things I did to you and which I have remorse for, you preserved and stayed strong. I am a changed man and now you have become everything I once was, now I see a shell of a man and in  I would have said I would need to bring out the Legend Killer but there is no legend to kill anymore, you already did my job for me and killed him yourself. But in my hometown of St. Louis, I will end this sham right before it begins and punt you in the head so you remember just who the hell you are, as you once said so there will no excuses for John Cena to cry about.” 

On the tron we now see shattered glass in the living parlor as Cowboy Bob Orton is seen in the middle of a broken coffee table as Cena stands over you. “How dare you act like the hero Randy Orton, you are nothing but a raging hypocrite. You incessantly whine about how I disgraced Cody Rhodes by insulting his mother, do you remember when you punted my father? Do you remember when you wanted a wrestling match with him and forced him to compete? You barbarian. You sit here and pretend that you are above bending the rules, so spotless and so pure Randy Orton. We had to restart our Summerslam match three times because you found a new way to cheat every time whenever you were using the ropes or outside interference and you still had outside help from Ted Dibiase Jr. You slapped a referee to cost me my WWE Championship opportunity that I rightfully won in the Royal Rumble. You call me a corporate sell out, but let’s remind everybody who sold out when you joined The Authority and cashed in on Daniel Bryan. Hey at least I haven’t tried killing you with pyro yet…Just like these fans you are abusive, vile and disgusting and I hate you Randy Orton, I despise you because it’s people like you who turned me into the person I am today and you are right, this will be the last time we ever set foot in a ring together, but it will be you will who met their end.

*John Cena vs Randy Orton: WWE Championship Extreme Rules Match*

In a brutal match between career rivals it all comes to a vicious close right here, right now in Randy Orton’s hometown. John Cena now bounces off the rope as he goes for a Throwback but Orton pushes him against the ropes and snaps him with a vicious Power Slam! Orton now looking to end Cena pulls out four chairs, and puts them on each appendage as he hits his patented stomp. Right arm, right leg, left arm, left leg thoroughly stomped out, Orton now throws it in reverse as he motions for a Punt Kick! But as he charges, Cena dodges as Orton goes knee first into an exposed buckle which Cena covertly took off! Cena now looks to take advantage as he strikes him in the knee with a chop block as he applies an STF! Orton struggles but eventually throws Cena over his shoulder! Cena using Orton’s momentum scoops up  Randy Orton for a Tilt A Whirl Backbreaker but Randy Orton drops him with an RKO out of nowhere! 1..2..KICKOUT! Orton now frustrated takes Cena to the outside of the ring and up to the tron, wanting to kill John Cena once and for all! Orton leaps up for an RKO but Cena picks him up and drops an Attitude Adjustment off the tron through the wires! Cena now climbs down as he picks up Orton carries his body to the ring as he pulls out the same bloody steel chain that he choked out Cody with at Wrestlemania, forcing the match to end to another submission knockout! The crowd boos as Cena has retained as the stretcher comes to take away Orton. As the stretcher wheels him up the stage, Cena dumps Orton back onto the pyro rig as he goes for the detonation button! But a returning Ilja Dragunov fends off Cena, trading stiff shots stopping his dastardly plans! 

*Build to Money In The Bank*

After foiling John Cena’s futile attempts at murder, we see Ilja Dragunov in the ring demanding a shot at John Cena. “John Cena claims that there is no one who is willing to step up to his brutality, to his ruthless aggression, but the Ring Tsar Ilja Dragunov is here to match his fire with brazen intensity and take his championship away from him once and for all!” A stoic John Cena marches out as he denies Ilja Dragunov’s request. “Listen up I just dismantled the Apex Predator, the most sadistic wrestler in all of professional wrestler and killed him in his own cradle. Who the hell do you think you are stepping up to me, getting involved in my business, the only thing you done is gone and get yourself injured, I wrestle big name opponents in big name matches on the biggest show, not some, no name kid from Russia who names himself after a gun and comes firing blanks. You are just like these degenerate fans in attendance, wrongfully entitled to anything that is rightfully mine. So you want a shot go earn it!” Dragunov replies “You want me to earn it, fine I’ll enter the King of the Ring tournament and The Ring Tsar will put you down once and for all!” 

CM Punk now comes down to the ring as he gleefully laughs, Cena proving the words he uttered right so many years ago. “Wow it took you long enough to finally acknowledge what I’ve been saying for so long, you have always been the New York Yankees, always the franchise player portraying himself as the beloved underdog. The facade is finally gone and now you have shown your true colors to the world, fully embracing the corporate evil. Hustle, loyalty, respect, live, laugh, love it was all as I said a slogan a motto conjured up by a boardroom of suits trying to be performative human. It was all a ploy for money, you didn’t see the fans as people but as consumers to buy into your phony product and your phony plastic personality like you so soullessly bought into. People say you sold out, but you never had a soul to sell in the first place John, it never existed, it’s just bright colored merchandise to appeal to the kids. Now you claim you want to retire and ride off into the sunset, hmmm where have I heard that before? When I wanted to leave with the championship, it was my sole bargaining chip, I didn’t have Dwayne pulling strings for me, I didn’t have Hollywood appeal, I was given nothing John so I had to take that title, not for myself, but to improve the working conditions for all the next generation, to leave behind a better place for the next generation, not to burn the it down in my wake. I always loved these fans John who chanted my name for ten years and it’s for them the people, that I stop you from running away with the title, I bring back the title to them so there is still a wrestling world for them and not your pompous ego. You are a just a figment of the mind of Vince McMahon, you are a part of him, the last shred of his prehistoric existence and I will snuff him out once and for all. So what do you say John, one last dance?”

John Cena now fires back at CM Punk. “All these hypocrites, CM Punk pretends he stands for rebellion but the truth is he stands for himself and his selfishness. He’s too busy carrying his own ego nevertheless being able to carry an entire company, this is why despite being WWE Champion, he played second fiddle to real stars like me and The Rock. For years and years, you belittled and derided this place, claiming how you would never come back that we took blood money working here and now here you are, after you have burned yet another bridge due to your selfishness like you did in the indies, you have come back. There was no rebellion, it was political grandstanding and virtue signaling, preaching about workers rights to people who never worked a job because you need the WWE more than it needs you. You went to UFC and you failed, you tried to make movies just like the guys you claimed to hate and never made it big, you went next door and got kicked out the door because it will never be enough. Hell the other place gave you your own TV show and you still weren’t happy, you had everything but you are a just an empty black hole that will never be satisfied with anything, always the oppressed victim to your narcissistic tendencies. You are a walking liability you shrivel up in the spotlight and that’s why I especially have to destroy you, I regret ever giving you a match at Money In The Bank because it legitimized a man who peaked in 2011 after one “pipe bomb” but 14 years later at Money In The Bank I take away your ability to ever wrestle again.” 

**Money In The Bank**

*John Cena vs CM Punk: WWE Championship* 

Another monumental rematch of epic proportions, memberberries on high as after 14 years John Cena and CM Punk meet once again in a barn burner! The ending of the match eerily follows similar story beats as the one in 2011. CM Punk has Cena on his shoulders as he drops him with a GTS but Cena is spent spiraling to the outside! Punk using the remaining last drops of his muster tosses Cena back in, but as he is about to go inside the ring himself, The Final Boss walks out onto the ring as Punk looks back, trying to focus on the match when Cena locks him in the STF! The Rock much like McMahon calls for the bell, not allowing Punk to even have a chance to fight out the hold as Cena idly allows this injustice to occur! The bell rings as Cena’s face drops for a minute, the sudden realization seeping in that he finally transformed into the very thing he despised. Cena releases the hold as Punk hysterically laughs uttering to Cena who gazes upon his title conflicted. “You aren’t just a part of him, you truly have become him and just as purely evil and soulless! All for what, for Number 17?” 

Cena now enraged, yet not willingly to admit to himself of his transgressions bashes Punk’s head in with the WWE Championship, until Punk bleeds profusely! Cena much like Punk in 2011 holds up the bloody Spinner WWE Championship as he blows Punk and the crowd a kiss goodbye, sitting on the barricade, one step closer to leaving WWE as the WWE Champion forever! But he is blasted by a wild elbow shot from Dragunov! Dragunov jumps up ontop of the barricade as he drops an H Bomb on Cena! 

*Build to Summerslam* 

After beating Cody Rhodes who was out to avenge his big Wrestlemania loss at in the finals of the King of The Ring Tournament, a fired up Dragunov addresses John Cena, earning his title shot! “You want ruthless aggression John Cena, well you are looking right at him dead in my eyes. There is no one who endures constant suffering and revels in its twisted temptation than me. There is no one whose passion burns brighter than a thousand setting suns than me. There is no one who has struggled as hard as me when my broke family fled from Russia to Germany, this is what makes my iron will unbreakable, this is what makes me indomitable, this is what makes me, me for there is no one like me for I am The Tzar, Ilja Dragunov. This is the same indestructible spirit that guided me in the King of The Ring tournament, besting the of the greatest in the modern day Cody Rhodes and its that same unrelenting determination that drives me to prove John Cena wrong, that some nobody from Russia can achieve his dream and become the WWE Champion!”

John Cena now comes out to spare with Dragunov. “Congrats Dragunov you beat the shell of man I obliterated four months of ago, now you up to the real challenge. You remind so much of myself, the unbridled brutality and intensity in the way you tear your opponents, your willingness to welcome any challenger when you were champion, you truly are a machine. Yet you are so naive, so dumbfounded like the old John Cena, trying to earn the respect of people you’ll never please, trying to play fair, always trying to be chivalrous when the opponents have no sense of morality, no sense of conscience. Luckily for you, you will learn the lesson I should have learned much sooner in my at Summerslam, I will be doing you a favor a teaching you not to give hustle where it’s not deserved, loyalty where it’s not earned, and respect where it’s not respected. Maybe then and only then you’ll be able to become Number 18.”

Speaking of, I typically drink a cup of coffee (around 8oz) every morning and afterwards drink a (24oz) Monster steadily for around 5 hours.

(Seriously),"**🚀 Challenge Accepted: I Swapped Multitasking for Time Blocking – My Energy Tripled! (Seriously)**

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 😊 Have you ever had one of those weeks where you’re juggling so many tasks, you feel like you might as well join the circus as a professional plate spinner? That was me, until I discovered the magical world of time blocking and, let me tell ya, it’s been a serious game changer. 🎯

**I used to be the queen of multitasking**, thinking I was some kind of productivity wizard. 🧙‍♂️ Spoiler alert: I was actually just *the queen of distraction*. Anyone else guilty of checking emails, replying to texts, and somehow convincing themselves they're ""working""? Yeah, I see you. 😉

**Here’s what happened when I made the switch**:

1. **More Brain Power 💡**  
   Turns out, hopping from task to task was like trying to have 10 tabs open in my head. With time blocking? It’s like I finally found the 'close all tabs’ button. Hellooo, mental clarity!

2. **Hello, Stress-Free Mornings ☀️**  
   Dedicating slots for specific tasks meant I didn’t wake up to a tornado of to-dos. Fun fact: knowing exactly what you’re tackling at 9am is oddly calming, like a warm hug from a checklist.

3. **Energy Boost ⚡**  
   Who knew focusing on one task at a time could give me more energy than my morning espresso? (And I love my coffee as much as the next person). I call it my daily dose of time-blocking caffeine.

4. **Epic Win Streaks 🎉**  
   Nothing beats ticking off those blocks! It’s like leveling up in a video game, but instead of beating imaginary dragons, you’re slaying your to-do list.

But hey, don’t just take my word for it. **Wondering how to get started?** It's as simple as...

- **Choose Your Blocks:** Break your day into chunks. It could be 30 mins, 1 hour, whatever floats your boat.
- **Assign Tasks:** Allocate specific tasks to those glorious chunks.
- **Stay Flexible:** Sometimes life happens (hello, unexpected Zoom meeting), and that’s okay. Just adjust your blocks like a supercharged Tetris player.

Switching to time blocking felt like discovering a hidden cheat code in the game of life. Who knew more focus could mean *less* stress? 🤔

This book is written with the intention of helping those who, like me, have faced depression and anxiety. I know what it feels like to be trapped in a darkness where hope seems unattainable. When we find ourselves at that point, we become paralyzed, feel irritable, or like victims of a dead-end situation. However, I want to remind you of something: you are not alone.  
was  
In some corner of the world, someone else is feeling the same way you do. Maybe at this moment, on a screen, another member of this invisible club is writing and searching for answers, just like you are doing now.  
  
Depression is not just simple sadness, and anxiety is not just ""nerves."" It is a real condition, an illness that cannot be solved with a ""just try harder"" or an authoritarian shout. It's not your fault, and what you think in your darkest moments is not really you: it's the illness speaking.  
  
Throughout these pages, I will share with you experiences, lessons, and tools that have helped me on this journey. I will also share real anecdotes with you (with some changes to the names, of course), because I know that many times we feel alone in this battle. But believe me, we are not.  
  
A piece of advice: life is a journey, and even though it sometimes feels like a nightmare, we can always take control. The monsters that torment you are smaller than you think. With small steps—like a conscious breath, a change in perspective, or an act of self-care—you can reclaim your power.  
  
Welcome. You are about to embark on a journey of transformation. I will be here, walking with you. Ready to take the first step?  
  
Chapter 1: Understanding Ourselves and Understanding the ""Viruses""  
  
Depression and anxiety can feel like shadows that follow us wherever we go. Sometimes they feel like an invisible weight that prevents us from moving forward, a sense of being trapped in an endless cycle. But the good news is that we are not helpless. With the right tools, we can regain control and start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  
  
One of the first steps to confront them is to learn to recognize when they are acting. If we manage to realize when anxiety starts to rise or when deep sadness sets in, we will have taken a big step. But, to reach that point, we first need to understand how they work.  
  
We already know that these ""viruses"" are in our minds, ready to make us doubt and, many times, they respond to past experiences or accumulated stress situations to sabotage our plans. But here's something important: we are not our negative thoughts. When we stop seeing ourselves as victims and start questioning those ideas, we realize that, many times, the problems are not as big as they seem.  
  
Practical Example 1: The Sabotage of the Mind  
  
Imagine it's Monday morning and you have to go to work or study. The alarm goes off and, instead of getting up with energy, you feel an enormous weight on your body. Your mind starts throwing thoughts like: ""I don't want to get out of bed... everything is sure to go wrong... I don't feel like facing the day.  
  
That's the ""virus"" talking. It's trying to convince you that everything will be a disaster. But here's the key: it's just a thought, not an absolute reality.  
  
Strategy to counter it:  
  
Take a pause and breathe deeply.  
  
Ask yourself: Is it true that everything is going to go wrong, or is it just my mind exaggerating?  
  
Think of a small action you can take at that moment: get up, take a shower, have a coffee. Don't try to solve the whole day at once, just focus on the next step.  
  
Say aloud: ""I'm going to take one step at a time."" The only thing I need to do now is start.  
  
Practical Example 2: Breaking the Cycle of Anxiety  
  
Sometimes, anxiety appears for no apparent reason. You are calm and, suddenly, you feel a knot in your stomach or your heart racing. Your mind starts looking for reasons: ""Did I forget something?"" Is something bad going to happen? And the more you try to calm down, the worse the feeling becomes.  
  
This is where we can apply a simple yet powerful technique:  
  
Strategy to stop anxiety:  
  
Ask yourself: Where am I at this moment?  
  
Reflect: Are my feelings more powerful than reason?  
  
Direct your energy to action: What's the point of overthinking if I can act?  
  
Take immediate action to help you get out of the state of anxiety, such as walking, writing down your thoughts, or taking deep breaths.  
  
Regaining control  
  
When we start to recognize these patterns and apply tools like these, little by little we regain control. Negative thoughts do not disappear immediately, but the mere act of questioning them makes them lose strength.  
  
The most important thing is that we do this process for ourselves. Not to meet others' expectations, but because we deserve to live with more calm and happiness.",2,1743562688.0,selfimprovementday,0,1.0,False

1jpek0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/yotta/comments/1jpek0p/tomorrows_the_day_for_me/,Tomorrow's the Day (for me),"This past Friday Evolve finally submitted a response to my complaint (which was submitted back in October). Unfortunately, I'm not able to share that response to help y'all plan for their arguments. Plenty of eye rolling content. However, since we are in mediation and not in the ""court"" aspect of arbitration, I really don't know what to expect for a result.

I did get a call from a lawyer representing a different bank. Being aware of our arbitration case, they were curious what route my wife and I were going and if we would be learning anything that may be of interest to them and the possibility of sharing information. They are in discovery themselves and commented on things that align with topics we have already commented on quite a bit on this forum, Jason's Fintech Weekly has reported on, and is even in the CoffeeZilla video. For example, they did reference Evolve's part in the shortfall (the Mercury migration and the fee's being taken out of end user FBO accounts).

Unfortunately, it does not appear this route my wife and I are taking will be of use for them.

Unsure if I'll be in a position to make any further contributions after tomorrow, I wanted to add this last bit of free info the lawyer offered as a courtesy for me returning their call.

Expect Mediation to go something Like this

1. The mediator is going to come in hard stating we don't have a case, why are we going through this now for what amounts to a loss of $400. Etc.
2. Just as hard as the mediator comes at us, he will be doing the samething to Evolve. To not get too discouraged, Evolve will be taking their blows as well.
3. Ultimately, the mediator only cares to get us to agree. He's not interested in anything else. He just wants to get the parties to an agreement which requires breaking us both down - that's how they get paid, that's how they build up their resume. 
4. Lastly, the lawyer mentioned to make sure we are aware of state laws for punitive damages. Not every state allows punitive damages in arbitration (Tennessee does).

Praying the best for everyone involved and impacted. My hope - with all of my posts of the last year - is that somehow, someway, what I've been able to provide, share, and accomplish others will be able to learn from and better prepare themselves so they get real results.",6,1743562359.0,yotta,2,1.0,False
1jpej35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1jpej35/belize_trip_reflection/,Belize Trip Reflection,"Leaving a reflection on a recent first trip to Belize we took in March 2025.  We had long wanted to visit, had previously travelled to Mexico and Guatemala, and jumped on short trip to Belize.  We absolutely loved it and would return.  Beautiful people, amazing country, unique experiences, and a very easy country to travel in.

**Broke Up the Trip.**  With only 9 nights, we wanted to get a taste of different areas - 1) the coastal plain and beaches, 2) the inland jungle, and 3) the island life.  We stayed outside of San Ignacio, on Maya Beach, and on Caye Caulker.  Our first night was at the Belize Zoo.  We loved moving to different spots every few nights and enjoyed the travel in between. 

**Rented a Car.**  The car rental agencies are literally steps across the small street from the airport.  Book ahead.  We went with Crystal – no problems with an after 6pm check out.  Having a vehicle provided so much freedom and driving was a highlight for us.  Distances are relatively short, fuel a little expensive, and roads go from fantastic to rough at the next turn or urban side street.  Driving in Belize was easy and oddly relaxing, as the pace is slow and the scenery fantastic.

**Chose Two Must do Tours.**  We focused on smaller owner-operator businesses with a great reputation, more personable interaction, and stated intent to leave early to beat the crowds. 

* ATM Cave Tour with the famous Patrick Bradley.  Patrick is a true storyteller of Mayan history, a seasoned guide, an exaggerator with a great sense of humor.  This is a once in a lifetime tour in terms of Mayan cultural significance, sheer sense of adventure and the fun Patrick instills.    [https://www.belizelimpkin.com/](https://www.belizelimpkin.com/)
* Hol Chan Snorkeling tour including shark ray alley, a shipwreck, all close to Caye Caulker.  In the 5hr trip we saw plenty of eagle rays, turtles, heaps of nurse sharks, schools of fish, a crayfish, some beautiful coral – with signs of decay.  Fantastic swimming conditions, clear, water is so warm.  Capt. Wilson and dad run a reputable owner-operator business.   [https://cayecaulkerreeffriendlytours.com/](https://cayecaulkerreeffriendlytours.com/)

**Travel costs.**   For accommodation we (2 people) leaned on Airbnb and found some very unique and ideal spots – costs from $150-300 per night.  Car rental was closer to $100 per day, for the 6-7 days we rented.  We splurged on the internal fights between BZE to Caye Caulker – well worth it but would go water taxi next time.  For daily spending we easily used $130 USD cash for two people on restaurants, coffees, beers, groceries, fuel for car, and a few mementos.  We cooked breakfasts most days in our accommodation, which is ideal as the places we stayed were the destination.

**Customs/Immigration.**

* Use the sticky at the top of r/Belize to complete the Digital Customs Form.  We also used QR codes in the Caye Caulker airport.  Don’t use pay sites!
* As a tourist, don’t fret too much on what you are bringing in terms of customs.  We packed our bags FULL of gifts and items we wanted to consume – Nothing to Declare line.  80% of one checked bag included gifts and donations for pack with purpose.  We had no questions during entry/scanning of our luggage.  More on Pack for Purpose here: [https://www.packforapurpose.org/destinations/central-america/belize/](https://www.packforapurpose.org/destinations/central-america/belize/)
* DO fret about getting stamped in and out of the country.  During our exit the immigration official oddly waved us through his checkpoint and as we passed alongside his booth we laughed how he was catching up on a telenovela on his side screen.  No joke!  We knew something was wrong and backtracked, showed the QR codes on our phones, handed passports, and got the exit stamp we needed.  The airport is easy to navigate, but this misstep and risk surprised us.

**People Made Our Trip.**  We loved our interactions with locals, hosts, expats, travelers too.  Belizeans are easy to engage with.  We had precious interactions with kids, debates with locals, and always felt welcome and safe.  Picking up hitch hikers and chatting with foreigners who have made Belize their home was also a highlight.  I can see why people return to Belize and why many stay.",3,1743562275.0,Belize,0,1.0,False

1jped09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1jped09/april_fools_joke/,April Fools’ Joke,"On April 1st, I came across a viral Q&A post.  
“How do you stop your wife from suspecting that you’re cheating?”  
The top comment had the most upvotes:  
“Just confess to your wife on April Fools' Day and then wish her a Happy April Fools’ Day.”  
“She’ll think you’re just joking, and she’ll let her guard down from now on.”  
I didn’t think much of it, but then I saw a screenshot of a chat conversation posted by the person who answered.  
Although the profile picture was hidden, the messages were identical to those my husband had sent me.  
When I saw that comment at the bottom of the post, it felt like my blood froze. My fingers tightened around my phone, turning white.  
I’ve been married to Jack for five years, and our relationship had always been stable.  
I stay at home as a housewife, but I also run a food blog with a significant following. My videos get a lot of views, and I earn quite a bit—probably just as much as Jack.  
Whenever I went grocery shopping, the neighbors would compliment me on having such a good husband. I always thought so too, until today, when I saw that post.  
I didn’t believe it, so I clicked on the person’s profile to examine the avatar more closely.  
The man in the picture was wearing a suit with the collar exposed, but I recognized it immediately.  
It was the same custom suit Jack had worn on our fifth wedding anniversary.  
Although it was expensive, I didn’t tell him the real price because I didn’t want him to feel pressured.  
I continued scrolling through his profile.  
“How to hide an affair—proven effective.”  
“Say this to your wife, and she’ll think you’re a deeply devoted husband.”  
“Cheating secrets that won’t get caught—updated regularly.”  
Clicking on these posts, I saw various chat logs between him and other women, all of which were messages he had once sent to me.  
My phone slipped from my hand and landed on my foot.  
I wasn’t sure if it was the physical pain or the realization of my husband’s betrayal that made tears fall uncontrollably.  
I couldn’t believe it. My husband had been cheating on me all along, and I had no idea.  
I quickly took screenshots to save all the evidence.  
Click, click.  
As I was screenshotting, I heard a notification from the house.  
I followed the sound and saw Jack’s tablet on the nightstand, constantly receiving messages.  
I unlocked the tablet with Jack’s birthday and opened it.  
This tablet was used by Jack to handle work at home, but from what I had just seen, he wasn’t working.  
He was selling “cheating tips” and contacting his affairs in a forum.  
Sure enough, one message was from a girl with a cartoon cat avatar.  
“Jack\~ Can you come see me today?”  
“I’m wearing the pajamas you bought me\~”  
She sent a photo of herself in lingerie, intentionally revealing some intimate details.  
And Jack actually replied to her.  
“I’ll come after work, my little darling. I can’t wait to see you.”  
After sending that, he used another account to send me a message:  
“Sweetheart, I have to go fishing with the boss today, so I won’t be coming home.  
“I’ll catch a big fish for you when I get back\~”  
I felt sick to my stomach and couldn’t stop myself from vomiting into the trash can nearby.  
After a few minutes, I started to calm down and continued scrolling.  
There were over a dozen girls listed, but some of them had stopped replying.  
I guessed that once Jack got tired of them, he’d cut them off and find new targets.  
The pinned post seemed to be a recent find.  
“Scumbag!”  
“A dog who can’t control his lower half, turning his affairs into a bragging point!”  
I cursed while copying everything from the tablet onto a USB drive.  
Then, I sent Jack a message:  
“Make sure to stay safe, my dear husband\~”  
When I saw these things, my first reaction was to gather the evidence and divorce him, making him leave with nothing.  
But after a moment of reflection, I realized that would be too easy for him.  
Losing a little money and reputation? That wouldn’t be enough. I wanted him to pay.  
Maybe it was because he forgot to log out of his account, but when I tried to check the messages again, the login was already gone.  
A second later, Jack’s account sent me an update:  
“Tell the wife you’re going fishing, and she’ll think you’re fishing in the lake, but in reality, you’re fishing for beautiful women in bed.”  
The post included screenshots of our conversations and unedited photos of the girl.  
The comments below were full of praise for him:  
“You’re amazing! You’ve got such young girls, you must be really something!”  
“Such a life is really enviable\~”  
Jack probably felt like a superstar reading these.  
“Jack, the more you gloat, the more hopeless you’ll feel when the punishment comes.”  
The first thing I thought of was to go to the hospital and get checked for any diseases this scumbag might have given me.  
After all, my health was the most important thing.  
On the way to the hospital, I looked at a post from another man confessing his affair, and one photo caught my eye.  
It was a family photo of him with his wife and child. He was standing behind them, and the woman was holding their kid.  
Why did it feel familiar?  
Because it was a month ago, I had seen this woman in my fan group. She was my top fan, Jean.  
Back then, she happily told me how much her husband and child loved the recipes I shared.  
I never thought I’d see her name under a post about a cheating husband.  
I immediately contacted her.  
“Hello, I need to talk to you about something.”  
The air conditioning in the taxi made my hands and feet cold, and even my typing fingers trembled.  
I was worried that telling her about this might ruin her marriage.  
And her daughter was so young—would she be able to handle the truth?  
Jean replied quickly, sounding excited.  
“I never thought my favorite blogger would contact me privately. I’m so excited!”  
“If you need anything, I’ll definitely help!”  
The more she said this, the more guilty and uneasy I felt.  
But I sent her the draft I had prepared.  
“I found out that my friend’s husband is cheating, and I’m not sure if I should tell her.”  
I saw the message bubble appear in the chat, and I nervously swallowed.  
Even the driver noticed my unease.  
“Don’t worry, miss, everything will be fine at home,” he said as he turned off the air conditioning.  
The brief kindness from a stranger helped calm my nerves. I smiled and nodded at him.  
At that moment, Jean sent a reply:  
“If it were me, I’d definitely tell the other person. This kind of thing can’t be forgiven.”  
I decided to tell her about my situation first, so she could discover the truth on her own.  
“Actually, the friend is me.”  
There was a long silence in the chat, and before she could respond, I arrived at the hospital.  
While waiting for my blood test results, I started to feel uneasy again.  
Suddenly, my phone buzzed, and Jean’s reply made me smile.  
“Shall we take revenge together?”  
She must have figured it out from the post I shared.  
“Cheaters should pay the price, don’t you think?”  
Jack came back the next morning, holding fishing gear and looking downcast as he entered.  
Though he seemed regretful, I could still see the satisfaction in his expression from fulfilling his desires.  
“Wife, I fished all night, but still came up empty…”  
His head rested on my shoulder, looking like a dog that had been beaten.  
I patted his messy hair.  
“It’s okay. We’ll just try fishing somewhere else next time.”  
I pretended not to know anything and acted like the foolish housewife who still believed in him.  
“Go get cleaned up. I made you some soup. You haven’t slept all night—drink it and rest.”  
Jack went to the bathroom to freshen up, and I used a wet wipe to clean the areas he had touched.  
Looking at the fragrant soup simmering in the pot, I took a photo and sent it to Jean.  
“The nourishing soup is ready! How are things on your end?”  
Jean replied with the same message, and I closed my eyes with a satisfied smile.  
“Honey, the price you’ll pay is starting to take shape\~”  
Jack drank the soup and felt a little groggy, unsure if it was from yesterday’s efforts or just from exhaustion.  
All he wanted was a place to sleep.  
After kissing me on the cheek, he went straight to the bedroom and collapsed into a deep sleep.  
I cleaned up the dishes, hearing his snoring from the bedroom, before I felt at ease and walked into the room.  
I used Jack’s fingerprint to unlock his phone, then installed the content-syncing app I had on my phone onto his device.  
This was the plan Jean and I had discussed after deciding to take revenge on the scumbag.  
The app was something I got from a friend I knew back in college, all to get the evidence we needed.

Jean's speed was quick. Looking at the messages on my phone, I couldn’t help but feel quite pleased.

""My dear husband\~ I hope your body can endure all of my revenge.""

After that day, my video account announced a temporary halt in uploads. I needed to make my husband pay the price first—how could I focus on managing the account as I did before?

When I arrived at Jack's company with the lunch box, I ran into Jean right at the entrance. We had already video-called, but I didn’t expect that my unfaithful husband would be working at the same company.

Jean's voice was as gentle as her personality: ""I was going to bring you the ingredients after I finished cooking\~""

I couldn’t understand why her husband would cheat. Such a good woman, yet she wasn't properly cherished.

She pressed the button for the top floor, and almost instantly, I knew who her husband was. I got off the elevator on the middle floor, exchanged a glance with her, and then walked into Jack's work area.

I didn’t visit his company often, only meeting a few of his close colleagues.

""Who are you? Why are you in our work area?"" A young woman stepped in front of me and questioned me. Although her words were directed at me, her eyes clearly indicated that she recognized who I was.

I didn’t answer, seemingly contemplating which of Jack’s past lovers this girl might match.

It was another observant colleague who spotted me and quickly came over to pull her away. She scratched her head apologetically toward me.

""Hellen, what brings you here today? Jack’s busy. Don’t mind Lisa, she’s new and doesn’t know any better.""

I narrowed my eyes and vaguely remembered this girl named Lisa. She was Jack's previous mistress, whom I discovered and forced him to break up with.

No wonder she looked at me with such hostility.

A worthless cucumber, and they’re fighting over it.

When I entered Jack's office, he was sitting at his desk processing documents. He didn’t even stand up when he saw me.

""Darling... what are you doing here?""

I placed the lunch box on the table, my voice carrying a hint of sweetness.

""Just came to bring you lunch, worried your stomach isn’t good. It’s bad to eat outside, it could affect your health.""

Jack smiled, but it was clearly forced. As soon as I moved, he seemed nervous.

I suddenly found this quite amusing, so I stood up and deliberately walked closer to his desk.

Jack broke out into a cold sweat, constantly swallowing, afraid that someone would notice what he was doing under the table.

""Darling\~ you must eat well\~ this is a wonderful tonic for your body\~""

Then I turned and left the office, but I could still vaguely hear Jack’s voice.

""Damn! That almost gave me a heart attack...""

I sat in the coffee shop downstairs with Jean, leisurely sipping my coffee.

A post I was following on my phone suddenly updated, so I opened it to check.

""My wife brought me lunch, but I was secretly cheating in the office.

""Nervous and thrilling, after she left, I had a wild time in the office.

""Afterward, I ate the big tonic meal she brought, and my conquered wife will never suspect me.""

It even included a photo, showing a woman lying on the desk, covered in red marks, with comments filled with admiration and praise for Jack. They practically revered Jack as a god of infidelity.

For a moment, I didn’t know whether to curse Jack or pity the woman. Her naked photo was exposed to the public. I wondered if she would break down after seeing this.

I shook my head and saved the new evidence as screenshots.

Jean, however, remained unusually calm, which made me curious.

""You seem to be used to this kind of thing?""

Jean enjoyed the rich aroma of her coffee.

""It’s not that I'm used to it, it’s just that they gave us an opportunity.""

I grew more suspicious. ""What opportunity?""

""My marriage is a business one. Although there’s some emotion involved, to me, the benefits are the most important.""

""He gave me an opportunity to bring him down. How could I not be happy about that?""

""Don’t worry, my actions won’t delay your revenge on your husband.""

I looked at Jean seriously, beginning to understand her perspective.

Who says women can only be housewives?

Who says we have to tolerate infidelity?

A smile spread across my face, and I found the coffee in front of me even more enjoyable.

""It seems our opinions align perfectly.""

When Jack got home from work, he saw me wearing an apron, making soup in the kitchen.

He came over and hugged me, still smelling of the lingering scent of women’s perfume—sweet and cloying, making me feel nauseous.

But I couldn’t show this emotion yet. I just smiled and turned to embrace him.

""Hubby, you’re back! I missed you so much\~"" I said.

But on the side he couldn’t see, my face darkened, and I almost wanted to strangle him right then and there.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed, and Jack loosened his hold on me.

He quickly pressed the screen down to hide what was on it, unaware that the message had already synced to my phone.

""Sweetheart, it’s something from the office. I’ll go handle it.""

Watching him walk into the study and close the door, I opened the message on my phone.

It was from that girl.

""Jack\~ The water's been cut off at my place. Want to come shower with me?""

She seemed particularly skilled at using her body to flatter men.

Along with the message, she sent a photo of herself with a towel that was about to fall off.

Jack was smiling so broadly that his grin almost reached the back of his head. He hurriedly sent the girl a voice message.

""Miss me that much? Didn’t I take care of you enough at the office today?""

When I clicked play to listen, my skin crawled with disgust.

""Sweetheart!""

Suddenly, Jack burst out of the study, startling me so much that I turned off my phone, afraid he would find out.

""I’ve got a colleague nearby whose water’s been cut off. She was wondering if she could use our shower,"" Jack said with a clumsy excuse.

His story was so poorly constructed. The nearby neighborhoods all share the same water supply pipe. How could part of the area be cut off while the rest had water?

In just a few seconds, I saw through Jack’s plan but still agreed to his suggestion.

After all, I wanted to watch him dig his own grave.

""Baby, let her use our shower,"" I said. ""Don’t worry, Hellen will never find out.""

The doorbell rang soon after, but Jack didn’t dare open the door himself. Instead, he asked me to answer it.

After the girl entered, she shot Jack a playful glance as if I weren’t even in the room.

""Hello, sister-in-law\~""

Before she came to my house, I thought maybe this girl was innocent. But now, though she respectfully greeted me, her subtle challenge toward me was unmistakable.

I knew that she and Jack were in cahoots, one willing to strike and the other willing to take the hit.

""The soup’s still cooking in the kitchen. If you need anything, ask Jack,"" I replied.

Jack seemed pleased with my response.

As I headed toward the kitchen, he tried to cover up his nervousness by calling out loudly, ""Sweetheart, I’m going back to the study to handle some work!""

But he didn’t notice that my phone was set to selfie mode and was facing directly toward the bathroom.

I lifted the lid of the pot, inhaling the rich aroma of the soup, and pulled out a small gourd-shaped bottle from my apron pocket.

Inside it was powdered herbs—an ingredient that could cause weakness and shortness of breath.

After all, when I started my food blog after marriage, I specifically learned about herbal medicine from the local herbalists.

I stirred the herbs into the soup, letting the powder dissolve completely.

I ignored the occasional soft moans coming from the bathroom.

When Jack came out of the bathroom, I suddenly appeared in the kitchen holding a knife, my face cold with a sinister smile.

Jack froze in fear, collapsing onto the floor, his voice trembling.

""Sweetheart... Sweetheart, you’ve misunderstood! I... I just...""

I tilted my head, showing no emotion in my eyes. ""Misunderstood what?""

Jack’s legs were shaking uncontrollably, and I could see a faint wet stain in the middle of his pants.

After scaring him enough, I finally lowered the knife.

""I just finished cutting the ribs. I was wondering if your colleague wanted to join us for dinner?""

When he heard that, he finally breathed a sigh of relief, scrambling to his feet, but his legs continued to tremble.

""Sure! Sweetheart, your cooking is so delicious. I’ll let her try your cooking,"" he said, reaching out to embrace me. But when he saw the knife, he quickly retracted his hand.

The dinner wasn’t very pleasant. Jack kept thinking about the moment I scared him earlier, while the girl across from him had her foot on his thigh, but he barely noticed.

""Well, Hellen, I’ll head back now. Jack, see you at the office tomorrow\~"" she said, her tone split between disdain for me and flirtation with Jack.

That night, lying beside Jack, I brought a flower pot into the bedroom before sleeping.

The flower was quite ordinary, but if someone who’d been startled during the day smelled its fragrance while sleeping, they would fall into a deep, dreamlike state, waking up repeatedly only to fall back into it. Over time, this would lead to nervous exhaustion.

I looked at Jack, already breaking into a cold sweat, and smiled with satisfaction.

""Sweetheart\~ Your time for sweet dreams is over\~""

For the next week, Jack was tormented by nightmares every night. Each time he woke up and saw me asking if he was okay, he trembled and tried to distance himself from me.

Even his communication with that girl gradually dwindled. Whenever she sent seductive messages, Jack would come up with various excuses to delay her.

One day when I brought Jack lunch, the girl had just left the office. She shot me a vicious glare, clearly frustrated at not getting what she wanted from Jack, and then looked at me with displeasure.

After setting down the lunchbox, I looked at Jack’s pale face and deliberately added a tone of concern.

""Sweetheart, are you not feeling well? Should you rest properly?""

Jack shook his head. He had been having nightmares frequently, and now, whenever he saw me, he instinctively wanted to avoid me.

Sighing, I pretended to be sad and left the office.

This time, I didn’t take the elevator but headed to the stairwell.

I had just seen that girl enter there.

The hallway was filled with the pungent smell of smoke, and it was so quiet that I could only hear one person speaking.

""Damn it! Why did she suddenly lose interest in me?""

""Could it be some other bitch seduced her? Is it one of the interns?""

The girl muttered, occasionally puffing out smoke rings.

She turned and locked eyes with me.

""Ah, isn’t that Hellen? Why are you out so soon?""

Lisa extinguished her cigarette and slowly walked toward me from downstairs.

""You heard all that?""

I could only feel how the smoke on her body was so pungent, making me unwilling to converse with her.  
""Don't worry,"" she said casually, ""I'm not trying to destroy your family. I just want to get what I need from him.""  
""When I have what I want, I'll naturally cut ties with him, and then I’ll return Jack to you.""  
She spoke so easily, as though Jack was merely an object she could use and return when done.

I raised an eyebrow slightly. ""Why would you think I’d want something that's already been used by someone else?""  
""Sorry, I’m a bit of a clean freak. What you don’t want, I don’t want either.""

She suddenly burst into laughter and moved even closer to me.  
""Hellen, I think you’re more interesting than him.""

I couldn't help but roll my eyes, pushing her away as I left through the stairwell. Before I closed the door, I left her with a final remark.  
""What are you after with me? You might as well take care of your own body; no one else can control that.""  
I had a pretty good guess at what she wanted from Jack, but I didn’t approve of her methods. Trading with one's body only leads to self-harm or leaving someone with a hand to hold over you. Though I wasn’t some grand heroine, I at least refused to be someone who submitted.

But this was certainly a piece of information that could be used. Since she had actively seduced Jack, I could choose to use her in return.  
I opened my phone and found the girl who had first stopped me.  
""Are you there? Want to know why Jack dumped you?""

The reply came quickly. I knew her feelings for Jack weren’t as simple as just a one-night affair. After all, she often sent him messages, hoping he would change his mind, but received no replies, even being blocked. A person with such obsession was likely to do something crazy, and I was very curious.

As I subtly brainwashed Yao Yao, I continued feeding Jack the ""super-nutritious soup,"" sending him meals for a month straight. His condition visibly worsened, losing weight from the continuous torment and nightmares.

As he stopped updating, most of the comments on his account were asking,  
""Has the host been found by his wife?""  
""Still waiting for the host to give us more benefits.""

I smirked at one comment that felt especially accurate. ""Indeed, he’s been found, but he can't update, and it’s not just because of that.""  
I really wanted to reveal to the commenters that the real reason Jack couldn’t cheat anymore was that he couldn’t even get it up.

After preparing today’s meal, I had to visit the office, only to find the floor where Jack worked had turned into chaos.  
A girl named Lisa was pulling the other girl's hair, her eyes bloodshot as she screamed in fury.  
""You bitch! You seduced him, didn’t you!""

The younger girl was clumsy in her struggle, and Lisa's anger had reached its peak. This erupted during the lunch break.  
A few employees tried to intervene, but most were just watching the spectacle.  
""You can't handle your man and now you want to blame me? Fine, I’ll return him once I’m done with him!""

Her words were just like what she had said to me, but it only enraged Lisa further.  
The two women were suddenly pulled apart.

I hid in the crowd, sharpening my voice.  
""If this were streamed, I bet it’d make quite a bit of money!""

My provocation had a few people filming the scene, and before long, it quickly made it to the trending list. I thought it’d be shut down fast, but I received a message from Jean.

""I told my husband about what’s going on on your floor, and I also mentioned the company’s stock price drop. He fainted from rage.  
""He’s being resuscitated right now, so no one has time for your floor.  
""Keep making a scene, this is perfect for us to profit from.""

I relaxed, watching the scene unfold. I figured it was about time for Jack to appear.

Jack walked over, unsteady, his exhaustion evident in his eyes.

I glanced at the comments in the livestream, feeling strangely satisfied.  
""Is this the guy the two women are fighting over? He’s this weak?""  
""He must’ve been drained by them! Trying to have both?""  
""Which one’s the wife and which one’s the mistress?""

As I considered the comments, plotting when to make my appearance, I saw Lisa, suddenly bolstered by unknown strength, break free from those holding her back.  
She rushed over, tearing open the other girl's shirt, exposing her chest completely.

Some sharp-eyed viewers began to comment on the mole and tattoo, recognizing the girl as the one from Jack’s posts.  
""Isn’t that the girl from the post? Could this weak guy really be the one they’re fighting over?""

Within minutes, Jack’s post link appeared in the livestream, and the scene hit the number one trending topic.

""Thought it was some rich guy playing games, turns out he’s just weak.""  
""He's ordinary, but wow, look at the games he’s playing.""  
""Disgusting, really feel sorry for his wife. I’d be tempted to chop his dick off.""

As the two women continued their futile fight, someone had spilled the truth, so now it was my turn to make an entrance.

Trying to stop them, Jack was shoved by Lisa, falling to the ground in a mess. I slipped in from a less crowded side, the meal I was holding falling to the floor.

The sudden change in the situation left the chaotic scene in an eerie silence.  
""Husband? Could it be that all this is true?""

I acted like a naïve fool, just realizing the truth, covering my mouth as I feigned tears.  
There were no screaming accusations, no curses.  
The more silent and broken I appeared, the more pathetic and unlucky I seemed.

The comments quickly turned their focus to me, as if they were preparing to judge Jack.  
I didn’t give him the chance to speak, instead throwing out a series of questions that, while seemingly filled with doubt, effectively summarized his wrongs.

""So, you really cheated with these two girls at work?""  
""And those posts about your cheating, were they real?  
""No wonder I’ve been trying to help you with your health, but we can’t conceive… you’ve already been drained by them, haven’t you?""

I wiped away the nonexistent tears, performing the scene with great skill. I even thought I should be awarded a trophy for my performance.

Jack, in a panic, tried to explain himself, but the moment he stood up, he collapsed backward.

The live stream abruptly cut off at that moment, but the heat of the incident didn’t diminish.

I followed the ambulance to the hospital, my eyes red, looking utterly pitiful.

Jack's surgery was deemed a success, as his life was saved. Though most of his organs showed signs of failure, the online frenzy continued, and no one suspected that the herbs I had secretly placed in his meal were the cause.

When Jack woke up, he saw me sitting by his bedside. He confidently spoke, almost making me slap him across the face.

“Wife, I didn’t expect you to love me this much, taking care of me day and night...”

“I’m so touched. After I recover, we’ll live a good life together. When I’m better, you can give me a big fat son.”

He became increasingly shameless, confidently thinking that as long as he returned to me, I would always stay by his side.

“After all that’s happened, I realized, wife, you are the one who loves me the most.”

“Those women outside are just passers-by; you are my home.”

I rubbed my ears, my patience completely worn thin, eyes filled with annoyance.

“Are you brainless or do you have none at all? Are you the Jade Emperor? Do you think your words are imperial decrees?”

His sudden silence gave me the opportunity to speak.

“I knew you were cheating from the very first time. That’s why every day I added medicine to your food to prevent you from having children.”

“After all, who would want the child of a rotten cucumber?”

Although Jack was saved, I knew his body was already depleted. His current appearance was just a facade, hanging on by a thread.

Once that thread snapped, he would be gone, and only then would he tell the truth.

“Taking these herbs for just over a month won’t completely drain you. So, I started acting two years ago, when you first cheated.”

I was never a kind-hearted housewife. When a big goose in my village bit me as a child, I killed it on the spot and had my mom cook it for dinner.

In high school, when someone accused me of spreading false rumors, I quietly lurked around for a month, then shoved a dirty rag in his mouth and made him wash it clean.

I gently stroked Jack’s slumped head, tenderly like when we first got married.

“My dear husband, can you guess why I’m telling you all these truths?”

Jack’s eyes widened in shock, his breathing becoming more difficult, no longer showing the energy he had moments before.

“You... what did you give me...?”

He stuttered, trying to ask me what medicine I had given him.

But I simply pinched myself hard, letting the tears fall, and loudly cried in the hospital room.

“Doctor! Come quickly! My husband, he’s not doing well again!”

The machines beeped urgently. By the time the doctors arrived, his heart rate had flatlined.

One of the doctors sighed and patted my shoulder.

“We did everything we could, ma’am. Please accept our condolences.”

As the doctors confirmed his death, I nearly couldn't suppress a smile at the corner of my lips.

Jean, who had also lost her husband, sent me a comforting message. She had taken over the company and gave an inspiring speech to the board.

“I will make sure his company reaches new heights!”

Lisa and the other girl were fired from the company. Lisa was fortunate that no scandals about her were exposed, and she quickly found a new job. However, the other girl was publicly shamed, and wherever she went, people gossiped about her. She eventually had to leave the country.

After everything was over, I resumed posting on my long-abandoned account.

The first post was a public service announcement about which herbs are toxic and should never be consumed together.

Jean and I sat in a coffee shop, sipping rich coffee, both eyes gleaming with cunning.

1jpeaiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1jpeaiu/my_coparent_keeps_twisting_things_humiliating_me/,"My co-parent keeps twisting things, humiliating me publicly, and weaponizing “accountability” – I’m at my breaking point","I’ve been trying to co-parent with my child’s father (we’re not together anymore because he cheated on me), and I feel like I’m constantly being manipulated, gaslit, and made to look like the “bitter baby mom.” I’m exhausted and honestly starting to question myself.

There have been several times where he’s gone weeks without seeing our son, and when he does show up, he’s never actually sober—yet somehow, I’m the one constantly being accused of being the problem.

The most recent incident that pushed me over the edge: I was leaving a party and called him asking if he could bring out the full iced coffee I forgot inside. I was exhausted, already overwhelmed, and when he told me it was dumped, I got frustrated and upset. What I didn’t know was that he had me on speakerphone in front of 12+ people, including his family and friends. Everyone heard me being upset. As I drove by the building, I saw people literally turn and look at me. He set me up to be embarrassed.

Later, he told me everyone at the party now thinks I “treat him like shit.”

Then it turned into this whole thing about how I removed a tag from a Facebook post (one that his sister made—not even him) about our son’s birthday. He claimed that I “don’t want people to know he’s involved,” even though I posted all about the party myself. He and his sister made it seem like our son took his first steps at the party—to him—which wasn’t true. My son had already been walking.

It felt like a weird performance to make himself look like super dad in front of everyone, while at the same time I was being talked about and subtly attacked in social posts. When I tried to set a boundary and stop the argument, he said I was “avoiding accountability” and “couldn’t handle the truth.”

This is also a man who drank 12 beers at our son’s first birthday party—but now claims he’s the one who “cleaned up” and that I’m bitter and jealous of his growth.

When I ignore him, I’m “cold.” When I speak, I’m “aggressive.” When I try to disengage, he says I “run from accountability.” Even when I’m literally putting our son to bed, he says I’m “avoiding the conversation.”

I’m just tired of being blamed for everything while trying to keep things peaceful for our child. He constantly flips things and tells me I’m lying, manipulative, or hiding things for “clout.”

I have screenshots of it all, but honestly—I just feel broken down.

Am I wrong for feeling hurt? Is this emotional abuse? Or is it just a really toxic co-parenting dynamic?
If anyone has been in this kind of situation, please tell me how you protected your peace—especially when you have a child with someone like this.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed (like I was), especially after learning you carry APOE4, here are 3 things that made a real difference in my daily stress:

**1) Meditation + Journaling** Try a few different apps—Headspace, Calm, and see what clicks for you.  
Even 5 minutes helps.  
As for journaling, I just brain-dump whatever’s in my head. No filter.  
Then I make it a habit to write a few things I’m grateful for—small and big.  
Coffee that tasted great. News from a friend back home. A brain that’s still functioning just fine.

**2) Lift Heavy Things. Sweat a Little. Repeat.**  
Exercise is free therapy.  
Cardio clears your head. Lifting weights gives you a sense of control.  
And let’s be honest—it doesn’t hurt to look in the mirror and feel strong.  
Mood improves. Sleep improves. Stress goes down.  
Literally zero downsides.

**3) Nature Walks.**   
Yes it sounds like some hippie stuff, but walking in trees changes something.  
I used to think this was woo-woo stuff, until I read about *shinrin-yoku* (Japanese forest bathing).  
Turns out there’s solid science behind it—lower cortisol, improved immune markers, better mood.  
But even if you don’t believe in the science?

My grandma complains a lot that my mom caused her life sorrows. But tbh I think my dad is a big part and her other kids don’t have the best track record.

My mom had it but I didn’t start experiencing RLS until I started seriously training to run long distances in my early 20s. I understand it’s hereditary so I most likely inherited it. 

I had the ‘Forrest Gump’ experience where I just kept running to see how far I could go which eventually led to running fifteen half marathons in under two years. I started out running 1 then 2 then 3 miles and on and on leading to running 30-55 miles per week. I run 5-6 days per week now. I’ve been running for almost a decade now usually 30-60 miles per week. I’d love to eventually run a marathon and then ultra. Who knows if I can. This information is just for context.

When the symptoms got really bad, I took a break from running but the RLS did not disappear. I wondered if my caffeine intake may be affecting it so on a bad night where I couldn’t sleep and was in tears I decided to quit coffee to see if it helped RLS. It helps me sleep better when I do fall asleep but it doesn’t help the RLS. The only way I can fall asleep when I have symptoms is if I shove my toes from one foot into the bottom of the other foot and lay on my stomach with one arm under my head. 

I’m not sure exactly when RLS appeared but it was when I started consistently training. So curious if any athletes have had similar experiences. 

I was a vegetarian for seven years in my 20s but when my iron levels dropped dramatically and RLS was awful I was put on iron pills. I had RLS before my iron dropped and it just got progressively worse. I was a running for years before the weird iron levels. When the iron pills didn’t improve the iron levels, my dr suggested doing an iron iv. My mom died of breast cancer and I didnt want to feel like a cancer patient so I asked if I could try eating meat and increasing high iron vegetables to see if it would improve. I was hoping it would also solve the RLS. It helped my iron levels go back to normal thankfully but it didn’t solve the RLS. I was referred to a neurologist who recommended starting Gabapentin, if that didn’t work then Ropinirole, if that didn’t work an opioid, and if that didn’t work I’d be able to try benzodiazepine.

My mind is a labyrinth, dearest. Just when I think I've made it out alive, it takes me back to the moment when I realized how deeply I'd fallen for you. Back to when I first caught sight of your hands trembling around a cup of coffee, eyes jaded with sleepy tiredness, not gleaming with the mischievous spark that I'd mastered the art of teasing you just so I can bring it out. 

How vividly I remember clenching my fist behind my back, nails digging into my palms, almost breaking skin. 

But the only pain I truly felt was the pain of not being able to reach out, envelop your hands with mine, and never let them go.

Because when I love, I love so selflessly.

I still remember it with deep detestation: the day I first saw you light a cigarette. I remember how my heart sank as I witnessed that cursed death stick suck the life out of your lips.

If only I could pull it out and replace it with my own searing kisses– only a fool like me would dare fight fire with fire!

But rather than smoke, I'd exhale bits of my soul into your body –only the shiniest ones, not the broken ones, not the stained ones–with each sigh of adoration I let out, just so I could keep you in my arms a bit longer.

Essential Tips for Crafting and Finishing Yard Art Woodworks
------------------------------------------------------------

Creating beautiful yard art woodworks is a fulfilling project that can add charm and personality to your outdoor space. Whether you are a seasoned woodworker or just getting started, it's important to keep some essential tips in mind to enhance the crafting and finishing processes. Below are key insights to help you work effectively and produce stunning yard art pieces.

### Choosing the Right Materials

Start by selecting quality wood. Cedar and redwood are popular choices because they are naturally resistant to moisture and insects, which is crucial for outdoor durability. Plywood can also be useful, especially for intricate designs. Always ensure you choose untreated wood to avoid chemical interactions with any finishes.

### Planning Your Design

Before grabbing your tools, sketch a clear design. This serves as your blueprint, showing dimensions and making the cutting process more manageable. Consider incorporating elements that reflect your personal style or the theme of your garden. Simplicity can be key; sometimes, less is more when creating eye-catching yard art.

### Gathering Essential Tools

- Jigsaw or bandsaw for intricate cuts
- Sawhorses for stability while cutting
- Drill for making holes for eyes, anchors, and embellishments
- Sandpaper for smoothing edges
- Paintbrushes and spray guns for applying finishes

### Cutting with Precision

When it comes to cutting your wood pieces, precision is paramount. Use a sharp blade and take your time to ensure clean cuts. If you are working with intricate designs, start with larger pieces before moving on to the finer details. This helps maintain the integrity of the overall structure as you progress.

### Smoothing and Preparing the Surface

Once your pieces are cut, it’s important to smooth all edges and surfaces. Sanding helps eliminate splinters and prepares the surface for painting or staining. Use a finer grit sandpaper for finishing touches. The smoother the surface, the better your paint or stain will adhere.

### Choosing Finishes Wisely

The right finish enhances the look of your yard art and protects it from the elements. Here are some options:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Outdoor Polyurethane:** Great for clear protection without altering wood color.
- **Stains:** These can add color while highlighting the wood grain.
- **Paint:** Use quality outdoor acrylics for vibrant colors that stand out.

Make sure to apply multiple coats, allowing proper drying time between each layer. This will ensure lasting durability.

### Fun Features

Yard art is an excellent opportunity to get creative. You might consider adding motion elements like wind spinners, or interactive features such as bird feeders. Mirrors and colorful glass can also be used for extra flair. The key is to engage the senses and encourage exploration.

### Anchoring Your Art

Once your piece is complete, it’s crucial to secure it properly. Consider the following methods:

- **Concrete bases:** These offer sturdy support for larger structures.
- **Ground stakes:** Use heavy-duty stakes for smaller art pieces.
- **Hanging options:** For pieces that are designed to hang, ensure you use weather-resistant hardware.

### Maintaining Your Yard Art

Regular maintenance will prolong the life of your yard art. Check for signs of wear, such as peeling paint or wood degradation, especially after harsh weather. Touch up paint and finishes as needed to keep your art looking fresh.

Just wanted to see some different perspectives and views?

Even advice or insights. I uploaded this to ai to problem solve and create some boundaries but now I need human insights. I’m not open to leaving our relationship even if the response below sounds dramatic. I just typed out everything I was feeling previously in the moment and included extra information I gave ai.

— So i got upset at my boyfriend yesterday and i feel as if it was due to my excitement being diminished. I ended up crying in front of him for the first time which i never do but i tell him i usually dont talk abt my emotions verbally because ill cry. I usually type them out or something. But we had agreed that i would decorate my side of his car. My seat and he was so down for it and even told his friends about it. When the time comes i got things i thought were cute and started. Just some plushies, a blanket, and a bow lumbar rest and head rest. He said it was too much and overwhelming and okay thats fine i respected that but it still hurt and i removed my decor. He asked me why i took all of it away even though he was okay with some and he asked me why not compromise. I told him that his disapproval of it makes me uncomfortable seeing the items so its okay it i just got rid of the decor. But i cried about it because i was so excited for it and it made me realize how many “boundaries” or things i have to diminish myself for. Like right now his car was given to him from his mom and he said it just felt weird since he used to ride in this car as a kid and i was like ok thats fine i dont have to have any decor in him. Then he said he didnt know if he wanted his car to look more so like mine than his. I asked him why he didnt put any decorations in it and he said he didnt know it just didnt feel like his car or that he didnt get around to it. And i respected that. But it also made me realize how many uncomfortable situations i had to sit through. Like when he was sick i gave him medicine and checked in on him and stuff but when i was sick for spring break i was really upset because i had a week planned out and he did check on me but would say things like “oh ill get you soup” then never did, or would face time me while he was with his friends and be like “you would like this its so cute do you want me to get it. “ I would say “if you want to. “ then he even said he was going to ask for my size and go get it and never ended up getting it. Or one time for Christmas i told him about this one bag and he said he was going to buy it and almost did but because i said it was something i wanted he didnt get it which confused me. In the future he noticed i never bought the bag for myself then he said that i said i dont like when people buy me things im going to get for myself. I NEVER. Said that. He said that and i told him that. I explained to him why would i deny someone getting me something that i WANT. Thats the whole point of lists, etc. I even explained that whatever my family didnt get on my list i went back and bought for myself. But he didnt get me that bag and it was annoying bc he kept asking me what i wanted and when i listed items i guess his idea was to not get my anything i listed and get me something better but he didnt get my something better… he got me like $50 worth of gift which is fine but it was like… trinket stuff. Like a bow keyboard cap, a photo card, and bow earrings which i bought in another color for $12. I spent over $500 for him and focused on things he genuinely liked such has pokemon cards, his perfume, etc. then he tried to make it up for me valentines at got me a matcha basket, something ive been asking for and then right after that he tells me we have been spending too much money for gifts. Like what!! You get me one nice gift and now we’re spending too much money. And our gift giving is just for holidays and now it makes my gift seem ungenuine. I get my gifts bc i know they would like it, but for him it seems to be a cost thing. Like he knew i would like what he saw at the mall but refused to get it. Even times i always surprise him with coffee or snacks but he never ever surprises me with anything. He does get my flowers but now those seem ungeninue. Recently he got me followers and they just screamed “here, damn.” Like no flowers i like, i tell him i love orchids and to just get me those as they are the same price… but still no. I even went out and just made my own orchid bouquet because ive been wanting one since forever. You can really tell a difference between the amount of love i put into my bouquet and then just the flowers he got me on his break… and i know they have better flowers in store but he got me this neon yellow astorias and red ones. That was all in the boquet. I threw them away because it felt so forced and unloved. I even told him i wanted pink flowers…. I gave him the boquet paper. He’s seen the flowers i make for his mom and ive never even received similar from him. And on top of that i have ti deal with his family being slightly racist then he wants me to help him cope woth that. What do you mean you want me to help you cope with your family being racist towards me!!! What!! Stand up to them. We cant even move in together because of them, because hes so set on doing what they say and trying to make both parties happy. But i feel as if he can be doing extra to make me happy outside of that. Like maybe listeningto what flowers i want. Getting me gifts i actually ask for, etc. i remember i even asked him to text me more and hes like okay and never does it and this has been a problem for a while where he goes like 24 hrs without speaking to me. We work together so i see him but then hes ghost on his days off. He said he’d even send good morning texts. He does it for two days max and then nothing but when he asks me to change something i do. Like i used to just ignore him when im upset and now i talk it out with him even if it means ill cry. Then for our dates… which we rarely have we end up splitting in some way which is fine but its bothersone seeing other girls never have to pay for dates or have men who genuinely want to pay. Like we will have a date maybe 1 or 2 times a month. If we go to maybe 2 or 3 places in one day im expected to pay for one or i at least offer to be generous. Sometimes he will even ask me to split but heres the gag, he doesnt pay any rent, or bills and lives at home w his parents and makes 3.5 monthly just about! I pay rent and all my bills and his cat is living with me so its frustrating to see that he cant do anything! He cant either one pay for our dates, or two get me things that j get for him. And i feel like im not even asking for both, but at least one would be nice to counteract his parents behavior or the emotions i feel from it. Even from him not holding up his part and not ghosting me like he says he wouldnt. But i ended up blocking him and disabling my notifications bc i dont want to contact him at all right now. And i feel like bc im off for the next 3 days and dont have to see him, he can stay blocked. I dont even know what im going to tell him because this is a lot

ADDON - Also another detail is that he thinks its okay to let his family control his like just because “they’re asian.” Or “thats how asian families are.” But they control him in so many ways even to making him possibly quit his job or them being okay him him moving him with his friends but not okay with him moving in with me. And maybe that influences some of his decision making but even so we cant even have sleep overs for too long without them wanting him to come home just because they want his presence in the house. They dont even need him for anything. But also note that he is buying a house now so he cant rent, so mentioned that because i know his excuse will be exactly that. Keep in mind we planned to move in together in November when he wasnt buying a house so things were different then

ADDON - Oh and then when i get him thoughtful gifts for his family. Sometimes hes like oh that will be too much or thats doing to much. Like for valentines day i wanted to get his sister a gift and he was like oh no thats too much. And i was excited bc his sister is reslly sweet. I still got her a gift which was flowers and his mom loved it for her

ADDON - Even if this is a hard thing for him to change bc i know his parents weight heavily on his emotions too bc they were kind of abusive, let him know that he can be more engaged or supporting outside of that such as loving me similarly to how i love him. Rather than me dealing with his family but now also having to pile on everything else.

ADDON - You know whats even crazier. I like the point where you mention “what if i mess up again.” (Ai suggested this perspective) Because he did mention before that he used to love planning cheesy picnic dates, etc, and even got upset when his ex was the one not communicating or texting him enough. And maybe we just dont have the time because we work everyday day of the week except Tuesday and thursday but we have class those days so maybe its stress or overwhelming

TL;DR: I’ve been feeling emotionally drained in my relationship. I put in a lot of effort by planning thoughtful gifts, expressing love in small ways, supporting my boyfriend through tough moments, and trying to build a real future together. But I keep feeling like I have to shrink myself. He dismisses or downplays my efforts, does not follow through on things he says, and lets his family’s bias affect our relationship. For example, they are okay with him living with a friend but not with me. I know he is dealing with pressure from his family and a stressful schedule, but I just want him to be more emotionally present, thoughtful, and supportive in the ways I try to be for him.

I’m focused on community and love taking care of others. My love languages are gift giving and acts of service. I’m the kind of lover that will give you random gifts because something reminded me of you, that learns how to make you as comfortable as possible, someone you can talk to about anything, and someone who will hop up to help you as soon as I can.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

Literally second guessing the path I'm on in life. 

Distract me. Recommend me a song or show or movie. Tell me a story. 

Full disclosure I'm not looking for anything flirty. Just a conversation that may or may not last past when I eventually fall asleep tonight. 

About me. My 30th bday party was shrek themed. I like rollerblading down by the lake. My perfect day would include coffee, a farmers market, and a book store. I like cheesecake. Love baking but hate eating most sweets. I like to lift weights. I'm terrible at watching movies. In the last 10 years I've watched shrek 1, shrek 2, the Mario movie, school of rock, nacho libre. In case it's not obvious I like Jack Black. I like charcuterie boards but I'm lactose intolerant. I suck at drinking water. I use to play piano and guitar. I have a stupid tramp stamp on my back I got at 17. I ironically started listening to creed but now I like creed. I don't have a favorite color.

1jpdom9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpdom9/i_keep_dreaming_of_a_graveyard_that_doesnt_exist/,I keep dreaming of a graveyard that doesn’t exist.,"Two weeks ago, I saw her again—the girl I don’t remember, but who knows me too well.



I was walking down a street in my grandmother’s village. There was a girl walking beside me—blue dress, orange hair. 

I can't clearly remember her face. We walked past the park and headed down a road lined with trees on both sides. 

A couple of minutes later, we arrived at a graveyard surrounded by stone walls. They were a little taller than me and had some kind of engravings on them.



We stepped inside, and it looked like a normal graveyard filled with old headstones. The girl didn’t speak, and I didn’t feel like I needed to either. 

I wasn’t scared—if anything, it felt peaceful. Familiar.



Then I woke up.



It was an interesting dream, but nothing too strange. I didn’t think much of it—until two days later, during lunch at work. 

A random thought hit me: that graveyard felt real. Not just real… familiar. But I couldn’t place it. I’d been visiting my grandmother’s village every summer until I was fifteen. 

I thought maybe it was a memory. I checked the area on the map—zoomed around every corner of that place, looking for it.



Nothing.



Maybe the map data was outdated. That happens, right? Some old places don’t show up. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, though. So I decided to take a couple days off and visit my grandma.



That evening, I packed a bag and drove down. It’s only two hours away—easy. I got there around 9 PM. Grandma was surprised but happy to see me. We sat down, drank tea, caught up.



I didn’t tell her the real reason I came. That night, I had the dream again. It was almost exactly the same—except this time, I remembered her face.



Bright blue eyes. Orange hair. A small scar on her nose. Pale skin with freckles.



She felt familiar. But also like someone I didn’t know.



I woke up with a strange, distressed feeling. Grandma was already up—noises coming from downstairs and the smell of something amazing. I ate breakfast, and she poured us coffee. We sat down, and I asked:



“Grandma, I want to visit the graveyard.”



“Sure. Why do you want to go?”



“I want to visit Grandfather.”



“Oh, I get it, son. When do you want to go?”



“Right after this coffee, Grandma.”



“Alright. As you want.”



I finished my coffee and left the house. As I got closer to the street from my dream, I realized—it was exactly the same. The park was there. The buildings were in place. Everything matched.



I entered the tree-lined road and kept walking.



But when I reached the spot where the graveyard should’ve been—there were only trees. Just forest. I kept walking. Nothing. I felt weird—scared, confused.



On the way back, I saw an old friend walking. At first, he didn’t notice me, but I called out:



“Henry!”



He looked over, surprised, and walked toward me. He smiled, hugged me, and asked:



“Taylor! What brings you here?”



“I’m visiting Grandma.”



“Oh, nice! Good to see you after all these years.”



“Thanks, nice to see you too.”



“Where are you coming from?”



“I was trying to visit Grandfather’s grave, but… I guess I forgot where the graveyard was.”



“Let me take you there—we can catch up on the way.”



“Sure, let’s go.”



We walked for ten minutes. He led me to the graveyard. It was in a place I didn’t remember at all. I paid my respects at Grandfather’s grave, then said goodbye to Henry and returned home.



Grandma brought out a large photo album that evening. Old, worn leather cover—full of childhood pictures.



“Oh, Grandma, this again?”



“Come on, son. You know I love these. Let’s take a look.”



I sat beside her as she flipped through the pages. Photos of me as a child, with my parents, uncles, cousins. Then something caught my eye.



“Grandma—wait a second.”



I pointed to a photo.



“Who are those kids?”



In the picture: a little boy with dirt on his clothes and face. A shy-looking girl beside him—orange hair,her face just slightly blurry.



Grandma laughed.



“Oh, come on. You don’t recognize her?”



I squinted. No recognition at all.



“No, Grandma.”



She smiled. “That’s you and Juliana.”



Me? Juliana?



I felt something twist in my stomach. I didn’t remember her. I got curious and asked:



“Grandma… I really don’t remember. Who was she?”



“What do you mean you don’t remember? She was your best friend when you were little. You two were inseparable—little lovers.”



“Oh, Grandma, don’t start.”



“You remember Emma, right? Or Parry? That silly girl Mandy?”



“Okay, okay. Enough. I’m going to bed. Goodnight, Grandma.”



“Oh, don’t run off, Taylor! We haven’t even gotten to the other girls!”



I went up to my room and fell asleep.



That night, I dreamed again.



Same walk. Same girl. Same graveyard.



But this time… her face wasn’t clear again.



And the gravestones?



They had names on them: Mandy. Emma. Parry. Three more I didn’t recognize. All names I’d known from childhood… people I’d loved or been close to.



Juliana’s name was missing.



The dream ended, like before. I woke up. I was in shock. What I’d seen scared me. I stayed in bed for almost an hour, staring at the ceiling.



Eventually, I got up. Took a shower. Went downstairs.



Grandma wasn’t in the house.



Panic twisted through me. I ran outside, calling for her.



A voice came from the garden. She was tending flowers.



Relieved, I went back inside. While she was in the garden, I pulled out the photo album and flipped to that same picture.



The girl’s face was clear now.



I stared, frozen. My hands trembled.



She felt familiar in a way that made no sense.



Then the door creaked.



It was Grandma, carrying a few tomatoes and vegetables. She saw me and smiled.



“Oh, you’re looking at the photos?”



“Yeah… Grandma, can you come here a second?”



She walked over.



“Sure, what is it?”



“Wasn’t this girl’s face unclear yesterday?”



She looked at the photo, then at me.



“Yeah… it still is.”



“Still? What do you mean?”



I took the photo again. When I looked—her face was blurry. Just like before.



I dropped the picture and ran upstairs. Grandma called after me.



I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. My mind racing.



What was that? I swear I saw her face.



What’s happening to me?



Who is that girl?



Why can’t I remember?



Is she the girl from my dreams?



I don’t know what to do.



I stayed in my room for hours until Grandma came and got me out. I went downstairs, and we sat down. She began to speak.



""Listen son, I know you’re embarrassed about your childhood girlfriends, but it’s okay.""



Hearing that—Grandma still doesn’t realize anything—I got mad. I got up, walked toward the door, and said to my grandma,



""I’m going for a walk. I need some air.""



I got out of the house and walked a little, but I didn’t know where to go. I was already scared out of my mind. I walked toward the park. In front of it were a couple of teens hanging out. I walked near them and said,



""Hi kids, can I join?""



""Sure man, come sit,"" one of them said. Three of them were sitting, all looking normal. One was eating chips and the other two were drinking some beverage. As I sat down, one asked,



""You’re not from here, are you?""



""Actually no, my grandma lives here, just at the end of the street.""



""Oh, are you Ms. Susan’s grandson?""



""Yeah, do you know my grandma?""



""Not much, but we know people in this village. You’re Taylor, right? My sister used to talk about you.""



""Your sister—who is she?""



""Juliana,"" he said. As I heard it, I stared blankly at his face. His hair was orange. Was he the brother of that girl I don’t remember? I was scared and reluctantly asked him, afraid of what he might say.



""Which Juliana? The one with orange hair?""



""Yeah, there isn’t any Juliana in this village besides my sister.""



""She’s in the village right now?""



""Yeah, she’s at home. Why are you asking?""



""Nothing, just asking. Anyway, I need to go. Have a good night.""



""Yeah, you too, man.""



I immediately got up and walked back home. As soon as I arrived, I wanted to ask Grandma about it, but she was already asleep. 

I didn’t want to wake her up, so I went upstairs and headed to bed, scared to sleep. It took me hours to fall asleep. I kept turning and turning in bed. When I woke up, I felt relieved.



That’s all I remember. It’s been a week since I returned from my trip to the village—at least, that’s what my friends say. I’m too scared to return there, or even talk with my grandma. 

I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what is real or not. Did I dream those things? Did they happen? Am I going crazy? Am I experiencing something otherworldly? I don’t know.



But every night, I dream of her. Of that place. Of the grave I never found.



I don’t know what’s real anymore.



Only that she’s still there. Waiting.



And that I’ll see her again tonight.

1jpdoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpdoim/the_last_voyage_of_the_horven/,The last voyage of The Horven.,"We know more about space than we do about the depths of our own ocean, at least that's what they say. I'm not sure who “they” are, or if there is even any truth to it. What I do know, is that what we found down there doesn't belong here. What I have seen, can never be unseen. It has changed me... forever. 

 

The salty cold spray splashed against my face as we pulled the cage over to the dump area.  A mix of The Dropkick Murphys, ACDC and Metallica blared from the deck mounted speakers as the rigging groaned under the weight of the haul. The cage, once in position, was flipped and opened, dumping 300lbs of Alaskan king crab onto the sorting table.  

“Get sorting greenhorn!” Yelled Cobb, the deck boss. Cobb was a big man in his early 40s, he was built like a linebacker and had the disposition of an irritable grizzly. Apart from the captain, he was the oldest, most experienced crabber on the ship. 

I nodded and stepped up to the table to begin digging through the mass of bright red legs and claws. Jimbo, a short wiry man and the only other deckhand on the ship, joined in and we began sorting by size and sex. The females and the undersized crabs are separated to be released back into the sea, while the legal-size males are dropped down a chute to the live well below the deck, where they would be stored until we returned to port.  

Being a crabber was never something I planned on doing. After graduating high school and disappointing my parents by refusing to go to law school like they had always planned, I decided to go traveling. I bummed my way around my home state of Texas for a while before making my way north, and then even farther north. I had originally come to Alaska with a friend who had promised me a career in the oil business. Unfortunately, that had fallen through, as most of his plans did. I found myself broke, jobless, and homeless in a cold and unforgiving climate. I could have called my parents for help, but my pride wouldn't allow it. I had set out to make it on my own and that is exactly what I would do it. I spent the summer working odd jobs here and there but never found anything stable. I was wiping tables at a bar in Unalaska when I met Captain Larsson.  

“You like working here?” He asked as he watched me prepare to clean up a puddle of vomit on the bar floor. His voice was deep and carried a hint of a Scandanavian accent. 

I looked up at him and shrugged, “Not really, but I need the money.” 

He was a tall man with broad shoulders, I guessed he was maybe late 40s to mid 50s. He had a head of shaggy blonde hair streaked with gray and a short beard to match. He nodded, “You look like you can handle hard work” He said looking me over, “I happen to be in need of a deckhand. Ever thought of being a fisherman?” 

I shook my head, “No, but I never planned on doing this either. How's the pay?” 

“Better than you’ll make here.” He said, glancing around the bar room. His eyes fell to the vomit on the floor, “And you won't have to clean any more of that, unless you make it yourself.” 

“Where do I sign up?” I asked.   

He smiled, “Come to the harbor tomorrow morning, we’ll get you sorted.” He finished his beer and headed for the door. 

“Wait.” I called after him, “Which ship is it?” 

With a slight glance back over his shoulder he called back, “The Horven.” 

Weird fucking name. I thought. 

 

“Wake up kid.” Said Jimbo, giving me a shove. “We got 50 more pots to haul in, no time for daydreaming.” 

I nodded and went back to work. The rest of the day went on the same as usual, haul in the pot, dump the catch, sort the crab, stow the pot. Captain Larsson was right; it was hard work, repetitive hard work, and damn was it cold. After four weeks at sea, you’d think I'd be used to the cold. But my warm Texas blood refused to acclimate to the frigid climate. 

“Incoming.” Yelled Cobb. 

The pot was pulled up the side of the ship and swung over to the dumping area. 

“Looks like we got a hitchhiker.” Said Jimbo, as he looked over the pot. 

“A hitchhiker?” I asked, trying to see what he was talking about. 

As the pot was spun, in preparation for dumping the haul, I saw what he was referring to. Clinging to the side of the pot, its tentacles in a writhing mass, was a giant pacific octopus. Hauling up an octopus wasn't exactly uncommon, but they were usually caught inside the crab pots. I hadn't heard of one riding a pot up on the outside, but there it was. It had an unusual color to it as well. I mean, everyone knows that an octopus can change its color, but this seemed different. It was a sickly gray color with odd purple veinlike designs covering its body.  As we approached the pot, I noticed something else. There was something clutched in the grip of the tentacles. 

“What the hell kind of octopus is that?” Asked Jimbo. 

“Biggest one I've seen.” Said Cobb. “Greenhorn, pull it loose and toss it overboard.” 

I nodded and stepped forward, “Hey guys, its holding onto something.” 

“Yeah, the cage.” said Jimbo, “Come on Evans, just get it done.” 

I reached out, preparing to pry the odd colored octopus from the pot. Suddenly it let go and dropped to the deck at my feet. I leapt back in surprise, causing the others to burst into laughter.  

“Shit, I got it.” I said, as I reached down for the limp creature. 

“Is it dead?” Asked Jimbo as he stepped over to look down at it. 

“It doesn't matter.” said Cobb, “Just toss it over already.”  

I tried to lift the huge octopus but kept losing my grip. The thing had to weigh a hundred pounds or more, and its limp slimy texture made it almost impossible to handle. 

“Move over.” Said Cobb, as he bent and hefted the limp creature over his shoulder, “Fucking greenhorn.”  

As he carried the octopus to the starboard edge of the deck, it dropped what it had been holding on to. I walked over and picked up the object, looking it over. It was a large egg-shaped stone, cracked open down the center. I turned it over in my hands, it was lighter than it looked. As I investigated the crack, I noticed it was hollow with jagged purple crystals within it. The crystals seemed to glow with an inner light, a soft, beautiful light. 

“AHH! HELP!” Yelled Cobb. 

I looked up to see the octopus’ tentacles wrapped around Cobb’s torso, its head bobbing around on his shoulder Jimbo and I rushed over and began trying to pull the tentacles free. 

“GET THIS FUCKING THING OFF!” Yelled Cobb, “ITS BITING ME!” 

We tried and tried but we didn't have enough hands, every time we got one tentacle free another took its place. Luckily the captain and Ramirez, the ship’s engineer, had seen the commotion and came running. With their help we managed to pull the creature off of Cobb and tossed it overboard. 

“Ahh!” Groaned Cobb, holding his shoulder.  

Captain Larsson rushed over to him and pulled his coat aside to inspect the wound. There were two large gouges, where the beak had taken out chunks of flesh. 

“Ramirez, Jimbo, get him inside and patch him up.” He turned to look down at the stone as it rolled across the deck. His brow furrowed as he studied it, “Evans, toss that thing overboard.” He said pointing to the stone. 

“What? Why?” I asked. 

The captain gave me a stern, uncompromising glare, “Do as I say, now.” 

I nodded, “Yes, sir.”  

The captain returned to the wheelhouse as the others helped Cobb inside. I walked across the deck and picked up the stone. When I had seen that it was full of crystals, I thought that it might be worth something. Me being broke, I could have used all the extra cash I could get. I glanced up to the wheelhouse and saw the captain watching me, so I made my way over and hesitantly tossed the stone back into the ocean. As I did, I looked back to the wheelhouse, the captain gave me a nod of appreciation. With a slight hesitation, I nodded back. With nothing else to do on the deck, I decided to head inside and see how Cobb was doing. 

“I'm fine.” Said Cobb as Ramirez packed his wound with gauze. 

“I know that.” Said Ramirez, pushing his glasses up on his nose. “But I still want you to stay inside and rest. I can help the boys finish up the haul for the day.” 

Cobb sighed and shook his head, “It's really nothing, the damn thing surprised me more than anything.” 

“No kidding.” Said Jimbo, “I mean, I know they can bite, but who ever heard of an octopus attacking someone like that?” 

Ramirez nodded, “It can happen, usually only if they are threatened. What did you do to it?” 

“No idea?” Said Cobb, “I thought it was dead, one minute it was completely limp. Next thing I know, the thing is squeezing the hell out of me and trying to gnaw my arm off.” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Well, whatever set it off, it took a serious bite out of you, my friend. But you're patched up for now.” 

Cobb started to get up from his seat at the dining table, “Alright, let's get back to it.” 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “We got this, you take it easy for now.” 

Cobb looked from Ramirez to Jimbo, then to me, “What do you say greenhorn? Can you try not to be a fuck up for once?” 

I sighed and nodded, “Yeah, Cobb. I can handle it.” 

“I’ll keep an eye on him.” Said Jimbo. “You just rest that arm.” 

And with that, Jimbo, Ramirez and I headed back out to the deck to continue hauling in the few remaining pots. A few hours later, after the last pot was stowed and the others went inside to the bunkroom to check on Cobb, I decided to head to the wheelhouse. 

 Captain Larsson glanced at me from behind the control panel as I opened the door. He took a puff on his long-stemmed pipe, filling the wheelhouse with the aromatic smoke.  

“Storms coming.” He said, looking back out the front facing window.  

I removed my hood and took a steadying breath, “Captain, I...” I paused. 

“What's on your mind Evans?” He asked, still looking out the window. 

I cleared my throat, “The stone, I was wondering why it bothered you so much? You took one look at it and...” I trailed off, feeling foolish for even bringing it up. 

“I've been a fisherman in one form or another for going on thirty-five years. I've never been married, never had any children, at least that I know of.” he grinned and winked at me. “I've had good seasons and bad seasons. I've seen good men die young and bastards live to old age. I've lost friends and found new ones. And I've done it all out here, on the water. The sea is all I've ever known, and its likely I'll die out here one day. Through it all, there's only one thing I've ever truly trusted.” He turned to face me, “Instinct. A captain has to know when it's time to turn the ship around to avoid a storm, or when to go for one more haul. A captain must trust his instincts, his gut feeling. Because when it's all said and done, it all rests on his shoulders. Do you understand?” 

I nodded but didn't speak. 

“When I looked at that thing,” Said the Captain, “I felt a deep and powerful dread come over me. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I tell you now boy, there's an evil about it.” 

Thunder rumbled in the distance. 

Just then, the wheelhouse door opened, and Ramirez came in. He was a heavy-set man with a kind face. 

“How's Cobb?” Asked the captain. 

“He’s sleeping.” Said Ramirez, “I was going to change his bandage, but I figured I'd just let him rest.” 

Captain Larsson nodded, “Fine, just make sure you change it first thing in the morning.” 

Ramirez nodded, “Will do.” He turned to me and smiled, “You did good today greenhorn.” 

“Thanks, I'm trying to pull my weight.” I said. 

“You're doing just fine, Cobb only picks on you ‘cause you're new. Next season you’ll be best friends.” Said Ramirez, as he slapped shoulder.  

“If he doesn't kill you first.” said Captain Larsson. 

Ramirez and I laughed. 

After another ten to fifteen minutes of small talk about the season, and what we would be doing when we got back to port, I was getting pretty tired. I told the two of them goodnight and headed for my bunk.  

The bunk room on The Horven was a small, cramped space, consisting of three sets of bunk beds along one wall. Cobb, who usually sleeps on the bunk above Jimbo, had lay down on the spare bunk and was out cold. Jimbo was snoring loudly from his usual spot, which would normally bother me. Tonight however, I was exhausted. Nothing would be keeping me up, or so I thought. As I lay down in my bunk, I heard the boom of thunder in the distance. I listened to the storm in the distance, growing closer and closer. Eventually the rocking of the waves lulled me to sleep, despite the booming thunder, and Jimbos snoring. 

Suddenly I was jarred awake by a heavy metallic thump. I looked at the clock on the wall, it was nearly 1:00, I had only been asleep for about an hour. I climbed out of my bunk and switched on the light to see Cobb lying in the floor, his body shaking violently. 

“Shit! Ramirez, Jimbo, somethings wrong with Cobb!” I shouted shaking them both awake. 

Ramirez jumped out of bed and rushed over, “Fuck!” he exclaimed, “Looks like he's having a seizure.” 

“What's going on?” Asked Jimbo as he sat up in his bunk, rubbing his eyes. 

“Cobbs having a seizure. Go get the captain.” Said Ramirez, “Evans, help me move him.” 

“Oh shit. Okay I'm on it.” Said Jimbo jumping up and rushing to the door. 

I knelt down next to Ramirez, “What do I do?” I asked. 

“Help me move him onto side and grab his pillow. Shit, he’s burning up.” 

After we carefully rolled Cobb onto his side, Ramirez slid the pillow under his head and raised his chin. Cobb continued to seize for around a minute before falling limp. 

“Is he dead?” Jimbo asked from the doorway. 

The captain pushed him aside and knelt down beside Ramirez. 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “He’s unconscious.” 

“Should we move him?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Let's give him a couple minutes, make sure the seizures are over.” 

We all sat in silence for the next few minutes. I think we all hoped that Cobb would just wake up and be fine, but that didn't happen. 

“Okay.” said Ramirez, “I think he's done. Let's get him into his bunk.” 

After lifting Cobb’s limp body into his bunk, Ramirez bent down and examined the wound on his shoulder. 

“Oh shit.” he said, after removing the bandages. 

“What is it?” asked the captain. 

Ramirez stepped back from Cobb's bunk, revealing the wound. The flesh around the bite mark was swollen and discolored. There were dark lines running out in all directions from the wound, which seeped a dark oily substance. 

“My god.” Muttered Jimbo, “Is he gonna be alright?” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Its clearly some kind of infection, but I haven't seen anything like it before.” He turned to the captain. “We need to get him back to port. All we have out here is ibuprofen, he needs a doctor, antibiotics. He needs more than I can do.”  

Ramirez ran his hands through his hair, clearly stressed. Aside from being the engineer, he was the ship medic as well. He took his responsibility of taking care of the ship and the crew very seriously. 

The captain put a hand on his shoulder, “I know you're doing what you can, I can't ask for more than that.”  

Ramirez nodded, “Yes sir.” 

The captain turned to Jimbo and me, “Evans, you stay here with Ramirez and Cobb. Jimbo, to the wheelhouse with me. We’re headed for Dutch Harbor, and I need coffee.”  

And with that Jimbo and the captain left. Ramirez and I sat there in silence for several minutes. Cobb's breathing grew labored as the ship rocked back and forth. Ramirez bent over Cobb and pulled open his mouth. 

“What are you looking for?” I asked. 

He turned to me, “I'm checking to make sure his airway is clear.” 

“I thought swallowing your tongue during a seizure was a myth.” I said. 

“It is, but he could still be choked if he...” Ramirez trailed off. 

“What?” I asked.  

He glanced at me, “Somethings wrong with his tongue.” 

“I thought you just said...” 

“Just shut up and come look at this.” Ramirez said interrupting me. 

I stepped over and looked into Cobb's mouth. Something was definitely wrong. Cobb's tongue was swollen and covered in lines, like scars. 

“What the hell?” I asked, “Were those there before?” 

Ramirez Shook his head, “No, I don't know what this is. The lines are too symmetrical.” 

He was right, the lines ran from the back of Cobbs mouth down to a central point on the tip of his tongue. And his breath, Jesus it was horrible, like rotting fish. 

“Ramirez.” The captains voice called over the intercom, startling us both. “I need you in the wheelhouse.” 

Ramirez looked at me, “Are you good here?”  

I nodded, “Yeah, I think so.” 

“If anything changes, anything at all, you come find me.”  

“Right, I got it.” I said, trying to sound confident. 

Ramirez patted my shoulder and left the bunkroom, leaving me alone with Cobb. The next half hour was pretty uneventful. Cobb slept, his breathing ragged and labored. I sat on the bunk next to him, waiting for someone to come and tell me what was happening. I was beginning to get bored when all of a sudden, Cobb started choking violently. I jumped to my feet and leaned over him, not knowing what to do. He coughed and sputtered, dark saliva flying from his lips.  

“Cobb, Cobb!” I shouted, “Fuck, I'm going to get Ramirez. Just hang on man, he’ll know wat to do.” 

I ran out of the bunkroom and up to the wheelhouse, my heart pounding in my chest. 

“Ramirez!” I shouted as I flung open the door. But he wasn't there. 

“What's wrong?” Asked the captain. 

“It's Cobb! He’s coughing and choking, I don’t know what to do!” I said, my breath coming hard. 

“Shit.” Said the captain before turning to the intercom, “Ramirez, get back to the bunkroom now, Cobb needs help.” 

“Where are they? What's going on?” I asked. 

He turned back to face me, a worried look on his face, “Engine room, something's wrong with the ship. The engine has power, but she won't move. We’re dead in the water.” 

“What do we do?” I asked. 

The captain stood up and threw on his coat, “I’ll head down to the engine room and see what I can do. You head back to the bunkroom; Ramirez may need help.” 

I nodded and we both left the wheelhouse. This whole situation was wrong. Of course, accidents happen. People get hurt or sick, the ship has problems, but... this was something else. I could feel it, like the captain said, instinct. 

I entered the bunkroom to find Ramirez, alone. 

“Where's Cobb?” I asked. 

Ramirez whirled around, “Jesus, Evans. You scared the hell out of me.” He shook his head, “I could ask you the same thing, what happened?” 

“He was here when I went to find you. He started choking on something. I didn't know what to do, there was some stuff he was spitting up, dark stuff.” 

“What kind of dark stuff? Was it blood?” Ramirez asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know. I don't think so.” I thought for a second, “I think it was black, and had chunks in it or something.” 

Ramirez studied me for a moment, “Whatever it was, we need to find him. He has a fever; he could be delirious.” 

I nodded and we left to tell the captain and Jimbo what was happening. 

 

“Gone?” Jimbo asked, “What do you mean gone? Where could he go?” 

“We’ll find him.” Said Captain Larsson, “Ramirez, you and Jimbo stay here, get my ship moving. Evans and I will search the ship and find Cobb. One of us will come get you when we do.” 

We all agreed, and the captain and I set out to search for our missing crew mate.  

We swept the upper and lower deck, the wheelhouse, the latrine, the dining area and back to the bunkroom. The Horven wasn't a large ship, but still there was no sign of Cobb anywhere. 

“Could he have fallen overboard?” I had to shout the question over the raging storm.  

We had gone back out to check the decks again, thinking that maybe we had missed him among the nearly 200 crab pots. 

“If he has, then he's lost. We’ll make a few more passes before we start thinking that though.” The captain shouted back. 

We started to make our way back inside, when I noticed something. The chute that we used to drop the crab down to the holding tank had a cover on it that usually stays closed when not in use. The cover was pushed to the side, leaving a gaping portal down into the tank. 

“Wait.” I called out, “Captain the hold.” 

The captain turned to see what I had seen. 

“Shit!” He exclaimed, “If he fell down there, he could be seriously injured.” 

We rushed over to the controls for the holding tank's large hydraulic door. The door groaned as it opened. The deck lighting illuminated the inside of the tank as the door opened wider and wider. I feared I would see Cobb's limp and broken body in the tank, being feasted on by thousands of large hungry crabs. But... I was only half right. Cobb was there, his flesh ripped and bleeding from the pinchers and claws of the large crustaceans, but he was still alive. He turned to look up at us, a large crab shell in his hands, his mouth was ragged and torn as he chewed the shell along with the meat.  

“What the fuck?” I exclaimed, stepping back from the door. 

The captain stood his ground, “Mr. Cobb, I need you to come with me. You aren't well.” 

He just stared back, unblinking as the freezing rain pelted his face. Dark blood flowing from dozens of open wounds. All the while, continuing to chew. 

“Cobb!” Shouted the captain, “Get the hell out here now!” He leaned over to me, “Go get Ramirez. Tell him to bring some rope.” 

“Rope?” I asked. 

Captain Larsson met my eyes, “I’ll not have this man loose on my ship.” 

“You think he's dangerous?” I asked. 

“Cobb was dangerous before he went mad. Now, I don't know what to think.” 

I nodded, “Yes sir.” and rushed off to get Ramirez. 

As I ran, I kept seeing Cobbs's face in my head. His face... it just looked wrong, like it didn't fit right anymore. What the hell was happening to him? I didn't think an octopus could even hurt a person, let alone give them some kind of infection. Whatever was happening, I would not be returning for another season on this ship. 

I entered the engine room to see Ramirez scratching his head. 

“We have power, I don't understand what's happening.” He said pacing back and forth. 

“Ramirez.” I called, “We found him.” 

After explaining how we had found Cobb and the state he was in, Ramírez's face went pale, “Madre de Dios.” He muttered. 

Jimbo tried to smile, “You’re joking right? You have to be joking.” 

His smile fell away when he saw the look on my face.  

“Theres more.” I said, “The captain said to bring some rope, he thinks Cobb may be a threat.” 

“What kind of threat?” asked Jimbo. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, but I think he's right.” 

Ramirez nodded, “I agree. If not to us, he’s clearly a danger to himself.” 

And with that the three of us left the engine room and headed for the deck. Ramirez found a large coil of thick nylon rope on the way. It was clear to see that the two of them didn't like the idea of tying up their friend, but what choice did we have? Something was very wrong with Cobb's mind. 

When we stepped out onto the deck, we saw no sign of the captain. We approached the holding tank door, still standing wide open, afraid of what we might find inside. But, apart from a half-eaten crab on the deck, there was no sign of Cobb either. 

“Where are they?” Asked Jimbo. 

“I don't know, dammit! They were both right here!” I shouted in frustration. 

Ramirez put up his hands in a calming motion “We will find them. Let's just stick together and search the ship.” 

We did exactly that, we scoured every inch of the ship and dammit there was no sign of either of them. After the search, the three of us sat down in the wheelhouse. Jimbo had his head in his hands. Ramirez just sat there silently, lost in thought. 

“Guys?” I said breaking the silence, “What do we do?” 

Jimbo took a breath and shook his head, “I don't know man, the captains gone, Cobbs gone. I don't know what's happening, but they are gone. I just want to go home.” 

“Look we don't know if they are gone, maybe we search again?” I suggested. 

“Wake the fuck up man!” Jimbo shouted, “They're gone. Something happened to them, and I don't want it to happen to me!” There were tears in his eyes. “They were my friends, but I won't die out here!” 

Ramirez stood up, “Okay, that's enough!”  

With the captain and Cobb both gone, Ramirez was next in command. Not that Jimbo and I were much to command. “Look, I think you are both right. Evans, I want to find them too. I care a lot about both of them, but I think Jimbo is right, something isn't right here.” He thought for another moment then said, “Whatever happens, the ship still needs fixed, so that's what I'm gonna do. Jimbo, I want you on get on the radio and call for help. We are pretty far out here and I'm not sure we will be able to reach anyone, but we have to try.” He turned to me, “Evans, search the ship for the others. It's possible they fell overboard, but if they are here, find them.”  

I nodded, “If they're here, I'll find them.” 

“And I’ll get to work trying to reach someone on the radio.” Said Jimbo, taking up position at the radio. 

“Alright.” Said Ramirez, “I’ll head below and see if I can figure out what's going on with the ship.” 

With the others tending to their duties, I headed off to search the ship yet again. Only this time, I didn't get far before the shit really hit the fan. 

 

I had just finished checking the dining area and latrine again and was about to head into the bunkroom when I heard Jimbo's voice over the ship intercom. 

“Evans, there's someone on the upper deck.”  

Finally, I thought. I had begun to fear that the missing men had fallen overboard, maybe our luck was turning.  

I stepped onto the deck and peered through the pouring rain, but I couldn't see anyone. I turned back to face the wheelhouse where I could see Jimbo looking out at me. I gave him a shrug. 

“He was at the bow, all the way out. I can't see him now.” said Jimbo, his voice tinny over the intercom. 

I wanted to ask him who was at the bow, I found myself hoping it was the captain and not Cobb. But I figured that at that distance he wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I made my way down the narrow path between the stacks of crab pots to the end of the bow, and still, I didn't see anyone. 

“Shit! Evans, He’s on top of the pots.” Jimbo sounded panicked.  

I looked up just in time to see someone jump across the pots overhead. Whoever it was they were damn fast. I began to feel less like a man searching for his friends and more like prey being stalked by some unknown predator. I turned and started back towards the wheelhouse. 

“Evans!” Jimbo's voice was growing more panicked, “Jesus, he’s...” His vice cut off abruptly.  

The nearest intercom speaker had gone silent, I could still hear Jimbo's voice coming from the speaker further up the deck, but with the storm raging around me I couldn't make it out. 

“Jimbo!” I shouted, fear taking hold of me. 

I ran for the wheelhouse, hearing the rattle of the crab pots above me as the unseen person pursued me. My heart pounded harder and harder with each step. Suddenly, I lost my footing and slipped. The cold hard floor of the ships deck rushed up to meet me. I tried to catch myself, but my hands slid forward on the slick metal. My chin slammed into the floor, splitting open and rattling my entire skull. For a moment, I was too stunned to move. 

When I finally climbed to my knees, I could feel the warm blood flowing from the gash on my chin, but that wasn't all.  I could taste it too, I spat the warm coppery fluid onto the deck and saw a few shattered teeth among the mess. 

“Fuck.” I mumbled painfully. 

I realized, I could hear Jimbo now. His voice racked with fear, “Evans, Ramirez! It's not Cobb anymore! Someone help me!” 

I stood on shaky legs and started toward the wheelhouse. I was still seeing stars, but Jimbo's panic spurred me on. “I'm coming!” I shouted.  

But, when I got to the wheelhouse, it was too late. The door had been smashed in, and Jimbo was gone. 

 “God Dammit!” I shouted in frustration. 

I rushed over to the intercom and called for Ramirez, “Ramirez, where are you? Jimbos gone, someone took him, I think it was Cobb.” 

I waited for Ramirez to come to the wheelhouse, praying I wasn't alone now. But he never came. 

After another ten minutes of calling for help, from Ramirez, the coast guard, God, anyone who would listen. I decided to head for the engine room, maybe he was still there, maybe the intercom was busted. I didn't know what to do, I just couldn't stay there. Before leaving the wheelhouse, I took the fire axe from its glass compartment. Whoever took Jimbo, even if it was Cobb, they wouldn't get me without a fight.  

I started down the stairs, axe in hand. I'm not a very big man, and the axe felt heavy in my hands, but I’d swing it for all I was worth if I had to. As I was about to enter the engine room, I felt a presence behind me. I froze, my grip tightening on the axe handle, but I wasn't fast enough. A pair of strong hands latched onto me from behind. One of them wrapping around and pinning the axe to my chest, the other clamped over my mouth stifling a scream. I squirmed and fought but couldn't break loose. 

“Calm yourself boy.” Came a hushed voice, “we may yet get out of this.” 

I calmed and he released me. When I turned around, I saw the last person I expected to see, “Captain Larsson.” I exhaled feeling a sense of relief, I wasn't alone. 

“Where have you been?” I asked, “We thought you fell overboard.” 

“I did.” He said in a shaky voice, “Cobb came after me like a mad man, swinging wildly. I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong, too primal. I ran, tried to get away, but the bastard chased me. His teeth chattering like he wanted to take a chunk out of me. I tried to make it back to the wheelhouse, but he tackled me over the side. I must have hit my head because I woke up hanging off the side of the ship, my leg tangled in the rigging and soaked to the bone.” 

“God, Jimbo was right.” I muttered. 

The captain nodded, “Whatever happened to him, he’s changed. When I finally managed to pull myself back aboard, I saw him. He’s not human anymore.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. “And how did he get back on board?”  

“I don't know how he got aboard. But I saw him break down the door to the wheelhouse, I tried to get there but my numb fingers couldn't move fast enough to get the rope untangled from my leg.” His head dropped as he spoke, clearly disappointed that he couldn't protect a member of his crew. 

I looked him over; he was absolutely drenched and shivering violently. I was amazed he was alive, let alone on his feet. 

“I tried to get there too, but I fell. We tried radioing for help, but I don't think anyone heard us. And I don't know where Ramirez is, I was on my way to the engine room when you found me.” I explained. 

The captain nodded, motioning for me to give him the axe. ""Good man. I’ll take the lead from here; you just stay close. I won't lose anyone else tonight.”  

I didn't argue. I handed over the axe and fell in behind him. I was just glad I didn't have to face whatever was going alone. 

As we approached the engine room door, the captain ducked low and motioned for me to do the same. He carefully turned the handle and pushed the door open, being as quiet as the squealing hinges would allow. We stepped inside and were greeted with a scene straight out of a nightmare.  

Cobb was there, but Jimbo and the captain were right, he wasn't Cobb anymore. His back was to us, but I could see enough. His hair had mostly fallen out, his head swollen and misshapen. His arms had lengthened, nearly to below his knees and his flesh was the color of a rotting corpse. 

Jimbo and Ramirez were there too. Their bodies wrapped up in a mass of black slime-like webbing that covered the walls of the engine room, like massive, bloated flies in a spider's web. I could see chunks of flesh missing from Ramirez's body, yet somehow, he was still alive. Jimbo squirmed and fought against the webbing when he saw us, his eyes pleading for mercy. 

We watched on in horror as Cobb stepped to the back of the room and knelt down, bowing his head in supplication as the octopus climbed out from the shadows behind the ship's engine. The creature had grown massive since the last time we saw it; its size dominated the engine room. 

“Holy shit. Is that...” 

“Yes.” breathed the captain. 

“It can't be.” I whispered, “Its huge.” 

“It is.” 

 The creature crawled over to the black webbing where Jimbo had been cocooned. 

“Jesus!” I gasped, “Its eating them alive.” 

 But before it could start in on its fresh meal the captain stood and began shouting and banging the axe against the wall. 

“Leave them alone, you bastards!” He shouted, before turning to face me. “Go to the wheelhouse, get the life raft and get away from this place.” 

“What? No, I'm not leaving you here.”  

“I won't leave my men to suffer. Now go!” 

Cobb had turned to face us. He looked even more terrifying now, dead skin hung loose on his face and his eyes bulged from their sockets.  

“Damn you boy, go now!” Yelled the captain, “I’ll hold them off.” 

He gave me a shove out of the engine room, then slammed the door behind him. With no other option in sight, I ran. I ran as fast as I could to the wheelhouse. I found the inflatable life raft and made my way out onto the deck, then hesitated. Could I really leave the captain and the others here? Where was I supposed to go if I did leave the ship? Maybe I could find a weapon and help the captain fight them. Yes, I thought. I would help the captain; we would save the others.  

I began looking around for something, anything I could use as a weapon, then I heard it. A wet, broken, gargled voice from behind me.  

“G... Gr...Grreeeennhorn.” 

I turned to see Cobb, standing at the top of the stairway. He had a large gash across his chest and shoulder, which oozed dark purple. I think he tried to smile, but the loose flesh didn't move with whatever was underneath. 

“Oh God.” I breathed. 

“N... Not y...yett.” Said Cobb, in his grotesque voice. 

He lunged for me. I tried to back away, but I slipped again. I fell hard onto my back, kicking out at Cobb. My foot made contact with his face and knocked more flesh loose, he hissed and sputtered as I continued kicking but I couldn't get him off of me. His long arms reached out and clamped onto my shoulders, pulling my face closer to his. I punched him as hard as I could, causing him to grunt in pain but he never slowed. In a last effort I reached out and took hold of the loose skin on his face. With a mighty heave, I ripped it away, causing him to howl in pain and me to shriek in terror. Underneath the dead skin was mottled gray flesh lined with purple veins, just like the octopus. He was left with a gaunt featureless face under a swollen and bulbous head.  

I screamed and screamed as his mouth opened, what was once his tongue was now a writhing mass of tentacles which reached out and wrapped around the back of my head, pulling me closer and closer to certain death. I fought and fought but could do nothing but watch as inch by inch my head would be pulled into Cobbs waiting jaws.  

Suddenly there came a wet thwack sound. The tentacles around my head tensed once more before falling limp along with the rest of Cobbs body. I scrambled back away from him to see the fire axe buried in his head. 

“Why the hell are you still here?” Asked Captain Larsson.  

I jumped to my feet, “The others?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Nothing to be done. Get the raft inflated, now. It's coming.”  

I grabbed the life raft and pulled the cord, the raft self-inflated in a sudden whoosh of air.  

“Wait.” I said, “Can't it just follow us into the water?”  

The captain smiled. “There is no us boy, I'm staying.” 

“Are you crazy? You can't stay here.” I said. 

He looked out to sea for a moment, “Did I ever tell you the meaning of the ships name?” 

“The Horven?” I asked, “Its Scandinavian, right?” 

He nodded, “Thats right. Back in Norway, my grandfather would always tell me tales of the old myths and legends. Tales of hero's and monsters. The horven was always his favorite, mine too I suppose. But the horven has another name.” 

“What name?” I asked. 

He smiled a grim smile, “Kraken.” 

I shook my head, “No. That's just a story...” 

He put his hand on my shoulder silencing me, “Maybe it is just a story. Or maybe, by naming my ship after the beast, I cursed us all. Either way, it's here and I’ll not leave while it lives.” 

“But...” 

“No, Evans. My mind is made up. Take the raft and go. If I kill the beast, I'll have avenged my crew. If it kills me, well, I’d like to think that at least someone made it out alive.” 

I studied his expression, “You don't think you can beat it, do you?” 

He looked down at his leg, blood pouring from an open wound and shrugged, “I'll give it hell all the same, maybe keep it busy long enough for...” 

Just then something wrapped around my ankle and began pulling me across the deck. I looked to see the huge octopus climbing its way to the top of the stairs from the engine room below. I screamed in pain and fear. The tentacle gripped my leg so hard; I thought it would crush the bone. Captain Larsson rushed forward and with a swift chop, severed the tentacle. We rushed to the life raft and tossed it into the sea below. I held the rope tight, keeping the raft from drifting away. 

“Captain, I can stay, I can help.” I said. 

He smiled warmly and put his hand on my shoulder, “Live a good life, son.” And with that he shoved me backwards off of the ship and into the waiting lifeboat below. 

The waves quickly pulled my raft out to sea, away from The Horven. I managed to get one last glimpse of Captain Larsson, before the waves took me away. A flash of lightning lit the scene as he swung the axe amidst the flailing tentacles, again and again. He screamed in rage as blood flew from the massive creature, and then I was carried away. 

 

I was only at sea for a few hours before another crab boat came along. Their captain had heard our distress call and came looking for us. After getting me some dry clothes and a blanket, they asked if there had been any other survivors. I thought about Jimbo and Ramirez, if they were alive, they were probably infected with whatever changed Cobb. I thought about the captain, I hoped he had survived, but didn't think he had. If he didn't manage to kill the creature, he’d be in the same shape as the other two. 

“No.” I said after a while. “There was no one else.” ",5,1743560150.0,nosleep,2,0.86,False
