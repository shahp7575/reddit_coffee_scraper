I'm looking into getting into the EA field, however from my understanding an EA is supposed to be like the right hand of an exec. So like doing the business strategy, market analysis, stand in for the Exec, budget planning, client meetings etc. generally book meeting and take notes in a lower amount . But generally Stuff more strategy related.
However I see many EA also do personal stuff for the Exec or just only book meeting, make sure everyone is happy and water and coffee is ready. But wouldn't that be a Secretary or PA, especially if you do stuff outside your work hours? 
Or is the three roles just blending together nowadays? 
Because I thought an EA was basically a springboard for becoming a project manager at some point. And that's what I am interested in at some point. 😊

 As children, we imagine these fantasies where we may be adventurers or pirates or secret agents, even inviting our friends to play along with us. Playing pretend is our first real taste of escapism and we choose to escape into worlds of wonder and adventure. 

Is it, therefore, the logical conclusion of that innate call to fantasize for us to learn to write down our fantasies into a palatable format that invites others to play along with us? Are we, deep down, children inviting friends and strangers to join in our fantasies of mystery, adventure, romance, and struggle? Is the art of writing just a wonderful game of pretend?

My husband has a side woman he cheated with on LDR cause she is in the US and we are in EU, the entire 2.5years in our 4 years relationship. Let's say her name is S. 

I confronted him about S many times, including asked him to discuss it in peaceful and mature manner, that if he found love in her I would peacefully gave up the marriage and let's get divorce so he could be with S, the woman he truly loves. Every single attempt to discuss I was met with extreme aggression, insults, blame shifting, suicide threats, and silent treatment, for days, weeks, he upped his antics, he locked himself in whichever room he can locked just so he didn't have to see my face or interact with me, in his own words. The true reason is just so he can freely chat and sexting with her in the locked rooms. We even didn't talk and have mini separation multiple times because of this matter. I have been called paranoid over nothing, schizophrenic, imagining things and ""the worst, ungrateful person in the world he ever met"" etc. because he said I cannot gave him even a crumb of trust. 

I never had concrete proof but the circumstancial evidences are overwhelming. How he picked up all hobbies, things, and likes that S likes. If S likes coffee he would drink coffee even though he has chronic stomach conditions and he would be in pain he would still drink it. If S went to Japan and the time zone changes he would flip his sleep and work schedule just to be up and present at the same time with her. He would sneaked out of the bedroom to the couch in the middle of the night because of the time difference and he wanted to video call or chat, sexting with her. And many more, little behaviour and personality changes to fit with S that in turn sliced my heart with little jabs every time. 
He became more secretive, closed, and gradually became meaner and more horrible towards me. Every argument and fights is because of S. One time he even got physical he tied me up with electronic cables and pinned me to the bed and choked me from behind because we fought about S again. That moment was when I gave up completely, like he went so far as to treat me like this rather than admit he is in love with S. He choked, hurt, and abused me emotionally every day for her. It's utterly disgusting. 

It also seems he found joy to show off how alike he is with S. Their music taste, their film taste, food choices etc. He knew I was keeping an eye of S social media so it was all seems more deliberate. If S posted about getting a certain jacket, he would ""coincidentally"" in his word, that the next day he would asked me whether he would look good in the same exact jacket (he literally showed me the web where they shop the jacket) but a male version of it. This kind of interaction is everyday for me in the past 2.5 years. 

Even how he met S, no matter what his justification on it if it's ever comes up, was clearly cheating. We were in one of those mini separation when he went back to his hometown in South America close to where S lives in the US. I knew at that time he went back to dating site and I knew that was how he met S. Makes me wonder if he ever got off dating site at all or not the entirity of our marriage. 

Since I left a month ago, he has been quickly erasing my traces from every aspects of his life and he moved and secured a new apartment just 4 days after I left. (This is in a country where he claimed gonna takes months or even years to get new apartment cause it's so difficult). And he became super silent and seems to lay low. He hasn't brought up talk about divorce or what the next step is and has been hard to reach. Seems he is too busy with S he couldn't even care about divorce matter.

 S though, on the other hand has been full blown excited and started to show it in the open, in the last weeks she has been non stop posting, usually in the form of songs, about ""maybe it's a happy ending"" ""I'd be by your side now you're flying free"" or ""we met when we both have partners, we couldn't dance (my husband always using dance as secret word for sex) but now my love speeding up towards you, it's a long way to go but it's gonna lead me to you""
"" You are one in a million chances but I met you"" etc. 

I am beyond devastated. My leaving was super messy as well, cause I no longer have family or friends I was taken by socials to a shelter, before I blew all my savings and flew back to my previous country. I was homeless for the entire time, crashing at a friend's place and just found my own apartment days ago. I am broke, I have nothing, mentally and physically crushed. Have to start from 0. Don't even know how I am gonna survive all alone in this expensive city. I have no other choice. I have nowhere to go. I am in a therapy I couldn't even afford. 

More than heartbroken because of him I feel so much pain because how I was treated for 2.5 years because of S. 
S must be so high in the sky knowing there is a man who went as far as abusing his own wife emotionally and physically, just for her. To keep hiding her in every argument. To keep her safe, he beat me up emotionally and physically. I really don't know how to feel about that. I have been a punching bag for S for years.

And I know the most devastating thing is he will treat S nicely unlike me. He stayed with her for years even though he is married. She is his most ideal type, physically. She has the body type he worships. Can't deny they are really alike as well. Hobbies, passions, life views. They are like the same person in different gender. Maybe they are actually soulmate hence the universe kicked me out so badly cause I am the wrong person. They say if you are meant to be, the universe will unite you even though you already have married or be with another people. 

And I am just that wrong person who universe doesn't even give a shit about, to be put in this position as ""the wrong person"" where for 13 years all I prayed and beg universe for is for a person to spend life with, to be together facing life until we are grey and old, cause I no longer have family and he could be my only family. 

That is what hurt me the most. I am now in deep depression I couldn't get out of the bed.

1mj325h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mj325h/how_does_the_keurig_kexpress_compare_to_other/,How Does the Keurig K-Express Compare to Other Single-Serve Brewers?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Express has been an interesting journey for a coffee lover like me. As someone who leans on caffeine to power through busy mornings, this single-serve coffee maker had its work cut out for it. With its straightforward design and multiple brew options, it promised convenience, but I wanted to see if it could truly deliver that rich flavor and efficiency I look for in my daily coffee routine.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
One of the first things I noticed about this coffee maker was its size. It fits snugly on my counter without hogging precious real estate—a huge plus for anyone with limited kitchen space like me. The modern black finish gives it a polished look that blends nicely in a range of kitchen aesthetics, whether minimalistic or bold. It's lightweight at just 4.1 pounds, so moving it around when needed isn’t a hassle. While there's nothing overly fancy about the appearance, the simplicity makes it approachable for those who prefer things to be functional rather than flashy.  

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Functionality is where the Keurig K-Express shines. Brewing coffee couldn’t be easier. With simple button controls, I could choose between three cup sizes—8, 10, or 12 ounces—at the press of a button. The 42-ounce removable water reservoir is spacious enough to brew up to four cups before needing a refill, perfect for someone like me who typically drinks two cups before noon. An added treat was the Strong Brew function. Anytime I needed a bold, kick-in-the-pants kind of coffee (especially for post-lunch slumps), pressing that Strong button gave me noticeably richer coffee flavor. It's worth noting that the drip tray can be removed to fit taller travel mugs up to 7.4 inches, which is a game-changer for coffee on the go.  

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Express on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b09715g57m/)

**Versatility in Coffee Options**  
Despite its single-serve nature, this coffee maker supports a variety of tastes. It works seamlessly with K-Cup pods, which means you can choose from hundreds of brands and flavors—including tea and hot cocoa! I even tested it out with the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter (sold separately) to brew ground coffee. That flexibility made it easy to experiment with different flavors, though the reusable filter took a bit of maintenance compared to pods. If you enjoy customizing your coffee experience, this feature truly adds value.  

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
On a lazy weekend morning, I might take my time enjoying a pour-over or French press coffee, but weekdays are a different story. This Keurig does its job quickly, brewing a fresh, hot cup in under two minutes. That speed saved me multiple times when I was running late. Back-to-back brewing is another highlight. You can make another cup right away without waiting for the machine to reheat—a feature my partner appreciated during our “coffee rush hour.” Though it efficiently serves its purpose, I will point out that the brewing noise was slightly louder than expected, especially early in the morning when the house is quiet.  

**Energy-Saving Features**  
I have a bad habit of forgetting to turn devices off, which is why I appreciated the energy-efficient auto-off feature. After five minutes of inactivity, the coffee maker shuts off by itself. This might seem like a small feature, but when balancing work and life, little conveniences like this can go a long way. Plus, it feels good to know it’s helping save energy, reducing both your electricity use and guilt when you forget to power down.  

**Pluses**  
- Easy-to-use design with intuitive buttons.  
- Compact size fits smaller countertops.  
- Choice of strong brew for extra flavor intensity.  
- Quick brewing with back-to-back functionality.  

**Critiques**  
- Brewing noise is louder than expected, which can be an issue for light sleepers.  
- My K-Cup reusable filter isn’t included and requires proper cleaning after each use.  

**Product Competitors**  
In the world of single-serve coffee makers, the Keurig K-Express goes up against a few notable rivals. For instance, the Nespresso Essenza Mini offers a more specialized experience for espresso lovers, but its lack of brew size versatility can be limiting. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew expands coffee options by supporting both pods and ground coffee without needing a separate filter, but it's bulkier and takes up more counter space. Comparing functionality, the K-Express falls somewhere between the two. It offers the speed and convenience of a no-fuss coffee brewer while managing to be compact and versatile in its options.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
This coffee maker lands in a sweet spot for price-conscious shoppers seeking value without giving up essential features. It delivers quick, simple, and strong coffee, which, in my opinion, makes it worth the money for busy folks or anyone wanting to streamline their coffee routine. Keep in mind that while the initial cost is reasonable, using K-Cups daily can add up compared to grinding your own beans. Still, the convenience factor may outweigh that for many people.

Here's Why Stevia Might Be Your New Best Friend 💚,"Living with diabetes doesn’t mean you have to give up on sweetness. I found something that actually works — and it’s called **Stevia**. Here’s why it’s worth a try:

💚 **No blood sugar spikes** – Stevia has a **zero glycemic index**, so it doesn’t mess with your sugar levels.  
💚 **100% natural** – It’s made from a plant, not a lab. No chemicals, no weird aftertaste.  
💚 **Zero calories** – If you’re watching your weight or managing carbs, this is a game changer.  
💚 **Safe for daily use** – It’s been approved by **WHO**, **FDA**, and even **FSSAI** in India.  
💚 **Super sweet, but guilt-free** – Just a pinch is enough. It’s up to 300x sweeter than sugar!  
💚 **Bonus?** Some studies say it may even help with blood pressure.

Honestly, it’s the first sweetener that doesn’t make me feel like I’m compromising my health. I use it in tea, coffee, and even desserts now.",1,1754482510.0,u_Direct-Algae-2196,0,1.0,False

Close your eyes for a moment and think of a memory from childhood that fills you with a deep, almost magical sense of meaning. Perhaps it's your grandmother's kitchen on a Sunday morning, the sound of rain on your bedroom window, or the way afternoon light fell across your school playground. Notice how that memory isn’t just a recollection of the past—it carries something more profound, an almost mystical quality that feels both wonderful and somehow unreachable.

What you're experiencing isn't simply nostalgia. You're witnessing a fundamental force of human psychology in action—one that has been shaping your desires, emotions, and life choices since you were small, yet remains largely unrecognised.

# The Mystery Behind Your Most Meaningful Moments

That sense of inexplicable specialness you just felt? It has a name: [**hagioptasia**](https://hagioptasia.wordpress.com/)

 (pronounced ‘Hag-ee-op-TAY-see-uh’), meaning ‘holy vision’. It's your mind's tendency to perceive certain people, places, objects, or thoughts as possessing an otherworldly quality of significance—as if they're touched by something transcendent.

Here's what makes this discovery so remarkable: while many of your experiences of hagioptasia relate to your childhood, it isn't only about the past. It's a perceptual mechanism that's actively working right now, transforming ordinary experiences into sources of profound meaning. Your nostalgic memories are simply the easiest place to observe it in action.

# A Simple Test: Watching Your Mind Create Magic

Try this revealing exercise:

**Step 1:** Think of three specific childhood memories that feel especially meaningful or ""magical"" to you. Not just happy memories, but ones that seem to glow with significance.

**Step 2:** Now ask yourself honestly: Were these moments actually extraordinary when they happened? Or were they fairly ordinary experiences that have somehow acquired a deep sense of specialness over time?

**Step 3:** Notice the paradox: You can intellectually recognise that these were probably quite mundane moments (a typical Tuesday afternoon, an unremarkable conversation, playing in a garden), yet they continue to feel profoundly special despite this rational understanding.

This is hagioptasia at work. Your mind has taken ordinary experiences and imbued them with a quality of ""specialness"" that feels completely real and external—as if the magic exists in the actual place or event, rather than being created by your perception.

# Why This Matters More Than You Think

Once you learn to recognise hagioptasia in your nostalgic memories, you'll start seeing it everywhere:

* That inexplicable allure of celebrities and status symbols
* The way certain places (a favorite café, a scenic viewpoint) seem to possess an almost sacred atmosphere
* Your attraction to vintage items, heirloom objects, or things with ""history""
* The transcendent quality you perceive in music, art, or literature that moves you so deeply

This isn't mere sentimentality or cultural conditioning. Research involving nearly 3,000 people has shown that around 80% of us experience this perceptual tendency from early childhood. It's a fundamental feature of human psychology, rooted in our evolutionary heritage.

# The Evolutionary Story Hidden in Your Feelings

Why would our minds be wired this way? The answer lies deep in our evolutionary past. Hagioptasia likely evolved as a sophisticated guidance system—a way of marking certain experiences, places, and relationships as significant and worth returning to or seeking out.

Consider how your nostalgic feelings often center around:

* Your childhood home and family
* Seasonal celebrations and traditions
* Moments of safety, comfort, and belonging

But hagioptasia also extends to social dynamics in ways that mirror other species. Just as male deer are instinctively drawn to impressive antler displays, or peahens respond to elaborate tail feathers, humans automatically perceive “specialness” in high-status individuals—celebrities, leaders, successful peers. This same mechanism that makes childhood memories glow with meaning also drives hero worship, status anxiety, and competitive envy.

These patterns aren't random. They represent exactly the kinds of experiences and social perceptions that would have enhanced survival and wellbeing for our ancestors. The sense of ‘specialness’ was evolution's way of saying: “Pay attention to this. Value this. Seek more of this—whether it's a safe haven or a powerful ally.”

# The Double-Edged Gift

Understanding hagioptasia reveals both its benefits and its potential pitfalls:

**The Gift:** This mechanism allows us to find profound meaning and beauty in ordinary life. It's the source of our deepest aesthetic experiences, our capacity for awe, and our ability to form lasting emotional bonds with places and people.

**The Challenge:** Because hagioptasia operates automatically and feels completely real, we often mistake its effects for external truth. We chase after things—careers, possessions, relationships, experiences—believing they possess the specialness we perceive, only to find ourselves disappointed when reality doesn't match our hagioptasic expectations.

# A Path to Wiser Living

Here's the transformative insight: Recognising hagioptasia doesn't diminish the beauty of your experiences—it enhances your agency in creating them.

**Before awareness:** “I need to recapture that magical feeling from my past” or “If I could just achieve \[goal\], I'd have that sense of specialness in my life”.

**After awareness:** “I have a natural capacity to perceive specialness, and I can cultivate this in my present experience rather than chasing illusions”.

This shift is profound. Instead of viewing your current life as somehow lacking compared to an idealised past or future, you can recognise that the source of magic was always within your own perception. The song of a blackbird in your garden today is just as worthy of that sense of wonder as any blackbird from your childhood—if you allow yourself to see it.

# Practical Steps to Harness Your Hagioptasia

1. **Practice Present-Moment Awareness:** When you catch yourself feeling nostalgic, ask: “What would it be like to experience this same quality of specialness right now, in this moment?”
2. **Question Your Pursuits:** Before making life decisions motivated by a sense that something will bring you that elusive “special” feeling, pause and consider whether you're chasing a hagioptasic projection.
3. **Cultivate Gratitude for the Ordinary:** Deliberately practice seeing the ‘specialness’ in everyday experiences—your morning coffee, a conversation with a friend, the quality of light in your room.
4. **Recognise Cultural Manipulation:** Notice how advertising, social media, and status cultures exploit your hagioptasic tendencies by promising that their products or lifestyles will deliver that sense of specialness.

# The Deeper Invitation

Understanding hagioptasia isn't about becoming cynical or losing your sense of wonder. Quite the opposite. It's about reclaiming your power to experience meaning and beauty on your own terms, rather than being unconsciously driven by ancient psychological mechanisms or cultural forces seeking to exploit them.

Your nostalgic memories have been trying to teach you something important all along: You possess a remarkable capacity to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary. The question isn't whether this capacity is “real” or “illusory”—it's how you'll choose to use it.

Will you spend your life chasing after projections of specialness that exist mainly in your perception? Or will you learn to consciously cultivate that same sense of wonder and meaning in your actual, present-moment experience?

I’ll be honest, I have no idea whether I slept, because if I did at all, it was fragmented, traumatizing and difficult: I had some calm moments, and every time I felt like something might have happened, I would be wide awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering whether it happened.

To be honest, I feel tired. I am most worried about the idea of being awake for 24 hours, or forbid, even longer.

But, I think it’s possible I slept, I think. I feel, sad, tired, a little depressed, but not nearly as bad as I felt in the past over this type of thing.

But Grayson acted like he didn’t hear a word. He tapped the temperature control with his finger. “It’s just **a** steam session. You won’t die. Compared to how you bullied Maddie, this is nothing.”

“Still won’t talk?” The moment his finger pressed the button, Savannah felt her heartbeat go berserk. “Fine. **Let’s** crank it **up** some more.”

Her mind blurred, but suddenly she remembered something–two days ago**,** Madeline had posted a location on her story.

She summoned her **last** ounce of strength. “I’ll talk! Northcrest Amusement Park… the utility room!”

Grayson turned on his heel and rushed out the door. But not before tossing an order to his men**, “**Don’t **let** her out until I say **so.”** 

**Half** an hour later**,** the **call** finally came.

**He’d** found Madeline. Only then did they let Savannah out.

She was drenched in **sweat,** burning up with **fever,** and collapsed into unconsciousness for the rest of the night.

**All** through that feverish haze, memories of Grayson flickered through her mind like a reel on fast–forward.

He’d been her father’s old friend, always hanging around when she was just **a** timid little girl.

She’d always been frail**,** barely able to **eat. Grayson** would show up like some **magician,** bringing **fresh** fruit and **vegetables from all** over the world**.** 

Pineberries from South America**.** Horned melons from Africa. Picked **at** dawn and served at noon**,** straight **to her** plate,

Those high–fashion couture gowns celebrities fought tooth and **nail** over–easily worth hundreds **of** thousands**–he’d** send them over like **casual** gifts**, all** because she once said, **“That’s** pretty.”

She’d **always** protest, “No way,” but her face would flush as red as a tomato.

On her eighteenth birthday**,** Grayson made a scene the entire city would never forget.

**He** covered the streets in her favorite white roses. Drones spelled out “Savannah, marry me” across the skies of Crestmoor Heights. The message stayed up there for three whole days and nights.

On a luxurious yacht, he wrapped her in his arms from behind, burying his chin in her shoulder.

“Baby, say yes. This life**,** the next, and the one after that–I’ll love you forever.**”** 

Under a sky exploding with fireworks, Savannah said yes through her tears.

But less than six months later, everything fell apart. The Langley family went bankrupt. Her father died from the strain. On his deathbed, he grabbed Grayson’s hand, barely breathing.

“Take care of Savannah… don’t ever hurt her**…**”

Grayson gave him a solemn nod. “**I** promise.**”** 

After that, Savannah moved into the Whitaker estate.

Everyone in Crestmoor Heights knew–Grayson gave Savannah everything.

Until Madeline Rhodes came along.

The new assistant–clumsy as hell**,** couldn’t even peel shrimp without help.

“She’s just a little dumb. Can’t even peel shrimp,” Grayson chuckled.

“She always **forgets** her paperwork too.”

That was the first time he mentioned Madeline in front of her. His tone was gentle, indulgent. It burned. Right through her chest.

Madeline swapped out his imported oolong for instant coffee, tanked a billion–dollar deal, and Grayson just ruffled her hair and laughed, “She’s just naive. Innocent and a little headstrong that’s all.”

She ruined **a** limited–edition dress from Savannah’s closet by spilling ink on it. Grayson didn’t even blink–he had a new one delivered

to Madeline the same day**.** 

1

Even on Savannah’s twenty–first birthday, while cutting her cake**,** Grayson suddenly paused mid–slice.

“Maddie loves blueberry cake…**”** 

**“If** she were here, she’d throw a **fit** just to eat the whole thing.”

**In** that moment, something inside Savannah shattered completely.

That woman—Madeline Rhodes–had already taken up permanent residence in Grayson’s heart. There **was** no room left for her.

Madeline moved in**,** playing every **petty** game she could think of. Savannah swallowed her pride and pretended not **to** care.

Then Madeline started her deliberate **little** vanishing **acts**. Each time**, she’d** drop a clue just for Savannah, tilt her head, and smile.

**“**Wanna guess? **Will** Grayson tear **you apart** just to get me back?**”** 

She played this game eight times. Savannah lost all eight.

In her dreams, Grayson’s cold, accusing face **got** closer and closer until she **jolted** awake, **drenched in** sweat.

Staring out the window, Savannah suddenly felt so, so tired.

The man she once clung to like salvation–he was long gone.

She pulled out the acceptance letter buried at the bottom **of** her trunk **and** dialed a number.

Can anyone give me an idea of where to start looking?

I assume something is wrong with the brakes but I’m not sure.
It stops no problem and doesn’t make any noise but there has gotta be something wrong.
Maybe a wheel bearing?

A gentler option some people try is green tea, thanks to L-theanine paired with a little caffeine. But does that actually help with control?

**How L-Theanine Works**  
L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea. It’s known for creating a state of calm alertness — relaxed but not sleepy. Combined with the light caffeine in green tea, it may keep your mind focused without the jittery edge of coffee or the dulling effect of alcohol.

**Why It Could Help**

* Reduces anxiety and racing thoughts that trigger quick finishes.
* Supports steady focus, making it easier to pace yourself.
* Mild caffeine can help with energy and erection quality without over-stimulating.

**Potential Drawbacks**

* It’s subtle — don’t expect instant or dramatic results.
* Sensitive guys may still feel jittery from the caffeine.
* Drinking too much tea before sex might just leave you needing the bathroom.

**A User’s Experience**  
One guy mentioned switching from pre-date drinks to a cup of green tea. He said he felt calmer, more in control, and less worried about losing his erection compared to when he drank alcohol. The difference wasn’t night and day, but enough to help him last longer.

**Tips If You Want to Try**

* Go with one or two cups of quality green tea about 30–60 minutes before sex.
* If caffeine bothers you, L-theanine supplements without tea are an option.
* Combine with steady breathing or reverse kegels to maximize calm control.

**Key Takeaway**  
Green tea and L-theanine may not be a magic bullet, but they offer a balanced way to stay calm and focused — without the downsides of alcohol or heavy stimulants.

Everyone knows each other’s names, waves when they pass by, and keeps to themselves. That’s why it was strange when a new guy moved into the house at the very end.

He introduced himself as “Matt.” Mid-30s, wiry, shaved head, wore the same gray hoodie almost every day. Friendly enough, but he had this thing where he’d just… walk into your yard without asking. First time, he said he was “just checking out the view.” Second time, he claimed he was “looking for his cat.”

It got to the point where I kept my blinds down, but I’d still catch him in my peripheral vision — standing on the edge of my lawn, just looking. No phone in his hand, no dog, nothing.

Last Friday, I came home from work and saw my front door slightly open. My heart dropped. I keep it locked religiously. I stepped inside, holding my breath. Everything looked normal, until I walked into my kitchen.

On the counter was a mug of coffee. Not mine. Black, steaming hot. Like someone had just poured it.

I backed out and called the police. They came, searched, found nothing. No signs of forced entry. No prints on the mug. The officer just shrugged and told me to “double-check my locks.”

That night around 2 A.m.I woke up to the faint sound of my fridge door opening. I froze. The kitchen light clicked on it was like Footsteps.

I didn’t move, didn’t breathe. Then I heard his voice,low...casual “Don’t worry. I’m just grabbing something.”

By the time I had the courage to get up, the kitchen was empty. The back door was unlocked. And sitting on the counter was the same mug.....Still warm.

1mj2q1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1mj2q1a/help_needed_getting_compensation_from_etihad/,Help needed getting compensation from etihad!,"Hi all,

Just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has dealt with something similar — or has advice.

I was scheduled to fly with Etihad (EY144) from Zurich to Abu Dhabi on July 17, 2025, to connect onward to Beijing for an international competition.

Here’s what happened:
	•	The flight kept being delayed at Zurich Airport throughout the day.
	•	Eventually, it was cancelled altogether, and we were told it was due to a technical defect (later confirmed in writing by Etihad).
	•	The email they sent at the time stated: “due to additional maintenance checks required on the planned aircraft.”
	•	I ended up arriving in Beijing 24 hours later than planned, which was incredibly disruptive professionally.

As a result:
	•	I missed my high-speed train in China the next day (595.5 CNY / ~66.65 CHF) — non-refundable.
	•	I had to share a hotel room with a colleague (also traveling for the same event), despite us being unrelated adult coworkers. It was a double bed, which I found totally inappropriate.
	•	We were sent to the wrong hotel initially (the voucher said IBIS Messe Zurich, but they bused us elsewhere).
	•	I also incurred small out-of-pocket costs (coffee etc. while stuck at the airport the next morning).

Etihad’s Response:
	•	They refused compensation under EU261/FOCA, claiming the technical defect was an “extraordinary circumstance.”
	•	However, from what I understand (and based on case law), routine maintenance issues don’t qualify as extraordinary unless it’s sabotage, a manufacturing defect, etc.
	•	They also said that FOCA (Swiss regulation) applied, not EU261 — even though FOCA enforces the exact same principles.

What I’ve Done:
	•	Filed a compensation request myself — rejected.
	•	Provided evidence of their own emails showing it was a maintenance-related issue.
	•	Now I’m handing it over to a claim assistance company (like AirHelp) to escalate further.
	•	Considering going through FOCA directly if needed.

⸻

TL;DR:
Etihad cancelled my flight after several delays due to a technical issue, made me share a hotel room with a colleague, I missed a train, and incurred costs. Now they refuse compensation under EU/Swiss law even though their emails admit it was for “maintenance checks.”

Would love to hear if anyone has had success claiming in similar situations — or tips on how to escalate this with Swiss or EU regulators.

For context she left at the end of December after being together for 8+ years, and we’ve been absolutely no contact since. Yesterday was my birthday and was trying to make it a good day, regardless of having to work and first one in years not spending it with her. 

I got up early, went to the gym, got dressed nicely and then wanted to treat myself to a matcha latte before work. I was planning on walking in the coffee shop because there’s a barista there that’s cute and would’ve liked to see her. When I got to a red light to turn right, I saw her car stopped few cars back at that intersection on the road where I was turning towards. Time felt like it froze, but I didn’t make it obvious that I saw her since I was wearing sunglasses and I wasn’t looking directly at her. I turned and I had to pass her. My windows were down but I kept looking straight to avoid catching eye contact and made it seem like I never saw her. Even though it was for a second or two passing her, it felt like eternity and had very high tension on my end. I’m almost certain she saw me; she’s a very observant and cautious driver and is always looking around. That stunned me to the point where when I got to the coffee shop, I accidentally went to the drive thru

Knowing that I was <10 feet away from her and 99.9% sure she saw me has me emotional. I’m not over her or how messy our breakup was, and though I’ve been lost without her, the change and growth I’ve experienced has been a big positive. She didn’t say happy birthday but I was preparing for that as I didn’t for her back in February, but it still hurts. I’m not sure how I feel about this, but I had to vent and would love to hear other people’s encounters. ",0,1754481460.0,BreakUps,1,0.5,False

You’re surrounded by people all the time in classes, hostels, canteens, group projects, random midnight ramen runs. You didn’t have to think about socialising because it just… happened. You sat next to someone in a lecture, cracked a joke, and suddenly you’re in a WhatsApp group planning weekend trips.

Then you graduate, and life flips the script. Everyone moves to different cities, gets busy with jobs, relationships, family. The spontaneous hangouts disappear. Even the people you used to see every day now need a two-week notice to meet up. If you’re not intentional about it, months pass before you realise you haven’t actually made a new friend in ages.

And here’s the part no one tells you after college, making friends isn’t about waiting for it to just happen. You have to *create* those chances. Go to the hobby class you’ve been thinking about. Show up to local meetups or community events. Say yes to that “friend of a friend” birthday invite even if you’re nervous. Strike up a small conversation with the person you always see at your gym or coffee shop. And if nothing’s happening around you? Start something yourself a weekend walk, a book club, a game night.

It feels awkward at first, and honestly, the pace is slower than what you’re used to. You might meet ten people before you click with one. But that one is worth it. Over time, those small efforts turn into actual connections the kind where you text each other for no reason, where someone shows up when you need them, where life feels a little less lonely.

## Key Features Analysis

The Lululemon Perfectly Oversized Crop Crew boasts several features that contribute to its popularity and functionality.

**Material Composition:** The crop crew is primarily made from Lululemon's signature Softstreme™ fabric. This blend typically consists of a combination of modal, polyester, and elastane. The exact percentage breakdown may vary slightly between colors and production runs, but the focus remains on creating a soft, smooth, and lightweight feel against the skin.

The Softstreme™ fabric is known for its exceptional softness and drape. It's designed to be breathable and moisture-wicking, helping to keep you comfortable during light activity or while lounging. The addition of elastane provides a slight stretch, allowing for freedom of movement and a comfortable fit.

**Oversized Fit:** True to its name, the crop crew features an intentionally oversized fit. This means it's designed to be loose and relaxed, providing a comfortable and unrestricted feel. The oversized silhouette adds to its casual and stylish aesthetic.

The design allows for easy layering over other tops or sports bras, making it a versatile piece for various weather conditions and activities. The relaxed fit also contributes to its comfort factor, making it ideal for lounging or running errands.

**Cropped Length:** The cropped length of the crew is a key design element that contributes to its flattering silhouette. It typically falls at or slightly above the natural waistline, depending on torso length.

The cropped length pairs well with high-waisted leggings or pants, creating a balanced and proportional look. It also allows for greater freedom of movement and breathability, especially during warmer weather or light workouts.

**Ribbed Cuffs and Hem:** The crop crew features ribbed cuffs and hem, which add structure and durability to the garment.

The ribbed detailing helps to keep the sleeves and hem in place, preventing them from riding up or feeling too loose. The ribbed texture also adds a subtle visual detail to the overall design.

**Minimalist Design:** The Lululemon Perfectly Oversized Crop Crew is characterized by its minimalist design. It typically features a simple crew neckline, long sleeves, and a subtle Lululemon logo.

The lack of excessive embellishments or branding contributes to its versatility, allowing it to be easily styled for various occasions. The minimalist design also aligns with Lululemon's overall aesthetic, which emphasizes simplicity and functionality.

1mj2hb7,https://i.redd.it/t14zukva0ehf1.jpeg,How to Automate Your Social Media as a Busy Realtor (The Definitive Guide),"You’re a successful real estate agent in a competitive US market. You’re juggling client appointments, property showings, contract negotiations, and the endless paperwork that comes with the job. 

You know, with absolute certainty, that you need a strong social media presence to generate leads and build your brand. Every guru and coach tells you to ""post consistently."" But they never tell you where to find the 8-10 extra hours a week it takes to actually do it.

Let’s be direct: This isn't another article about *why* you need social media. You already know why. This is a practical, step-by-step guide on *how* to automate your content creation and posting, so you can build a lead-generating social media presence while you sleep.

This is your playbook for getting off the content treadmill and back to what you do best: selling real estate. And the engine that powers this entire system is [**Trof.ai**.](https://trof.ai)

# The Myth of ""Finding Time"" for Social Media

Every busy agent has said it: ""I just need to find more time for marketing."" This is the biggest myth in the industry. You will never ""find"" time. The most successful agents don't find time; they create systems. Relying on sheer willpower to manually create and post social media content is a losing battle, and it's costing you more than you think.

**Here's why the manual approach is unsustainable:**

* **The Content Treadmill is Relentless:** To stay relevant, you need a constant stream of diverse content. ""Just Listed"" announcements for your new property on Elm Street. ""Open House"" reminders for this weekend. ""Under Contract"" updates to show momentum. ""Just Sold"" posts to build social proof. Add in client testimonials, market updates, and local tips, and you’re looking at a full-time content creator's job description.
* **The High Cost of Manual Creation:** Let's do some simple math. If you spend just 8 hours a month creating and posting on social media, that’s an entire workday lost. What is your average gross commission income (GCI) per hour? If an hour of your time is worth $100, $200, or more, you're spending thousands of dollars in opportunity cost every month on tasks that can and should be automated. That's time you could have spent showing one more property or nurturing a high-value lead.
* **Inconsistency Kills Growth:** When you get busy with a big closing, what’s the first thing to get dropped? Your social media. A week of silence turns into two, and suddenly your feed is a ghost town. This inconsistency signals to social media algorithms that your content isn't reliable, tanking your reach. More importantly, it tells your audience that you’re not an active, engaged expert.

The solution isn't working harder. It’s automating the work.

# The 3 Pillars of Real Estate Content Automation

To effectively automate your marketing, you need to understand what can be systematized. A powerful social media presence for a realtor rests on three distinct content pillars. Manually supporting all three is nearly impossible, but with the right tool, you can automate the creation of each one.

**Here are the three pillars:**

1. **Listing-Based Content:** This is the foundation of your business. It’s the content that directly generates buyer inquiries and attracts seller leads. This pillar includes every milestone in a property's lifecycle: Just Listed, Open House, Price Reduction, Under Contract, and Just Sold announcements. This is your most time-sensitive and crucial content.
2. **Reputation-Based Content:** This is your social proof. It's what builds trust with potential clients before you ever meet them. This pillar is built from client testimonials, 5-star reviews from Zillow or [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com), and success stories. This content answers the silent question every prospect has: ""Are you good at what you do?""
3. **Expertise-Based Content:** This is your brand builder. It’s what positions you as the go-to local authority, not just another agent. This pillar includes local market updates (""What's the average sale price in Austin right now?""), helpful tips for buyers and sellers, and guides to the neighbourhoods you serve.

The reason 99% of agents struggle with social media is that they try to be a content creator, graphic designer, and videographer for all three pillars. The secret of the top 1% is leveraging a system that does the heavy lifting for them.

# Your Step-by-Step Automation Playbook with [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai)

This is where theory ends and action begins. This isn't a ""nice idea""—this is a tangible, step-by-step workflow you can implement today to automate over 80% of your social media marketing.

# Step 1: Automate Your Listing Content (Pillar 1)

This is your most frequent and time-consuming task. With automation, it becomes your easiest.

* **The Action:** Your new listing at **123 Elm Street, Anytown, USA**, just went live on the MLS and is now on Zillow. Instead of downloading photos and opening Canva, you simply copy the Zillow (or [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com)) link.
* **The Automation:** Paste that single link into **Trof.ai**. In under 30 seconds, our AI gets to work. It pulls all the professional photos, the price, bed/bath count, location, and property description. It then instantly generates a complete campaign of branded content:
   * A stunning, multi-slide **""Just Listed"" Instagram carousel**.
   * A dynamic, scroll-stopping **video tour** for Instagram Reels and TikTok.
   * An **""Open House"" announcement graphic** with the date and time.
   * Professionally written **captions and hashtags** for every post. You just did what would have taken a marketing assistant an hour in less time than it takes to make a coffee.

# Step 2: Automate Your Social Proof (Pillar 2)

A glowing review is your most powerful marketing weapon. Don't let it die in your text messages.

* **The Action:** A happy client sends you a text: ""OMG, thank you! We couldn't have done this without you!""
* **The Automation:** Screenshot that text message or Zillow review. Upload the image to [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai). Our AI reads the text from the image, extracts it, and instantly places it on a beautiful, branded testimonial graphic—complete with your headshot, logo, and contact info. It’s ready to post in seconds.

# Step 3: Automate Your Local Expertise (Pillar 3)

What do you post when you don't have a new listing? This is where most agents go silent. With automation, this is where you build your brand.

* **The Action:** It's a slow week, and you need fresh content to stay top-of-mind.
* **The Automation:** Go to the ""Local Expert"" feature in [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai). Enter a neighbourhood name, like ""River Oaks"" or ""Beverly Hills."" Our AI generates valuable, branded content for you, such as:
   * A ""3 Tips for First-Time Buyers in This Market"" graphic.
   * A short video on ""Why Everyone is Moving to \[Your City\].""
   * A ""Local Market Update"" template ready for you to plug in the latest stats.

# Step 4: Automate Your Posting

Creating the content is only half the battle.

* **The Action:** You now have a folder full of professionally created content.
* **The Automation:** Connect your Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts directly to [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai). Use the simple, one-click scheduler to plan out your content for the week. Post your ""Just Listed"" video now, schedule the testimonial for Wednesday, and the market update for Friday.

You have just designed, created, written captions for, and scheduled an entire week of high-performing social media content in under 15 minutes. This is the power of a true automation system.

# Real-World Example: A Week in the Life of an Automated Realtor

Stop imagining it and see what it looks like. Here’s a typical week for a busy agent using the [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) automation playbook.

* **Monday (9:00 AM):** Your new listing at 456 Maple Drive, Dallas, TX, goes live on Zillow. You copy the link, paste it into [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai), and generate a video tour and a carousel. You post the video to Reels immediately. **Total Time: 5 minutes.**
* **Wednesday (12:30 PM):** While eating lunch, you see a 5-star review a past client left on [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com). You screenshot it, upload it to [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai), and post the generated testimonial graphic to your Instagram and Facebook pages. **Total Time: 2 minutes.**
* **Friday (4:00 PM):** Great news! 456 Maple Drive is now under contract after a bidding war. You use the same project link in [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) to instantly create a branded ""Under Contract"" graphic. You post it to build urgency and showcase your effectiveness. **Total Time: 1 minute.**
* **Sunday (7:00 PM):** While relaxing, you plan for the week ahead. You schedule an Open House for another property. You also use the Local Expert feature to schedule a ""3 Reasons to Sell This Fall"" post for Tuesday to fill the gap in your content calendar. **Total Time: 5 minutes.**

**Your weekly investment: Less than 15 minutes.** **Your result:** A perfectly branded, highly active, and professional social media feed that consistently engages your audience and generates inbound inquiries—all while you were out doing what you do best.

# Why [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) is the Smart Choice for US Agents

In a market full of tools, choosing the right one is critical. A BOFU decision comes down to results, efficiency, and ROI. Here’s how [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) stacks up against the alternatives.

* [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai) **vs. Manual Creation (e.g., Canva):** Canva is an excellent design tool, but it’s a blank canvas. It doesn't give you the strategy, the content ideas, the listing data, the AI-written copy, or the automation. You are still the one doing all the work. [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) is an end-to-end *engine*. It's the strategist, designer, copywriter, and videographer in one, executing a proven real estate marketing plan for you.
* [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai) **vs. Hiring a Social Media Manager:** A good social media manager in the US costs anywhere from $500 to over $2,000 per month. They can be effective, but they add significant overhead, communication delays, and you lose direct control. [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) provides the same (or better) quality of branded content for a fraction of the cost, giving you instant results on your schedule.
* [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai) **vs. General Schedulers (e.g., Buffer, Hootsuite):** Tools like Buffer and Hootsuite are empty buckets. They are built for *posting*, not *creating*. You still have the full-time job of feeding them content. [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) is a complete, end-to-end solution designed specifically for real estate. It handles the entire workflow: Ideation > Creation > Branding > Captioning > Scheduling > Posting.
* **Built for the US Market:** [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) is engineered to work seamlessly with the platforms you use every day, including Zillow, [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com), and thousands of other brokerage and MLS public-facing sites across the United States.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **How much technical skill do I need to automate my social media?** Almost none. The goal of automation is to *remove* technical work, not add to it. If you know how to copy and paste a website link, you have all the technical skill required to use a platform like [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai). It's designed for busy agents, not tech wizards.
* **Will automated content feel generic or robotic?** It’s a valid concern, but the answer is no—if you use the right tool. Sophisticated automation doesn’t mean generic. [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) pulls the unique photos and specific details (like ""newly renovated kitchen"" or ""stunning city views"") directly from *your* listings. Combined with your personal branding—your headshot, logo, and colours—the content feels authentic and custom-made every time.
* **What if I don't have any active listings? How can I automate content?** This is a critical scenario where automation shines. A robust content strategy goes beyond listings. Use automation tools to repurpose your past sales into ""Just Sold"" or ""Neighborhood Expert"" posts. Turn your library of client reviews into a steady stream of testimonials. Generate evergreen content like local market guides or buyer/seller tips to ensure your feed stays active and valuable, even between deals.
* **How quickly can I expect to see results from automating my content?** The time-saving results are immediate—you get hours back in your first week. In terms of lead generation, the key benefit of automation is consistency. By showing up every day with professional content, you build trust and stay top-of-mind. Agents using this system typically see a marked increase in profile views, engagement, and inbound DMs within the first few weeks.
* **Is it better to automate everything or still post some things manually?** A hybrid approach is often the most powerful. Use automation for the 80% of content that is necessary but time-consuming (your listing milestones, testimonials, market data). This creates a rock-solid foundation and frees up your time and creative energy to manually post the high-touch 20%—a behind-the-scenes video at an open house, a selfie with your clients at the closing table, or a personal story about your journey in real estate.

# Your Final Step: From Overwhelmed to Automated

Stop trading your valuable time for social media likes. The manual way of marketing is broken. It’s time to implement a system that works for you, not the other way around. Start automating your content, generating leads on autopilot, and reinvesting your time where it matters most.

1. **Acknowledge the Grind is Over:** Make the decision to stop being a part-time, unpaid social media manager.
2. **Create an account on Trof AI Now:** This is the system designed for you. [**Click here**](https://trof.ai) to begin.
3. **Automate Your First Listing in 60 Seconds:** Grab any of your active listing links from Zillow or [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com) and prove the concept to yourself right now.
4. **Reclaim Your Time:** Take the 8-10 hours you just saved this month and dedicate them to negotiating deals, prospecting high-value clients, and growing your business.",1,1754480953.0,trofai,0,1.0,False
1mj2gi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1mj2gi7/the_halfdrawer_heart/,The Half-Drawer Heart,"This isn’t our story… not yet. But God, I want it to be. I can see it feel it in every corner of my heart. The slow way we’d fall into each other’s lives, the toothbrush left behind, the drawer half-full, the boxes unpacked in silence. I don’t have this. But I ache for it. I dream of it. And if I could write it into existence, this is how it would go.



**The Half-Drawer Heart**

It started quietly.

One night, she called him at 11:48 PM. *“I can’t sleep,”* she whispered. *“Come over,”* he said, already pulling back the covers on his side of the bed.

She showed up twenty minutes later, hoodie half-zipped, eyes tired but soft. She crawled into bed and curled up against his chest like she’d been there a thousand nights before.

It happened again the next night. And the one after that. Two weeks passed.

By then, her toothbrush was nestled beside his. Her moisturizer sat where his aftershave used to be. She had a drawer half claimed with her t-shirts and socks, though some clothes had found homes on the back of his desk chair, the edge of his dresser, or tucked into the side of the laundry basket. Her coffee order was saved in his phone. His sleep schedule now followed hers.

She wasn’t just visiting anymore. She was *here*. He stood in the doorway of the bedroom one morning, watching her hum softly while brushing her hair, wearing his shirt that fit her too perfectly.

His heart swelled. Not with nerves. Not with hesitation. But with the quiet kind of clarity that only comes when everything finally feels right.

That night, after they’d curled into their familiar place her head on his chest, his arm wrapped around her waist he kissed the top of her head and said, “Jenny?”

“Mmhmm?”

“This… us… it already feels like home. You’re here most nights, your stuff’s already taken over half the bedroom,” he teased gently. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”

She lifted her head slightly to look at him, brows raised.

“I want to wake up with you every morning,” he said. “I want you here *really* here. Not just your stuff. You. I want to share this space with you. For real.”

She was quiet for a moment, her eyes scanning his, like she was committing the way he looked to memory.

Then she smiled. That smile the one that had wrecked him the first time he saw it. The one that always made everything else fade.

“You’re just asking me now?” she whispered, voice laced with laughter and awe. “I thought I’d already moved in.”

He laughed, then pulled her close, arms tight around her.

“I just wanted to make it official,” he murmured.

She kissed him softly and settled back onto his chest.

“You’re stuck with me now,” she whispered.

His voice was full of warmth, steady and sure.

“Good. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”



**The First Day of Forever**

Morning sunlight spilled through the blinds, warm and golden, casting soft shadows across the bed. The house was quiet, except for the faint hum of the ceiling fan and the slow, sleepy breaths of two people who had finally found their place.

Jenny stirred first.

She opened her eyes and blinked against the morning light, her gaze falling on him still asleep, one arm flung across her, his hair a little messy, his mouth parted just enough to make her smile.

He looked peaceful. Like he belonged in this moment. Like they both did. She didn’t move right away. She just laid there, taking it in. Her hand rested on his chest, feeling the steady rise and fall, grounding herself in the rhythm of it.

*This is real.*

He woke up slowly, eyes fluttering open, his lips curving into a lazy smile the second he saw her.

“Morning,” he whispered, voice still heavy with sleep.

“Morning,” she whispered back.

He pulled her closer without another word, burying his face in her hair. They stayed there for a long while wrapped up in quiet, in warmth, in the soft certainty that this was it. This was *home.*

Eventually, hunger won out.

They shuffled into the kitchen, her wearing one of his oversized sweatshirts and him in pajama pants and a sleep-tousled grin. She sat on the counter while he fumbled with the coffee maker, pretending he remembered how she liked it.

“You’re forgetting the cinnamon,” she teased, watching him with that spark in her eyes.

“Cinnamon?” he said, feigning shock. “How could I forget the most important part?”

He turned around dramatically, opened the spice cabinet, and held the little jar like it was gold. She laughed really laughed and he turned back around just to catch it. He made eggs while she buttered toast. She stole bites off his plate. He didn’t mind.

They ate on the couch, legs tangled, plates balanced precariously between them, the TV playing something neither of them were really watching. Every now and then, he’d look over and smile. Like he still couldn’t believe she was really here.

Later, they unpacked a box of her things together. It wasn’t even that much some books, a candle, a worn hoodie that smelled like her, a framed photo of her and her mom. But each item found a place. A *shared* place.

Her slippers by the door. Her journal on the nightstand. Her laughter in the hallway. By afternoon, she had claimed the left side of the closet and the right side of the bed. He gave both up willingly.

At one point, she found him standing in the doorway of the bedroom again, just watching her hang up a dress.

“What?” she asked, looking over her shoulder.

He shook his head, smile quiet and full.

“I’ve imagined this for so long,” he said. “And now it’s real. You’re really here.”

She crossed the room and stood in front of him. “I’m not going anywhere.”

“I know,” he said, and kissed her gently. “But I’ll probably keep needing to hear it.”

“You will,” she whispered. “And I’ll keep saying it.”

That night, when they crawled back into bed, everything was the same but also completely different. Her pillow was already indented. Her phone charger was on his side. Her slippers sat neatly at the foot of the bed.

She fit perfectly into his arms, like they were made for this, this rhythm, this quiet, this forever. And as they drifted off to sleep, he whispered one more thing into her hair:

“First day of forever.”

She smiled in the dark.

“Best day of my life.”



**The Last Box**

The room looked smaller now.

Maybe it was because of all the boxes stacked near the door, or maybe it was because it had always seemed larger when it held the echoes of her childhood. Now it felt like a place in transition caught between the past and the future.

She was kneeling by the closet, sorting through a box of old yearbooks and journals, her brow furrowed as she flipped through the pages. Occasionally, she’d laugh at something, holding it up for him to see a note from middle school, a ridiculous photo, a mix CD someone made her years ago.

He sat on the edge of the bed her bed, the one with the faded quilt and the dent in the mattress where she always curled up. It was strange, being in this room. This space that raised her. The posters on the wall, the soft twinkle lights still wrapped around the mirror, the stuffed animals sitting in quiet little clusters on the shelf.

Everything here whispered *Jenny,* just younger. He picked up a frame from her nightstand a picture of her at graduation, arms around her parents, that beaming smile on her face.

“You sure you want to take all this?” he asked gently, as she stood and looked around the room again.

She smiled faintly. “Not all of it. Just enough.”

Her mom peeked in to check on them. “Want lemonade?”

“In a bit, Mom,” Jenny said, and the door closed again with a soft *click.*

And then came the footsteps.

Her dad.

He paused at the door before stepping in, hands tucked into his back pockets. He looked around the room the same way Jenny had, like he was cataloging every memory.

“This room’s been hers since she was five,” he said, not to anyone in particular. “Feels like I just finished painting the walls pink.”

Jenny chuckled softly. “They haven’t been pink in years, Dad.”

“I know.” He looked at her for a long moment, then shifted his gaze to him.

He stood up, instinctively straightening, meeting her father’s eyes. There was a silence, comfortable but weighty. Her dad finally spoke.

“You’re really doing this,” he said quietly.

He nodded. “Yeah. I am. If she wants to, then I’m all in.”

Her father looked down at the floor for a second. “She’s always been everything to us. Our light. Her mom and I… we’ve only ever wanted someone who saw her the same way.”

“I do,” he said without hesitation. “She’s everything to me too. And I know what that means. I don’t take it lightly.”

Her dad studied him again like he was still deciding if this man could hold the weight of everything his daughter was. Then, with a slow nod, he spoke.

“I believe you.”

A pause. Then:

“You know, Jenny used to sit on this bed and talk about this guy she hoped existed. Not out loud, not in so many words. But we could tell. The way she looked at love in movies, or the way she’d sigh after a really good book… she believed in *something*. Someone who’d make her feel safe enough to be herself. Someone who’d *see* her.”

He blinked, feeling his chest rise and fall a little harder.

“That guy,” her dad said, stepping closer, “better be you.”

“She’s my everything,” he said softly. “She’ll always be.”

Her dad extended a hand. This time, it wasn’t formal. It wasn’t polite. It was *real.* He took it. They shook once. And then her dad pulled him in for a brief, firm hug.

“Take care of my girl.”

“I will,” he promised. “With everything I have.”

Jenny turned just in time to see them separate. “What’d I miss?”

Her dad cleared his throat. “Nothing. Just making sure he’s worthy.”

She raised an eyebrow. “And?”

“He’ll do.”

She beamed. And just like that, the last box was packed.

She looked around her room one final time, then turned and walked out the door her hand in his, her past behind her, and her future waiting at home.",2,1754480883.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

Hopefully this'll attract some of you!

I'm Nick, I live in the East of England and am originally from Nottingham. I left home at 18 for uni and just never went back (except to visit), and that means I've lived in a few different places over the years. Holding down friends is tough as an adult, I find. What about those I met at school? I left them all behind as they got into drugs and they seemed to care more about them than me. I was always the odd one out who drank but never did anything else. I still wanted to play football everyday while they passed a joint around (or often worse).

I love coffee, rum, lager, good food, daydreaming, deep conversations, British bands and underground music. My interests include football, cricket, reading, writing (plus the stationery that goes along with it), journalling, mental health and psychology.

I originally thought my triggers were alcohol and caffeine related as my first few episodes were after days I drank. So I fully cut both out for a while (caffeine I have allowed back in moderation not alcohol though). However the episodes still kept happening.

Then I thought ok maybe it’s dehydration, as they episodes happened when I would workout (or after a long day of working outside, one time even due to a long car ride I didn’t drink water very much on, or sitting on the couch eating a salty snack) so I started being very aware of my hydration and drinking much more water. However like almost clock work I was getting them once a month after my first ablation (like litterally almost exactly 4 weeks apart they would trigger I even asked my cardiologist and they told me it was a coincidence)


So I got a second ablation a little over a year after the first. The surgeon told me the first ablation hadn’t reconnected and the second he thought should take care of it. Well just out of the blanking I had another episode while just walking on a treadmill. I was hydrated but this is when I thought maybe it’s electrolyte imbalance, since I work outside as well and as a result drink alot of water. So I started monitoring my potassium intake as well as my sodium and trying to make sure I have an electrolyte supplements as I work through out the day and workout. So after that episode I had another the other day and I’m exhausted with trying to figure out my trigger at this point. It happened during a workout, when I was fully hydrated had taken electrolytes so I don’t believe I was imbalanced, it was a more intense workout, but I’ve definitely pushed harder and not had episodes in the past. 

So at this point idk what to do any more. I wish I could narrow it down more, how do you guys narrow it down better?

For the record I have fully overhauled my lifestyle that triggered my intial on set. I have low caffiene intake (1 cup of coffee, and 1 caffeinated soda), sleep apnea free, lost over 50lbs to get below 20% body fat, try to get atleast 7 hours of sleep, have zero alcohol,and got my blood pressure to normal.

By using a platform like Aryeo, you’ve secured stunning, high-quality media for your listings. Your photos are sharp, your virtual tours are immersive, and your properties look their absolute best.

This puts you leagues ahead of the competition relying on smartphone snapshots. But here's the critical question: what happens *after* you get those beautiful photos?

For most agents, the journey ends after uploading them to the MLS and the property portals. Those valuable, expensive assets sit there, their potential only partially realized.

The real, game-changing value lies not just in having great media, but in *repurposing* it. This guide will show you exactly how to transform your existing library of Aryeo content from a simple listing tool into a powerful, automated marketing engine that generates leads, builds your brand, and helps you dominate your local market.

# The Aryeo Advantage: Why Your Investment in Quality Media Matters

Your decision to use a service like Aryeo for professional real estate photography is the bedrock of effective property marketing. In today's visually-driven market, the quality of your imagery is not a luxury; it's a fundamental requirement for success.

These high-resolution photos, drone shots, and video tours are your digital curb appeal, and they do more than just showcase a property—they build your entire brand. According to the National Association of Realtors, listings with high-quality photography sell 32% faster. This isn't just a statistic; it's a reflection of buyer psychology.

**Here’s why that initial investment is so crucial:**

* **First Impressions are Final:** Buyers form an opinion about a property within seconds of seeing the first photo. Professional shots from your Aryeo photographer create an immediate perception of quality, value, and desirability. They stop the scroll and entice potential buyers to learn more.
* **Justifying Value and Attracting a Better Caliber of Buyer:** Crisp, well-lit photos signal that a property is well-maintained and professionally represented. This inherently supports the asking price and attracts serious, qualified buyers who appreciate quality and are more likely to be pre-approved.
* **Building Your Brand as a Premium Agent:** Every piece of marketing you produce is a reflection of your professional standards. Consistently using high-end media positions you as a premium agent who provides a superior level of service. It tells potential sellers, ""This is the quality you can expect when you list with me.""
* **Creating a Powerful Asset Library:** Every photoshoot isn't just for one listing. It's a deposit into your personal marketing bank. The exterior shot of a home in a sought-after neighborhood can become the backdrop for a market update. A beautiful kitchen photo can be used in a blog post about home staging. Your Aryeo media is a library of versatile assets ready to be deployed.

In short, you've already secured the most important ingredient. Now, let's learn how to cook with it.

# The Repurposing Gap: Where Most Agents Stop Short

Here's a scenario that probably sounds familiar. Your photographer delivers a stunning gallery of photos from your new listing at 123 Main Street. You’re thrilled. You eagerly download them, upload them to the MLS, push them to Zillow and [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com), and maybe post one or two photos to your Instagram with a ""Just Listed!"" caption. And then... what? For the vast majority of agents, this is where the marketing effort for that media ends.

This is the ""Repurposing Gap""—the chasm between acquiring high-quality assets and leveraging them to their full potential. It's the single biggest missed opportunity in modern real estate marketing.

**Falling into this gap is easy to do and happens for a few common reasons:**

* **The ""Upload and Forget"" Mentality:** Many agents view property photos as a single-use asset. Their purpose is to sell one specific house. Once the house is sold, the photos are mentally archived and forgotten. The idea of using photos from a sold listing for future marketing feels like extra, unnecessary work.
* **The Overwhelming Time Sink:** You're busy. Between showings, client calls, and paperwork, who has time to be a full-time content creator? Manually designing multiple social media posts for every stage of a listing—Just Listed, Open House, Under Contract, Just Sold—is incredibly time-consuming. Doing this consistently for all your listings feels like an impossible task.
* **The Design and Tech Hurdle:** You’re a real estate expert, not a graphic designer. Creating eye-catching carousels, engaging video slideshows, or branded graphics requires design skills and proficiency with tools like Canva or video editing software. The learning curve is steep, and the results can often look unprofessional without the right expertise.
* **Inconsistent Branding:** When you do find the time to create a post, it often looks different from the last one. One post might use one font, the next another. Your logo might be in a different place, or your headshot is missing. This inconsistency dilutes your brand recognition and makes it harder for your audience to remember you.

This gap is where leads are lost and brands stagnate. But bridging it is easier than you think. You don't need more hours in the day or a degree in graphic design; you just need a smarter workflow.

# The Modern Marketing Workflow: From Aryeo to Everywhere in Seconds

Imagine a world where the Repurposing Gap doesn't exist. Imagine a seamless workflow that takes your stunning Aryeo media and, with almost no effort, transforms it into a full-fledged marketing campaign. This isn't a fantasy; it's what happens when you connect your high-quality assets to a powerful automation engine.

The modern workflow isn't about working harder; it's about using the right tools to automate the tedious tasks and amplify your results.

**This is how you turn your media into marketing gold, step-by-step.**

**Step 1: Your Aryeo Media Goes Live** Your process starts as it always has. Your professional photographer works their magic, and the media is delivered and uploaded to the MLS and property portals like Zillow, Rightmove, or your brokerage's website. This is the trigger. The moment that listing is live with its beautiful photos, it's ready for the next step.

**Step 2: The 30-Second Transformation with** [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai) This is where the magic happens. Instead of downloading photos and wrestling with design apps, you simply copy the public URL of your property listing.

Paste that link into [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai). Our platform instantly gets to work. It scrapes the entire listing—all the high-resolution photos you invested in, the price, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the location, and the listing description. In about 30 seconds, [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) creates a complete set of marketing assets for you.

**You’re not just getting one post. You’re getting a suite of professionally designed content, including:**

* **Stunning ""Just Listed"" Carousels:** A multi-slide Instagram carousel that tells a story. The first slide is a beautiful hero shot with the address and price. Subsequent slides highlight key features like the ""Gourmet Kitchen,"" ""Spa-like Master Bath,"" or ""Spacious Backyard,"" all pulled from your Aryeo photos.
* **Engaging Property Videos:** [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai) automatically creates a dynamic video tour from your listing photos, set to licensed music. This scroll-stopping content is perfect for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Facebook, capturing attention far more effectively than a static image.
* **Branded Single-Image Posts:** Perfect for quick updates or sharing across multiple platforms.

Let's take your listing at **456 Oak Avenue**. You paste the Zillow link into [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai). Before you can finish your coffee, you have a branded, 10-slide carousel detailing the modern kitchen, the serene backyard, and the asking price, complete with a compelling, AI-generated caption ready to post. You also have a 30-second video walkthrough ready for your Reels. The entire process took less than a minute.

# Beyond the Listing: Content Strategies to Dominate Your Market

A successful social media presence isn't just about announcing new listings. It's about telling a continuous story of your success, expertise, and activity in the market. Your Aryeo media library is the perfect source for this ongoing narrative.

By thinking beyond the individual listing, you can create a content calendar that keeps you top-of-mind with potential clients all year long.

Here are powerful content strategies that leverage your existing photos:

* **""Just Sold"" Announcements:** This is arguably the most powerful post an agent can make. It’s tangible proof of success. Use the best exterior or interior shot from the Aryeo gallery and create a ""Just Sold"" graphic. It tells your network: ""I get results."" This builds immense trust and attracts new sellers.
* **""Under Contract"" & ""Pending"" Updates:** These posts create a sense of urgency and show that you are active in a moving market. It tells potential buyers and sellers that properties are in high demand and that you are the agent facilitating these transactions.
* **Hyper-Local Market Updates:** Take a stunning photo from a recent sale—say, the beautiful craftsman at **789 Pine Street**—and use it as a visual anchor for a local market update. Overlay text like, ""The Maplewood neighborhood saw a 5% increase in home values this quarter. Thinking of selling?"" This combines your visual assets with valuable data, positioning you as a local expert.
* **From Static Photos to Dynamic Videos:** Video is king on social media. It generates more engagement, shares, and views than static images. But who has time to edit videos?

This is a non-negotiable for modern marketing. Your Aryeo gallery might have 25 incredible photos. Instead of just posting one, use [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai)**'s Video Generator**. It automatically stitches your professional photos into a compelling video slideshow, complete with smooth transitions, your branding, and background music.

 It transforms your static gallery into a captivating property tour that stops the scroll and gets potential buyers to DM you for a showing.

By implementing these strategies, you’re no longer just marketing a house; you’re marketing yourself as a proactive, successful, and knowledgeable real estate authority.

# Building Trust with Social Proof: The Other Goldmine

Your two greatest assets in real estate are your properties and your reputation. You're already leveraging your property media, but what about your reputation? Glowing client reviews are marketing gold, but they are often stuck in places where they have little impact—at the bottom of a Zillow profile, in a private email, or as a text message on your phone. 

To make them work for you, you need to bring them out into the light in a professional, visually appealing way.

This is where you turn praise into powerful social proof. A screenshot of a text message is nice, but it lacks professionalism and branding. It doesn't look like it comes from a top-tier agent.

Imagine your client, Sarah, texts you: ""Thank you so much! You made this whole process so easy and got us way over asking!"" Don't just let that moment fade away. Screenshot it, and upload that image directly to [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai). Our AI technology reads the text from the image, extracts it, and instantly places it onto a beautifully designed, branded testimonial template. It includes the glowing review, your headshot, your logo, and your contact information.

In seconds, a private message is transformed into a high-impact piece of marketing content that screams credibility. Posting these regularly builds a public portfolio of trust. When potential clients see a consistent stream of happy customers, their decision to hire you becomes infinitely easier. It’s the digital equivalent of a powerful word-of-mouth referral.

# The Automation Advantage: Consistency Without the Grind

The secret to winning on social media isn't creating one viral post; it's consistency. Consistently showing up with valuable, professionally branded content establishes you as a reliable authority and keeps you at the forefront of your audience's mind. However, manual consistency is exhausting and unrealistic for a busy agent.

The only way to achieve it without burnout is through intelligent automation.

**This is the ultimate advantage of integrating your Aryeo media with a platform built for automation.**

* **Achieve Effortless Consistency:** By turning the 30-minute task of creating a post into a 30-second action, you remove the friction. You're more likely to post about every stage of the listing journey—from Just Listed to Just Sold—because it's no longer a chore. This consistent activity drastically increases your visibility and engagement.
* **Perfect Branding, Every Single Time:** With [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai), your brand is built-in. Every piece of content you generate, whether from a property listing, a client review, or a local market tip, is automatically customized with your headshot, logo, brand colors, and contact information. This ensures a cohesive, professional look across all your channels, reinforcing your brand identity with every post.
* **Post Directly and Save Hours:** The final piece of the puzzle is distribution. Once your perfect, branded content is ready, what's next? [**Trof.ai**](http://Trof.ai) closes the loop by allowing you to post your new content directly to your social media channels with a single click. No more downloading and re-uploading. No more copy-pasting captions. This seamless integration saves agents, on average, over 10 hours of marketing work every single week.

This automated workflow transforms your marketing from a series of disjointed, time-consuming tasks into a smooth, efficient, and highly effective system. It allows you to focus on what you do best—selling real estate—while your marketing engine runs consistently in the background.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **What is Aryeo and how do agents typically use it?** Aryeo is a popular content platform built for the real estate industry. It acts as a central hub for agents and brokerages to order, receive, and store professional media for their listings. Agents use it to manage the photos, videos, and virtual tours delivered by their photographers, ensuring all visual assets for a property are in one organized place.
* **How do I get my photos from Aryeo to use for my social media?** Typically, you would log into your Aryeo account, navigate to the specific property gallery, and select the photos you wish to download to your computer or phone. For a faster workflow that avoids manual downloads, once your listing is live on a portal like Zillow or [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com), you can use a marketing tool that pulls all the photos and data directly from the public listing link to create content.
* **Does Aryeo automatically post my listings to social media?** No, Aryeo's primary role is media management and delivery. It does not automatically create or publish marketing content to your social media channels. Bridging this gap requires a separate step where you either manually create posts or use a marketing automation platform, like [Trof.ai](http://Trof.ai), which is designed specifically for that purpose.
* **What's the best way to create engaging videos from my static photos without being a video editor?** The most straightforward method is to use a tool with built-in video generation. These platforms take your gallery of photos and automatically stitch them into a dynamic video with transitions and music. This is far more efficient than using complex video editing software. Look for services that can create these videos from a listing link to save the most time.
* **Is it worth creating marketing content for listings that sold months ago?** Absolutely. Your past sales are powerful social proof. A ""Just Sold"" post is one of the most effective marketing pieces you can have. You can also use photos from past sales for ""Throwback Thursday"" content or to create neighbourhood-specific posts, like ""A Look Inside Homes in Woking,"" showcasing your expertise and sales history in the local area.

I would like to start a business selling cheesecakes and would love any advice/tips. I have done lots of cheesecakes for friends/family but am unable to sell at this time due to cottage law. My ultimate dream would be to have a bakery that allows my community to feel safe and comfortable. During the morning/day I would like to offer a quiet space for people to work/relax while enjoying some coffee and savory/breakfast themed cheesecakes. At this time I would offer bread/donuts/bagels/whatever I feel with the “pay what you can” concept so everyone feels welcome and can be fed. The afternoon/evening would become more lively, offering customizable mini cheesecakes & mocktails. I would like to do different cheesecake bases (plain, cookies and cream, peanut butter, etc) and then allow the customer to choose their toppings. I would offer these in the count of 3, 6, & 12. Still speaking in the aspect of dreams, I would like to have live music during the evenings and allow artists to display their work to bring the community together as much as possible. 

Now that I’m done dreaming, to start this there seems to be a couple options and I need help figuring out what would be the best choice or what other options I may not be aware of. I cannot sell from home. 

1. Online orders + rent kitchen space
Pros: cheapest option
Cons: little sense of community, difficult to transport product, possibility of issues from other products in shared kitchen

2. Food truck + rent kitchen space
Pros: customer facing, ability to transport
Cons: still unable to have full sense of community without physical space, have to pay for both truck and rent space

3. Rent storefront
Pros: ability to have community and feel fulfilled living out my vision, have my own space to freely use at any hours without worrying about others, easier to prep.
Cons: cost

Any tips or additions to pros/cons for these options would be so appreciated. Thank you!!!

1mj2bmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mj2bmm,Bankai,"While visiting Utrecht, Netherlands, walking the canals, searching for bags of coffee through the windows of cafés, I approached a shop with white trim and bloody red letters that spelled “BANKAI”. The last thing I would’ve assumed was that it was a café; but underneath the title read, “slow coffee bar”. And through the reflections of the windows I saw the digital pour-over scale, a la Marrazaco, and Mahlkonig grinder. I thought I’d pop in to see what they had for beans. Dak! A roaster I really wanted to try. 
I approached the counter with a question, seeing several Dak boxes on the counter with rather lower price marks handwritten in ink. “Is this box of Dak really 9 Euros?” He explained to me that’s the cost for a pour-over. He further explained that his brew offerings were beans that were peaking in flavor. No under-rested coffee. 
 I’m starting to look closer at the counter and realizing there are handwritten notes and graphs, inked across the glass countertop with red ink. I observed him explaining coffee to the customer ahead of me about what he’s trying to accomplish with the drink he’s making them, jotting down pictures of explanations for visual learners. 
His personality. Very direct. His passion somewhat overwhelming. But to a coffee person, he spoke the truth and was authentic. Initially a little off-putting but in retrospect was refreshing to have. 
I thought with all the tech, perspective, and confidence I’d try the mango tango pour-over, beans by Dak. I asked for his brew recipe and he refused. Stating that brew set-ups are completely different and told me to adjust my brew methods to bring out the tasting notes on the box. As he finishes up the pour-over, he pours a little bit of the coffee into a spoon and slurps it down. I think to myself what the heck, that’s my expensive coffee I’m buying from you! But… I appreciate that he cared enough to try what he made me to make sure it was decent, or, he had a sample to adjust his next brew. Either way that was the best pour-over experience I ever had at a café. 
I was in there for over half an hour… he took his time with everyone that came through the café and every brew he made with intention. How he makes lots of money? I don’t think he does. Love him or hate him, he makes a damn good cup.

1mj2blm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mj2blm/otto_neurath_and_happiness/,Otto Neurath And Happiness,"I think of Otto Neurath primarily as a member of the Vienna circle. Rudolf Carnap and Moritz Schlick were two other prominent members. They developed the philosophy of logical empiricalism or logical positivism. No woolly dialectics or cultural criticism for them.

It was a custom, when they were meeting at their preferred coffee-house in 1920s Vienna, to interrupt any speaker who had strayed into much-despised metaphysics. Neurath did this so often that they told him to hold up his hand whenever the speaker said something that was not metaphysics.

When Neurath fled the Nazis, he took his wife and his mistress with him. They got along well.

A number of revolutions, inspired by the Bolsheviks, convulsed central Europe after World War I. I think of Hungary and the Spartacists, in particular. Neurath began implementing his ideas for central planning under the Bavarian Soviet Republic. He advocated planning in kind, without monetary prices.

This was long before the definition of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But Neurath would not be interested in optimizing GDP in his planning. He did not want to duplicate capitalism. Rather he looked at a broader array of measures:

>""Neurath … pioneered a measure of living standard. He took variables that are now familiar to economists, such as nutrition, health, life expectancy, housing, clothing, incidence of crime. He was also concerned to build these up in a single measure, and its level, as well as its distribution, were to be the concern of the socialist planner."" – Meghnad Desai. 2002.

This measure is like the United Nations [Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) (HDI), Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness (GNP), or, say, metrics promoted by [Joseph Stiglitz](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gdp-is-the-wrong-tool-for-measuring-what-matters/). 

I suppose I ought to mention ISOTYPE, Neurath’s pictorial language or symbols.

A century has shown that an unregulated, unrestrained capitalism does not deliver a broad-based prosperity for all, in which most can fully develop their capabilities. Suppose you care about the majority of your fellow citizens, not just a few at the top. Empirically, you should vote for socialists.

It is I, nonoyo, also known as Pumpkin2648 - As a tradition, I am here; humbly I must say, reaching out to see if maybe theres anyone who would like to make my birthday a special day. 

I cant explain to you how this has become a tradition of mine, to post this request for my birthday every single year for the last ~5 (6? 7? Can't remember) years. I do not get to celebrate much, but I always love and [appreciate](https://imgur.com/a/0nGtWWC)
[the mail](https://imgur.com/a/g2cIal2) [I have received](https://imgur.com/a/uNMK5tH) [throughout the years](https://imgur.com/a/FeJpBj6) - so 2025, is no exception, could you help me out and celebrate my birthday with me?

I would love any kind of card! I am not picky at all, but if you need ideas, here are some stuff I like:

- I love cooking, coffee, aguas frescas, campers, cats, dogs, bumblebees, and all cute stuff, almost all baby animals are adorable to me - i cluding rats, snakes, otters, etc (except for monkeys and some weird fish)


- My favorite color is YInMn Blue - which is something like a mix of cobalt and electric blue. However, the colors I use the most either in my [craft room](https://imgur.com/a/pXgoMgN), or my [gaming set up](https://imgur.com/a/FxZXGu8) are Teal and White. I also love purple. 


- I do not like to receive the following themes, or things: anything about religion or politics, anything with bugs (especially roaches), monkeys, hello kitty, ""ecchi"", lamellae like the ones found in mushrooms or duck beaks, anything with clusters of circles (trypophobia), mean or hateful mail towards myself or others, gory or bloody content. When in doubt, just ask away ❤️ 

My birthday is on August 22nd :) I will be turning 37 - yes I'm old, yes my back and knees hurt, no, I have not found out how to stop losing hair. I live in the US basically in the DC metro area. (If that matters :)) 
I do not mind any other topic you want to bring up and talk about or read whatever you want to write. A happy birthday will suffice :).

If you have it in you and could apate me about t minutes if your time and send me a card I woullllddddd so damn much appreciate it.

Please comment down below if you can help!.
And we will take it from there


Thanks so much for the support and love shown to me during all these years. 


Thanks!

Don't forget to smile daily!

Love you


okay

1mj29uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mj29uo/starting_a_cheesecake_business/,Starting a cheesecake business?,"I have no experience in bakeries or owning a business. I would like to start a business selling cheesecakes and would love any advice/tips. I have done lots of cheesecakes for friends/family but am unable to sell at this time due to cottage law. My ultimate dream would be to have a bakery that allows my community to feel safe and comfortable. During the morning/day I would like to offer a quiet space for people to work/relax while enjoying some coffee and savory/breakfast themed cheesecakes. At this time I would offer bread/donuts/bagels/whatever I feel with the “pay what you can” concept so everyone feels welcome and can be fed. The afternoon/evening would become more lively, offering customizable mini cheesecakes & mocktails. I would like to do different cheesecake bases (plain, cookies and cream, peanut butter, etc) and then allow the customer to choose their toppings. I would offer these in the count of 3, 6, & 12. Still speaking in the aspect of dreams, I would like to have live music during the evenings and allow artists to display their work to bring the community together as much as possible. 

Now that I’m done dreaming, to start this there seems to be a couple options and I need help figuring out what would be the best choice or what other options I may not be aware of. I cannot sell from home. 

1. Online orders + rent kitchen space
Pros: cheapest option
Cons: little sense of community, difficult to transport product, possibility of issues from other products in shared kitchen

2. Food truck + rent kitchen space
Pros: customer facing, ability to transport
Cons: still unable to have full sense of community without physical space, have to pay for both truck and rent space

3. Rent storefront
Pros: ability to have community and feel fulfilled living out my vision, have my own space to freely use at any hours without worrying about others, easier to prep.
Cons: cost

Any tips or additions to pros/cons for these options would be so appreciated. Thank you!!!

Over the last year I’ve lost 50 pounds and during that time I stopped making coffee every morning in my traditional drip coffee machine. I use expensive beans that I grind myself. Recently though I started craving plain lattes from a local coffee shop but they are pricey. 

Twenty years ago I had a Keurig and it made the worst coffee I’ve ever had in my life. It also died after just five months. My Mom still has one and the coffee is still awful, but she buys a new one every year. 

I’m looking for a super simple no frills make a one cup of coffee or latte machine. Smaller is better as I probably won’t be using it daily.

But now? I can’t even take a bite. Sugar or caffeine makes me feel so weird. Emotionally nauseous, panicky, tingly, like I’m gonna throw up but inside. And it lasts for days. It’s not physical sick, it’s emotional.

I have bipolar and borderline, and I don’t know which one’s messing with me. This sudden shift feels so unfair. Like, it’s just sugar and coffee. Why is my body reacting like it’s poison?

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

That’s just my opinion. I’m autistic and I have difficulty picking up and learning new things and getting used to dynamics. Since I’m a newbie I’ve struggled so hard with settling into findom with a more formal dynamic of paypig/domme. 

I think just being a guy who a domme considers in the friendzone or just casual simping for your domme is much easier as it’s easy to work around. And it gives freedom to your domme, she doesn’t need to feel locked in, she can reply whenever and however she wants and I can just keep doing small coffee sends and etc.

Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

# Best Powder Coated Tumbler 2025: Reviewed & compared

The powder coated tumbler has become an essential accessory for anyone seeking to keep their beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods. From morning coffee to afternoon iced tea, these durable and stylish containers offer a superior choice to disposable cups and bottles. With a wide array of brands and models available, selecting the perfect powder coated tumbler can be a daunting task. This review aims to simplify that process by thoroughly examining and comparing top contenders for 2025, providing you with the information needed to make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The best powder coated tumblers of 2025 boast a combination of innovative design and advanced technology to deliver exceptional performance. Below are key features to consider when evaluating various options:

**Material and Construction:**

High-quality stainless steel is the standard for premium powder coated tumblers.Look for 18/8 (304) stainless steel, known for its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and its ability to maintain the purity of yoru beverage's flavor. The construction should be seamless or feature minimal welding to prevent leaks and improve insulation. The powder coating itself should be chip-resistant and durable,ensuring long-lasting aesthetics and protection against wear and tear.

**Insulation Technology:**

Vacuum insulation is the key to temperature retention. Double-walled vacuum insulated tumblers create an airless space between the inner and outer walls, minimizing heat transfer. This technology allows the tumbler to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours, depending on the specific model and ambient temperature. Some advanced tumblers also incorporate copper lining between the stainless steel walls for added thermal conductivity and improved temperature retention.

**Lid Design and sealing:**

The lid plays a crucial role in preventing leaks and spills.look for lids made from BPA-free plastic or stainless steel with a tight-fitting silicone seal. Screw-on lids generally offer better leak-proof performance compared to press-fit lids. Some lids feature a sliding closure for easy access to your beverage, while others have a flip-top mechanism. many premium tumblers also offer interchangeable lids to cater to different beverage types and preferences.

**Powder Coating finish:**

The powder coating provides both aesthetic appeal and added grip. A high-quality powder coating should be durable, scratch-resistant, and available in a variety of colors and textures. Matte finishes tend to be more resistant to fingerprints and smudges, while gloss finishes offer a sleek and vibrant look. Certain powder coatings also feature UV resistance to prevent fading from prolonged sun exposure.

**Size and Capacity:**

Powder coated tumblers come in various sizes, typically ranging from 12 ounces to 40 ounces. Consider your typical beverage consumption and portability needs when selecting the appropriate size.Smaller tumblers are ideal for coffee or tea, while larger tumblers are better suited for water, smoothies, or other larger servings. Also, check if the tumbler fits in standard cup holders and is agreeable to hold.## Core Benefits

Powder coated tumblers offer a range of benefits that extend beyond simply keeping drinks hot or cold. They provide environmental advantages, enhance convenience, and potentially save money in the long run.

**Superior Temperature Retention:** Powder coated tumblers excel at maintaining the temperature of your beverages. Whether you need to keep your coffee piping hot during a chilly commute or keep your iced tea refreshingly cold on a hot summer day, these tumblers deliver consistent performance. This is achieved through the double-walled vacuum insulation that minimizes heat transfer, ensuring your drinks stay at the desired temperature for hours.

**Environmentally Kind Alternative:** By using a powder coated tumbler, you significantly reduce your reliance on disposable plastic cups and bottles. This helps to minimize plastic waste, which contributes to pollution and harms the surroundings. Choosing a reusable tumbler is a simple yet effective way to make a positive impact and support enduring practices. Over time, the cumulative impact of individual choices can contribute to significant environmental improvements.**Durability and longevity:** High-quality powder coated tumblers are built to last. The stainless steel construction and durable powder coating make them resistant to dents, scratches, and corrosion. Unlike flimsy plastic bottles that can easily crack or break, these tumblers are designed to withstand daily use and occasional drops. Investing in a durable tumbler means you won't have to constantly replace it, saving you money in the long run.

**Enhanced Convenience and Portability:** Powder coated tumblers offer unparalleled convenience for on-the-go lifestyles. Whether you're commuting to work, hiking in the mountains, or simply relaxing at home, you can easily enjoy your favorite beverages without worrying about temperature changes or spills.The leak-proof lid designs ensure that your drinks stay contained,while the various size options cater to different needs.

**Improved Taste and Purity:** Stainless steel tumblers do not retain flavors or odors, ensuring that your beverages taste as intended. Unlike plastic bottles, which can leach chemicals into your drinks, stainless steel is a safe and inert material. This means you can enjoy your coffee, tea, or water without any unwanted aftertaste or concerns about contamination. The pure taste experience provided by stainless steel tumblers enhances the overall enjoyment of your beverages.

## FAQs Section

**Are powder coated tumblers dishwasher safe?**
It depends on the specific tumbler and the manufacturer's instructions. Some powder coated tumblers are dishwasher safe, typically on the top rack. Though, hand washing is generally recommended to prolong the lifespan of the powder coating and prevent potential damage to the vacuum seal. Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific cleaning instructions.

**How do I clean my powder coated tumbler effectively?**
For regular cleaning, warm soapy water and a soft sponge or brush are sufficient. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the powder coating. For stubborn stains or odors, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or a specialized stainless steel cleaner. ensure the tumbler is thoroughly rinsed and dried after cleaning.**Can I use my powder coated tumbler for carbonated beverages?**
While most powder coated tumblers are designed to handle a range of beverages, it's generally not recommended to use them for highly carbonated drinks.The pressure from carbonation can potentially damage the lid and cause leaks or even explosions in extreme cases. If you choose to use your tumbler for carbonated beverages, be sure to release the pressure periodically and avoid overfilling it.

**How do I maintain the temperature retention of my tumbler?**
To maximize temperature retention, preheat or pre-chill your tumbler before filling it with your desired beverage. You can do this by filling it with hot or cold water for a few minutes and then emptying it. Avoid placing your tumbler in direct sunlight or near heat sources. Regularly cleaning the lid and ensuring a tight seal will also help maintain optimal temperature retention.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

1mj26q0,https://i.redd.it/4xofqfazxdhf1.jpeg,Day 65 is done!,"Day 65 ushered in a new book!  This is my fourth book of the challenge so far, “Work Your Network!” By Jim Pelayo.

The reading has been a great success for me, it’s the one activity that’s got a non negotiable schedule I follow, along with my progress picture, they’re the very first two tasks that I complete at the very start of the day.

I read as soon as I wake up, and immediately follow that up with my progress pic.  

These the two tasks are  the ones I want done because they are the easiest to miss completing while also the easiest to do, so getting them out of the way is critical to my success.

It’s a great way to simulate the brain and to start the day with the right mindset, and I get two big tasks done before my day starts so I’m already ahead of the game, and mentally ready for the day’s set of tasks to complete, for business and personal.

Depending on my mood and schedule for the day, I may take a bit of time to reflect on the book I’m reading while I’m enjoying my morning coffee, other times I’ll just get the day going if I have things to do, everything always falls into place by the end of the day.

I have to admit that I personally prefer to listen to audiobooks, but the reading has been a great experience, and the books I’m reading were all gifted to me by great people I look up to, who encouraged me to read those books for a variety of reasons, and I feel great that I can tell them I did so, even sharing insights with them.

I love the balance between the mental and physical challenges of the 75 Hard, I feel my mind has evolved over the past 9+ weeks, if I could take a progress picture of my brain it would likely be looking fit and muscular too!

I’m looking forward to finishing this book around the time I finish the 75 Hard, but like every other day, I will be focusing on the present tasks I have to do first.

10 days to go, but day 66 is the only way forward.  Let’s go!

Stay Hard.

A few months ago, I had one of those “where did all my money go?” moments.  
I opened my bank app. Then I opened my notes app. Then I opened 3 expense tracker apps…  
And then I closed them all.

Adding every transaction manually is a chore — and it’s exactly why I (and probably a lot of people) just don’t do it consistently.

So I decided to build something that works the way I think:  
Just say what I spent — and let the app figure it out.

I spent the last 6 months building **WalletGPT** — a voice-powered expense tracker where you can literally say:

""Spent 5$ on coffee today, 65.5$ on electricity bills last friday and refueled my car for 30$ yesterday""

…and it will:

* 🧠 Understand what’s income vs expense
* 🗂️ Break it into multiple transactions
* 🗓️ Parse natural language dates
* 📊 Categorize everything with AI

Last week I finally launched it on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6747127537) only for now.

In the **first 5 days**:

* ✅ 61 downloads
* ✅ 3 users started a trial

Not huge numbers, but seeing people *use* something I made is surreal.

* Budget alerts
* Recurring transactions

## Key Features Analysis

The following Anubias species offer diverse sizes, leaf shapes, and growth habits, making them suitable for a wide range of aquarium environments. Each species offers unique aesthetic and functional benefits.

**Anubias barteri var. nana**

Anubias barteri var. nana is arguably the most popular Anubias species in the aquarium trade. Its small size, typically reaching 2-4 inches in height, makes it ideal for nano tanks and foreground placements. The plant features rounded, dark green leaves that are incredibly durable and resistant to being eaten by herbivorous fish. Its slow growth rate also minimizes the need for frequent trimming.

**Anubias barteri var. angustifolia**

Anubias barteri var. angustifolia, also known as Anubias 'Narrow Leaf', distinguishes itself with its long, slender leaves that can grow up to 6 inches in length. This variety adds a unique texture and vertical element to aquascapes. It shares the same hardy characteristics as other Anubias species, thriving in low to moderate lighting conditions and tolerating a wide range of water parameters.

**Anubias barteri var. coffeefolia**

Anubias barteri var. coffeefolia is known for its distinctive ruffled leaves that resemble coffee beans, hence the name. The leaves emerge with a reddish-brown hue, gradually turning green as they mature. This variety adds a touch of visual interest and complexity to any aquarium. It grows to a moderate size, typically reaching 4-6 inches in height, making it suitable for midground placements.

**Anubias gigantea**

Anubias gigantea is the largest Anubias species, capable of reaching impressive sizes of up to 18 inches in height. Its large, broad leaves provide ample coverage and create a dramatic focal point in larger aquariums. Due to its size, it's best suited for tanks with a minimum capacity of 50 gallons. It offers a bold and striking aesthetic.

**Anubias nana 'Petite'**

Anubias nana 'Petite' is a miniature version of the popular Anubias nana, with even smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit. This variety is perfect for nano tanks and intricate aquascapes where space is limited. Its tiny leaves create a delicate and visually appealing effect. This plant only grows to be about an inch tall.

## Core Benefits

These Anubias species offer several key benefits to aquarium enthusiasts. These benefits range from ease of care to aesthetic enhancements and water quality improvements.

**Low Maintenance**

Anubias plants are renowned for their low maintenance requirements. They thrive in a wide range of water conditions and do not require intense lighting or CO2 supplementation. This makes them ideal for beginners and those seeking a hassle-free aquarium plant. Their slow growth rate also reduces the need for frequent trimming and pruning, saving time and effort.

**Durable and Hardy**

Anubias plants are exceptionally durable and resistant to being eaten by herbivorous fish. Their tough leaves can withstand nibbling and grazing, making them a safe and reliable choice for community tanks. They are also relatively resistant to diseases and algae growth, contributing to a healthier and more stable aquarium environment.

**Aesthetic Appeal**

Anubias plants offer a variety of leaf shapes, sizes, and textures, allowing aquarists to create visually appealing and natural-looking aquascapes. Their dark green foliage provides a striking contrast to other aquarium plants and decorations. They can be attached to rocks, driftwood, or other hardscape elements to create a sense of depth and dimension.

**Water Quality Improvement**

Like all aquatic plants, Anubias contribute to improved water quality by absorbing nitrates and other harmful substances. They also release oxygen into the water, which is essential for the health and well-being of fish and other aquatic organisms. While their impact may be less significant compared to faster-growing plants, they still play a valuable role in maintaining a balanced and healthy aquarium ecosystem.

**Versatile Placement**

Anubias plants can be placed in various locations within the aquarium, depending on the species and desired effect. Smaller varieties like Anubias nana and Anubias nana 'Petite' are ideal for foreground placements, while larger varieties like Anubias gigantea are better suited for background or centerpiece positions. They can also be attached to rocks or driftwood to create unique and natural-looking aquascapes.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions regarding Anubias plants helps prospective buyers make informed decisions and properly care for their new aquatic additions. These questions cover essential aspects of Anubias care and compatibility.

**Can Anubias plants be planted in the substrate?**

No, Anubias plants should not be planted directly into the substrate. Their rhizome, the horizontal stem from which the leaves and roots grow, must be exposed to prevent rotting. It is best to attach them to rocks, driftwood, or other hardscape elements using fishing line, super glue (cyanoacrylate), or specialized aquarium plant glue.

**What are the ideal lighting conditions for Anubias plants?**

Anubias plants thrive in low to moderate lighting conditions. Excessive light can promote algae growth on their leaves. If your aquarium has high lighting, consider placing them in shaded areas or using floating plants to reduce the intensity. Aim for 1-3 watts per gallon of water for optimal growth.

**How often should I fertilize Anubias plants?**

Anubias plants are slow growers and do not require frequent fertilization. However, occasional fertilization with a liquid fertilizer containing micronutrients can promote healthy growth and vibrant color. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can lead to algae blooms. A general rule is to fertilize every 2-4 weeks, depending on the specific needs of your aquarium.

**What type of fish are compatible with Anubias plants?**

Anubias plants are compatible with a wide range of fish species, including those that are known to eat other aquatic plants. Their tough leaves are resistant to nibbling and grazing, making them a safe choice for community tanks. Some popular fish species that coexist well with Anubias include tetras, rasboras, corydoras, and dwarf shrimp.

1mj1z3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1mj1z3y/when_your_friend_brings_their_chaos_hospitality/,When your friend brings their chaos: hospitality gone wrong,"I recently hosted a close friend and her family for a last-minute, week-long stay—and honestly, it was overwhelming. The kids were constantly disruptive, hygiene was lacking, and despite my efforts to accommodate and provide meals, they showed little appreciation or contribution. I ended up shouldering nearly all the cooking, cleaning, and expenses while juggling a demanding job.
I tried to be flexible and generous, but my boundaries were often tested and ignored. Was I unreasonable in expecting basic participation and gratitude? How would you handle hosting a family that takes advantage while showing minimal appreciation? Any tips on setting clear boundaries or standing your ground without feeling guilty?

**The full context:**
Their request to visit came last minute, which immediately put me in a challenging position. I live alone and don’t have children, so my home isn’t really set up to comfortably accommodate a family of five for an extended stay. Still, wanting to be flexible and helpful, I agreed.

My friend and I have known each other for over a decade. We live in different states and only keep sporadic contact (a few times a year). We’ve met every few years for a few hours each time. So friendly and close when we're together, but not too close. Still, I wanted to be generous by hosting them; after this experience though, it’ll be their first and last visit.

From the moment they arrived, their behavior made it clear there would be issues. I heard one of their kids shouting from the street before they even came in. Once inside, instead of waiting for a proper welcome or tour, the husband and kids stormed in, opening cupboards, drawers, and doors—including some I had locked to keep my personal belongings safe. It was chaotic and intrusive; I had to stop them, gather their attention, and explain house rules and where essential things like the bathroom and bedroom were.

Hygiene was a huge problem for both parents and kids. The kids rarely washed hands after using the toilet and then handled food. They never cleaned up after themselves. Their feet were often filthy; they’d go straight to bed without washing properly. I found sand and food crumbs in their beds. The house was left quite a mess, and now I have a big cleaning job ahead.

Financially, I had hoped they’d chip in for groceries or meals, but I ended up shouldering almost all the costs. I did all the shopping and cooking, providing nearly all breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. The youngest child mainly ate store-bought baby food, which was the only exception. After long workdays, I was often too exhausted to cook for five—especially with two picky eaters—so I took them out for dinner twice, paying myself. They did pay for one breakfast and one lunch, and covered their own lunches twice when out while I was working.

They offered to buy groceries and cook, but given the messiness and hygiene, I declined — I didn’t want them in my kitchen making a bigger mess. So I was left to cook or take them out, both costly in time and money on top of my already demanding job.

One frustrating moment was when, while I was still preparing dinner, my friend’s husband said there wasn’t enough food for everyone. That felt rude and inconsiderate.

Another issue was a train day trip. I mistakenly bought an extra ticket and offered it to them, asking for reimbursement. They agreed but ignored all my reminders. Her husband even laughed ironically, saying his wife owed me since she used the ticket, not him. I was left speechless. Not wanting to keep pushing, I let it go, but it was frustrating. Perhaps they thought paying for lunch and coffee for me made up for it, but I had covered two restaurant dinners and all groceries. And they were staying for free in my house!

What really struck me as rude was their lack of appreciation. They showed up empty-handed — not even a small gift, no chocolate or flowers, anything... They claimed they thought about bringing champagne but decided against it because they know I don’t drink. Instead, they brought their own specialty coffee and even a mocha pot to maintain their morning routine — and took it all back home. So literally, they brought nothing for me. It may sound petty, but to me, it showed entitlement and a lack of respect and consideration.

Interestingly, they did buy local gifts for their own family during the trip, so gifting wasn’t foreign to them. It makes me wonder if they show up empty-handed at other friends’ homes too or just at mine. Honestly, it felt like they treated my home like an all-inclusive vacation rental — except mostly free.

Their behavior was exhausting: constant tantrums, fighting kids, and parents who seemed indifferent. Despite me being clear about house rules, they made themselves too comfortable too quickly.

At one point, my friend and her husband asked for my honest opinion on their parenting. I was hesitant but candid as they insisted. I told them their kids’ behavior was out of line and that more discipline and structure could benefit them, helping avoid future social problems. I also told them that if I had known how challenging their visit would be, I’d have suggested maybe only my friend and their youngest come, rather than the whole family. To their credit, we actually had a constructive conversation, and they seemed open to hearing this kind of criticism.

Despite everything, I tried to be gracious. I gave up my own bedroom —the nicest in the house— to make them comfortable and did my best to keep things calm. But the disruption was draining. Several nights I barely slept managing the chaos alongside a demanding job, and my personal life!

I really wasn’t prepared for all this chaos. I tried to be flexible and tolerant, but there’s only so much anyone can take. Several times, I had to discipline the kids myself, but they ignored me or acted defiantly—while their parents watched silently. Unless I specifically asked parents to intervene, they didn’t, which baffled me. My attempts obviously failed — not being their parent — but the lack of adult response was shocking.

In the end, they had a great vacation, probably saving around 80% of what they’d have spent on hotels and eating out, while I was suffering disruption, intrusion and disproportionate financial cost. 

Looking back, I should have been firmer about expenses. I hinted that I couldn’t provide every meal and suggested they eat out more, but it was clear they wanted to save with home-cooked food. I didn’t want to be rude or too direct. Similarly, I should have pressed more on the train ticket reimbursement, but I didn’t have it in me. I tend to be assertive in life, but I guess when it comes to hosting, I turn into a bit of a people-pleaser. In this situation, I let them take advantage of my generosity because I didn’t want to seem unwelcoming or stingy. In hindsight, it’s a bit ridiculous.

Once, many years ago, I gave this same friend a gift worth almost $100 because I had missed her wedding — I couldn’t travel across states at the time, so I wanted to mark the occasion and show my support and happiness for her. But her reaction was surprisingly cold. She literally asked me, “But why?” I had to explain my intentions, and then she said, “I hope it’s not clothes,” because she considers herself environmentally conscious and against overconsumption. She even gave me a short lecture about how overconsumption harms the planet and people’s rights.
It wasn’t clothes at all. When she finally opened the gift, she didn’t really show any appreciation—just a flat “thank you” with a long face—and then quickly moved on. I remember feeling so stupid and thinking, Maybe we’re not really that kind of friends. I found her response quite rude, but instead of calling it out, I let it slide and ended up questioning myself rather than her unfriendly attitude.

As I’m writing all this down, I’m starting to realize that maybe she just isn’t a very nice person. I keep wondering why I worry so much about coming across as rude, especially when she herself isn’t very friendly, polite, or well-mannered.

What do you think? Was I unreasonable in my expectations? How would you handle hosting guests who are disruptive or don’t show appreciation? And do you have any advice on how to set healthier boundaries or reframe my own approach so I don’t end up feeling taken advantage of next time?",6,1754479406.0,childfree,2,1.0,False

Not because he wants to , but because he needs to.*

""Beneath the thin veil of this material world, there exists a hidden second world. One with its own laws and its own entities. It's not like a fantasy novel with Gandalf and the seven dwarves, and it's not like an occult horror movie where witches and demons lurk around every corner. It's something of its own. You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Mr. Smith?""  
The woman in the tight black dress slowly and absentmindedly let her finger glide along the rim of her cocktail glass and glanced around the bar. Her gaze rested on a wall for a moment, then she looked back at Jake.

""Know? No."" Jake looked into her eyes. ""It's something I’ve felt since..."" he whispered more quietly, ""since fate struck me.""

""Fate? There is no fate, Mr. Smith. Unless one submits to it out of free will.""

""What kinds of fates are there that one can submit to?""The moment he asked, Jake felt a cold shiver run down his back. Had the man sitting at the far end of the room looked at him piercingly for a moment—or had he just imagined it?

""That is a dangerous question. Only someone like you, who has no idea about that world, would even consider such a question. Naming a thing can also summon the thing. I’ll just tell you this: The free will of humans is a source of power. Don’t give up the power of humans lightly and too quickly. A free piece of good advice from me.""

""I won’t. Thank you for the advice, Ms. Vox.""

She nodded, and a black curl fell forward, only to be brushed back by her hand.

""What happens now, Ms. Vox? You don’t want to tell me more. Am I and will I remain just a tourist who stumbled upon a figure from that world?""

""People like you can be classified in different ways. It is not your fate to give up.""

""Now there is a fate after all?""

""Your fate is to walk your path. Your free will is your fate. Don’t let anyone take that away from you.""

Jake looked at her defiantly. ""Fine, then maybe I shouldn’t let a riddle-speaking Medusa stop me from walking my path. How do I cross the veil? How do I become part of the world that isn’t just material?""

As he asked it, Jake thought he heard something like a whisper for a moment. But he simply ignored it. Nothing would stop him.

Lilane Vox looked at him for a long time. The discreet lounge-style music played in the background. She took a sip of her cocktail. She looked into Jake’s eyes. Behind Jake’s bravado, she saw a deep pain. A fluctuation in his soul. A burden he wanted to rid himself of but couldn’t.

""That world is not harmless. On the contrary, it is extremely dangerous. A wrong word can damn your soul. A door once crossed may never open again. That world is salvation and damnation. Heroin and medicine.""

Jake impatiently tapped the table with his knuckle. ""I don’t care about any of that. I MUST go there.""

Lilane nodded.

""Very well. I can help you. But maybe one day you’ll curse me for showing it to you.""

""Maybe. Maybe I’ll be grateful to you forever.""

For a moment, there was silence between them. Lilane seemed lost in thought. Then she took the initiative.

""Close your eyes, Mr. Smith.""

Jake looked at her skeptically. His distrust was obvious.

Lilane giggled wickedly. ""I’m not going to devour you. Do you want to or not?""

""I’m just afraid that if I close my eyes, you’ll be gone and won’t tell me what I want to know.""

""I gave you my word out of my own free will. I trust. Now you have to trust.""

Jake looked at her for a moment, then closed his eyes.

""Go back to the moment that forms the foundation for your decision to want to cross the veil.""

Lilane saw how the face of the man across from her twisted. She felt his pain, his fear in a distant way. Whatever he was imagining—it wasn’t pleasant.

""I bet you see something in front of you now...""

Jake hesitated, then forced himself to answer. ""... A door. A door in my family’s home. Behind it...""

""OPEN that door and pay attention if, in the moment of painful revelation, you feel, see, or hear something that doesn’t belong to that moment itself, but is still connected to it.""

Jake moved his head back and forth like a writhing snake.   
""... There. is. nothing.""

""There is ALWAYS something. Come on, Mr. Smith. You’ll perceive it if you REALLY want to.""

A single tear ran down Jake’s face.""At the moment I open the door... I hear something like a bell... Not like a church bell but something like a bright, clear silver bell. Like from a glockenspiel.""

Lilane felt the veil around Jake thinning.""THAT’S IT, MR. SMITH. That’s your burden—and your power.""

Jake opened his eyes. Sweat stood on his forehead. He wiped the sweat and tears away with the sleeve of his hoodie.

""Congratulations. You’ve found the way.""

""I still don’t fully understand it.""

""You will. Very soon. Welcome to my world... Jake.""

""Thank you, Ms. Vox.""

""It’s fine. From now on, you can call me Lilane.""

""One last free piece of advice, Jake: If you get a bad feeling, if a door makes you afraid, and your intuition tells you not to do something—then you should listen to it. That can save you a lot of trouble.""

""I’ll follow your advice, Lilane.""

""No, you won’t. But that’s okay. At least I warned you. Don’t forget your weakness—but believe in your strength as well. See you soon, Jake!""

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg. 

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized. 
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well. ",1,1754479168.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

1mj1rua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1mj1rua/bad_owners_bad_people/,Bad owners = Bad people,"I think looking at bad dog owners as a niche kind of person is short sighed. 

I read a lot of the posts on here and I can definitely relate to a lot of the stories told.

I think the actual problem is bad people in general. 

I believe they are misused and mistreated by humans. As a result of this socially acceptable abuse, a lot of really terrable people have access to very dangerous animals that place a huge strain on the world. 

I think dogs are a go to for people with personality disorders, mental health issues, and other negative personal reasosns. For someone who has no intention on properly careing for, cleaning and traing the dog It's a quick and easy way to buy  status. Unfortunately the status bought by terrable people comes at a huge price to the rest of the world.

If given the opportunity the same crappy dog owner would be a crappy parent, co-worker, boss, subordinate, ect. That person will be a shit human no matter their circumstances. 

A lot of them seem to enjoy mixing two or more  things they can't handle and have pets and kids. 

I had a job position a few years ago that I was the direct supervisor for 20 - 60 people. I have heard it all.

Shitty people will use dogs / pets,  kids, and finances as an excuse for EVERYTHING. 

These people usually smell bad from 5-10 feet away. Their houses are usually filthy. They will often have multiple vices and make terrible financial decisions. Smoking, vaping, alcohol, drugs, energy drinks, daily store bought coffee and breakfast items, expensive vehicles they don't need.
People who live in big houses with expensive cars in the driveway but no food in the house or petrol in the vehicle.
The kind of people who litter, spit, steal, lie, cheat, and spend money recklessly LOVE to own dogs.

Until people change as a whole and governments holds bad people financial and legally responsable for the strain they place on society this problem will persist. 

A lot of countries require licences and training to have / do certain things. Dogs should 100% be one of those things.

1mj1rkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1mj1rkr/75_days/,75 days,"About a week and a half I went 75 days without coffee and no Starcarft 2. At first I was very tired and I def. felt the caffeine blues state of mind for the first days or weeks. But after I went through that, I felt much better for like 90% of the time. Sometimes it felt a bit boring but I was way more productive, more calm, much better sleep and much more benefits.   
  
The thing is I really saw the no coffee part as a challange, like I wanna go for 100 days without coffee and then drink in moderation. Then at day 75 I told myself you know what 75 is good enough.  The second day I allready binged like a madman on coffee and I was in my hyperfocus gaming mode till deep at night during a normal workweek. Telling myself, this is my last coffee tomorrow I quit so now I can also play SC2 again since it's the final coffee moment anyway (insane I know). But then the next day I feel so tired I tell myself this might not be the moment let's have a coffee. Then I drink 6 coffees and in the evening I play SC2 again because you know, I will quit tomorrow. 

I have only trained 1 time the last 1,5 week and my sleep is rubbish. I have neglected the household chores as if I can do them tomorrow when I have quit coffee but since I failed to do that yet nothing happens and I keep playing SC2.  I have 3 kids, a decent job and I don't wan't to live like this. I KNOW this is not good for me yet I keep getting back in this cycle. 

Sorry for the rant.

1mj1qts,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1mj1qts/lpt_reducing_screen_time_isnt_about_quitting_your/,"LPT: Reducing screen time isn’t about quitting your phone, it’s about getting your brain back.","I just saw someone talking about screentime and people conversing via phone even when they're sitting across each other, look, I’m not gonna say throw away your phone because let’s be real  none of us are doing that. But I hit this point where my screen time was hitting 6–7 hours a day and I couldn’t even tell you what I’d looked at. Just endless scrolling, and somehow still feeling bored. The brain rot was getting to me.

So I started messing with little things.

I pushed all my social apps off my home screen so I’d have to actually hunt for them, and apparently my brain is lazy because half the time I just don’t bother. I also stopped grabbing my phone first thing in the morning. Those first 30 minutes, I just make coffee, go sit in my balcony sip my coffee and just look at the nature then maybe talk to an actual human. like my family in my case. And when I hang out with people now, I keep my phone far away so I’m not doing that just checking one thing move every five minutes.

so basically don’t delete Insta, TikTok, or whatever you’re hooked on  just shove them into a random folder on the last page of your phone. Make it so you have to swipe a couple times to even see them.

Sounds stupid, but trust me, your brain is lazy. Half the time you’ll just think eh, can’t be bothered and move on. I did this and my screen time dropped by over an hour a day without me even trying to quit. No guilt, no dramatic I’m going off social media post… just less doomscrolling.

It’s wild how different I feel. My head’s less scrambled, I’m actually talking to people without zoning out, and I’m not spiraling into some random internet drama at 1 a.m. every night. Don’t get me wrong, I still fall into the deep scrolling on ig reels and yt shorts  hole sometimes. I’m not a monk  but now I catch myself before an entire afternoon disappears. It’s like I finally got some of my brain back, and honestly, it feels pretty damn good.",529,1754478666.0,LifeProTips,28,0.92,False

I guess I was also hoping that if I ignored it it might just go away on its own. But I'm really getting to my limit now. Its been about 2 or 3 years, and my hope that it'll go away is fading. 

I dont know how else to describe it, but I just always feel like crap. There are usually no specific or overwhelming symptoms, I just feel run down and unhealthy all the time and I don't know why. I always feel weak, low energy, like I'm constantly tired out from some mystery exersion that hasn't happened. When I'm out it usually feels like I'm walking through knee-deep mud, like getting from A to B is just a little more effort than it should be. When I'm at home, I find it hard to keep going with chores and hobbies like I've already been running around doing things for hours before I've even started. I get spells of feeling weak and completely drained where I feel the overwhelming need to sit down and catch my breath even though I haven't *done anything*. Sometimes I get kind of lightheaded for no reason, even if I'm sitting down and reading or lying on the bed, it'll just wash over me. Sometimes I get tired and woozy just walking up the stairs. 

It's not severe, it's not specific, but it's bad enough that it limits what I can do. And it's constant. Just this constant, persistent thing, like the dripping of a tap in the next room or the humming of a fridge. Quiet but it's there, you notice it. 

I don't know why this is happening to me. I have no health issues (that I know of). I eat very healthily and I have a full and balanced diet, I'm not perfect but I eat very little processed foods. I drink plenty of water, I sleep 7-8 hours every night and I seem to sleep okay- my bed is comfy and I live in an area that is dead silent at night and all the streetlights go out automatically at midnight. I don't smoke, I don't drink. I only have 2 coffees a day. I could be more active but I try to go out for at least an hour a few times a week, either for a walk or to the park or I just sit in my garden. So I get sunlight and fresh air. I'm 28 years old and I'm a very healthy weight, I do stretches every single morning and a basic weights routine. I never used to be like this, I used to be active and full of energy and life and I feel like I'm watching myself fade away. 

The only medication I take is 20mg daily of Citalopram, an SSRI, but I've felt this way since long before I started that. I had a basic blood test in December to check for deficiencies and apparently it came back totally fine. I also had an ECG at the same time which was clear of any issues. 

I'm desperately hoping someone reads this and immediately recognises or relates to how I feel and can tell me what this could be, how I can deal with it, or even just help me with what I can say to my doctor or what tests I can request. My partner has CFS and while I know everyone's symptoms are different, I don't seem to feel the same way he does. I watch what he goes through and it just doesn't seem like what I have. But I don't know. I really hope someone here can help. ",1,1754478363.0,ChronicIllness,2,1.0,False

# Stipulation award to aid alloy development, project advancement.

**To support development of a domestic scandium supply chain for U.S. defense applications, the Department of Defense has committed up to $10 million in milestone-based funding to advance engineering, drilling, and alloy qualification work at NioCorp Developments Ltd.'s Elk Creek critical minerals project in southeastern Nebraska.**

Following a spring drilling campaign to upgrade portions of its scandium and niobium resource, early-stage activity at Elk Creek accelerated ahead of a [$60.7 million equity financing in July](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/07/23/tech-metals/funding-jumpstarts-elk-creek-development/2387.html), which aimed to support expanded engineering, regulatory, and land acquisition efforts.

Shortly afterward, the company finalized the purchase of three additional land parcels required for mine infrastructure, processing operations, and road improvements.

Totaling 1.66 acres and acquired for approximately $2.7 million, two of the three parcels include both surface and mineral rights, and all are located within the core development footprint – reducing reliance on leased ground and moving the site another step closer to construction.

According to the 2022 resource estimate, Elk Creek hosts 970,300 metric tons of niobium oxide, 11,337 metric tons of scandium oxide, 4.2 million metric tons of titanium oxides, and 632,900 metric tons of total rare earth oxides, all in the higher confidence indicated resource category.

If advanced to shovel-ready status, a mine developed here would produce 7,450 metric tons of ferroniobium, 12,063 metric tons of titanium dioxide, and 104 metric tons of scandium trioxide annually over a 38-year operating life.

With site work underway, NioCorp announced Aug. 5 that DOD intends to provide up to $10 million in funding to its subsidiary, Elk Creek Resources Corp., through a Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III award designed to support the development and deployment of aluminum-scandium alloy components for defense aerospace systems.

**""We believe this award and the development of the Elk Creek Project will position the U.S. as a global leader in the mining, processing, and manufacturing of scandium and scandium alloy components for defense and essential civilian technologies,"" said NioCorp CEO Mark Smith. ""In doing so, we will greatly reduce our dangerous dependence on China and other adversarial nations for scandium and other defense-critical minerals.""**

Structured under milestone-based funding, the DPA award will involve collaboration with an unnamed U.S. prime contractor to qualify aluminum-scandium alloys for use in aircraft programs of record, hypersonic weapons systems, and other advanced platforms – targeting direct integration into propulsion systems and structural assemblies across multiple defense applications.

**""By facilitating the Elk Creek Project's advancement to construction and eventual commercial operation, this DoD award will also help America ramp up domestic production of scandium, niobium, titanium, and other critical minerals that are vital to many defense and commercial technologies and which today are almost entirely produced in China,"" added Smith.**

In addition to supporting alloy qualification and deployment, the funding is expected to enable the completion of feasibility study-level engineering, additional reserve drilling, and updated cost estimates regarding Elk Creek's development and production potential.

This, in turn, is expected to facilitate NioCorp's pursuit of project finance, including up to $800 million in debt financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM).

**Together, the award and EXIM's potential financing demonstrate an integrated whole-of-government approach to promoting domestic critical mineral production for defense and essential civilian technologies.**

**ELK CREEK, Neb. —**

A company looking to build a rare and critical earth minerals mine in Nebraska officially received a $10 million boost from a Department of Defense grant this week.

NioCorp says its mine near Elk Creek in southeast Nebraska would be the first of its kind in the U.S., which imports the vast majority of rare and critical earth minerals. It plans to produce the minerals on-site.

The company says building the mine is critical to national security. Currently, China produces the vast majority of rare and critical earth minerals. China retaliated against U.S. tariffs in part by restricting its exports of the materials.

NioCorp is using the grant primarily to help with its ongoing work to learn more about what's under the ground on the site. If it is successful, the Export-Import Bank of the United States would provide a nearly $800 million loan to allow NioCorp to begin building the mine.

""Pricing certainty means companies and investors are less exposed to volatile markets and prices, which are opaque and prone to manipulation,"" King said.

The support comes as prices for some metals such as rare earths have been too low to fund processing capacity in Western countries, keeping China on top as remained the world's dominant supplier.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. – L3Harris Technologies' [Aerojet Rocketdyne](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2025/04/16/aerojets-president-talks-new-approach-to-making-rocket-motors/) officially opened a new and expansive rocket motor parts plant in Huntsville, Alabama, in a ceremony Monday, which marks another clear step in the defense industrial base's work to drastically increase production capacity for munitions in the U.S.

With some machines already installed across the periphery of the vast, but still empty floorspace, the Advanced Manufacturing Facility – South (AMF-South) is poised to surge production of inert parts for solid rocket motors in a facility the size of six football fields (roughly 379,000 square feet). These parts include components like cases, nozzles, exit cones and aft closures.

Within 24 months of L3Harris acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne, it invested over $20 million to bring the facility to life and additional funding from a Defense Production Act agreement helped pay for additional equipment and tooling.

The agreement between the company and the U.S. government is to increase rocket propulsion manufacturing capacity in the continental U.S. to keep pace with the rising global demand for tactical and strategic missile production.

The new facility has already begun to build parts for the Standard Missile, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System and the Javelin antitank weapon and plans to expand to other programs requiring solid rocket motors in the future, Scott Alexander, L3Harris' missile solutions president, said at the event. The plan is to continue to add capability to the floorspace as demand increases.

https://preview.redd.it/c5d9wimfsdhf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ff013ad029b23aa3c6f69cc2718d1098f4bea

While the company has already hired 40 manufacturing employees, there is a plan to bring on another hundred in the coming years.

The new facility comes in addition to the company's 136,00 square foot Advanced Manufacturing Facility in Northern, Huntsville, dubbed AMF-North. Opened in 2019, it covers the production of inert parts for larger solid rocket motors.

In addition to L3Harris' Huntsville expansion, it is also rapidly building out large manufacturing facilities in [Camden, Arkansas](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2025/02/20/l3harris-breaks-ground-on-solid-rocket-motor-production-expansion/), and [Orange County, Virginia.,](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/05/22/l3harris-breaks-ground-on-new-rocket-motor-plant-in-virginia/) to cover the entire gamut of solid rocket motor production.

While AMF-North and AMF-South focus on inert parts, the company broke ground on a new production facility to make energetics for rocket motors in Camden, Arkansas, earlier this year, and construction is underway to build out production for small and medium motors - key components for the Javelin.

Across the board, L3Harris is redesigning how it produces solid rocket motors, driving into that design more flexibility and the ability to surge and produce at scale. The company is also working to introduce new methods to achieve a drastically higher production rate.

""We spend a lot of time talking about the mobilization of the \[defense\] industrial base. This is exactly what we need,"" Maj. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army's program executive officer for missiles and space, said at the event.

""When you hear senior leaders across the nation talking about increasing capacity, increasing throughput, increasing missile and munition inventory levels; when you hear people talking about getting on a war footing, understanding the threats and the adversaries that we face on a daily basis; when we talk about all of these things, this is the manifestation of that outcome,"" he said.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# ****The bottom Line & for consideration...

**""IF""**\- NioCorp executes on its current trajectory, it won’t just be *another* supplier — it will be the **flagship U.S. source** for multiple critical minerals at once, **uniquely DFARS-compliant**, and aligned with both defense and clean energy priorities. That would make it **indispensable** to the U.S. industrial base and its allies going into 2028 and beyond. 

 **NioCorp Developments Ltd. represents the emerging model for a fully U.S.-based, vertically integrated critical minerals supplier**. With a single, highly permitted site in Nebraska, NioCorp is advancing toward production of **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium (and TiCl₄), and Heavy/Light Rare Earths** — all vital for hypersonics, aerospace alloys, SMRs, EVs, and permanent magnets used across defense and commercial platforms.

The company has distributed mineral samples to national labs (AMES), defense-linked programs (such as Project Pivot), and aerospace innovators (Boeing U.K. & IBC), and has confirmed active talks with both government and private-sector buyers. Its current infill drilling campaign (completing August 2025) and forthcoming DFS (Q4 2025?) could significantly expand projected output — positioning it to begin construction in May 2026?? and production by mid-2028 **(all T.B.D. Pending finance!)**. 

**With no foreign ownership**, full DFARS compliance, and a diversified critical mineral portfolio tailored to strategic U.S. supply chain needs, **NioCorp is on track to become a premiere, Tier #1 flagship supplier** — not only to U.S. defense contractors, but to the broader industrial and allied base as geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions intensify.

The company stands at the inflection point of federal funding eligibility, potential offtake agreements, and strategic investment interest. If financing and agreements fall into place over the coming year, **NioCorp could emerge as the most secure and scalable U.S. alternative to Chinese and transitional supply chains**

Why?

Because this one had it all. Like *literally* all....**10-stage purification**, **RO + UV + UF + Alkaline + Copper**, **In-tank UV**, **2 years of no service cost**, and a name that sounds like a skincare product.

Let’s break it down like the overthinking human I am.

# What You Actually Get

* **10-Stage Filtration** – RO + UV + UF + Copper + Alkaline + Sediment + Carbon + Magic?? (They don’t break it all down clearly, but it’s doing a LOT behind the scenes.)
* **In-Tank UV Sterilisation** – Kills germs even after the water is stored. Smart move.
* **RO + UF Combo** – Extra layer of safety, especially if your TDS is crazy.
* **Copper & Alkaline Cartridge** – Supposedly boosts immunity, balances pH, adds taste. Feels like a wellness bonus, even if science is still catching up.
* **7L Storage** – Okay for families, manageable for singles/couples.
* **No Service Cost for 2 Years** – This one is HUGE. Filters *included*. You just need to schedule the free services.

# Things I Liked (No Bias, Just Brain Fog)

**No More Paying for Filters** – 2 years of peace of mind. That alone makes this worth considering. Most brands charge ₹3-4K a year for replacements.

**Water tastes surprisingly good** – Smooth, slightly sweet, no metallic tinge. The copper + alkaline does *something*. Not placebo-y.

**In-tank UV is a win** – Especially if you leave the purifier off for a bit or live in a warm city. No more stale-tasting water.

**Looks premium** – Matte black finish, nice curves, doesn’t scream “I’m here for bacteria”.

**Copper + Alkaline = health flex** – If you’re into wellness, this is a nice touch. If you’re not, it still doesn’t hurt.

# Stuff That Gave Me Pause

**7L feels…** ***just enough*** – Okay for daily use, but you’ll refill faster during peak summer or with guests.

**No digital TDS display** – Come on, Livpure. If you’re going all out, at least let us see the nerdy numbers.

**Installation experience varies** – Mine was decent. Others on Amazon said their technician ghosted them. Follow up like your life depends on it.

**No app, no smart features** – Not a big deal, but other purifiers in this price bracket are getting “smarter.”

# Should You Buy It?

If you’re tired of:

* Paying for filters every 8 months
* Debating whether copper/alkaline benefits are real
* Drinking boring, flat RO water
* Switching water sources and needing something *versatile*

Then yes, this purifier is kinda brilliant.  
It’s low-maintenance, well-rounded, and gives you a *feeling* of wellness... even if you’re still living off Maggi and iced coffee.

One day you're scanning barcodes and standing in lines, and the next you’re just picking something up and walking out while it charges you automatically.

AI vending machines and smart fridges are already around in more places than people think. You open the door, take your item, and that’s it. No buttons, no scanning. Just sensors and cameras doing the work.

Autonomous checkout is slowly becoming normal too. Cameras watch what you pick up, shelf sensors track movement, and by the time you’re ready to leave, everything is already added to your bill. No cashier, no scanning, no waiting.

Smart sensing is another thing changing the game. Stores are using AI to see which shelves are running low, understand which areas get more foot traffic, and even decide how to arrange products better. It’s not flashy tech. It just works quietly in the background.

What I observe:

There’s a small store near my office that added an AI-powered fridge and smart checkout. I didn’t notice anything special at first. I grabbed a cold coffee, walked to the front, and the screen already had my item listed. I just tapped my card and walked out. It was fast and smooth. That’s when I realized this is probably what shopping will look like everywhere soon.

What’s interesting is that people are getting used to it quickly. AI isn’t just a big tech thing anymore. It’s slowly becoming part of everyday stuff. It helps stores work better, save time, and avoid mistakes.

Feels like in a couple of years, we’ll be shopping in fully AI-run stores without even thinking about it.

Khalid Ayyad was born under the hot, honey‑gold sun of a small seaside town in the Iberian Peninsula—Lisbon, to be precise. He was the third child of a modest family that had migrated from the historic city of Tunis to Portugal a few years earlier, hoping to stitch a new future for their kids among the old tiles, narrow alleys, and the faint scent of grilled sardines that rose from the waterfront markets.

Even as a child, Khalid’s world was a kaleidoscope of languages. His mother whispered in Tunisian Arabic at home, his father answered in Portuguese at the bakery where he worked as a baker’s apprentice, and the schoolkids—Marta, João, Aisha—raced through the schoolyard yelling in Portuguese, Catalan, and an occasional dash of French. Khalids early days were a perpetual dance of tongues, each one unlocking a new window into the world.

\---

\### Chapter 1: The Quiet Harbor of Lisbon

\#### The Neighborhood

In the narrow, sun‑warmed streets of the Graça district, Khalid’s family lived in a modest apartment at the top of a hill that overlooked the Tagus River. From his bedroom window, he watched the orange‑hued ferries come and go, each carrying sailors, tourists, and, more importantly for a boy at that age, a sense of endless possibility.

Every day after school, he hurried to his favourite hide‑out: an old, half‑ruined lighthouse perched on the edge of the city’s western coastline. There he would sit on a chipped stone bench, listening to the sea’s steady rhythm, while his mind fluttered between his dreams and his reality.

\#### The First Heartbeat

At fifteen, a girl named Ekaterina “Katya” Volkova came into his life like a gust of wind from a far‑away winter. The girl had been born in Saint Petersburg, her family moving to Portugal when she was ten because her mother had won a prestigious academic scholarship in Lisbon. Katya's dark hair was always tossed in a messy bun, her eyes a cold amber that mirrored the snowy skies of her homeland. She spoke Russian at home, but in school she could switch to Portuguese, English, even a dash of Italian—thanks to her love for opera.

Khalid, who had never previously met anyone so fluent in so many languages, was instantly fascinated. He began listening to the way her voice modulated when she recited poetry in Russian; he felt the melody of her language echoing in his own heart. They met under the lighthouse, where she’d practice piano on a makeshift keyboard (the old lighthouse had a cracked piano left there by an old sailor). They exchanged simple phrases—\*""Olá,""\*—\*""Привет,""\*—in the same breath—and it felt like the world was narrowing down to just two voices.

\#### The “Jinjer” Boy

Khalid’s life, however, was not only painted with roses. By the time he was sixteen, another boy entered his universe, a boy named Marco “Jin” Jinkowski—nicknamed “Jin” by friends because of his sharp, almost mischievous smile that seemed to flash with an inner fire. Marco was the son of a Polish–Portuguese family that had migrated to Lisbon after a stint in the Netherlands. He came with a reputation for being the “bad boy” of the block—his quick, cunning mind always on the edge of a prank or a rivalry, and the name “Jin” had become a moniker tied to the way he’d “jingle” through school corridors—ever the schemer, always the challenger.

Their rivalry started over a seemingly mundane argument about a borrowed guitar. The instrument had passed hands—Khalid had borrowed it from a fellow student, only to find it had been claimed by Marco, who then claimed it had been promised to him after a night’s party. The two boys exchanged heated words in Portuguese, a language that seemed to crack with their anger:

\> “\*\*É tua!\*\*” shouted Khalid, his voice cracking.

\> “\*\*Não, é meu!\*\*” Marco retorted, his eyes flashing.

The conflict grew from a simple dispute to a deeper clash of values. Khalid—who had always believed in kindness, patience, and the harmony of languages—clashed with Marco’s reckless disregard for the feelings of others. Marco’s nicknames, his swagger, the way he seemed to flaunt his own identity, turned into a source of hatred for Khalid, who began to feel anger deep within. For a time, it seemed he could never see beyond the hostility.

He began avoiding the lighthouse where he and Katya would meet. He avoided the school corridor where Marco would flash that quick, dangerous grin. The friendship that had been sparked by a love for music, books, and an infinite curiosity about the world now seemed threatened by a boy who simply made it easier to feed a bitter resentment. The world was not black and white; yet his heart had become locked in a shade of gray.

\---

\### Chapter 2: Love, Music, and the Storm of Youth

\#### A Song from the Heart

One cool evening as October’s chill brushed the streets of Lisbon, the entire town seemed to gather around the small town theatre for a charity concert. Khalid, in his teenage years, was tasked with serving as the main coordinator of the event—thanks to his role in the bakery and his growing reputation as a dependable “jardiner,” a term for a caretaker who helped with décor.

Katya was to perform a simple lullaby of an old Russian folk song, yet she decided to blend the tune with Portuguese Fado, creating a melancholy yet hopeful melody. She rehearsed in the courtyard, and the sound drifted across the neighborhood. It was here that the tension of the rivalry boiled over. As Katya sang with a trembling voice that carried over the street, a sudden ruckus—Marco's angry shriek, a stolen guitar, shouting in three languages—broke the stillness.

The concert's lights dimmed, the crowd's hush was broken. Yet, the moment that seemed meant to shatter changed. Katya turned, her eyes glinting with a strange mixture of tears and iron will. She paused the melody, turned to the audience, and said in half Portuguese, half Russian, “\*\*We can be strangers or we can speak.\*\*” That single phrase—half a lament, half an invitation—seemed to hold the entire story of a multilingual, multicultural, conflicting world inside a single breath.

Khalid heard the words, and his heart began to thaw a little bit. He realized that maybe the anger, the ""hate"" he had felt toward Marco, was no more than the confusion of being a boy who has never experienced a true clash of language, culture, or personal identity— he lacked a tool to talk through the feelings. At that moment, he resolved not to let hatred guide his future. He decided his feelings for Katya should not rely on his hatred toward a single boy. It didn't have to be a love story that had to become a tale of revenge.

\#### The Storm

The next morning, Khalid approached a small cafe near his home—Café das Luzes—a place that had become a sanctuary for people who were traveling: an old Portuguese couple who would discuss politics; a young couple who had moved from Angola; the bartender who had fled from Angola during the civil war. Their stories, woven like the fabric of a woven tapestry, made Khalid feel the weight and beauty of the world. It was there that he met a young professor of linguistics, Dr. Elisa Montet, who had just moved from Paris.

El Elisa, with her warm smile and accent that wavered between French and Portuguese, had a special interest in how languages could heal emotional wounds. She offered to teach Khalid the French language—an addition to his language collage that already included Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. Through months of lessons at the cafe's side table, with the clink of coffee cups and the soft hum of radio, Khalid slowly learned French—pockets of  “Bonjour, comment ça va?” and “Je suis d’accord.” The new language opened a doorway that helped him see the world beyond the narrow street and its familiar faces, a chance to understand and maybe even forgive.

\---

\### Chapter 3: From Lisbon to Brussels

\#### The Chance to Move

Three years after the café’s night of the lullaby, a massive turning point arrived. The bakery where Khalid's father worked received a lucrative contract to supply premium pastries to a famous chocolate shop in Brussels—Belgium’s capital, renowned for its chocolate, its architecture, its canals. The contract, with its promising salaries and a new chapter, came with the decision for the whole Ayyad family to move—two continents away from the familiar sea.

Khalid was now twenty, his hair more wavy, his eyes deepened by the storms of adolescence. He felt the tug of past feelings—an intense love for Katya, a lingering bitterness toward Marco (now in his consciousness as a reminder of the power that anger can hold). In his suitcase he placed a handful of Arabic and Portuguese letters, some old photographs, and a single, battered Ukrainian violin (gift from Katya) that had remained a talisman.

In Brussels, the Ayyad family opened a small bakery near the grand-iose Atomium, but to pay rent they needed to learn the language of the city—French—because the local, multicultural community responded with a love for French pastries. The bakery's sign read “Boulangerie Ayyad—Tradition et Moderne”, and it quickly became a hub for the locals, who liked the mixture of Arab flavors with Portuguese recipes, served in french-finished pastries.

Khalid’s French turned from basic to fluid. He started using the phrase “je vais bien,” i.e., “I’m fine” - a phrase that represented his own internal state: “well”—despite his history. Every time a client smiled, he felt a piece of his soul “speak” in French and be understood, and the old hatred dissolved more like a mist that had a place in the past but not the present.

\#### New Friendships

When Khalid arrived in Brussels, he met a group of young international students from an International School of Brussels. Among them were:

\- \*\*Lorenzo\*\*, an Italian who loved skateboarding,

\- \*\*Mia\*\*, a Hungarian student who studied architecture,

\- \*\*Mounir\*\*, a fellow Arabic-speaking who was an aspiring writer,

\- \*\*Alex\*\* a French‑Bristol expatriate who was into cycling.

The group’s most important member, to Khalid's heart, was \*\*Anna\*\*, a Russian student who was studying French literature. Anna was from Moscow but grew up in the suburbs of Brussels. Their love grew out of curiosity: she would ask him about his Arabic roots, his Portuguese upbringing, his love for Portuguese Fado, and his dream of composing a piece that merged the Arabic Oud, Portuguese guitar, and the Russian balalaika. The two spent evenings at the grand place, the stone squares illuminated by the glowing lanterns, sharing stories in an improvised mixture of Russian, Arabic, Portuguese, French, and a little English for fun. The city, with its diverse languages, served as a tapestry where each thread, each story, wove into a larger harmonious piece.

\#### The Girl from Moscow

When Khalid walked to his new job at the bakery, often a girl in red would sit at his table, sip a coffee and read a book about French novels. She called herself \*\*Anastasia\*\*—a Russian girl whose parents had fled from Moscow during the late 2010s crisis. She moved to Belgium for a graduate program. Her eye color, a mix of the icy Russian north and an inner fire, reminded Khalid of Katya in some ways—she seemed to be the same soul, but this time he was not in Lisbon. He realized love can repeat itself across continents, and his heart opened again. However, this time the narrative had learned patience, empathy and compassion.

\---

\### Chapter 4: Healing and Identity

\#### Reconciliation

One early summer morning, while Khalid was putting fresh almond croissants onto a wooden tray, an unexpected figure entered the bakery: Marco “Jin” Jinkowski had arrived. The years had changed Marco’s visage; the rebellious youth had matured into a quiet gentleman. He had moved to Brussels to work as an architect, using his knack for design and his unique ability to blend cultures in the buildings he created. He had come to seek out Khalid because the bread that Khalid’s father baked reminded him of home, and his heart wanted to make peace. He approached Khalid with a smile, and said in Portuguese and French: “\*\*Je suis désolé pour tout.\*\*”

Khalid, who had grown as a young adult—who had learned to speak many languages and who had learned that his identity was not defined by one single hate or love—just nodded and said, “\*\*It’s okay. We’re all learning.\*\*”

The bakery’s bell rang, and the moment felt like the final chord in a long, complex song. In the quiet of early morning, Khalid realized that the hatred he once felt toward a particular boy is no longer necessary. He realized that his heart—once anchored in the narrow lanes of Lisbon, then tossed in the seas of grief—has now found a stable place in the multicultural, multilingual city of Brussels. He is now speaking French, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, a few slivers of Polish and English—all at once.

\---

\### Epilogue: The Music That Connects

In the years that followed, Khalid published a collection of poems titled \*“Les Quatre Langues du Cœur”\* (“The Four Languages of the Heart”). Each poem was written in a different language, and each ending line was a blend of two languages: an echo of his Arabic heritage, a dash of Portuguese warmth, Russian melancholy, French romance.

He was never able to fully forget the pain of his youth, but his story had changed. In the final verse of his first poem, he wrote:

\> \*“From the salty water of Lisbon to the bright canals of Brussels,

\> my heart has traversed.

\> In Arabic: \*قُدِّيتُ فَصَفًا\* (I have walked alone)

\> In Portuguese: \*Mudei, Mas Não Esqueci.\* (I moved, but I haven't forgotten)

\> In Russian: \*Мы вечно ищем\* (we are forever seeking).

Just a thought that came to me today. 

I'm talking about the iconic wallpaper, when you search for ""destiny 2 beyond light wallpaper"" with the guardian sitting in front of the pyramid. 

I love the game so much for it's beautiful world. It ticks every box for me + the phenomenal gameplay. That's why I'm here since D1 Beta non stop. 

Now 3 weeks in The Edge of Fate, I just - although obvious - realised, how much I miss the ""world"" aspect of this game while drinking my morning coffee in front of this wallpaper.

I like the part of the Portal that let's me get ""usefull"" loot, while not needing to play the most recent activity (sadly there is also not really one) over and over. I just did, what I thought, I have the most fun with and made it to 320. But it is really starting to feel ""off"" day by day. I am now just engaging with an interface instead of ""the world"" they build over 10 years. 

Do you feel the same? ",4,1754477329.0,DestinyTheGame,4,0.75,False

**Subject:** Quarterly Report Feedback

""Write a professional email to my colleague about the quarterly report. Sound enthusiastic but not fake. Mention that I've reviewed the numbers and they look great. Ask about the timeline for the presentation. Keep it under 100 words. Make me sound smart but approachable. Also I had coffee with him last week so reference that casually. His name is Nipurn.""

Hey Nipurn! Hope you're doing well after our coffee chat last week...

I've been wondering why Rahul's emails suddenly got so much better 😂

 I replied with ""Prompt received. Generating response..."" and he hasn't responded for 3 hours.

He just knocked on my office door looking panicked asking if I got his ""weird email."" I told him ChatGPT wrote a great response and now he's asking me to teach him how to use it properly.

This has apparently been going on company-wide. Our HR director just sent an email that was CLEARLY ChatGPT (started with ""I hope this email finds you well"" and had bullet points with perfect spacing). The AI revolution is here and it's in our inbox.

I've been using ChatGPT for emails too. We're all just AI puppets at this point.

I would like to start a business selling cheesecakes and would love any advice/tips. I have done lots of cheesecakes for friends/family but am unable to sell at this time due to cottage law. My ultimate dream would be to have a bakery that allows my community to feel safe and comfortable. During the morning/day I would like to offer a quiet space for people to work/relax while enjoying some coffee and savory/breakfast themed cheesecakes. At this time I would offer bread/donuts/bagels/whatever I feel with the “pay what you can” concept so everyone feels welcome and can be fed. The afternoon/evening would become more lively, offering customizable mini cheesecakes & mocktails. I would like to do different cheesecake bases (plain, cookies and cream, peanut butter, etc) and then allow the customer to choose their toppings. I would offer these in the count of 3, 6, & 12. Still speaking in the aspect of dreams, I would like to have live music during the evenings and allow artists to display their work to bring the community together as much as possible. 

Now that I’m done dreaming, to start this there seems to be a couple options and I need help figuring out what would be the best choice or what other options I may not be aware of. I cannot sell from home. 

1. Online orders + rent kitchen space
Pros: cheapest option
Cons: little sense of community, difficult to transport product, possibility of issues from other products in shared kitchen

2. Food truck + rent kitchen space
Pros: customer facing, ability to transport
Cons: still unable to have full sense of community without physical space, have to pay for both truck and rent space

3. Rent storefront
Pros: ability to have community and feel fulfilled living out my vision, have my own space to freely use at any hours without worrying about others, easier to prep.
Cons: cost

Any tips or additions to pros/cons for these options would be so appreciated. Thank you!!!

It's like having a productivity consultant optimize every aspect of your life:

**1. Ask ""What's my frog for this project?""**

Tracy's most famous concept. Identifies the one task that will make everything else easier. ""I'm overwhelmed with my business launch. What's my frog for this project?"" AI cuts through the chaos to find your highest-impact activity.

**2. Say ""Help me ABCDE prioritize this situation""**

Tracy's famous method: A=Must do, B=Should do, C=Nice to do, D=Delegate, E=Eliminate. ""I have 15 things on my plate. Help me ABCDE prioritize this situation."" AI becomes your personal productivity consultant.

**3. Say ""What would happen if I doubled my speed on this?""**

The velocity mindset shift. Tracy taught that fast tempo creates momentum and confidence. ""I'm writing a report and it's taking forever. What would happen if I doubled my speed on this?"" AI finds ways to accelerate without sacrificing quality.

**4. Add ""Help me create a systematic approach to this goal""**

Tracy's secret weapon was turning everything into a repeatable system. ""I want to network more effectively. Help me create a systematic approach to this goal."" AI builds step-by-step processes that guarantee results.

**5. Ask ""What skills do I need to develop to earn twice as much in this area?""**

The continuous improvement prompt. Tracy believed your income is directly tied to your skill development. ""I'm stuck at my current salary level. What skills do I need to develop to earn twice as much in this area?"" AI creates your personal development roadmap.

**6. Use ""How can I practice single-handling on this task?""**

The focus multiplier. Tracy proved that multitasking kills productivity. ""I keep getting distracted while writing. How can I practice single-handling on this task?"" AI designs distraction-proof work sessions.

**7. Say ""What are the natural consequences if I don't complete this?""**

The motivation amplifier. When procrastination strikes, this prompt creates urgency through clarity. ""I keep putting off my tax preparation. What are the natural consequences if I don't complete this?"" AI makes the stakes crystal clear.

**8. Add ""How can I prepare more thoroughly for this outcome?""**

Tracy's preparation principle. Success comes from thinking through every detail in advance. ""I have a job interview next week. How can I prepare more thoroughly for this outcome?"" AI creates comprehensive preparation strategies.

**9. Ask ""What would I do differently if I had to complete this in half the time?""**

The efficiency breakthrough prompt. Forces creative solutions and eliminates time-wasting activities. ""This project usually takes me 2 weeks. What would I do differently if I had to complete this in half the time?"" AI finds your productivity shortcuts.

The power comes from Tracy's insight that success is predictable when you follow proven systems. These prompts automate his decades of productivity research.

**Plot twist:** Chain them for maximum efficiency. ""What's my frog here? What would happen if I doubled my speed?"" It's like having Brian Tracy personally audit your entire workflow.

These prompts make AI think like the world's most systematic productivity expert.
