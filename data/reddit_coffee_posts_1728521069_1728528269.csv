This an attempt at creating my own reddit cheating story. It did turn out longer than I intended. Mights have gotten cared away with details. So I will be posting in multiple parts. I hope its enjoyable. Be gentle. 

  
**My girlfriend of one year cheated on me. I never predicted what would happen next.**  


This story takes place over the course of several years. So it’s a bit long. Please be patient with me.

So, before I go into this story I need to lay out some history in order to create some context. Pretty much my entire life I have suffered from bad depression and social anxiety. I am now 38, but when I was 30 I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it is a personality disorder that results in someone having a very hard time regulating their emotions. It’s believed to have stemmed from some form of childhood trauma or abandonment. It usually results in impulsive behavior, emotional outbursts, a lack of self identity and a pattern of unhealthy and unstable relationships, be it friends or romantic relationships. For those of you who do know what it is, please don’t villainize it. I can guarantee you that whoever you knew that had it has been struggling emotionally far longer than you know. And also more than likely severely regrets whatever they did in order to ruin the relationship. They more than likely have not reached out to mend things because of embarrassment or a fear of rejection.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, onto the story. So I met Sarah roughly 4 years ago. My friend Ali, who I had not talked to in several years, had reached out and wanted to check in on me. I was surprised since I was just under the assumption they were tired of my mood swings and decided to cut me out of their lives for good. She wanted to know how I was doing and if I wanted to come to a party they were having at their place this weekend. We talked for a bit and I let her know things had been a bit rough. 

At this point my depression was so bad that I never did anything except go to work and come home. I did not talk to anyone or hangout with anyone. I was all alone. So at the urging of my therapist, I accepted the invitation. 

That weekend Ali’s husband, James, came and picked me up and took me back to their place. The party had not started yet, but there were a few familiar faces, and there was definitely one I had never seen before. It was Sarah. Now right off the bat I was very intimidated by her, because she was absolutely gorgeous! I mean in my head she was miles out of my league. Everyone I knew was happy to see me and they all gave me hugs, it felt good, but awkward. I was introduced to Sarah. She was a friend of someone I knew and it was actually her first time at Ali and Jame’s house. She looked at me, smiled and said hi. I said hi back but then quickly looked away. I was too nervous. After a little while more people showed up and the party was underway. 

Now everyone I knew drank, and to excess. But I had quit drinking years before. So being basically the only sober person at the party was…well weird and a bit uncomfortable. See I’m not a fan of small, cramped and loud spaces. And that’s what the inside of their house felt like. So after a while, when I was feeling overwhelmed, I stepped outside and sat at a table in their backyard. After about 10 minutes or so of trying to decompress, I heard the door open and then close. I turned to see who it was, and it was Sarah. She walked up to the table and asked if she could join me. I was super nervous, and sadly, a bit skeptical. My past relationships, platonic and romantic, had left me constantly on edge and a bit mistrusting. But I said it was no problem and she sat down. She asked me how I knew everyone, and I told her I have known Ali since I was 18, and I met everyone through her. But we don't talk as much these days. She asked me why, but I deflected the question. We just continued to sit there talking. The longer it went on, the more relaxed I was becoming. After what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually an hour, Ali came out to see where I had gone and found me and Sarah talking. She asked if everything was okay and I told her it was, I just was decompressing from feeling overstimulated inside. After that Sarah excused herself and went inside. I followed shortly after.

I stayed at the party until about midnight. That was when my social meter just hit zero, and I had to head home. Everyone else was drunk, so I needed to call an Uber to take me home. I said my goodbyes to anyone who was coherent enough to understand, and I stepped out front to wait for my ride. I didn’t even notice but Sarah came up from behind and sat down next to me. She asked what I was doing, so I told her. I commented on how she didn’t seem as drunk as everyone else. She explained that while she did drink, she wasn’t a real heavy drinker. This immediately appealed to me. We kept talking until my Uber showed up. I told her to have a good night and went home. 

The next day I was off work, just sitting at home drinking my coffee when I got a text. Which was weird because I never got texts. And what was weirder was that it was a number I didn’t know. Turns out it was Sarah. She said she enjoyed talking to me, so she got my number from Ali. Again I was skeptical of her. Why would she want to talk to me? I was no one interesting or special. I didn’t get it. 

I responded and we just spent the next hour or so texting back and forth just talking about nothing. I had noticed the night before that she just seemed like someone who was really easy to talk to, and it was only proven today. So over the course of the next several weeks this became a daily thing. We would text back and forth most of the day. Eventually she asked if I wanted to go grab a coffee sometime. I reluctantly agreed. We met up at a local cafe and spent the next two hours just talking and laughing. It was during this conversation that my BPD got brought up. She told me that she actually had an aunt who had BPD, and she understood how difficult it is to live with. That made me feel relieved. She told me about how things had been a bit rough for her lately as well. Her apartment ended up having black mold, so she had to move out. But then she was laid off from her job. So she was staying with her mom till she got back on her feet. 

So, Sarah and I became fast friends. Now, I have a problem where when a pretty girl shows me positive attention, I tend to over analyze and overthink everything. And I definitely did that with Sarah. I had developed this huge crush on her, and it was probably very obvious. And between my constantly shifting emotions and the overthinking things, I from time to time would have breakdowns. It had been three months since Sarah and I had met. And that is when my breakdowns tend to happen the most. And like clockwork, they did. I would get jealous of other guys, but keep it to myself. I would think that her and other people were only spending time with me because they had pity for me. That she was talking bad about me behind my back. 

One day Sarah could see that I was feeling extra emotional that day. She asked me what was wrong and I told her it was nothing. She insisted I talk about it. And after some back and forth I gave in. I told her about all the thoughts and feelings I was having. I left out the part about me having a crush on her, but other than that, I spilled my purse out on her doorstep. After I was done she kind of just sat there staring at me. It went on for what felt like forever. Then she reached out and pulled me in for a huge hug. It kinda freaked me out and tried to jump back, but she just grabbed me and pulled me in tightly. She told me that she would never do that to me and she knew that what I was feeling was not my actual feelings, but my trauma coming to the surface. Now, if I didn’t have a crush on this girl before, I certainly did now!

He is extremely health/looks conscious. I was quite fit when I met him with a PT. I can no longer afford this. He has made multiple comments in the past in regard to my body.

For context, when we first got together 4 years ago we both agreed that we don't want the other to let ourselves go (as in get obese as our previous partners have).
Anyways, I have since had a child and I now have loose skin around my stomach which is normal. I have also been on some birth control that the doctor told me ""would definitely make me gain at least 3kg"". I am a stay at home mum and student. i was working a full time job when we met and had no kids. Now due to my less active lifestyle being at home a lot I have gained around 6-7kg since we first met 4 years ago.

My partners mother is a 'almond-mum' and has also commented on my weight as well as my families weight. She called me fat when I was pregnant (that my bump was too large) She has had a huge impact on my partner and his thoughts around 'bodies'. She is ultra fit/vegan/eats no junk food, does marathons. I would say I am slightly above average weight for my height (since having a baby).

My partner is fit, doesn't eat refined sugar or junk food or caffeine. He has committed to this for the past 2 years. I still eat stuff with sugar and love my coffee however I don't think i go overboard with them.

Partner has made comments for as long as I can remember about my appearance. He said when I was breastfeeding and had larger boobs. ""You're more attractive like that"". In the past he comments on my portion size of food at dinner if it is not smaller than his. He will show a look of distaste if I ever said I wanted to get an icecream from Maccas for dessert. For 1 year now I have cut out McDonald's/KFC from my diet because of his comments. When I was pregnant he didn't believe me when I said I had cravings. He said ""it's just you who wants it"".

I have attempted to go to the gym out of self-hatred fueled by his comments. I was going every second day, my partner was really happy. I used to have a eating disorder when I was young. I showed my partner the pics of me when I looked extremely under-weight with my bones popping out. He said ""it looks good"". I ended up falling off the gym wagon as it was fueled by negative thoughts about myself. That was a month ago.

Today, we had a blow up. We were at the store and I was trying on clothes. Two items were too tight and he said ""you need to lose weight for that"". It's our anniversary today.
This has been an ongoing issue I have brought up to him multiple times. It's had me crying a lot in bed today as he said 'you broke your promise' meaning the promise we made to 'not get obese' which I am not. My question is, is he actually concerned for my health (we are also trying for another child) or is it just for looks? Reaching my wits end and really feeling like I want to break up with him.

Should I tell him? Even though I've been 10 months clean.

Long story incoming/something to get off my chest and onto 'paper'


My parents got divorced when I was 12. My mom moved pretty far away and I used to live with my dad. I've had a relatively normal childhood despite this I feel like. My parents used to fight and be awkward for the first few years (since my mom cheated on my dad).

My little brother and older sister were struggling really bad with this when we were younger, they both seeked professional help and they have given it a place in their lives. I on the other hand was never busy with any of this and just lived my life all the way up to when I was 21 years old and moved out of the house to live on my own. I was doing fine, listened to a lot of psychedilic rock music with my friends. They had done a lot of shrooms and acid and whatnot previously and I up until that moment in my life had never used any drugs. I was super curious and used acid with them once, 1 tab, in a forest where we rented a small cabin. It was the most magical experience ever!

I should have left it here. This was not the case. I started using acid one day a month at first, then once a week and finally I started upping the doses from a single 100ug tab to multiple tabs at 500ug total. This was over a course of 2 years. I also tried some shrooms and 3mmc in that time.

Mentally I was doing really bad. Work was not going well, I started to distance myself from everyone in my life and I was using alot of acid. My brain was completely fogged and I was getting super depressed. In that time I also broke up with my then girlfriend and I started using more.

Then one day. When I took the 500ug dose I had an ego death. My soul left my body, and i started evaluating my whole life. I came to the conclusion I missed my mom throughout my childhood and I never gave that a place in my life. The next day when I was sober I called up my mom, met her for coffee soon after and had a really good talk with her about the whole situation. Told her everything! The drugs, the problems I've had and we talked it all out. She also missed me in her life and we are actually meeting up alot more and include each other in our day to day. My brother and sister also know this all and I've talked to them both about this.

That day I used the 500ug was the last day I've used any drugs. This was 10 months ago. My mind has never been this clear before and I feel at total peace with myself and my past situation.

My dad however, I've never said a word about any of this ever. Despite him being the closest person in my life. I keep having this feeling in me that I need to tell him my story aswell. I don't want to keep him out of the loop. Another side of me says I shouldn't tell him, I'm through the bad situation and I will never use drugs again.

What do you guys think is the best option? I'm kinda scared I might hurt my dad emotionally. But i feel like it is something I should tell him.",1,1728527797.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

And it's always something super random, like recently it was rotisserie chicken skin, the other time it was overcooked pasta of a specific shape that I don't remember the name of. It's not that I actually feel this taste, but it's like I expect to feel it. Like I just took a bite of that specific food or see it in front of me and am anticipating this taste or texture in my mouth. And it's literally almost all I can think about at the moment. I'm imagining how I'm eating that food, imagining in the most flattering almost p*rnographic detail. The only thing that helps is distracting myself for a long enough time with studies or drinking something caffeinated, ideally black coffee.

I don't know what might cause it. People say that something similar happens when you're vitamin deficient, but my bloods were fine and I honestly don't think that between my binging and psychotic orthorexia I have any deficiencies. I have also had trouble with periods where I only recently got one after two years of them missing (not entirely weight related, I've been weight restored for over half a year), so maybe it's something hormonal, but I've done hormonal panels in the past and there was nothing abysmal there either. And with my 200 mg of Zoloft and 200 mg of Topamax combined I should really not be having this problem.

I f’d up this morning having not enough coffee yet and ended up deleting a datacenter when I meant to delete just a couple of VMs (we’ve all been there, right? RIGHT?!?). This was a “remote” site with a 2-node cluster and around 20 VMs, however it also was a vSAN one with a remote witness. The removal of course removed the witness and about half of the VMs ended up unresponsive.  Pretty sure my pulse about doubled when I saw the ‘delete datacenter’ task in the console. 

So after taking a few calming breaths and letting the rest of the team know I made a boo boo, I engaged support with a critical ticket. Within 15 minutes, I was working with an incredibly helpful storage expert and we were able to recreate the cluster and get things back up in another half hour. No data loss, no additional outages, no ‘sfc /scannow’. 

Been in this field for over 20 years and it’s humbling that no one is immune from the occasional mistake…you just have to be honest about it with your team and those affected, and then get to work fixing it. Hopefully learn something from it too…

I’ve always been a tad gassy 🤷🏻‍♀️ but I’m noticing that it’s been really really bad for the past year or so. Lots of gas, bad smelling, and stomach pain if I hold it in.

I end up having 4-5 cups of it a day because I’ve got an 8 month old baby and need the caffeine 😅 Some posts/reasearch talk about diarrhea, constipation, gas, and bloating. So I’m gonna test this theory out.

But I need my matcha daily (coffee makes me anxious) but I absolutely HATE the plain matcha powder that you have to whisk - partly for taste (too strong) and partly for the routine of it - the matcha collagen is so easy to put in a mug and pour hot water over it and it’s ready, no whisking!

I definitely do not have any feelings for her and we also haven't been in touch since so there's no way for me to know if she's with/seeing someone. All I want is to meet her for a coffee for a few mins - check how she's doing and go back to no contact. The point is that I did enjoy time together and still wish her well in life even though she went full maniac to the extent of being admitted in the psych ward for 2 days and being diagnosed with BPD. Believe me when I say this, she pulled of something nasty that scarred a part of my brain and heart that'll last an entire lifetime.

She's very clingy and there's a high chance of her mistaking that I want to give us another try, the chances of which happening are less than 0% if you ask me.

Do you think that it is a good idea to say hi, check up on her and then go back to living to my life.

Personally, it can either be a very friendly catch-up or one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

Why? Why not ?

Feeling a lot better, mentally and physically. Am still a little tired, but just starting getting some strength to work out again, finally. 

I worked out a lot before, but was so tired and lethargic. Luckily I am only working part time, but have been having quite a few interviews/exams. I feel a lot more focused and that heart dropping anxiety for something that isnt even a big deal is completely gone. Feel like my body is finally rehydrating, that was my bigfest reason for quitting caffiene, that and it masks any issues that you have physically and mentally. 

Also I just started drinking some Pero, it's a coffee alternative, caffeine free. I make it with honey, a little heavy cream, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It's a nice little dessert. Going to be a go to when winter hits.

- it felt like the cece reveal was so long before but it was one episode and didn’t even answer all of the questions that we had. 

- why did they move on from Lesley stone so fast 

- not one person thought to call Sara’s mom and ask the situation…?

-trauma is so downplayed in the show, the girls often tried to quieten han for expression how Charles was a psycho for Ali’s sake but cece LITERALLY kidnapped and tortured then. They didn’t spend much time healing, like at ALL.

- tanner was an awful detective. 

- also how did toby not get any type of promotion within those 5 years but lorenzo did???? 

- Shauna was never addressed properly, like…how did aria just get away with that???

-how did the moms get out of the basement?

-how did Jessica fake Charles’ death, take cece to the funeral  after getting special permission granted for her leave, and then read it her as Charlotte…like WHAT???? HOW does that even work, explain it to me, not ONE answer for that. 

- what happened to the whole company fund thing that Rhys was running 

-how did Andrew have so much footage inside the dollhouse? Did cece plant it or did he uncover it and if so why couldn’t the police do that to find them…

-Ezra, Malcom and Ezra’s mom… what happened to that storyline it got dropped after we found out Ezra was trying to still see Malcom but his mom just never came back despite being so adamant about wanting to be involved in it all

-how did Ezra go from being a desperate high-school  teacher who was broke as hell to owning the coffee show 

-the whole beauty pageant thing was so random…

- personal opinion: I cannot stand Alison and season five is so pointless and boring and filled with so many random storylines that contributed absolutely nothing (except monas death). I loved Ali when I watched before but it’s clear how horrible of a person she is and the entire shift of her trying to- and failing - to be a soft caring church goer is just….insane???

- oh and Holbrook??? What was that about??? He went from being kind to Hanna to whatever that was

However as time passed I started to feel a bit lonely without being able to see friends in person. Lately I have been trying to get to know people more at my work and other events but not quite finding a good friendship connection (and people around my age). That brings me here seeing if I can find someone to chill at a coffee shop with or a fair or other outdoor events with. I'm very much a quite person and have a very mellow vibe but I'm not shy. I am open to having all sorts of conversations, listening to others, and want to positive and uplifting for others. 

I work full time as an IT support tech and use my evenings and weekends to practice and learn hobbies. I've been investing into quite a few hobbies since trying to be less online. Learning crochet, learning photography, practicing digital art, learning Japanese again, \*trying\* to read more, and recording music. Most recently I've been working on getting more active with walks and bike rides (I'm 6'4 240 with a bit of a belly that I'm trying to shrink down) and taking dance classes which have been a lot of fun! It's a lot of different things but if any of those stick out to you I'd be happy to focus more and improve on one.  
  
I do play video games though not as much anymore with the above activities and not too many multiplayer games but I have a PC and a Nintendo Switch to play on. I only watch anime on occasion as well these days but I am a One Piece fan! (take what you will with that)

I'm not looking for anyone too specific since I consider myself Ace, except for that you'd be around my age +/-5 years or so, preferably if you don't smoke cigarettes, and someone with good positive energy!

Didn't Harold emasculate himself with the dog bowl story?

[https://archive.ph/I83da](https://archive.ph/I83da)

This is such a bizarre piece.  

*These memories came flooding back after reading headlines mocking Prince Harry for being nothing more than his fabulous wife’s ‘plus one’.*

*For months now, rumours have circulated that all might not be paradise inside the Sussexes’ £12 million Montecito mansion.*

*That a miserable-looking Harry increasingly cuts a forlorn figure, playing second fiddle to the magnificent Meghan. During their two faux-royal tours to Nigeria and Colombia earlier this year, he was very much the sideshow.*

*Barely two years after he portrayed himself as the forgotten Spare in his venge-fest book of the same name, is Prince Harry in danger of becoming a spare part in his own marriage, too?*

*Despite her unpopularity over here, Meghan has managed to establish herself on the celebrity circuit in the States, turning up unexpectedly at the LA Children’s Hospital Gala this week, greeting children, dressed in showstopping red and posing for snaps shared worldwide – while Harry was alone in southern Africa, where he had travelled to visit the charity he co-founded in Lesotho.*

*He also spent the night of his 40th birthday recently hiking with his mates rather than with his wife and two children, something I fear should ring alarm bells in any marriage. Yet Meghan even took ownership of that trip, saying it was her gift to him, seemingly having the effect of deliberately or inadvertently emasculating him again.*

*\*\*\**

*Many of my girlfriends found their marriages failed once their careers took off. And now I fear that Meghan is making the same mistake – emasculating a once- proud man.*

*After all, Meghan fell in love with a Prince of the Realm, an Apache-flying hero. Now she’s supposed to want to rip his clothes off as he collects free-range eggs from their chickens? Unsurprisingly, these days Harry is often seen alone sipping coffee made with organic milk in the couple’s local cafe.*

*Whether we like it or not, there’s still this ingrained belief in most men that they should be the breadwinners. Not that they’re against female equality, but we know that many men think badly of themselves if they lose the role of hunter-gatherer. And what they see as failure may lead them to look for other ways to repair their battered ego.*

*\*\**

*So I’m relieved to see that in the past fortnight, Prince Harry, with his ten solo engagements from London to Lesotho, is finally rediscovering the man he once was.*

*Beloved prince and war hero; a cheeky chappy whose appeal encompasses everything that was best about his mother Diana.*   ***\[I just cannot.  Gag me with a spoon.\]***

*His marriage, and his whole life, have changed a good deal since the couple’s very royal wedding in 2018.*

*By now striking out on his own for these key engagements, he is escaping Meghan’s shadow – and indeed casting his own, as I unkindly told my own husband to do.*

*So Meghan, take note to avoid your marriage ending up like mine – a bitter and costly divorce followed by a lifetime of ‘what ifs’.*",12,1728526376.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,9,0.88,False

I am only missing Meat on Sticks catering company will only offer if they get an event and have left overs apparently and Rocklands Barbeque and Grilling Company 32 miles away from me.....

Cava $4.99 is just a basic meal at least the Chantilly, Va store near Wegman's. They make a bowl and don't let you customize anymore after corporate stated not to apparently.

Peet's Coffee is just pastries got six pieces for $3.99. Just pick up.

Rawal Kabob for $4.99 is just a meal both times I tried it. I loved the food given but the quantity isn't anything to write home about. A small wait time.

Saltenas Camila for $5.99 is just a meal but is fairly bad and basic. 20 minute wait time. They are from a ghost kitchen. They are offering breads with fillings, sandwiches and soups. They offer three types the mystery bag is sandwiches and soups. They only offer bags Friday-Sunday.

Moby Dick House of Kabob for $3.99 is just a basic meal. Someone keeps snatching them up ASAP but the two times I got to pick them up they were just a standard meal offering from their menu. Small wait time.

Bobby's Bagel Cafe is just 12 bagels and two containers of cream cheese. The pretzel bagels are really salty. No wait time just pickup.

Fairfax Bakery was just bagels and some pastries. Wasn't as good as Bobby's but acceptable. Small wait time

Jas and Fam Caribbean Flavor. A ton of rice and not much meat or vegetables not worth it to me. Comes with a Sandwich as well. 10 minute wait time

Chi Mc is plain chicken wings which you have to pay for sauce and a side of white rice. It isn't to bad sauce costs $1.5.

King's Buffet is a random assortment of food from the buffet in a standard container they use. Think white Styrofoam container. Small wait time while they pick your food. If you bring a soup container you can grab some soup. You can also request the removal or addition of some items.

Rasa is just a basic bowl. Small wait time during assembly or no wait time if you come late as they are already made.

Whole Foods bakery is random items that are nearing out of date. I got 3 items.

Whole Foods prepared foods is random one of the four bags I had had a salad, mac and cheese and a pizza. Another had wings, salad and crackers. Another had a flat bread wings and cheese platter with grapes and brownie. The final had the same cheese platter, with a salad and lo mein. Overall only two were worth it. The salads were small, pizza was fairly large, flatbread was large, wings were only 10-12 in number didn't bother counting but they were small and haven't opened them all yet, cheese platter was small and not worth it and the crackers within were stale and the Lo Mein was small. Pickup was at customer service desk. The other time I went was fried chicken, soup and wraps.

Anna Sudha Community Kitchen is a basic meal with some extras. Well worth the $5.

PLNT Burger is a basic meal, burger and fries at $4 unsure if random.

Armored Fresh is vegan cheese. I can't really make a judgement if it is worth it since I don't eat many Vegan items but at $4 it is well worth it I think. Think American cheese slices.

Fava Pot is a basic meal at $5 of a ton of carbs rice beans onions or a veggie fava bean sauce with wraps.

Siroo and Jukstory $4.99 for an assortment of baked goods and prepared food. It is random based on what is going to expire.

Mas Seafood is raw seafood which mine had fish.

Area 2 Farms $14.99 for an a wide array of vegetables and herbs

Ikea $4.99 a random meal tried twice once was just mac and cheese the other was meatballs with sides. Your better off buying a meal on Tuesday for $3.99 since it is cheaper and won't be random.

Flavor Hive $4.99 is a random item on their menu.

Meaza $5.99 is a large wrap with toppings.

City Kabob House is meat and rice not worth the price at all.

Prime Halal is a bunch of rice and little meat been twice. $6.99 and not worth it at all.

Dig Inn $4.99 Basic bowl random.

Nene's Soul Cafe is Meaza a large wrap with toppings.

Kabob Grill is $5.99 basic meal only sold on Fridays for some odd reason.",5,1728526351.0,toogoodtogo,1,1.0,False

Baths - this might be strange 😂 I take 1 to 2 baths a day. Idk if I’m sweating it out or what but a safe space where I can’t convince myself to get nic and clears my head like a sauna. If I was rich I’d be in a sauna all day. 

Coffee - need a heart racing thing to give me a nic replacement, I always drink coffee but have upping it a bit just to get that similar feeling.

How do I communicate this issue with him? ,"This feels so petty in comparison to other posts on here, but idk what to do bc I don’t think it’s enough to nuke our relationship. 

For context: my fiancé has a heart condition, he can only have limited caffeine over a period of time.  

So, long story short, my fiancé keeps eating my diet food and drinking my monsters. I drink one monster a day as coffee upsets my stomach. I also recently started a weight-loss diet as I had a baby 3 years ago and I let my self slip postpartum. When I wake up after he goes to work, I’ll go to grab a monster and I’ll notice I’m short one, or he took my last one. When I come home from work in the evenings and go to make dinner (usually a salad or granola with yogurt) and he’s eaten over half of what I was planning to make. It’s not the only food in the house, but the problem is we’re paycheck to paycheck atm, so we budget our grocery’s down to each meal. So when he eats my food or drinks a monster it throws off my whole week. I’ve told him so many times how it makes me feel, which it honestly makes me feel crappy. I’ve gotten to the point where I count everything every time I go to grab them. His response is always the same “I’ll buy you more on Friday” but that doesn’t help me on Friday morning when I get up at 7 am with a toddler and I have no caffeine bc he took one, so there is none. I just don’t know what to do at this point. 

Also, he chooses what he wants for his meals since I know someone will ask about it. We also have snacks in the house and other drinks in our home. 

TLDR; my fiancé keeps stealing my food, and his big solution is to buy me more at a later date which is a huge inconvenience, but he doesn’t think it’s a big deal. ",4,1728524960.0,relationship_advice,7,0.83,False

-coffee shops sitting taking and watching life 

Old towns

Cute shops and streets

We are foodies, so love good restaurants 

We are not looking to do any hiking, several months ago my fiancée had surgery so any hiking other than a short easy walk is not in the picture.

We would love to visit some beaches, and I would like to get a waterfront or semi waterfront Airbnb 

Beautiful nature views to sit and enjoy

this is your gentle reminder to please be kind to your dutch employees tomorrow (not just on sticker days but always please). we usually staff up and prepare as best as we can for sticker/merch drops and we always do our best to make sure everyone who wants a sticker gets one, but we do have a limited quantity.

*stickers are one per paid drink. free drinks with dutch app rewards or birthday drinks will not earn you a sticker*

if you’re able to, try and get to your local shop as early as possible, like before 8 or 9 in the morning. if you can’t make it in the morning it is not likely you will get one on your own — maybe you can coordinate with an early riser to buy something extra and save you a sticker. 

if you are in line and it’s busy, you see your broistas busting their butts in there, please treat them with respect and kindness. please do not ask for extra stickers. please do not yell at your broistas for not having anymore stickers. we are simply humans trying to serve you coffee with a smile and a cool sticker. however, it is JUST a sticker. it is not worth losing your cool over and making a broista uncomfortable.

again, get there early, ask a friend to snag you one, don’t ask for extras. it’s real simple and yet every time we always have very difficult interactions because people feel extremely entitled to their stickers. be kind it’s so easy. have a good night and best of luck snagging a sticker!",33,1728524597.0,dutchbros,1,0.95,False

*  She's considering getting a topper because the oral Minoxidil is causing a shed.  She's insecure about it but she doesn't want to spend the money on it.

*  Her streaming room is a wreck.  She hasn't bothered to do anything with it (because she's a lazy sack of shit.)  It needs to be painted first but they're going out of town and have lots of shit planned that doesn't involve our intrepid Kween lifting a dainty finger to do anything resembling work.  Eww.

*  More discussion about wigs and toppers.

*  She just remembered that other ppl exist in the world and asked a stan if there's a hurricane heading for FL and if Disneyland closed.

*  Asks if the light is okay.  (She looks kind of blue but I doubt she's gonna do anything to fix that because ewww, work.)

*  She tried to quit smoking again this week and failed.  

*  They have to go to the storage and she didn't marinate the chicken thighs so she's gonna feed poor, starving Trent a bacon and cheese omelet.  (That's not dinner.  It's not filling.)

*  She wants to buy a good vape.  But she doesn't want to vape in trade of smoking.

*  She's gonna have Thanksgiving and vlog it with Tucker's mom and her fam.

*  She's hardly drinking at all lol.  She's trying to fix all her bad habits.

*  She will make the traditional Thanksgiving feast.  (I can't even...what with all the beater licking that goes on over there.)  Her mom would roll over in her grave if she knew Cunty makes StoveTop Stuffing. 

*  She eats everything on Thanksgiving.  (Except green bean casserole, which she likes to let ferment for a couple of weeks in the oven first.  🤢🤮 Gag, hork.)

*  Someone tells her they gave a German soldier a cigarette in WWII and he spared his life in thanks.  (I am floored that some rando old dude watches Cunty McDonald's youtube channel.

*  She says the person who is trying to dig up dirt on her is not in chat today.  (Hmmm, I wonder who that could be?)

*  William, the stan with his head so far up Cunty's ass, he can smell her putrid whisky breath, says something about us.)  Once again complaining about us.  We have no one in our lives who cares about us and she's very sad for us.  (Oh fuck off you drunk, chubby, insecure, lazy af,  narcissistic twatwaffle.  Worry about your next meltdown.  We're not going to be the ones who cause it.  You are.)

*  William, the stan with his head so far up Cunty's ass, he can smell her putrid whisky breath, says something about how we're ""not over him.""  I assume that would be Skeevy or possibly Rusty?  Maybe Andrew?  No idea.  I got in very late so the chat was long gone.

*  Talking about the new Joker movie.  And she's going on and on about even though she can't be arsed to drag herself to a theater.  She hates superheroes.  She said she ""had a friend"" who was raving to her about the 1st Joker movie.  (What friend?  B?  She has no friends.)

*  Contemplating whether everyone deserves to be happy.  ""If you're just gonna be an asshole, you're gonna reap what you sow.""  (Let's hope she does.)

*  More movie talk.

*  She gave Trevor a whole concert and he said the best song she sings is Jokerman by Bob Dylan.  And she told him he was a weirdo.

*  She has never farted in front of Toddrick.  She never will.  (This just baffles me.  Does she plan on never taking a dump, not burp, never have a period?  It's a fucking bodily function that everybody has.  But she's such a delicate little flower she could never!!!)  She thinks is not sexy.  He farts in front of her though.  Apparently that's perfectly fine.

*  She raises her arms to get the sexy shoulder sweater&trade;
 and she has sweat stains.  

*  Back to talking about farts.  (She's such a shy and delicate flower.)  She's a human being with bodily functions and she's not ashamed of them except she won't fart in front of her boyfriend.  ( I am unsure why she thinks there's anything sexy about her that could be ruined cuz from where I sit, I don't see it.)

*  She vacuumed the whole house!!!  By herself!!!  EEEWWWW!!!!!!!!!  That's probs why she has the sweaty pits.

*  She wants to name the stream Farts & Queefs, smoking and hair toppers.

*  She finds fart jokes hilarious (she would because she's still 13.) and if anyone doesn't find them funny, they need to get the stick out of their ass.  (Or she needs to grow the fuck up??)

*  Talking about the Sims 4.

*  Talking about hanging stuff up.

*  Talking about coffee.

*  She's gotta swap where the herb cabinet and writing desk are.  Thaddeus is gonna help her (lol, Translation:  she's gonna watch him do all the work while she stands around complaining that he's doing it wrong.)

*  She has so much stuff she doesn't need or want so she's gonna throw it in the storage because she's too lazy to do something about it, like tossing it in a dumpster.

*  Telling all about how Travis has no debt except the mortgage.  I'm sure he loves her giving away all his personal finances.

*  She's a maximalist.  She wants all her beautiful (lmao) things...she's like a dragon hoarding her jewels.  (Everything she owns is either cheap crap or gifts from stans.  Not one piece of her furniture is real wood.  Beautiful things...lol.)

*  She wants to get divorced.  She's gonna hire an attorney after the first of the year.  (I'll be taking bets on if this actually  happens.)  She thinks it will be easy because he would never do bad things to her.  (She's got a lot of faith in someone she abused for years.)  She wants to get it behind her.  And she wants her maiden name back and ""I WILL NEVER EVER EVER CHANGE IT AGAIN.""  (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Oh you bet she's gonna be Cunty James if Troy ignores everything and marries her lazy ass.)

*  She's hoping the school loan forgiveness thing goes through.

*  Ppl (we) don't give Todd enough credit for how super smart and quantum physics he is becuz he sounds stoned all the time but he's really really really super duper extra smart.  He's a regular Einstein.  ~sigh.

*  Trayvon doesn't autopay his bills online.  He logs in and pays them.  He says that way he knows it's done.  She considers this doing it the old fashioned way.  (I mean, he's not mailing checks...)

*  They have separate finances (lol).  She's paying half the mortgage and utility bills.  She's gonna cashapp him her half.  She thinks it's smart to keep the finances separate.  She's happy and he's happy.  She knows Tank would never try to take advantage of her.  (I don't think it's him we need to worry about here lol)

*  Discussion of Xmas plans.

*  They will not be adopting any pets because of wtfever their future plans are.  Traveling and stuff.

*  She might give out trick or treat candy.  (RIP small children's  privacy.)

*  She's responsible for her own emotional well-being.  There's been a couple of times she almost went banshee.  She's saving that for a vlog.  But she has seen a profound change in the way she handles things and that she no longer makes it someone else's responsibility to make her feel better.  She caught herself and didn't do it.  Twice now.  She's doing so well!!  (Until she's not lol)  She's so happy.  She's really having a healthy relationship.  (lol so the constant criticism and working him like a dog isn't a problem at all!!)  

*  Her healing journey Ted Talk goes on for quite some time.

1g07mk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1g07mk7/aita_for_not_inviting_someone_to_be_a_bridesmaid/,AITA for not inviting someone to be a bridesmaid for my wedding when I was one for her?,"Sorry if this is a bit lengthy, but I'm genuinely at a loss for words.
I, 29F, was a bridesmaid in a wedding back in 2018. At the time, I was best friends with this girl, 32F. When she got engaged, I was asked to be a bridesmaid, and with no hesitation said yes. Her and her husband got divorced and have since gone separate ways. They have 2 kids together. This information will be important.
We met through work and clicked almost immediately. She's the extrovert who adopted me, an introvert. I became the honorary auntie to her kids and I constantly babysat them when she needed me to, no questions asked.
In 2020, I met my now fiance, M32. He changed my life for the best. I grew up in a mentally abusive home and he rescued me, giving me the confidence to move out and be on my own. I moved 2 hours away from our home town, only returning when I wanted to. Due to this, I didn't talk to my friend as often, but not for lack of trying. I'd make the effort, but it was never given back. She only contacted me when she needed something. Soon, I started realizing how much she used me when I lived close by. It was one of those situations where ""you say jump, I ask how high"" But if I said jump, she'd laugh and say no. I realize now it was extremely narcissistic. One day, I was on the phone with her and she said ""Yeah, my oldest asked why you had to get a boyfriend and move away"" her oldest, at the time, was 7. I'm having a hard time believing they genuinely said that, and it wasn't her being upset that she lost her free full time babysitter, her free ride anywhere, and her coffee supplier when she wanted. I realize I, too, was the problem because I should have stopped it, but I was blinded by the friendship I wanted. If she didn't get her way, she would gaslight me.
Anyway, in 2022, my fiance and I got a house together 1 hour away from where I grew up. At this point my family and I have a better relationship because I finally got to find my authentic self after feeling the need to hide it for so long. I did a lot of growing up and they allowed me to. I'm the happiest I've been in, well, ever. Due to this, I go to my home town more. I always make efforts to meet up with my old friends and a majority of the time I do, unless they have work or other plans. It happens, and I understand. But I've even made trips to town when she said she was free, only to be met with ""Well I didn't think you'd come down, so I can't meet up."" And even once told ""I just don't want to."" But she's never made the effort to come to me. If I don't drop everything to see her, I'm the bad guy. It's hurtful, but at this point I've let it go.
Recently, my then boyfriend proposed and I am over the moon. Suddenly, my ""friend"" started talking to me again. She called me out of the blue after a year or so of very little contact asking questions all about wedding things. My fiance and I are in no genuine rush to get married because weddings are stupid expensive and we have a mortgage that takes priority, but I'm also graduating next year and want to settle in my degree before jumping into marriage. She has started getting frustrated because I have started making minor plans for my wedding, and I'm not keeping her involved. Her and her kids will be invited, of course, but not in the party. She continues to gaslight me and make me feel as if I should let her be in my wedding, despite how toxic she is for me, and she belittles me often, hoping I will crack. When I told her she wasn't in my party, but I was more than happy to have her there as a guest, she got super upset and hung up on me. My fiance is standing beside me and my decision because he just wants me happy and has seen my efforts to see and communicate with her, but it never be given back to me. My mom knows this friend very well and is trying to get me to make her a bridesmaid, but is also trying not to get involved because it's my wedding. I'm a huge people pleaser, so having this go on is hard for me. I'm standing my ground, but THT subreddit, be honest... Am I the asshole?",19,1728523532.0,TwoHotTakes,19,0.95,False

Living in separate apt. Recently, the discussion of moving in together came up and tbh I was all for it. We  talked splitting bills and overall have more income to work with. We started looking for an apt. 

Now, my gf (we'll call her Z) Z has had bad relationships in the past. Which has lead her to have trust issues in relationships. Understandably. Well as were looking for apt she brought up her insecurities on relationships and how moving forward was a big step in her life, in our lives. During these times I try my best to reassure her we are one at this point. I'm loyal, I care about you, I want to make this work. Then I said "" I have not cheated on you"" and before I could finish with "" and never will..."" she interrupted me and said ""OH I KNOW YOU HAVENT CHEATED ON ME!"". this statement took me aback. The certainty in her voice and her firmness was not something I saw often. But she was confident I was not cheating. Which was great, but seemed off for her personality. Ever since this conversation it's kind of been stuck in the back of my head. I'm glad she knew, but that amount of certainty just seemed off. Like stating a fact based on information you already have. Not ""I know you're not cheating because I trust you."". 

Then I started thinking back. I was set to go to lunch during work with some co workers. It was a kind of Celebration for co workers for gaining a new client and finally solidifying them as a perm employee. We were a table of 4. 2 girls and us 2 guys. We went to the celebrated people preferred place which was a sushi restaurant (hell yeah lol). We sit down, get drinks, then I hear ""heyyyy you!"". I look up and see my gf. I was surprised. We are like 55 mins one way from both our Apts at the time and her work was even farther than her apt. She saw me surprised and started getting angry ""who are these people?"". I informed her they were my co workers and were celebrating. When I asked why she was here she quickly said she was hungry and changed the subject and was being dismissive. Once my coworkers confirmed we were there from work, awkwardly, she started to calm down. I offered to get a chair for her but she ""already ate and was leaving"". When she left all my coworkers basically looked at me like ""tough to deal with huh?"" Attitude.... that was embarrassing. I knew in that moment that she was tracking me. 

After this incident, I sat her down and flat out asked her ""are you tracking me?"". She's not good at lying and said no..... I knew she was lying... so I continued ""a relationship requires trust. If you don't trust me tell me now"" she says she trusts me and knows I haven't or never would cheat..... every bullshit meter I have internally went off. I explained again if you are tracking now is the time to come clean so we can work this out and move past it, otherwise  that's enough of a broken trust boundary that I'd consider ending the relationship. I was obviouse when saying it in a manner that was ""I already know you're tracking, just admit it so we can talk about it""  She reassured me she's not tracking me.......... I iterated again, if you are tracking me and I find out it's a deal breaker. We are adults who can communicate about out feelings and insecurities. TELL ME NOW. ""No I'm not tracking you"". 

Ok 

After these 2 incidents I decided to setup a test. First I searched my car top to bottom. Inside and outside. Couldn't find a tracker. Which was a relief. I didn't want to find it tbh.... I started questioning ""how else can I be tracked if not a device on or in the car"".... my phone. I'm a 15 year into my IT career. I take privacy as seriously as I can. When I get a new phone I look for the opt out of all guide online and follow it. Turn off Google tracking, Android tracking, app tracking, all of it. It's all off and not being shared...... well I went into my android setting  and what do I find... Z has turned on and started sharing my location to herself.... I was mad..... internally.. we hadn't made the jump to move in together yet waiting for leases to finish.. so i set up a plan. That night she came over and I had another conversation about tracking me and how I do not and never will agree with it. I was clear in my statements and presented them as facts. And asked her she had anything to tell me ""no."". Ok...... 

The next day I called a friend. Informed them of being tracked, my stance, and asked if he would put on a show for me. Call me tomorrow
Around 8pm and I'll put you in speaker and we'll pretend to make plans to go to a specific restaurant for lunch the next day. We agreed on a time and a place. Ask gf if she wanted to come, she could not due to work schedule conflicts. We have lunch at diff times. Ok np. 

The next day during lunch I got the rest of the day off and I drove 3 hours away from the house to a random diner. Grabbed my phone charge and found a table with an outlet. Then just waited. Ordered some coffee, some food. Spent time on my phone and just sat. 

Fun fact on android the moethod of tracking being used. It tracks both ways for users. So she was tracking me, but I could also see her location. Not long after. Sitting down I see her making her way towards me. Waited about 45 mins and saw she was closer. Way outside of our city... wait another hour or so and saw she was even closer now. Here we go...... another 45 mins or so and she's at the diner. Parked in the back to hide her car. I moved to a booth in the very back that didn't have a window by it. And sat with my back pointing towards the door. Basically in a little cubby area way off In back. And just waited. She entered and I saw her looking around, got up and gestured for her to come sit with me. Her eyes were wide and surprised as hell to see me invite her over to the table. Asked what she was doing, she asked me what i was doing 3 hours from our city at a diner. 

You can prolly guess what happened next. I let Z know I know she's been tracking me. Showed her the android tracking. And when I informed her the tracking was both ways she went silent. They even have history of where you've been. So I pulled it up and showed her she'd been tracking for a while and every time she followed me to a location secretly without me knowing, i had proof. She tracked me to my location 12 times in the last 4 months. I informed Z I was there as a test to see if she'd be willing to drive out this far to spy on me..... 

I let her know it was time to take a break from this relaionship as moving forward without trust would lead to a relationship of doubt and despise. And got up and started walking out, then gave the waitress a 20 for dealing with me for all those hours.. I'll be honest. I did it in front of Z as I was leaving. Then, I looked back and walked out. 

Wibtah? I turned off tracking. But I don't feel good about the situation....",17,1728523271.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,8,0.96,False

I have sometimes 4-5 days off in a row.  I just find myself feeling very lonely and not having anyone to spend time with on my days off.  My days off are usually spent reading ( sometimes I’ll go to a coffee shop or outside somewhere to read).  I’m in a book club with my job buts it’s online and not a lot of people show up to it.  I’ll sometimes bike too on boardwalks or bike paths.  I also do some solo trips I just went to Rhode Island.  I also go to this private gym that focuses on kettlebell exercises and it’s a small group of people that go there, so that’s a lot of my socialization on my days off.  But I don’t hang out with these people outside of the gym.  Sometimes I’ll even pick up overtime at my job if I have nothing planned.  

I have like 3 friends.  2 of them I hang out with together and the third one it’s usually just us two.  I maybe see them once a month at most.  I’m single I try meeting people I try the dating apps but I’m having a hard time meeting someone.  I’m not that close with my parents even though I live nwith them.  My sister doesn’t really separate from her husband so don’t spend much time with her.  I do spend some time with my coworkers too maybe once a month.  I go on maybe one vacation with my friends a year also. 

So basically I just always feel lonely on my days off.  I feel like nobody reaches out to me or I put more of the effort with my friends.  Except for my one friend, she does reach out to me but sometimes I’m working and our schedules are conflicting.  Sometimes I’ll want to do something with someone and there is just nobody to go with.  I do plenty on my own but sometimes I want to be with someone.  I feel like as I get older the loneliness gets worse.  I just don’t feel like I have any deep meaningful connections in my life.  I like my friends/coworkers but don’t see them much.  

Sometimes the loneliness is so painful.  I will just lay in my bed crying because I just feel so hopeless.  Like I’ll always feel this way.  And yes I do see a therapist.  I’m trying to make some effort and better my life and do things, but at the end of the day the crippling loneliness I feel is always there.  

Any advice or does anyone else feel the same.  I also feel like this has started ever since I left college, which was full of socialization.  No one prepares you for that drastic decline in socialization after college.  ",1,1728523121.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

Imagine this: you’re at the checkout counter of a bustling coffee shop, eager to pay with Bitcoin for your favorite espresso. You scan the QR code, hit send, and then... you wait. And wait. And wait some more. The barista gives you an awkward smile, the people behind you are starting to fidget, and you’re still wondering why your transaction is stuck in Bitcoin limbo. Enter **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** ([https://www.txaccelerate.com](https://www.txaccelerate.com)), the ultimate traffic controller for Bitcoin transactions, here to save you from slow confirmations and crypto anxiety.

# Why Do Bitcoin Transactions Get Stuck?

Before we dive into how **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** works its magic, let’s quickly explore why Bitcoin transactions sometimes take forever to confirm.

Bitcoin is a decentralized network, which means every transaction must be verified by miners before it’s added to the blockchain. The problem arises when the Bitcoin network gets congested—kind of like a traffic jam during rush hour. Thousands of transactions are fighting for a spot in the next block, and if your transaction fee is too low, your payment might get stuck behind a horde of higher-fee transactions.

Think of it like trying to get into an exclusive club. If your fee (the “cover charge”) isn’t high enough, the bouncer (miners) might leave you waiting outside until someone decides to tip them a bit more. Frustrating, right? Well, that’s where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** comes in to act as your personal VIP pass.

**Bitcoin TX Accelerate** is designed to help you skip the dreaded wait and accelerate your Bitcoin transactions. Whether you're dealing with slow confirmations, urgent payments, or just want to get your transaction into the next block as quickly as possible, this app has you covered.

Here’s the best part: you don’t need to be a crypto wizard or tech guru to use it. With **Bitcoin TX Accelerate**, you can speed up your stuck transactions in just a few simple steps. No more watching the blockchain explorer with bated breath—just smooth, fast confirmations so you can get on with your day (or coffee break).

# How Does Bitcoin TX Accelerate Work?

You might be wondering, “How exactly does this work?” Let’s break it down:

1. **Transaction Identification**: You provide the transaction ID of the stuck transaction that’s frustratingly slow. This is like telling **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** where to find your transaction in the blockchain crowd.
2. **Acceleration Process**: **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** then uses a combination of techniques to push your transaction up the priority list. One of the most common methods is called **Replace-by-Fee (RBF)**, which allows you to increase the transaction fee and incentivize miners to prioritize your payment.
3. **Faster Confirmation**: Once **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** works its magic, your transaction gets picked up by miners faster, leading to quicker confirmations and less time spent biting your nails.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: You can track your transaction’s progress in real time, so you know exactly when your Bitcoin has made it through the blockchain and into its destination.

It’s like hitting the ""turbo boost"" button on your Bitcoin transaction, zooming past the congestion and landing safely in the next available block.

# Why Choose Bitcoin TX Accelerate?

Let’s face it, nobody enjoys waiting around for a Bitcoin transaction to confirm, especially in today’s fast-paced world. So why should you consider using **Bitcoin TX Accelerate**? Here are a few compelling reasons:

# 1. Time is Money (and Coffee)

If you’re waiting hours (or worse, days) for a transaction to confirm, you’re wasting valuable time that could be spent on more important things—like buying more coffee, checking out that new NFT drop, or planning your next big crypto trade. **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** ensures that your transactions confirm quickly, so you can get back to what really matters.

# 2. Ease of Use

Crypto can be complicated, but **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** makes it simple. No need to understand blockchain mechanics or navigate confusing interfaces. You just enter your transaction ID, hit the button, and let the app do the heavy lifting.

# 3. Peace of Mind

There’s nothing worse than sending a large payment and watching it get stuck in the mempool (the waiting area for unconfirmed transactions). With **Bitcoin TX Accelerate**, you don’t have to stress. You’ll know your transaction is in good hands, and you can check its status as it moves toward confirmation.

# 4. Cut Through Congestion

The Bitcoin network is a busy place, especially during peak times. Whether there’s a market frenzy or just regular transaction overload, **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** helps you cut through the congestion and ensure your payments go through without unnecessary delays.

# Real-Life Scenarios: When to Use Bitcoin TX Accelerate

Let’s take a look at a few real-life scenarios where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** could come to your rescue:

# Scenario 1: The Late Rent Payment

You’ve promised your landlord to pay your rent in Bitcoin, but the network is congested, and your transaction is stuck. The last thing you want is a grumpy landlord knocking on your door asking for an update. With **Bitcoin TX Accelerate**, you can push that transaction through faster, keeping your rent payment on time and your relationship with your landlord intact.

# Scenario 2: The Urgent Trade

You’ve just spotted an amazing trade opportunity, but you need to move your Bitcoin into your exchange wallet ASAP. Unfortunately, the network is busy, and you’re watching your BTC sit in limbo. **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** can help you speed up that transfer so you can take advantage of the market while the price is right.

# Scenario 3: The Gift That’s Stuck in Transit

You’ve sent a birthday Bitcoin gift to a friend, but hours later, they still haven’t received it. Talk about awkward! Don’t let your thoughtful crypto gift get lost in the blockchain shuffle—use **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** to make sure your transaction arrives in time for the party.

# Tips for Faster Bitcoin Transactions

While **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** is your go-to solution for speeding up stuck transactions, there are a few tips you can keep in mind to avoid getting stuck in the first place:

* **Choose a Competitive Fee**: When sending Bitcoin, always check the current recommended transaction fees. If you want fast confirmation, make sure you choose a fee that’s competitive with the rest of the network traffic.
* **Use RBF (Replace-by-Fee)**: This feature allows you to increase your transaction fee if it gets stuck, so it’s always worth enabling if your wallet supports it.
* **Keep an Eye on Network Congestion**: Bitcoin transactions tend to slow down during peak times (like during a big market rally). If you’re not in a rush, consider sending your transaction during quieter periods when fees are lower.

# Conclusion: Accelerate Your Crypto Experience

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, speed matters. Whether you're paying for coffee, sending gifts, or making time-sensitive trades, you don’t have time to wait around for hours—or worse, days—for your Bitcoin transactions to confirm.

1g06wuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/robinhobb/comments/1g06wuv/recently_had_a_fire_in_my_apartment_building_all/,"Recently had a fire in my apartment building, all utilities except water are off, and I keep thinking of Fitz and Wizard","My neighbor died in a fire across the hall from my apartment on Sunday (it's Wednesday now), and I keep thinking of Fitz and Nighteyes, and Wizard from Megan Lindholm's Wizard of the Pigeons. 

I'm not sure if it's from the first or second Fitz/Fool trilogy, but Fitz says something like, so much suffering is based on human expectations. As a human, I expect to be warm and dry, so when it rains, i get upset and dwell on my discomfort. The wolf inside Fitz simply accepts that rain means being cold and wet. And once he accepts that reality, Fitz's suffering eases. 

I expect to have power and internet and my Playstation and Netflix and heat and light and laundry facilities and a stove and a refigerator for my food, and because I'm used to that, I'm cranky that I don't have that now. But on the other hand, I'm trying to be the wolf who accepts hardship for what it is, and to be okay with it. And let's be honest, I didn't burn to death, my cat is okay, and all my shit is fine. I came out of it lucky as hell. I'm overall doing pretty damn well considering. 

Wizard from Megan Lindholm's book is homeless, he secretly lives above an old shoe store or something where he has no right to be. The whole book is filled with Wizard thinking about how damn cold he is all the time in the fall Seattle weather, always getting rained on, hardly eating, dissociating, suffering horribly from PTSD. I don't have his horrific memories, but I do feel semi homeless right now. 

I technically shouldn't be here by city ordinance, but I have been staying in my apartment. It hasn't been too terrible, really, though I do feel a constant chill even though I've been working each day from a coffee shop. In fact, I'm  writing this now by candle light. And like Fitz, it is so hard for me to take people up on their offers of kidness and support, and i am extraordinarily lucky that many people have offered their generosity to me. As for work, well, just because your neighbor burns to death 25 feet away from your bed doesn't mean you can just stop participating in capitalism! 

At the end of the day, I'm fine. Unused to hardship, because i am very fortunate overall, it isnt fun, but if Wizard and Fitz can endure, so can I. 

It is my expectations that make it hard, but humans and animals can endure far worse than what I am experiencing. We actually found my neighbor's cat alive in his apartment this afternoon (again, the fire happened Sunday, she had been trapped in that burnt out smoky shell without food or water for 3-4 days), we all assumed she died with him, but she somehow fucking lived through that inferno of horror! I couldnt fucking believe it. I think I was more shocked to see her alive than I was being abruptly awakened by fire alarms, smoke, and panicked voices, if you can believe it. 

At least I didn't have the sins of war forced upon me like Wizard; at least I didn't get tortured in a dungeon like Fitz. 

I'm going to be okay as long as I remember what Nighteyes said about suffering. I am not prey. I am a survivor. And I can and will endure.
