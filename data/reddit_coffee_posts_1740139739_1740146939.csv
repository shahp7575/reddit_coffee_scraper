I tried the above cake and it was very much a total disaster. First the topping sank into the cake and then it barely raised at all. I did use sour cream that was frozen and I let sit at room temperature but after mixing it the batter seemed to be very thin. 

Would it be worth trying again? I’ve made this before and didn’t have any problems but nothing seemed to go right this last time. I double checked my oven and the temperature seems fine on that at least.

Wonder if I should just switch to something even easier like lemon scone. Really want to try something that went well with my gonads vanilla and coffee ice cream. Also doing beef sandwiches, baked Mac and cheese with a little salad on the side.

I’m facing a complicated situation at work and would appreciate legal guidance on how to handle it.

I was reprimanded by my boss for writing in my notebook during work hours, while I was waiting for the machine to finish a task. However, during this time, several coworkers were using their phones, chatting, or joking around, and they were not called out for it. This unequal treatment bothers me, as it feels like I’m being persecuted for any action I take, while others are free to do whatever during work hours.

Additionally, the company owner has been disrespectful toward me. Whenever he shows up at the company, which happens about once a month, he makes jokes about my hair. I have long hair, and on one occasion, he even pulled my hair and joked, saying, “Why don’t you all prank him and shave his head?” He laughed, and every time he sees me, he comments about me getting a haircut. This is emotionally distressing for me, especially since I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and these comments cause significant discomfort.

Moreover, on another occasion, my boss called me “crazy” when he got upset because I did something simple, like grabbing a cup of coffee. Even though this situation was isolated, I feel constantly uncomfortable because I notice that other people who often disregard company rules are not persecuted like I am. It feels like I’m always being treated unfairly.

I’m considering gathering evidence, such as recording coworkers using their phones during work hours or chatting without being reprimanded, or even recording situations where the company owner makes disrespectful comments. I thought about using a spy pen or a recorder to capture these actions, but I’m concerned that it might be interpreted as illegal or that the evidence wouldn’t be accepted in a potential lawsuit. Another concern is whether recording without the consent of others could be seen as an invasion of privacy or harm me legally, as I’m unsure if it’s permitted to record without others’ knowledge.

I’m worried that if I take legal action, it might harm my career and lead to me losing my job, which puts me in a difficult position. On the other hand, I don’t think it’s right to continue in a work environment where I’m constantly disrespected and treated unfairly. What are the risks of taking this route? Is there a possibility of retaliation? What is the best way to ensure my rights are respected without jeopardizing my position at work?

If anyone has experience with similar cases or can offer advice on how to proceed legally, I would really appreciate it.

I currently work somewhere that is usually just a place to help u find a job, so they're luckily also very nice abt me missing work a lot and almost never being there on time. I'm almost constantly at my ""house doctor"" (to get a doctors note for work) and she has been the only doctor to ever support me, recently made her version of an at home pots test and it all came back positive, recently prescribed me better pain meds (tramaldol, tiny amount) and actually listens to me.
When this all started i went to the hospital because I've felt so weak and yeah yk the drill, they run some tests and they all came back negative, everything but my 24h ekg that i did, almost everytime i stood up my heart rate spiked and when walking it went up to 170 and even higher with more difficult tasks. For some reason they thought i just needed to do more exercise, so i tried and nothing worked, my pain kept getting worse and more unbearable, i took ibuprofen multiple times a day bcs of it and destroyed my organs and lost a lot of weight. I tried getting into the hospital via my psychologist and my doctor multiple times this year and wrote them emails but they deemed me not ""acute"" enough. Two weeks ago i had a rlly bad day and when going to the doctor to get a doctor's note yet again my bpm was 140 with very low blood pressure while sitting and i was sent to the hospital, there i waited 5h after laying down for an ekg, ofc normal. I spoke with the head doctor and that was when i just completely lost it and yelled at her, she wanted me to get off my new pain meds (and sm more) and why i just havent tried melatonin to sleep if my pain was so bad and immediately shoved me in the mentally ill box, and it just being anxiety and stress, there was so much more bs she told me and i yelled at her for not being able to do her fucking job. (She was rlly that bad im not over exaggerating) and left in tears. 
I do have some tests coming up next month (ive been waiting for months to get my appointment) but i want to make an essay, write everything down and i mean everything and compare them to all my symptoms and write good sources in them, drink a cup of coffee (the last time i did i fainted, ik dangerous but ill be careful and go with a friend) and go to the hospital and make them read it, I'm so sick of not being taken seriously and just constantly having ppl tell me it's all in my head, so if you have any website i can include in my essay I'd be very thankful. Ofc i can't write down all of my experiences but if there are any questions im glad to answer them. I know ppl might deem this as dangerous or useless to do, but atp im doing it for my own sanity and to maybe get something out of it and actual help also it'd be helpful for other doctors that wont let me in bcs im not 18 and only help ppl if they're ""acute"" enough and to have everything by hand.",1,1740145039.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False
1iur273,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/1iur273/real_02212025_i_should_have_said_hi/,[Real] (02/21/2025) I should have said Hi,"It has happened to me maybe a handful of times. Meeting someone that just catches you eye that much that you can’t stop looking. Not per se because of the physical attraction, although I’m sure that will play some part, but because there’s something about them that has a hold on your attention. Maybe that’s what one would call an aura, I don’t know. All I know is that it has happened to me once again.

Out of all the times I can only recall two of them, one of which happened two days ago. The first was when I was about sixteen. I was traveling with the bus from school back home. A girl in the bus caught my attention. Now in this case looks definitely were part of it, because yes, she looked super friendly, but she also was an emo/scene girl, something I have always found an amazing look. She and (I assume) her mom got off the bus, and I thought I was confident enough to go and talk to her, so instead of staying in the bus for another 2 stops home, I got out as well. As soon as my foot hit the floor, my confidence was gone. I decided to walk home. The street I took home was parallel to the main street. I always look around, and in one of the streets linking the street I was on with the main street, I caught another glimpse of this girl. She caught me looking, which boosted a little bit of the confidence back into me. One street further, the same thing happened, again boosting my confidence. Sadly, the street after, I didn’t catch her anymore. And instead of actual trying to go after her, just to say ‘hi’, I walked home thinking about the scenarios that could have been. In the weeks that followed I tried to find her online, but without success. At some point I messaged a friend of a friend, because she looked very familiar, but sadly it wasn’t her. I don’t have all that many memories that I actually remember of my childhood, but this sure was one that has stayed with me forever. If only I had sad Hi to her that day.

And last Wednesday, it sure happened again. I was working at our Amsterdam office, about 200 kilometers from home. The office has been decorated with many green walls, flowers and trees all over the building. Somewhere around 10 I had a meeting, so I went into a small cubical and sat down for the call. This cubical, fully made of glass, has a perfect view of the hallway in which we have our small kitchen island with the coffee machines and with some of those plants. As I sat there focused on the meeting, I saw a guy walk to the plants to water them. A few seconds later a girl entered my sight and something about her just made me lose all focus and stare. I really hate this, as it sounds creepy as hell. But I couldn’t get my eye of her. She had a badass appearance; someone I’d guess rides a motorcycle. She had some tattoos and looked very independent and like someone that would stand her ground. At this point the guy in the meeting had mentioned me a couple of times trying to get back my attention. The girl looked at me as she was walking away, and as I was still staring, she looked straight into my eyes. Instead of looking away, I just kept eye contact. She probably thought what a weirdo, but she kept eye contact for a good five seconds, before she was out of sight. I tried to focus back on the call, but noticed myself looking around the corner a couple of times to see if I could find her. I continued to the call, slowly regaining focus as she seemed to be have gone on to the next part of our floor. A few minutes later she came back to pick up a watering can that they had left at the kitchen island. As she walked past me, I apparently smiled, and she smiled back.

Time went by, the meeting ended and I got myself a coffee. Walked around two stations to see if I could find her again, maybe say something, but without luck. Got back to my desk and worked a little until it was lunch time. Me and coworker took a spot over at one of the balconies. I sat down as my coworker went down to the restaurant to grab himself some lunch. As I was sitting there waiting for him to join me, I couldn’t but look around to see if I could find her again. I was out of luck. A few minutes passed, coworker wasn’t back yet, and sure enough she walked by. She was heading down the stairs, and as she walked past me, she told me to enjoy my lunch. Quickly sad thank you but wasn’t able to actually form a proper sentence.

I watched her go down the stairs and up another balcony. My coworker sat down for lunch and we had a conversation. But as we did that, I know it was rude, I kept looking over my shoulder to spot her. Still being caught by something about her, I cannot explain. Until at some point I thought to myself to give it a rest. Again, very sorry, I know it’s creepy AF. We continued our lunch and conversations and got back to work. It was a quarter to one at this point, and I had another meeting planned at 1. I went to grab another coffee. There are a couple of kitchen islands in the inner ring, and then also on the balconies. I went to the one close to me on the balcony, as that was one with oat milk which I actually like better. Grabbed my coffee and just enjoyed some me-time with my coffee looking over the ground floor where people were still enjoying their lunch. At some point I looked down, and there she was again. But as I looked down, she looked straight up. Already felt way too creepy so I just looked away and walked away back to my desk and waited there for the next meeting to start.

The rest of the day I found myself thinking about her. I still didn’t quite know what it was that made me so invested in her. Thought she looked somewhat familiar, but couldn’t figure out from what. Later that night, staying at the hotel, as I worked again at the Amsterdam office the day after, I tried to figure out who she was. Slightly pissed at myself, because yet again I didn’t have the courage to actually start a conversation. It was near impossible to find anything. Maybe I’m not that good at online stalking. I reactivated my Facebook for a minute to see if I could find anything, but without any luck. Neither on LinkedIn nor Instagram. To be fair, all I had was the company she worked for, as they all were wearing a sweater with the name on it. Found the company on LinkedIn and Instagram, but no luck quickly scanning for employees. I ended up messaging the owner of the company saying I enjoyed their work in both our offices as well as a compliment to the workers at the office that day. Didn’t want to ask or say much more. The only thing that I figured out is that the company providing all the greenery is actually a company that is close to my home / were I grew up. So, with that in mind it could be that I actually had seen her before, unknowingly, as we could have walked past each other in the city for example.

Apparently, my mind wasn’t convinced of letting her go just yet, as she appeared in my dream that night. Nothing weird or sexual, just that she was sitting at a table telling jokes and no one seemed to get it but I was falling out of my chair laughing. The same smile she gave me in the office, she gave me in my dream and after that we were playing football and badminton in a big indoor sports field. To be honest, no clue what that last part came from, because it was weird. Buckets of water being thrown by a bunch of people.

The next day at the office went by quickly. She was still on my mind, still trying to figure out if, and if so, where I knew her from and why she was still on my mind. Got home at about 10 in the evening and pretty much straight went to bed. I woke up a couple of times between dreams. She didn’t appear in the dreams, but I recall myself talking to people that knew her and told me her name. Every time I (think I) woke up I thought to myself to look up that name in combination with the company’s name in the hopes to find her. To my knowledge that happened two or three times before waking up in the morning. The issue is that I’m not 100% sure that I actually woke up and thought that or that I was just still sleeping, as I have been having that issue lately of not being able to tell which part I dreamt and which part was real.

But to my sad discover, I didn’t look anything up during the night to find her. And of course, I cannot remember the name that was told to me in my dreams. At this point she’s still in my head, I’m still trying to figure out if I can think of the name, if I can think of where I could possibly know her from. But no luck, so I think this will be yet another case for me of meeting someone I should have started a conversation with but didn’t. Probably will remember this for the years to come, and hopefully next time I will have more confidence to actually say something.

If only I had said Hi to her.

\----

Edit: Again, it’s not just physical attraction in these cases. There are plenty of people that look amazing that just walk by and as soon as they are no longer in my central vision they’re also out of my mind. Thankfully. In these situations, first and foremost I feel like they would be amazing additions to one’s life, whether it’s as a friend, an acquaintance or a partner.

Edit 2: I am not shy to start a conversation with random people I meet, whether it’s somewhere public, at work or for example during sport. This because I do not care all too much about what other people think about me.  Couldn’t care less if someone finds me weird, annoying or stupid. But somehow when they have this ‘special’ vibe around them I do choke up. Might be that in these cases I do lack the self-confidence because somewhere in my mind I do care about their opinion and therefor don’t find myself good enough to stark a conversation.

Edit 3: In addition to edit 3: This sure is something I want to work on. Physical appearance surely is part of that, although the only thing I can change about that is getting back into (a less round) shape. But with that, hopefully also comes more confidence to not have this happen again in the future.",1,1740145016.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

Currently I am at a fitness retreat in Thailand for the express purpose of losing weight, all the food I eat here is tracked in a webpage and broken down into its macros. I do not cheat like some people here only eating out once a week and quite conservatively when I do (maybe 1k calories on a big cheat). 

The program consists of 6 days a week
- 2 hours of walking in a hilly environment a day (I break it up into 4 30 min session because it's hot as balls here) 
- one hour weight training alternating areas of the body daily 
- calorie and macro counted meals 3 times a day with the possibility of healthy snacks (yogurt, veggies, hard boiled egg) 
-massage and rest

I came in weighing 154kg (340lbs) and have lost 4~ kg in the 2 months I've been here

I had my RMR tested at the hospital with results of   3085 cal a day  (I also did a dexa scan for my body comp which seems to be worse than the one I did 6 ish months before coming) 

In a day I eat an average of 1800-2400cal, 200-250g protein,  100-150g carb, 65-90g fat, with more on Sundays around 2800cal 

Some further background, I have done a similar program to this working out much less and eating much less and managed to gain muscle and shed weight like a dream. And losing weight if I actually apply myself consistently has never been a huge issue for me, the issue being maintaining consistency. I have encountered major plateaus before but never at the start line like this. 

Going to the doctor for my RMR appointment was interesting and frustrating as it gave me greater detail into what my body is doing as a baseline but no actual answers. The sports medicine tech advised that I burn too little fat while sleeping and too much carb and shouldn't drink coffee after 12pm and that I should take some supplements. The doctor said my blood sugar, hormones, etc, are in the normal range or only slightly elevated and that I should avoid fruit in Thailand because of how sugary it is (first time a doctor ever told me don't eat fruit lol)

So yeah I'll try to clarify anything that needs it but I've got one month and 10 days left in the program and I've seen so little progress to where I would argue I've seen none. WTH am I doing wrong? I'm nearly frustrated to tears and my wallet is certainly crying. ",1,1740144368.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

(Flashback – Linda is still pregnant. Jack is pacing excitedly, rambling about the future.)

Jack:
And then I’ll teach him how to throw a baseball, we’ll toss around the old pigskin, and when he’s old enough—bam! I’ll pass down my lucky baseball cap. He’ll be a miniature version of his old pops!

Linda (raising an eyebrow):
And how do you know she won’t be a girl?

Jack (waving her off):
Pfft! Don’t ruin this with your woman voodoo, Linda. When a father knows, he knows. I’m having myself a boy.

Linda (smirking):

(She leans in, making direct eye contact, and then chants under her breath like a mischievous witch):

Congratulations! It’s a girl!

Jack (throwing his hands up):

Present Day – Ness Comes Out
Ness (nervous, taking a deep breath):
I’ve been thinking a lot about who I am… and I just—I need you to know that I’m a guy. I’m trans. I was assigned female at birth, but that’s not who I am. I’m your son.

Linda (calmly sipping tea):
Honey, we’re both really proud of you for being yourself. And, uh… especially your father.

(Jack skids back into the room, dramatically places his old baseball cap on Ness’s head, and shoves a baseball bat into his hands.)

Jack (beaming):
Come on, son! Your old man’s got years of lost time to make up for. First baseball, then football, then I’ll teach you how to slide into home like a real pro—

Ness (blinking, still processing):
I… I don’t actually know how to play baseball—

I actually felt like a noticeable crash and felt pretty depressed bc I didn’t notice any difference.

Titrated up to 40mg- kinda the same but in the when I spoke with my dr I just explained that I wasn’t sure what it was doing so he told me to take 1.5 doses (60mg) and see how I feel.

Monday on 60mg, feels god, I’m at work and I’m actually performing well instead of trying to do as little as possible while flying under the radar, Tuesday is the same. But the side effects are bad, extreme dry mouth- sore spot on my tongue.

Wednesday- I take my dose, side effects are gone, my tongue feels fine. But I’m kinda like did I even take the full dose or did i forget and only take 1/2? Thursday is the same but I definitely took my dose.

I just dk how I’m meant to feel. Like when they kick in- I don’t get that sort of *buzzed* feeling anymore which I understand you’re not supposed to get. But I notice it, my brain just feels a bit faster and I feel chatty, I wanna speak to people (this is good, I’m normally too much in my head to speak too much) but at some point a couple hours later that disappears, I don’t know if that’s wearing off or maybe I’m doing fine and don’t notice.

I convinced myself the meds were having no effect this morning and had a cup of coffee in the morning (and no food, when I normally have a decent breakfast) - I was clearly wrong here as I’ve felt terrible and jittery for hours now so I’ve learned my lesson there.

Sorry for the ramble I’m just concerned because I don’t know how this is meant to go and would like a bit of insight from others.

The roaster does her thing at home, and uses all single origin from Vietnam. There’s sacks of green beans all over the shop, and lots of good vibes. 

I tried six arabicas, two robustas, and one cherry tea. Most I tried in the Phin Den style Vietnam is famous for, but had a couple pour overs as well. All very tasty! My favorite was the Yellow Caturra (anaerobic natural), Arabica (anaerobic natural), and Robusta (natural) which had the strongest taste of whiskey that was very surprising. The cherry tea was super refreshing as well. They sold out of the robusta, so I only took two bags with me. 

Regarding robusta… she says that all of it is sourced for the commercial market. It’s harder for her to get access to the green to roast herself. But she keeps it in the shop to serve the locals as they prefer it. She just had three specialty robustas in the shop and some of the pre ground to keep folks happy. 

I found out more about the butter fried beans mentioned in my last post. It turns out this is an old war time practice when resources were scarce. They would often cut the roasts with soy beans and corn. The butter is often not good quality as well. I was told I can find these in street carts, but was warned it may be moldy and make me sick. I’ll take her word for it. 

Given that the favorite out here is milky (cow or condensed) her shop is actually struggling. If not the high season, she’s without customers that appreciate the 3rd wave coffee. If you’re in Hue, definitely check her out and leave some space in your suitcase. ",4,1740143983.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False
1iuqp0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1iuqp0h/value_of_larger_kitchen_vs_dining_room/,Value of larger kitchen vs “dining room”,"Looking for some confirmation on what’s more valuable as my husband and I are in a disagreement. We purchased our first home in 2022. We plan to live here for at least five more years but do anticipate trying to sell after that so we like to make sure we are keeping in mind how any house projects will impact resale value in the future while also balancing our own desires for comfort in our home.

When we moved into the house, the prior owners had already removed the wall between the kitchen and dining room to make the kitchen larger and more open. I am happy they did that as otherwise the kitchen would feel really small, but after living in the house for a few years, I am finding that this made the “dining room” just space for a second a kitchen table that we only use when we need more seating. With that, I proposed getting a larger table in our kitchen nook that could seat 6-8 people and then using the current dining space to expand the kitchen. My idea would be to fill in the back wall (11 feet) with two additional pantries, additional cabinets, a wine refrigerator down below, and additional counter space to be used for a coffee nook, etc.

My husband is concerned that this will make the house feel smaller since we are technically getting rid of square footage by installing cabinets on what is now open floor and also that it would turn off potential buyers that there is no “dining room”.

My thought is that it will make the kitchen seem much larger and that we didn’t really have a “dining room” to begin with, just a large kitchen table and that by getting a bigger kitchen table, we are not losing anything.

Including pictures below of what the space looks like today and what I am imagining for the kitchen extension (imagine it with two pantries on each end though). Curious to hear from the real estate sub to help us settle this debate in what would be more valuable to potential buyers.

i (19f) was recently diagnosed in September 2024 with combined ADHD (hyperactive, impulsive and inattentive) and am now on 60mg Vyvanse. 

Before my meds i was constantly in a state of anxiety, fatigue and was extremely overeating. i developed a horrible habit of constantly buying takeout no matter how expensive it was nearly every single day and got to about 95kg (i’m 5’3)

after my meds i have literally lost 26kg (am now 69kg) because the appetite suppression is so intense. Most of my anxiety is gone (apart from when the coffee and the meds peak at the same time lmao) and i am now a lot more productive than i used to be. However, I’ve also developed the worst insomnia i’ve ever experienced. It will get to 2am sometimes and im still up and not tired at all, and also realising i haven’t eaten anything yet. I’m ending up going to bed at 5am a lot of the time now and waking up at 2pm. this is turning into a viscous cycle because the later i take my meds the later i manage to go to sleep..

I do feel a lot happier in my body though and i feel alot healthier, however my mental health is not on the same wavelength. My suicidal ideations are the worst they’ve been in a long time and im finding myself feeling extremely depressed and i can’t manage to kick myself out of it. i’m not sure if im burnt out from working 6 days a week and being a broke teenager alongside some other family issues..

i am going through an extremely stressful/ difficult time with my life in general at the moment and am not sure if my meds are worsening it or helping? Would anyone be able to tell me if theyve gone through anything similar and if it’s the meds or not? maybe both?

My meds have been life changing for me in the best way possible but im never able to tell what is an affect of my meds anymore or what is just my mental state. I am an intelligent girl and gather that eating probably around 400-900 calories a day definitely isn’t going to help my mental health in any way but i just do not enjoy food anymore? i do not ever get hungry, its like a chore now. like how you have to water a plant just so that it doesn’t die.

Every time i wake up i feel suuuper low like literally opening my eyes and crying because i hate life, and then my meds make me feel alot better. idk. idek what im really asking to be honest i just feel like i needed to vent and see if anyone could give some advice/relate? it would help a lot.

Some necessary details I suppose: 

I'm 19 years old, turning 20 this year, I currently weigh around 103.9 kg or 229.06 lbs and I'm 5'1 ft tall. I'm a college student on a small allowance, and my campus' gate has a lot of street vendors + fast food chains. (Notably, McDonald's) 

I have started on a 1,590 calorie deficit (I do believe that's the term, I apologize, I am not super educated on this) and I am struggling, to put it bluntly.

I don't have the best self control, and I have a very weird relationship with food due to my upbringing. I eat around 500-600 calories every dinner, but the rest of the day is up to me due to how my classes are. I, unfortunately, have recognized I spend a lot on snacks and heavy meals even if I'm full.

I am not comfortable putting any photos up but I am definitely overweight/obese. My doctor has told me that I need to lose weight for my health, but I've been fluctuating between 102-104 kg.

I only have the very basic knowledge of cooking (eggs) but I know how to bake. I would like to ask for tips in general? Just general stuff, what to do and what not to do. 

How do you not want to eat in the morning? Do I drink something like tea or coffee to curb my appetite, or do I chew on something like gum to keep myself occupied? What kind of meals should I look up so I can prep for myself?

I'm very scared on posting here since I don't use Reddit often, so it might take some time for me to respond.

1iuqnwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iuqnwd/troubled_marriage_after_only_2_months/,Troubled marriage after only 2 months,"

The friendship 

I (27F) recently got married to my best friend and current husband (24M). We have been good friends for 2 years then he confessed to me and expressed that he had feelings for me all throughout the past 2 years when I just saw him as a friend. I was very hesitant but after a month of thinking and considering this potential relationship I said why not? Why shouldn't I give this good guy a chance? And I agreed to be his girlfriend.

The relationship 

We dated for 4 more years after deciding to tie the knot in late 2024. We did have ups and downs in our relationship and I had always complained about some specific communication issues we have but I decided to always see the bigger picture and that overall he was still a very decent guy. 

The marriage 

Issues between our respective families started to arise a bit after the engagement party. His mother started to show signs of narcissism and superiority complex and she would often say insensitive comments which could be hurtful. For Instance, in the engagement party which over 45 people attended she was given the mic and said: ""I believe my son is too young, he's still very young and I just can't say no to my kids"" (in fact he had to cry and protest for them to agree that he married me because they were against the idea the first time he brought it up). And every time we gather for lunch or just a coffee she had to mention again that his dad was strongly against this marriage and how she begged and convinced him to finally agree. 

The tears on my wedding 

On the wedding day, she was ordering my mother around: Do this, give me that etc. and my mom was already fed up with her but just stayed composed to not hurt me or my husband. I cried on my wedding day because his mom was rushing everyone to serve dinner very soon and therefore I had to show up in the wedding hall without the presence of my sister nor closest friends. I feel so pressured to do things the way she wanted because she was paying for the food and dj expenses while I paid for my clothes and offered the venue. While I was changing into different outfits she kept coming in and out of my changing room and not even once had she smiled at me or said I looked fine or just nice. To add insult to injury she 'accidently' spilled 2 cups of juice on my rented dress and I had to stop the ceremony of Henna and run to the changing room to get the next outfit. That dress was the one I was looking forward to the most and couldn't even get family pictures with it. With many more stressing small events, the wedding eventually ended and we went to a hotel we booked. 

The traumatic next day

In Moroccan traditions there is a second day celebration that the bride's mother organises on the 1st official day as a newlywed bride. We went to my mom's and she had already prepared plenty of food and delicious sweets to welcome us as a newly married couple and the groom's family as well. My mom asked his mom what to do with the huge amount of left over food that because of the caterer went almost all bad. His mom suddenly goes into a hysterical mode, screaming and shouting. She shouted racial slurs and made me and my family feel like nothing. The scene was too shocking that my husband went upstairs crying and all his siblings and her family were crying without saying a word. She kept screaming and ranting for nearly 2 hours while my mom decided to not say anything back and stayed quiet the whole time feeling bad for all my in-law family crying. It was traumatic to say the least. After saying every toxic, insensitive degrading and hurtful comment possible, his mom left and affirmed that she will not mend things unless my mother who has been quiet this whole time kisses her forehead and apologizes. 


The aftermath

The days following the incident were just filled with confusion and almost denial of what happened but later it hits. And it hit me hard! I was crying almost every night because of this. Especially that my husband just wanted to pretend like nothing happened and disregard the hurt and humiliation my family and I had to suffer from. My mother went into a depressive state where not only she misses me, she was insulted and reduced to nothing without a chance to retaliate and she is very concerned about the hardships I will most likely face dealing with such a rude and narcissistic mother-in-law. I did not feel any support from my husband because he thinks I'm making a big deal out of nothing and I should stop my own suffering by stopping to think about what happened. He is an overall good husband, he helps me with house chores and gets me nice gifts and gestures here and there but I feel like none of this matters to me of I don't feel emotionally safe and protected. I was forced to go visit his family and his mom because he would fell upset and hurt if I don't. Moreover after 2 months living together I'm realizing his stomach issues and eating preferences and neat-freak habits are adding more pressure on my shoulders. 

Is marriage supposed to be this hard?

I'm at a point where I don't know if marriage is supposed to be this hard, or if I just married the wrong person and married into the wrong family. Maybe I'm just being too dramatic and I should indeed just forget about it and let such a good relationship fall over the first obstacle. I can't lie, there were some very good days and sweet moments we shared but now I don't feel loved and I'm loosing joy in the smallest things in life. I still cry every now and then feeling stuck and unsure about this marriage anymore because I don't feel heard nor understood. 

Meeting the MIL tomorrow for closure

Because he doesn't have the courage to tell his mother what she did was wrong on so many levels, I will be meeting her tomorrow to tell her exactly how I feel and I'm really not sure which way it will go. I'm scared I'm ruining a potentially good marriage after only 2 months. What do you think?",1,1740143840.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Cupid's bow just got an upgrade—it's now powered by artificial intelligence. Yes, AI is not only reshaping industries and automating tasks but also making its way into our love lives. But as we rush to chat with our AI-enabled dating apps, let’s pause and ask: is this the end of romantic candlelight dinners or just a quirky new chapter in the age-old saga of love?

### The AI Interference: Love's New BFF or Frenemy?

AI has slipped into romance with the subtlety of a third wheel on a first date. It's offering personalized love advice and crafting smooth opening lines that could melt even the iciest of hearts. Great news for introverts, but maybe not so much for hopeless romantics longing for authenticity.

**Pros:**
- **Conversation Savvy**: No more awkward silences. AI helps you avoid saying, ""So, do you like stuff?"" eight times in a row.
- **Emotion Tracking Apps**: Helping you figure out if you're vibing with Mr./Ms. Right—or just hangry.

**Cons:**
- **False Expectations**: AI might set the bar so high that the Harrys and Harriets in the real world seem like emotional chimps.
- **Increased Scams**: As AI evolves, so do online romance scammers—making it harder to spot phonies before they prey on emotions and bank accounts.

### Love and the Unseen Emotions

Ask any relationship guru, and they'll say love is about the unspoken as much as the spoken. Here’s the wrinkle: AI doesn’t (yet) comprehend those saccharine looks exchanged over coffee or decode your heart’s skipped beats the way a human can. 

Our digital companions can't pick up on emotional nuances—those fleeting smiles or the way your eyes light up talking about your pet iguana. This gap can lead to unrealistic expectations when we interface with real people who, let's admit it, can be gloriously imperfect.

### The Rise of Romance Scams: Love in the Time of Algorithms

In the shadow of heart emojis and AI-generated love notes lurks a darker side: romance scams. Online platforms are breeding grounds for cyber love predators who skillfully exploit emotional vulnerabilities for financial gain. While technology aims to aid romantic connections, it also empowers digital Don Juans and femme fatales with robust tools for deceit.

### Conclusion: A New Age of Love

AI might be encouraging connectivity and offering us ways to manage (or at least identify) emotions better, yet it throws us into a tango with expectations. Machines can be our wingmen, but they can't replace the thrill of real human engagement.

So, dear readers, what’s your take on AI’s romance revolution? 😘 Have you navigated the tricky waters of AI-assisted love, or do you dare keep it unapologetically analog? Share your Valentine’s Day victories and catfishing horror stories below!",1,1740143667.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I want to make some signs and get speakers to play music so we can drown out their hatred and bigotry. Maybe if this is something people are interested in doing more than once, we could make it a recurring thing. 

Anyway, I’m thinking next Friday would be a good day to start. We could be there from 9-1 like they are, bring some coffee and donuts and party for planned parenthood! Let me know if you’re interested and we could start a signal chat :)

1iuqhk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthonyBourdain/comments/1iuqhk2/tony_and_coffee/,Tony And Coffee,"Okay, we know Tony liked coffee; he can be seen drinking it in numerous episodes of his shows.  E.g., in the Los Angeles episode of  The Layover, he can be seen lounging outside his bungalow with coffee, vowing that ""I ain't goin' anywhere.  I'm stayin' right the f\*ck here.""

Yet, Tony exhibits an odd ambivalence to the beverage.  The San Francisco episode of No Reservations ends with Tony enjoying a breakfast of Anchor Steam beer, a double cheeseburger, and chili cheese fries at Red's Java House -- where, Tony says, ""Wine is a dollar, and espresso is nowhere to be seen.""  What's the problem with espresso?

In the Seattle episode of the Layover (one of my favorites), Tony says:  ""There is no culture around coffee.  Coffee is a beverage, not a culture.""  Later, he adds:  ""Alcohol is a social event.  Because there's a possibility that you're gonna get drunk and say something mildly amusing.  There's a possibility of something interesting happening.""

Isn't the same thing true with coffee?  Some of my most important friendships and intimate relationships started with going out for coffee -- for espresso drinks, no less.

Did Tony believe he was attacking alleged pretentiousness over coffee?  Or was he merely being provocative?

Curiously, in the San Francisco episode of The Layover, Tony promotes Blue Bottle Coffee, where he notes that one can obtain siphon-style coffee brewed with extremely expensive machines that are usually found only in Tokyo.

Siphon-style coffee is a hell of a lot more esoteric than espresso.

What's up with Tony's seemingly shifting attitude towards high-end coffee?",8,1740143298.0,AnthonyBourdain,9,0.9,False

To give you a context, people say, both girls and boys, that I have this innocent aura, that I seem incapable of wrongdoing. And I think because of this aura, usually men who are already taken, most are married, are attracted to me. One of my males co-workers even commented that I look innocent but wild in the sheets. Hmm I agree to that statement to some degree, but I’m not the type of woman who engages in casual relationships, you know. To be honest, I sometimes feel hurt and/or degraded when I think about the fact of the audacity of these already taken men still trying to fling with me. 

Recently, another encounter with a taken man that triggered me to post here. This taken man was my classmate before, we dated once but I felt so disappointed because I believed he was not up to a serious relationship. Here comes after five years, he replied to a story I posted in social media and messaged me casually inviting me to have coffee with him. In fact, I felt the message was so random because though we were in the same community, we never interacted again after the first date. Then fortunately I knew later that he is already married. It’s just frustrating that this person is trying once again to disturb my peaceful life and hurtful at the same time because why I keep encountering these kind of men? Is there something wrong with my aura? with my behavior? But I actually act modest and polite always, seemingly reserved person. I am even regarded as strong, independent woman and a licensed professional at the same time. So the question is why I am attracting these kind of men?? It’s making me question my self worth😔

1iuqf9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1iuqf9h/my_mother/,My mother...,"I'm 40 years old, 33 weeks pregnant with my second. My toddler son is 3. It's a difficult, high risk and painful pregnancy. The first time around I was not in so much pain. There are days were I literally cannot walk. I WFH and my job is quite demanding but I make sure my son and husband are taken care off. I have a nanny / helper for a few hours a day and my son goes to play school until 3pm. 

Here's the rant. I am feeling a lot of pain and I have zero to no energy. I barely eat because food is just yuck to me. I do my best but I am barely surviving at this point.

My mother who lives in another city, 600kms away constantly texts me and this is how all her messages read ""Hi doll, trust you are well. How's <sons nickname>. Send pics"" that's it. She's never asked me once how I felt or said anything decent apart from telling me I'm huge. She and my dad do this all the time. Mind you I have lost weight during this pregnancy. I have been admitted to hospital due to complications etc. She and my dad visited for my sons birthday 2 weeks ago and after 4 days they left to go home. Yet they stay at my sisters place for a month at a time to ""help"" She never once asked how I am or helped with anything. My feet were swollen and painful after they left because I was on my feet from 6am until 10pm every night. Cooking and washing up after them. She would just ask if my helper was coming the next day and would leave her dirty dishes in the sink. She'd also wake up at about 9am every morning saying she's so tired. This is after my husband left for work and my son was in school. No help with anything. My dad would make her breakfast and lay it out for her. On my sons birthday she work a casual suit with heels and went to his playschool for his birthday party at school. Then when some of my ininlaws came over for tea and cake...she just sat. I have to prep coffee, snacks, lay the table with cups and cool drinks and then clean it all away. My MiL was pissed and said out loud ""why are you not getting the help that you need"" This has always behavior mother's behavior but I think last night's text set me off and I did not respond. She also always tries make sure my son loves her more than me and always makes comments about how my son looks just like my husband. I don't care tbh but seriously, this kid looks like me as a toddler and a lot of people have said so. Even when he was born and she came to my house to visit, she congratulated my husband but the first thing she told me is that I am feeding my son all wrong. When I was in active labour and my husband shared a pic on the family chat she reply telling me to pull my mask up (it was during Covid). She also always made comments like how my son looked pissed off at my in pics but was so in love with my husband. My son was prem and was a surprise delivery and in NICU for 2 weeks. Based on my history, she keeps telling me I must make sure I carry to term. Yes because I fucking have control of that. I am on meds to prevent it but she literally called my son backwards for not walking or having teeth at 12 months because it was my fault he was born prem. Those 2 weeks in NICU she literally berated me whenever she could and shouted at me constantly. He biggest issues with me was that i was embarrassing her because I was not answering calls from her family. She also had a massive issue because my husband created a group for the grandparents to give them updates on his daily progress and she went off because my sister and her husband were not included in this group. I later found out that my brother in law created a seperate group for my parents and him and my sister to chat daily but I was never included. He created this group in 2021 before I was married or had a child.

She's now jealous that I am moving in with my in laws for 2 months because my MIL offered to help me as she sees the pain I am in and she also wants to throw my baby shower party. I mentioned it at dinner when my parents were visiting and my mother dead ass looked at my father and spoke about the food being nice. Also the night before my sons birthday I was speaking to my husband about how my water broke and how we took it in our stride and how amazing that whole process was and how we were not prepared but we made it through. We always reminisce at 7.30pm the night before his birthday because it's special to us. She was listening to this and literally cuts us off and starts speaking about what my sister went through during labour and made the whole thing about my sister. She does this a lot. She goes on and on about my sister and brother in law especially when she's speaking to my in laws. My sister lives in Europe and we don't have a relationship thanks to my mother's influence over my sister. During my pregnancy, only my dad texts or calls  once or twice a month to do a check in and speak to my son. 

Anyway, this is long. I'm just so upset. I have noone to speak to and if I stand up for myself or say something I am labeled hormonal or her favorite, bi-polar. There's more to this story. She's even attacked me on my wedding day, she and my sister told me I look like a drag queen with my make up. They spoilt the whole day and experience but for my sisters wedding my mother acted like it was a fairytale. Honestly I'm so annoyed...and it all started with a text last night.

# A+ Content for a Professional Amazon Look

# Develop a Compelling Brand Story

Remember that customers only buy from trustworthy brands, and a good [brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-your-amazon-brand-story-matters-more-than-your-product-specs/) can help you differ from the competitors. Using the A+ Content “Brand Story” module, retailers can communicate their journey, values and mission, creating increases in credibility and emotional connections with shoppers.

 

# Why It Matters

A [brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-is-amazons-brand-story-significant-for-your-brand/) establishes trust and makes your brand feel more relatable. If potential customers are clear on the vision for your products, they’re more likely to select your brand than a competitor’s.

 

# How to Do It Right

* Begin with your mission: Tell us why you started your brand.
* Highlight important milestones: Demonstrate brand achievements and awards.
* Include genuine images: Share photos from behind the scenes or a team introduction.
* Make it short and sweet: Use a few short paragraphs—audience-focused, not you-focused.

 

# Example

For example, a sustainable skincare brand that sells organic face serums could use A+ Content to provide details about its eco-friendly mission. The of writing off their use of recyclable packaging, a timeline of their journey, and an image of their founder explaining why she decided to create clean beauty products.

 

Telling a story, customers can identify with can create brand loyalty and lead to conversion. In a world where shoppers are more inclined to support [Amazon FBA brands](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-amazon-resources-empower-amazon-fba-brands/) they connect with, the Brand Story module is an invaluable asset to A+ Content.

 

# Why Use High Quality Lifestyle Images 

Good quality **listing images** are so important to purchase decisions. Whereas product images on a white background are usual, [lifestyle images](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) that demonstrate real-world usage give customers a sense of how it may fit into their everyday life.

 

# Why It Matters

Lifestyle images provide context, size and function of a product, and an emotional connection. Amazon shoppers are more likely to purchase from listings that use relatable use-case scenarios.

 

# How to Do It Right:

* Use some great examples: Show the product in action.
* Diversity of backgrounds: Pick settings similar to your audience.
* Keep high resolution: Clear and professional-looking images

 

Visually highlight the key benefits: Rather than using heavy text to explain product value, allow **listing images** to do the talking.

 

# Example

For example, an **Amazon FBA** seller of yoga mats may include lifestyle images of a person practicing on the mat in a studio or at home. Instead of just showing the rolled-up mat, the images can showcase a couple of yoga postures, non-slip grip, and the comfortable thickness.

Including lifestyle images adds a 3D shopping experience that helps shoppers visualize the product in their lives. This can result in increased likelihood of engagement and conversion rates.

 

# Use Infographics to Highlight Its Key Features 

There are also [Amazon infographics](https://amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/) that get your product benefits across quickly. They pair graphics with short text, which make information easier to digest.

 

# Why It Matters

 

In fact, most shoppers don’t read [product descriptions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/amazon-debuts-generative-ai-tools-that-helps-sellers-write-product-descriptions/). Just make sure you choose to highlight the most important product aspects in an easy and understandable format.

 

# How to Do It Right

* New design with simple icons and graphics: Show features through visual representations rather than text only
* Text should be short and impactful: Not lengthy descriptions.
* Avoid overusing color contrast: Color contrast is a great way to emphasize certain points but pick moments to use it strategically so as not to confuse the viewer.
* So zero in on the headline benefits: things that are most important to customers.

 

# Example

For example, a noise-canceling headphones seller might use an infographic to explain:

* Battery life: “40 hours on a single charge” followed by an icon of a battery.
* Sound quality: “Premium HD audio,” with a speaker icon
* Bluetooth range: “Seamless connectivity up to 30 feet” along with a Wi-Fi signal icon.

Infographics serve as a visual aid to condense and communicate information clearly. Bringing it to a more customer-level engagement and higher conversions

 

# Describes A Comparison Table To Highlight Your Advantages 

A comparison chart lets you showcase your product’s benefits over the competition in a straightforward, side-by-side comparison. That helps customers easily see why your product is better.

 

# Why It Matters

When consumers are shopping, they often explore many products before they buy. A well-laid-out comparison chart can save them time, and this can also sway the decision in your favor.

 

# How to Do It Right

* Select comparison factors that make sense: Decide on the elements that can set your product apart.
* Design with clarity: The less clutter, the easier it is to read the information.
* Show your strengths: Always keep your product distinct in the chart.
* Price vs general market standards — no mentioning competitor product names to comply with Amazon policies

A laptop **Amazon FBA** seller can create a chart:

 

||
||
|**Feature**|**Our Laptop**|
|**Battery Life**|12 hours|
|**Display**|4K Ultra HD|
|**Weight**|Lightweight (2.5 lbs)|

 

# Leverage Customer Testimonials and Reviews

Reviews are critical in building trust, and displaying positive testimonials in A+ Content can add further substance to the reviews and influence buying decisions. Customers don’t really trust retailers when they say their products are good, and the social proof factor works in their favor here, especially buying brands on Earth. 

 

# How to Use Customer Testimonials Effectively

 Sellers should not only include them in their product descriptions, but they should also keep in mind to highlight the specific benefits a customer gained from the product according to a review; use reviews from verified buyers for credibility, and present them in a readable way, with **listing images** where possible, print. 

* A fitness equipment brand can showcase a testimonial of a customer who lost weight using their treadmill, along with some before and after images. Using Positive Reviews in [A+ Content](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-resolve-a-content-upload-issues-on-amazon-fba/) helps gain more trust from short priced buyers.

 

# Use CTA (Call-to-action) Elements

A strong call to action (CTA) emphasizes what you want the customer to do next, whether that is purchase, sign up for updates, or discover more about the product. Many buyers need some direction before completing a purchase, and a good CTA can change the game. 

* In this regard, **Amazon FBA** sellers should make sure that their CTA is action-oriented, with words like “Buy Now,” “Upgrade Your Experience,” or “Limited-Time Offer,” and that they are placed within the content for the most impact, and mention urgency when possible. 
* For instance, an electronics seller might use a CTA such as “Order Today and Get Free Shipping” to motivate customers to buy right away. Effective Call To Action (CTA) drives better conversion and sales performance.

 

# Test Your A+ Content with an A/B Test

Even top A+ Content will likely require some tweaks to reach peak performance. A/B testing (split testing) is a method where **Amazon FBA** sellers may use to compare multiple versions of their content to see which performs better.

 Sellers can test various **listing images**, text and layouts to determine what optimizes for higher conversions. 

* For sustainable A/B testing, sellers need to modify a single factor at a time, use Amazon’s “Manage Your Experiments” tool to create A/B tests if eligible, analyze results relative to engagement and conversion rates, and add any successful elements for the long term. 

Such as a skincare brand that tests two versions of A+ Content — one featuring an infographic showcasing top ingredients and the other featuring a before-after comp. If the before-and-after performs better, the Amazon FBA seller can use that as the final product. 

The real customer data from A/B testing allows sellers to refine and enhance their listings to engage their targeted audience more effectively and ultimately stimulate higher sales.

 

# Remove Irrelevant Keywords

# Identify Non-Converting Keywords

These keywords are search terms that generate clicks to an [Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/essential-steps-for-amazon-sellers-after-launching-an-amazon-listing/) but result in no purchases. While these keywords can get views, if they don’t convert viewers into buyers, they damage the overall performance of the listing. 

To find these types of keywords, **Amazon FBA** sellers can pull Amazon’s Search Term Report in Seller Central. This report shows you the keywords pulling in clicks but not purchases. 

This means that either there is no intent between these two groups, in which case the target audience is inappropriately defined, or the keyword is not applicable to a huge proportion of the target audience.

* For instance, let’s say a seller was selling luxury leather handbags. If their product is being shown to budget-conscious shoppers without the keyword “cheap handbags,” which filters out the budgeted shoppers, their product is still getting exposure but at the cost of extra ad money spent in vain on these shoppers who will never buy an expensive bag. 

Other customers will click on the listing, but see the price and move on, which can hurt conversion rates. To remedy this, the seller should delete “cheap” from its backend search terms and instead optimize for words like “genuine leather handbags” or “designer handbag for women.”

This includes sellers cutting out ineffective keywords. Both ensure higher conversion and higher listing ranking on amazon. A product with a high conversion rate tells Amazon’s algorithm that it is a relevant and valuable product, and therefore stands a better chance of getting higher placements in search results.

 To continue attracting the right customers, sellers need to frequently monitor keyword performance and remove non performing terms to keep their listing well optimized.

 

# Avoid Generic Terms That Lack Buying Intent

Generic keywords might get you traffic, but not serious buyers. Searches for “best shoes” or “good laptop” are too generic and lack the intent of actual buyers. Shoppers looking for those types of terms are often in the research phase of the buying journey, not necessarily ready to buy. 

To boost sales, **Amazon FBA** sellers need to optimize these vague keywords with more targeted, high-intent phrases.

* For instance, a seller wants to sell gaming laptops might specify instead of using couch words like “good laptop,” they might use product-related, purchase intent keywords such as “high-performance gaming laptop” or “laptop with RTX graphics card.” These phrases appeal to buyers who are already aware of their needs, making them the conversion-catalyst step.

Most of all, Amazon’s search algorithm favors listings that match a customer’s intent to buy. 

* For example, if an **Amazon FBA** seller uses generic keywords they may have their listing display in search results for unrelated questions which results in less engagement and fewer sales.) Moreover, popular keywords are also highly competitive and smaller sellers will often find it difficult to compete with established brands.

Instead of going after generic keywords, sellers should conduct keyword research to identify terms that mirror customer intent. Amazon FBA sellers can fine-tune keyword strategy based on intent-based search terms to improve their relevant listing and attract the target ready-to-purchase customers for sales.

 

# Eliminate Keywords Which Mislead the Customer About the Product

Using ambiguous language in Amazon product descriptions will result in the wrong buyers getting interested which produces higher rates of returns as well as bad reviews that decrease page position. 

Each keyword in your [Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-small-amazon-listing-tweaks-can-lead-to-big-sales/) should precisely depict the product’s characteristics as well as technical details. The use of incorrect terms by **Amazon FBA** sellers attracts faulty customers who end up unsatisfied with their purchase when reality differs from expectations.

* When a wired gaming mouse includes the search term “wireless” in its listing it will appear in results for wireless mouse queries. Customers who seek a wireless option will likely click the listing for a Bluetooth-enabled product. 

Customers will usually provide poor feedback or choose item return or non-purchase after they discover the product uses wires. The user experience deteriorates while the algorithm receives signals that indicate the listing does not match the search terms.

Sellers should conduct consistent keyword checks and remove terms which fail to accurately represent their products. Sellers need to concentrate on showing their products’ real specifications rather than attempting to reach broad consumer groups. 

Sellers who use proper keywords in an authentic way establish customer loyalty and boost sales because their targeted customer base effectively discovers appropriate products.

 

# Eliminate Outdated or Seasonal Keywords

Seasonal keywords function excellently during targeted periods yet destroy visibility after seasons conclude. The market value of keywords tagged to event-specific listings decreases when such events finish. 

* For example holiday items like “Christmas gift for kids” or “Black Friday deals” put specific keywords into disuse. Product listings that contain obsolete search terms will receive lower search rankings from Amazon’s system because they attract customers who are no longer interested.

During cold months sellers of winter coats market their products using the keyword “best winter jackets for extreme cold”. When season transitions take place the total number of customers searching for winter jackets declines. 

The visibility of a listing declines when **Amazon FBA** sellers neglect to update their key phrases which impacts its ability to attract suitable traffic. The sellers should shift their search phrases toward “lightweight spring jackets” and “windproof jackets for spring” which better match contemporary consumer interests.

Physical store success depends on continuous monitoring of market trends followed by keyword adjustments. By analyzing data from search volume tools such as Google Trends and Amazon the seller can spot declining popular seasonal keywords and make needed updates in their listings.

 Strategic updates to keywords help maintain product usability so it attracts customers throughout the entire year.

 

# Eliminate Irrelevant Brand Names

Listing keywords that include competitor brand names may seem like a way to bring in more traffic, but it may have the opposite effect. Amazon’s guidelines restrict **Amazon FBA** sellers from including another brand name in their own backend search terms — list abuse on this count could see listings suppressed or penalized. 

* For example, if a seller is selling generic wireless earbuds, having words like “Apple AirPods” or “Bose headphones” in the backend keywords may help bring shoppers who are looking for those brands. 

When customers receive these products and see they are not Apple or Bose products, they may feel tricked and post a review. This damages the listing’s credibility and also raises returns.

* Sellers should emphasise what sets their products apart instead of competitor names. If the earbuds come with features like noise cancellation or long battery life, keywords such as “noise-canceling wireless earbuds,” and “long-lasting Bluetooth earbuds” will draw the right audience without any confusion. 

Transparency is key in both ensuring compliance with Amazon’s policies and maintaining trust and satisfaction with your customers.

 

# Remove Unnecessary Synonyms and Repetitive Keywords

[Amazon’s A9 algorithm](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-feed-amazon-a9-algorithm-during-product-launch/) automatically takes different versions of keywords into account, so there is no need to build out 100 synonyms for keywords or repeat keywords excessively. Stuffing backend search terms with similar words occupies precious real estate that could be used for more relevant keywords.

 

* So for instance, a seller listing a “waterproof hiking backpack” doesn’t have to add all of those variations like “hiking backpack waterproof,” “waterproof backpack for hiking,” and “It’s All About a backpack hiking waterproof.” Amazon already knows these are related terms.

 **Amazon FBA** sellers will need to leverage other relevant keywords, such as “lightweight trekking backpack” or “durable outdoor backpack,” to increase their opportunities.

But on the other side, if your listing is repetitive, it is too spammy. Instead of repeating “best laptop for students,” sellers should use alternatives, including “affordable student laptop” or “lightweight college laptop.” The well-planned and clean keyword strategy follows an optimized approach for making the listing visible without disturbing the user flow.

 

# Eliminate Poorly Performing PPC Keywords

[Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-amazon-ppc-strategies-for-maximizing-your-advertising-roi/)) campaigns help you understand keyword performance — as in, which keywords convert sales and which do not. PPC performance reports should be checked regularly, and poorly performing keywords should be removed from listings. 

If these keywords see a lot of clicks but fail to result in sales, they can sour both organic rankings and advertising ROI.

* For example, if a **Amazon FBA** seller places an advertisement for “Bluetooth speakers in $30” that receives a very high click-through-rate, but not conversion, then obviously the expectation for the product does not match customer expectation. 
* Targeting this keyword creates wasted spend, and minimizes profitability on the whole. Instead, more effective search keywords for the seller to use might include phrases like “compact wireless speakers ” or “budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers” which better reflect what customers are searching for.

This can significantly enhance their sales performance as removing low-performing PPC keywords and concentrating on high-converting terms can improve the efficiency of paid campaigns and boost organic search ranking.

Some keywords are strictly prohibited by Amazon guidelines. While creating their content, sellers must ensure not to use restricted terms like false claims, medical benefits, prohibited product descriptions, etc.

* For example, a seller of supplements may not use words such as “cures arthritis” or “guaranteed weight loss” because Amazon allows medical claims only with F.D.A. approval. Gen-y does not allow the use of promotional language in listings, so words like “free shipping” or “best price” should not be part of backend search terms, either.

 

# Optimize for Amazon SEO Algorithm Updates

# Focus on High-Intent Keywords

Amazon algorithms A9 and A10 position listings which match specified buyer intent criteria because these terms indicate readiness to make purchases. Sellers achieve better visibility and conversion rates through their efforts on high-intent keyword selection. 

The consumer seeking “best waterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach use” requires a particular product which must provide both durability and portability features. 

* The use of search keywords such as “waterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach” strengthens the probability that buyers will discover the product while searching for purchasing options at the beach.
* Through the use of special search tools **Amazon FBA** sellers can select appropriate long-tail keywords that match their targeted customers’ precise search needs. Products should use specific descriptions such as “best portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker for travel” instead of generic terms “Bluetooth speaker.”

A natural readable flow throughout the listing must be maintained at all times. The use of excessive repeating keywords through keyword stuffing destroys both the readability along with the customer’s overall experience between seller and buyer. 

Refining your product list to meet search engine requirements must not overshadow creating a valuable experience for prospective buyers so you need to strike a careful measure. Targeting high-intent essential terms helps sellers find suitable audience matches and improves both product visibility and conversion chances.

 

# Prioritize Backend Keywords for Better Indexing

The search engine of Amazon uses Backend keywords as secret terms which make products searchable. The algorithm relies on these secret keywords which the product page does not reveal to find matching search queries. 

The strategic use of backend keywords enables massive visibility growth though sellers need to implement them properly.

Amazon supports 250 backend search terms yet **Amazon FBA** sellers should prevent duplicate keywords from title content as well as bullet points and product description content. Including “wireless headphones” within the product title makes further inclusion of this phrase in backend keywords unnecessary. 

* A seller should focus on putting related terms and variations within backend search terms. A product such as Bluetooth headphones requires backend keywords including “noise-canceling Bluetooth earphones,” “over-ear wireless headphones,” and “wireless stereo headphones for working out” to maximize search query coverage.
* Sellers commonly make the error of including excessive irrelevant keywords within their search term backend. The use of terms such as “best” or “cheap” typically proves useless because they conflict with Amazon’s system guidelines and trigger algorithmic detection. 

The search system on Amazon identifies equivalent words and phrases therefore Amazon FBA sellers do not need to use the same term repeatedly to rank their products. Each backend search term should include different specific phrases which will expand the potential for appearing in additional search results.

Exploring an appropriate set of backend keywords allows sellers to boost their product discovery levels while following Amazon’s platform regulations. The improved indexing ability lets sellers get ranked for multiple relevant search inquiries.

 

# Optimize Product Titles with a Balance of Keywords and Readability

[Amazon listings](https://amzonestep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing-your-amazon-listings/) receive their main performance boost from the product title which stands as a crucial element in their rankings. The combination of targeted keywords with text that customers can easily understand produces superior rankings and click-through rates (CTR) in an efficient title. 

Both appropriate keywords and simple readable customer-engaging content need to exist in one title. Amazon provides limited character count for titles yet **Amazon FBA** sellers should maximize their word choice in this space. The optimal title for a wireless vacuum cleaner should appear as follows:

**“XYZ Cordless Vacuum Cleaner – 22 Kpa Suction Power, Lightweight, 2-in-1 for Home & Car Use”**

* The product title sneaks in essential keywords “cordless vacuum cleaner” plus “suction power” and “lightweight” yet adds useful information about being “2-in-1 for home & car use” to attract prospective customers. 

The title combines customer-oriented problem areas with essential features to create both visibility and product value communication.

Repeated use of keywords should be avoided in title content because it leads to clumsy and unappealing texts. 

The addition of excessive repeated words like “best vacuum cleaner” and “powerful vacuum cleaner” within the title does not enhance search rankings since it generates confusion in both readability and comprehension. Place vital keywords and product characteristics into the text in a natural way. 

 

# Engaging and Emphasizing the Bullet Points for Optimization

The Bullet Points – This section of an Amazon listing is an opportunity to get in the features and benefits of a product, so this is an area to focus strongly on optimization.

 Not only is this a crucial aspect of Amazon’s ranking algorithm, but the bullet points are also directly visible to customers, so they must be keyword-optimized as well as persuasive.

When forming bullet points a good practice is to optimize them one by one concentrating from the beginning on the points that initially come to the head of product selling. 

Some of these can be size, color, durability, material, end use, etc. For instance, selling a waterproof backpack, bullet points should immediately communicate what makes that product special:

 

* Waterproof – Completely waterproof with sealed zippers to keep your things safe in any climate
* It holds a 15” laptop and has lots of compartments to keep you organized.
* Durable Materials – Constructed from heavy-duty, abrasion-resistant fabric for durability.

You can also include relevant keywords in the bullet points that help the algorithm understand what the product is and match it to customer searches.

* The keywords “waterproof design” and “heavy-duty fabric,” for example, might be associated with high-intent searches such as “waterproof backpack for hiking.”

 

# Improve Your Product Descriptions with Long-Tail Keywords

As a result, Amazon’s search algorithm is skewed heavily towards long-tail keywords, with more specific customer intent.

* And while broad keywords like “coffee maker” might generate general traffic, long-tail keywords like “best coffee maker for small kitchens” or “easy-to-use single-serve coffee maker” can help sellers bring in more qualified traffic and increase conversions.

Long-tail keywords are usually less competitive which makes it a better chance for new or niche products to appear on top of the search results. Sellers can now target more niche searches with many relevant long-tail phrases scattered throughout their product description and not compete with larger, more established listings.

* A **Amazon FBA** seller selling a smart thermostat, though, can use long-tail keywords such as “energy-efficient smart thermostat for large homes,” “Wi-Fi capable smart thermostat for Alexa” and “programmable thermostat with voice control.” 

These phrases appeal to different kinds of customers, whether they want energy-saving features, compatibility with smart devices or straightforward programming. But do make sure not to go overboard with stuffing [Amazon keywords](https://amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-to-master-amazon-keywords/). 

 

# Get More Customer Reviews and Keep Ratings High

Customer reviews are one of Amazon’s most important ranking algorithm factors. The more positive reviews a product has, the higher it is likely to rank in search results, as positive reviews are indicators of trust and quality.

 Vendors need to keep gathering more reviews while maintaining high ratings in order to improve the ranking.

* Fortunately there are a number of techniques that will help you request reviews without running afoul of Amazon’s rules. One way to go is to utilize Amazon’s Request a Review button, which sends customers a standardized email asking for feedback on their order.

 Sellers can also request a review in their follow-up emails in a friendly way. For example, once a product has been delivered, you might say something as simple as:

 

* “We Hope you’re enjoying your new product! We appreciate reviews to help us improve and serve better.”

That would be Amazon Vine, where trusted reviewers can obtain free products in exchange for honest reviews – just another method to garner some reviews. Positive reviews enhance the reputation of the product, which not only raises rankings but also builds trust in potential customers.

Keeping high ratings is also essential. If you have a negative review, do something about it and try to resolve your customer’s problem. Handling negative feedback professionally demonstrates to potential buyers that the seller is considerate regarding consumer complaints, improving both reviews and conversion rates.

 

# Optimize For Mobile Search And Voice Search

Mobile is where the brand is: Over 60% of Amazon shoppers shop and buy on mobile. Optimizing for mobile search correlates to increased visibility and conversion, making this one of the most important aspects of optimizing listings. 

MOBILE FRIENDLY: Listings must render quickly and use crisp, high resolution listing images with short bullet points and descriptions.

Ease of navigation and readability are key here, especially for mobile users, as they are frequently on the road. This includes making bullet points scannable and making sure that the most compelling features (and evidence) are front loaded. 

Most mobile users want fast access to information, so don’t use extended paragraphs that could overwhelm or confuse potential buyers.

* Amazon’s Alexa is also popularizing another major trending topic: voice search. With the increasing usage of voice commands for customers to search products, it becomes crucial to optimize for voice search. Voice queries are often more conversational, so you’d want to focus on natural language. 

However, instead of targeting “blender”, a voice search keyword might be “What is the best blender for smoothies?”

For voicing search optimization, encompass vocals that are: nearest for how persons speak. This strategy increases visibility in voice-activated queries, so you want your product to show up when someone asks Alexa for recommendations.

 

# Improve Click-Through Rates (CTR) with Compelling Images and Pricing Strategies

Click-through rate (CTR) is an important factor in the Amazon ranking algorithm. Search algorithms favor items with a high click-through rates (CTR). Sellers must improve the [Amazon CTR](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-factors-are-influencing-your-amazon-ctr/) by working out high-quality listing images and attractive pricing ways.

An image is the first aspect your customer gets to see while scrolling through a search result. Engagement for a listing with high-resolution listing images showing the product from different angles are much higher. 

* For instance, if selling a coffee maker, include photos of the product in action, close-ups of its most important features, and lifestyle shots that help customers visualize the item in their own kitchens.

Another key consideration is price. If you can make the price and/or offer (bundling products for a discount, etc.) more competitive, this will help improve CTR rates by encouraging potential buyers to click on your listing.

* Promotions, such as limited-time discounts, can also be used by **Amazon FBA** sellers to create an urgency among customers. For instance, “Save 20% for a limited time” can stimulate visitors to click to buy. If you stay on top of competitor prices, you can regularly adjust your price based on this.

This means one can send a positive signal to Amazon’s algorithm to rank their product higher for better visibility to drive sales.

 

# Keep Track of Performance and Adjust to Algorithm Changes

Amazon algorithm like A9 and A10 is constantly evolving so sellers must stay updated with changes. Sellers need to adapt their strategies when search ranking factors change, so regularly monitoring performance allows them to do just that.

There are multiple tools to measure listing performance, such as Amazon Seller Central, Brand Analytics, and third-party tools.

They help sellers measure keyword ranks, conversion rates, and overall listing health. You can analyze keywords and check if there is any product feature or feature that is still unable to bring on traffic.

 

# Try Buy One, Get One (BOGO) Promotions for Amazon Listings

One of the simple yet powerful approaches when it comes to promotion is a Buy One Get One (BOGO) promotion that works well to increase Amazon sales and drive customer actions. 

This is a super great offer for both a typical first time buyer and every repeat customer, where one is getting some free offer on a purchase if the product qualifies the offer.

 If done correctly, BOGO promotions can help you gain better product exposure, acquire a higher customer base to purchase your product and help you attain greater sales — an indispensable weapon for the Amazon seller.

 

# The Effectiveness of BOGO Promotions on Amazon

Deals are in an Amazon shopper’s DNA, and while BOGO makes sense functionally, it also plays into the instinct to make a beeline for the deal that provides immediate value. 

The idea of getting something extra for free or at a discount and completing the purchase resonates well with shoppers. That sense of extra value often leads clients to make larger purchases than they originally intended.

The competition on Amazon is fierce and if you can add a BOGO that might set your product apart from the competition. This is a deadline-oriented way of selling that can increase the conversion of visitors to buyers. 

Buy One, Get One Free — This model appeals especially to the compatible consumer, who wants to get the most out of the checkout process. 

* For example, if a shopper was only planning on buying one product, but sees that they can receive a second, free of charge, they are more likely to make the purchase.

Additionally, BOGO offers can increase Average Order Value (AOV) and encourage repeat purchases. And if shoppers are able to find the exact item they were looking for, they may even feel more fulfilled by their purchase, leading to positive [product reviews](https://amzonestep.com/blog/7-ways-to-provide-product-reviews-on-amazon/), and greater customer retention.

 

# How to Set Up a BOGO Promotion on Amazon

Setting up a BOGO on Amazon is a simple and straightforward process via Amazon Seller Central. So, here is a guideline about how to go-about implementing it.

* Log into Seller Central, Click on Promotions Tab:
* Navigate to the Advertising tab in Seller Central
* From the drop-down choose promotions and click on create new promotion.

 

# Select the BOGO Offer Type

Click on the appropriate “Buy one, Get one” promo type There are different types of promotions with amazon, so please go ahead and choose the one that suits your needs.

 

# Define Promotion Criteria

Configure the products that you want to offer with this BOGO promotion. Choose the promotional Buy One Get One type (e.g., a second item free or a second item at a given percentage discount), and supply any exclusions or limitations. You can simply apply it on selected colors or sizes of a particular item — say, a BOGO.

 

# Set the Promotional Dates

Pick your promotion date range for start and end dates.  In the case of BOGO deals, the absence of a time frame makes it difficult for the consumers to realize the urgency and act swiftly, well, a definite timeline rectifies that.

 It may make sense to latch the promotion to a big shopping event, such as Prime Day, [Black Friday](https://amzonestep.com/blog/whats-the-secret-to-winning-the-amazon-black-friday-battle/) or Cyber Monday when traffic is up.

 

# Monitor and Adjust

Check the performance of your promotion in Amazon Seller Central as soon as it goes live. Keep an eye on the sales volume, traffic on the product page, and the engagement with consumers. If the promotion goes well, you might choose to continue the deal or reproduce it with additional products.

 

# Examples of Successful BOGO Promotions on Amazon

Below are some examples of successful BOGO promotions from Amazon sellers.

 

# Health and Wellness Products

Supplement brands implementing a Buy One, Get One Free on multivitamins could see increasing sales — particularly since vitamins are an essential, repeat-purchase item. Health-aware consumers will surely seize the opportunity to stock up on their favorite vitamins.

* Deal: ‘Purchase 1 Bottle of High-Quality Multivitamins, 2nd for Free’
* Effect: In all likelihood, customers will buy the deal in bulk, rise the average order value and gain this product more appealing option against rivals.

 

# Beauty and Skincare

Buy one get one free deals generally work great for things like facial cleansers or even moisturizers). A lot of the customers are using these products on a daily basis, hence a Buy One, Get One Free offer can facilitate customers to use different variants or stock them for long term use.

 

* Promo: “Buy one anti-wrinkle cream, get one for free!” Limited Time Offer.”
* Effect: This promotion can place some urgency into the customer and make them purchase on the spot rather than wait for the offer to disappear.

 

# Home and Kitchen Appliances

BOGO deals are effective for kitchen tools, blenders, and vacuum cleaners, where the second item is a complementary product. A blender brand for example can provide a free jar for blender on the purchase of main unit which gives more value on the product for the customer.

* OFFER PRODUCT: Buy One Premium Blender, Receive an Extra Jar (yours free)
* The effect: This unfair advantage is targeted at customers who may already be on the verge to purchase the blender, helping them feel as if they are getting something unique for their money.

 

# Fashion and Apparel

Apparel shops are also a great motivation for BOGO offers, and this goes especially for clothing or accessories. For buyers who want to shop that often and stock up on basics or experiment with various colors/styles, a t-shirt or socks Buy One, Get One Free is probably very difficult to resist!

* Product: Buy One Pack of 5 Cotton Socks, Get Another pack of Free!

* Why it matters: This could incentivize buyers to purchase multiple sets, and raise their overall spend. Well, it is easier to convert with more of something for the same price.

Can i trust her?,"# GF/46 constantly lies about her past and cheating on her husband whom she was with 24 y for children to have a complete family

Hello everyone, I need some advice. My girlfriend, who is 45, has lied about her past several times. Especially when it comes to partners and sex. She is a foreigner, I will not give her nationality. She was married in her native country for 24 years. She has two adult children, according to them her husband was an alcoholic. He did not help with the housework and did not earn any money. He only drank alcohol and went to the pub with his friends. When she wanted to have sex with him, he did not want to. So she looked for substitutes in her village. And then she moved to another city and cheated on him there too. The thing is that when we talked about her past, she first told me that she had 20 sexual partners in her entire life. And she claimed that she had 18 of them between the ages of 17 and 21. But every time we talked about that past, she told me different information. The first time she told me that she had cheated on her husband only once. Then she said twice. And a few days ago, under the influence of alcohol, she confessed to me that she had cheated on him eight times. She told me that sex was very important to her and she wasn't getting it from her husband, so she was looking for a replacement. When she came to my country, she also cheated on him with my colleague and then with me, now she is divorced. My girlfriend and I work at the same job and I asked her out. We had sex that very day, we were under the influence of alcohol. But she said that it was because I was exceptional and she liked me. We have been together for 7 months now. But the main problem is that she lies to me about her past and other things. She told me that she didn't want to admit that she had cheated on him so many times so that I wouldn't think of her as a whore. She told me that she really loves me and that she hasn't had such feelings for a long time and I brought colors and feelings into her world that she hasn't felt for a long time. Today, I wanted to end it with her thanks to the information I found out and mainly because she lied several times. At the beginning of the relationship she told me that I shouldn't lie to her because that trust is important to her. I'm always honest with her but she breaks it. And I feel sorry for her, I lost her trust, when we first argued about it she swore that she only cheated on him twice and that it was true. Now she tells me that there were 8 of them and promises me that it's true and that she won't lie to me anymore. But I still think she's lying to me because sex is very important to her and I don't believe that she's only had 8 men during her 24 years of marriage. She explained to me everything about how her husband treated her and that he was very abusive. Now she tells me that she really loves me and that she hasn't felt that way for a long time and doesn't want to lose me. She works as a nurse and so do I. And in her home country she worked for a GP and there she met two patients with whom she cheated on her husband. Now she works in the acute ward in surgery, just like me. But I wanted to ask you if there is a risk that she would cheat on me and if I should continue the relationship. I lost trust in her because of those lies. And I forgot to mention that when she drinks alcohol, she gets very horny, that time she had sex with her neighbor because she needed him but she didn't even like him, she just wanted the sex. She said that if she wants the sex, she doesn't care who she has it with. She says I suit her and she's happy with me. But sometimes she talks about other guys and it seems to me that she's so flirtatious with the doctors she works with. She said that she only wants me, but it doesn't really seem like that. Because when we're at work, she notices other men more than me. So I wanted to ask you about your opinion on the situation and if there is a risk that she would cheat on me. She said that when she was young, he was nice to her so she had sex with him. Now it's not like that anymore. But it seems strange to me that we go on the first date and have sex right away. She said that when she cheated on her husband with other men, she went for walks and coffee with them. And when it suited her, she had sex. What is your opinion on that?

I apologize if I'm repeating myself, I'm writing this under the influence of alcohol and English is my native language. I'm a little worried because she's going to her home country for a month, and to the village where she had the men she cheated on her husband with. What do you think about all this? Should I continue the relationship and hope that she won't cheat on me even though I've lost her trust. Or should I end it?

My wife’s family had never been to Greece and with it being winter, travelling there is really inexpensive, so as a thank you to some of her family for helping us out so much when we’re in Portugal, we took her aunt and uncle and two cousins to Athens and Crete. 

They found it interesting, but the take away from the trip was that “Greek people seem unhappy, sad even.  There feels like there’s no joy there.”

I maybe felt a little of the same vibe but not nearly to the extent my Portuguese family members did. They were really hit hard by it. 

My wife’s uncle is 80, and retired from fishing and sits each morning and has coffee (or the occasional breakfast beer, but let’s not say much about that) with his old fishing buddies and all he’s talked to them about for the last mornings is how sad it is in Greece and how maybe the world could try to cheer them up.

Initially Bought the replacement part and watched the install video and replaced. I dropped the lid back on and it didn’t chirp near zero and my shots were running fast so I watched the calibration video adjusted and now I’m chirping around 5 and below. Figured this would solve my problem, but my shots are running in 10 seconds even when the grinder is set a slight chirp. 

This is the same coffee I was using before opening the grinder. Was pulling kinda long (30+) at around 15-20 before. I’ve never opened the grinder before and never had issues. I unscrewed the lid the whole way and turned each screw a half turn at a time to make sure they were even on both sides. If I go the whole way to 0 it will be clearly rubbing, but at 5 it is chirping but not fine enough for longer than a 10 second shot. I have noticed when I use the bellows the resistance seems much less. 

I’m assuming that my burrs are unaligned now, but they were fine before so I’m assuming it has something to do with how I’m reattching the lid. (I did double check it was the right direction). Any advice on what may be going wrong? 

EDIT: I use light and medium roasts only and have never had any issues before now. ",1,1740142759.0,DF64,1,1.0,False

after that, i just didn’t mind his questions and other stuff but then when the coffee came (delivered by grab) i gave it to him and said my goodbyes since im done with my workouts. just right after i left the building, while i was driving, he proceeded to call me and i thought it was just because i left something but he said, “ingat ka ha .salamat ulit sa coffee. bakit kasi ang aga mo dumating kakarating ko lang. miss na kita.” and i just said “wala lang yun coach thank you again” then ended the call because i felt disgusted. 

after hours, he keeps on texting me such as he’s having a breaktime and drinking the coffee i gave him, as well as, him updating me that he’s currently having his lunch.

i don’t know but with the actions i took, does this coach have the right to ask personal questions? and does he have the right to message me unnecessary things for the purpose of exchanging numbers as a potential client? did i somehow lead him on? i just bought him coffee since he’s been assisting me for free for the past week, i believe i was just doing it for the sake of “pakikisama” but now i don’t think i need to socialize in that branch because i won’t go back there anymore.",7,1740142629.0,AnytimeFitnessPH,11,0.89,False

I just created a server called Sip & Sipag, inspired by that group, where we can work while interacting with others.

One of the main reasons I made this server is that I enjoy working while seeing other people’s faces or just having the feeling of being surrounded by others. While the Study With Me server offers that, they require you to turn your camera on—which isn’t always ideal for me. Sometimes, I just want to keep it off and work at my own pace.

Another reason is that I love the atmosphere of a coffee shop—hearing people talk in the background without actually having to spend money at a café. In this server, you can deafen yourself when you need to focus or switch to a focus room where no one is allowed to talk.

At Sip & Sipag, you have the freedom to work however you like, as long as you respect others and their space. It’s a small, growing server that I just launched today, and I’d love for you to join me!

When Bitcoin first dropped in 2009; it was like the punk rock movement of finance - all about breaking free from the system. Fast forward to 2025, and we're seeing that crypto is getting a mainstream makeover.

Take Coinbase's Base network, for instance. It's like watching your rebellious friend from high school become a corporate executive. They're collecting fees, running the show, and basically becoming what crypto originally sought to disrupt. Imagine ordering a ""decentralized"" coffee, but there's still a single barista controlling who gets their cup first!

Here's what's wild - the biggest players in crypto today are centralized stablecoins and exchanges. You're going off-grid while living in a smart home connected to the city's power supply, basically. The original vision of removing trusted third parties? Well, we just replaced banks with... different kinds of banks.

We at Ozak AI are taking a different approach. While the crypto world grapples with its identity crisis, we're building something truly decentralized. Our predictive AI network is staying true to the original crypto spirit.

Want to be part of something that's actually sticking to the decentralization playbook? Our Phase 3 presale is live, and early investors have already tripled their investments.

The choice is yours - stick with crypto's new corporate costume, or join a movement that's keeping the decentralization dream alive.

Urges that are mostly based at long term progression, satisfying grinding and loads of different builds to mess with.

In my search I stumbled upon Orna ( think pokemon Go but then oldschool mmorpg loot, classes and combat ).  And then later on I found out the developers also made Aethric. Which instead of a gps game is more traditional world mmorpg. 

The game has a very fair payment model ( mostly cosmetics and buying the developers coffee ), has no fomo that never returns. ( only fomo it has is seasonal events that come back every year ). 

And all in all it's just been an amazing amount of fun for me to grind on, make a guild with some mates and doing world bosses together.

Jim, je vais avoir encore besoin de toi.

Je t'écoute, Jules.

J'ai envie de me lancer dans les réseaux sociaux, je pense que ça peut rapporter gros.

Si tu es d'accord, on va ouvrir des pages sur les réseaux et affirmer que les gaz d’échappement des tondeuses à gazon provoquent des dépôts sur les pelouses, contenant des substances chimiques ou biologiques délibérément versées dans le carburant par des gouvernements ou des organisations secrètes. On dira que ces substances sont utilisées pour manipuler la météo ou lutter contre le réchauffement climatique.

On pourra aussi prétendre qu'elles visent à empoisonner la population, affaiblissant leur santé pour favoriser l'industrie pharmaceutique ou réduire la population mondiale.

Enfin, on ajoutera que les produits déposés sur les pelouses contiennent des nanoparticules destinées à influencer le comportement mental des humains.

Jules, je t'arrête, tu délires ! C'est totalement faux et je ne vois pas comment ça peut nous rapporter de l'argent !

Tu es naïf, Jim, je vais t'expliquer. On va devenir des influenceurs complotistes, à nous  la belle vie à Dubaï.

D'accord, ça sonne bien, mais pour l'argent, comment fais-tu ?

Les créateurs de contenu sur les réseaux sociaux peuvent gagner de l'argent grâce aux clics et à l'engagement de leur audience de plusieurs manières :

1. Publicités et Monétisation des Plateformes

YouTube : Grâce au programme YouTube Partner, les créateurs gagnent de l'argent via les publicités diffusées sur leurs vidéos. Le revenu dépend du nombre de vues, du CPM (coût pour mille vues) et de l’engagement.

Facebook et Instagram : Facebook propose l'Ad Breaks et les vidéos monétisées via Facebook Watch, tandis qu'Instagram permet d'afficher des publicités sur IGTV et Reels.

TikTok : Le TikTok Creator Fund rémunère les créateurs en fonction des vues et de l'engagement sur leurs vidéos.

2. Marketing d'Affiliation

Les influenceurs partagent des liens affiliés vers des produits (Amazon, AliExpress, etc.) et touchent une commission à chaque achat effectué via leur lien.

Exemple : un créateur de mode peut recommander des vêtements et recevoir un pourcentage des ventes générées.

3. Sponsoring et Partenariats avec des Marques

Les entreprises paient les influenceurs pour promouvoir leurs produits ou services via des publications, des stories ou des vidéos sponsorisées.

Les tarifs varient en fonction du nombre d’abonnés et du taux d’engagement.

4. Vente de Produits et de Services

Beaucoup de créateurs vendent leurs propres produits (merchandising, formations, ebooks, coaching, etc.).

Exemples : Un coach fitness peut vendre des programmes d'entraînement, un artiste peut proposer des œuvres numériques.

5. Dons et Soutien des Abonnés

Sur des plateformes comme Twitch, Patreon, ou Buy Me a Coffee, les fans peuvent faire des dons ou souscrire à un abonnement payant pour soutenir leurs créateurs préférés.

YouTube propose également les Super Chats (dons envoyés lors de lives) et les abonnements payants à des chaînes.



6. Dropshipping et E-commerce

Certains créateurs utilisent leur audience pour diriger du trafic vers une boutique en ligne en dropshipping, où ils vendent des produits sans stock réel.

L’essentiel est d’avoir une audience engagée et de diversifier ses sources de revenus pour maximiser ses gains.

Tu comprends maintenant ? On va devenir des marchands de clics. C'est comme ça qu'on gagne de l'argent de nos jours. Es-tu partant avec moi ?

C'est OK, Jules, tu m'as convaincu.

Morale : Dans un monde où l'information circule à grande vitesse, la vérité devient une monnaie d'échange. Mais faut-il la déformer pour s'enrichir ? Si les marchands de clics prospèrent, que reste-t-il de la confiance et de l'éthique ?

Important note: All the things mentioned down below are accepted things to eat at my stage. Doctor approved ;-)  I know a lot of people are doing 2 weeks of purees or soft foods for 2 weeks but that is not what my clinic recomments.

I'm 7 days post op and I'm actually doing very well. 

  
The program said to eat purees for 5 days and then transition to solids according to how my body reacts. And to be fair; I'm doing amazing!   
I'm eating a big of greek yoghurt with some strawberries and sugarfree granola in the morning, proteine shake or an egg als snack, cracker with hummus and cottage cheese for lunch, fruit as a snack, dinner it differs and some fruit in the evening as a snack. So I'm actually doing well!   
Even experimenting with coffee today and it went well!

Fluids was a big problem from the start. I couldn't get anything down. Threw up 3 times in the hospital while trying to swallow some meds with the tiniest sip of water.   
It took a few days but now I'm better. Warm drinks work better for me and I'm working on just water or sugarfree lemonade but that is still hard to get down for me. But I think I'm getting a liter of fluids in and working my way up, so to be fair; doing quite well. 

But I'm getting such a massive headache in the later afternoon, first I thought it was my fluid intake but that is kinda okay I think. Sure I wanna work my way up to 1.5 liters but I'm over 1 liter a day only a week post op so I thought this was good. I really don't know what causes the headache.

I just came back from a few days away, wanted to make a cup of coffee. Decided to flush it first by pretending I added ground coffee at the top (just the way you would rinse after cleaning).

No water came out. At least not where you'd expect. It was all in the drip tray. Tried it a few times. Then when the pump was running I moved the spouts(?), or whatever you call the thing I drew a circle around, and water came out.

Not sure what to do now, because when I made coffee it did come out, but a lot less than supposed to. 

So.. the water is directed into the drip tray instead of through the ground coffee. What can I do about this? It also sounds like some plastic is loose inside the brew group.

Order number provided by the app was #9470. I get there and I am being told that there is no order with that order number. Then I provide my name and the person starts being rude by saying that there is no order.

I ask to come to the window, and I am being refused and being told to leave. I drive to the drive-thru window and show my app, showing the order number, location and method of pick up, and still I am being denied my order. After the manager leaves, the nice lady at the drive thru window asks me to come inside to try and solve the situation.

I do, knowing well that I would by now get late to work, (which I did!) and as soon as I get to the window, one nice young lady asks me if I have a mobile order. When I am about to say I do and show the app, the manager I was talking to from my car at the drive thru shouts that I have no orders.

I once again open the app, navigate to recent orders and show the date, time and my order (which was a 2 cream 3 sugar, nothing else), that I have paid for it, and she keeps insisting that I leave, very rude and shouting, being ashamed in front of other customers.

I say that I have paid for my order as the app shows and eventually she gives me a coffee and demands me to leave once again by shouting again. I don’t understand why I was taken care so badly! I felt like I was being accused of stealing a coffee that I have paid for. It was the worst experience of my life on any Tim Hortons, a customer who has been buying the same coffee and much more at the same exact location for years, many weeks on a daily basis.

I am upset and feel very overwhelmed by the experience. I had proof of purchase and still, being told no, like somehow I was lying. It is a shame such treatment, when clearly I had all the proof needed to show that I was right. Not even an “I am sorry for the confusion” was said.

Please do better! You have now just lost a customer.

Edit: I forgot to mention that before I have made the post here, I have made a complaint with Guest Services and I am now awaiting for an email back.

Also, for the people that are attacking me, and saying that no one cares, well, I am simply sharing my experience and if you think that, then it is okay, but I don’t understand why you are writing stuff like that. I won’t be deleting the post and I will just ignore you. To you might not be a big deal, but maybe it will bring awareness for this type of customer treatment to a multi-million dollar company and force them to make changes.

I'm male, 42. 

So a couple of days ago while being sick I wetted my bed. I first thought I was just sweating but when i came back from the toilet I saw a circle around where my underpants were... Since then I am more or less dripping urine. In the past I already had this sometimes, after going to the toilet, but I didnt think too much about it. NOw its sometimes more, sometimes less... Yesterday I drank a lot and was sitting in a meeting, when I went to the toilet I saw in my underpants that I leaked a good amount, fortunatley not so much that one saw it through my jeans. What can I say, it freaks me out. 

I already was at a urologist yesterday but he didnt take the topic too serious. He had a look on my prostate (normally sized) and on my bladder (looks good). Also did some urine testing regarding blood, protein, sugar and something else. Everything fine. 

I am a frequent masturbator (sometimes 3-5 times a day, when in homeoffice (no comment please :-P)) and I already sometimes had a feeling that im somewhat disconnected from down there. It also  happened when I stopped smoking weed, but thats not the case right now... 

So could this come from a tight pelvic floor (caused by too much masturbation?), or could my floor be too weak? How do I find out? I have a hard knot right abouve the anus in my perineum, which sometimes is feelable and sometimes not (unfortunatley not yesterday at the doc). 

Maybe it could also be psychological, as it was gone for three days in the meantime but is back now. So at the moment I have no clue how to go further. Should I do kegels or not? Should I do more stretching? Should I stop masturbating for a while?

I also was drinking lots of coffee the last weeks and I am downsizing right now, but could this still have an effect even days after I stopped drinking so much?

1iupibn,https://i.redd.it/aw0oet9zhhke1.jpeg,It is amazing to see how Blume breaks down India's market into three layers 🧐,"
(a). India 1(Mexico)
- Roughly 10% of the population, APC income → $15K 
- High-spenders who drive trends in premium products and services:like  Blue Tokai Coffee, Licious, Country Delight. 
- Startups target India1 early because they're willing to pay premium prices and their consumption habits drive broader market trends.

(b). India 2 (Indonesia)
- 30% of households, APC income → $3K
- Reading this, startups like KukuFM: Micropayment models to lower entry barriers drive adoption within this segment (Netflix also introduced a mobile only option for ~ ₹150/month, trying to cater to this segment).
- Exceptionally challenging to convert them into paying customers.

(c). India 3 (Sub Saharan Africa)

I'm still trying to adapt the coffee chroniclers standard switch recipe for smaller dose do coffee 15g coffee to 240g water, but I have trouble with extracting the same flavours from those beans as I have managed using same recipe but 20:320 ratio.  
  
Today I added a bit of agitation in the first phase with pouring with open switch as those early acidic fruity flavors seemed muted in my last cup, but it didn't help at all. So my today's recipe was 120g water with open switch, swirl the coffee. Close at 45 sec pour quite aggressively 120g more water, finish pouring at 1:10 and open switch at 2:00. Drawdown finished at about 3:10. I used 93°C water
  
The final resulting cup is quite weak. It has barely to none bitterness or acidity. I think the flavor of  pineapple are really muted and in the background.
  
I'm not sure whether this recipe is just not suited for those small doses or should I still try to troubleshoot it. I tried to go finer than I am today but I felt like I achieved no fruitiness at all not just muted fruits",2,1740139973.0,pourover,3,1.0,False
1iupgkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScoliosisTeens/comments/1iupgkf/my_scoliosis_story_new_updates_coming_soon_an/,My scoliosis story (new updates coming soon). An insight into what life with scoliosis is like.,"In January of 2024, I was 14. 

My mother walked into the bathroom as I was showering (rude, I know right?!) Self conscious of my changing body I peered curiously around the shower curtain to see what she was doing. She told me to ""stand up straight"" which was weird as I felt like I was and I always have good posture.

One shoulder was significantly higher than the other, with part of my rib cage bigger than the other. I'd never really looked at myself in this way however I did see what everyone was referring to.

By June my mother had booked me in to see my paediatrician, who sent me off for an X-ray.

Nervous as I have never had any serious medical issues, I stood there cold and shaking in one of those tie up gowns. 

The X-ray tech was a lovely man who made me feel like we were old friends. It was no different to a picture that lasted no longer a second, we took a couple of images.

I had no clue what my spine would look like, the tech told me ""I'll need to consult my supervisor"". A wave of panic washed over me as he left the room, I was alone, my mother in the waiting room, just me, myself, and my thoughts to keep me company.

I tentitavley peered over at the screen out of anxiety of what was to come and sheer curiosity. I see my spine all crooked and bent, unsure what to think I wander back to where I was standing previously. The Tech comes back with his supervisor and asks why the image isn't lining up...

The supervisor took one look at the image and muttered to herself ""Oh wow, that's an impressive curve"" before saying out loud ""It's meant to look like that, it's for a scoliosis diagnosis, obviously"". They then send me and my mum on my way.

By august 2024, I was 15. 

We had a specialist appointment. The Doctor had analysed my X-ray, tested my reflexes and with a thoracic curve of 53 degrees. He told me in a pragmatic tone ""There is no doubt you have scoliosis. Bracing wouldn't be effective and we should concider surgery whilst it's still relatively early"".
He then proceeded to refer me to the Royal Childrens Hospital, for surgery.

We didn't hear back for a few months however by October 15 I had my first day at the hospital.

October 15 2024,

The hospital was colourful, with fish, meerkats and shops. It had multiple fun stuff for kids (because it was a childrens hospital duh).

It was a long day however I got a total of three X-rays, and a blood test. Everyone was so nice and caring, I even had a boost juice and lunch with my mum (they have cool restaurants INSIDE the hospital) 

I met my surgeon who wanted me to get a blood test, and a traction X-ray (where they pull and stretch you in an X-ray, which didn't hurt at all).

The blood test was fine, I had a green squishy cat I got to hold and keep. But after I felt like fainting which was kind of scary, the nurse was so kind and got me a cold glass of water which helped a lot. My heart was racing and it felt like my senses were almost fading slowly away. I don't think I ever fully lost conciousness but I was pretty close to losing it.

After that intense long day, we drove home and I slept all the way in the car (best sleep I ever had, slept quite literally like a baby).

The new year came (2025) and I was starting to get a sharp, pinchy pain in my mid-lower back. I was still on the waitlist for the surgery, days became long and tiring, and summer break was almost over.

Janurary 19 2025

It was a Sunday, the hospital was quiet. I had my first ever MRI. I met with a funny man who would talk to my whilst I was in the MRI. We picked a movie to watch (The lion king - live action) and my mum left to get a coffee.

I lie down on the MRI bed and they put these special earphones on so I can hear the movie. The table moves up and down, and in and out. It was crucial that I stayed perfectly still so the image was clear.

I never really got why people said MRIs are so loud, it just sounded like a nock on a door whilst a phone was vibrating like crazy. I don't really know how to describe it LOL!

I could not focus on the movie as my thoughts were loud (and so was the machine, just a bit)

The MRI lasted a total of 45 minutes. I slipped my shoes on and eargerly left the raidiology department and went up the bright green elevators to see my mum. 

As I mentioned before, the hospital was quiet because it was a weekend, me and my mum went to get lunch. It was 1pm and I was STARVING! (I got tuna sushi which was quite authentic)

Then I proceeded to beg my mum to let me see the funny blue fish with the long nose in the lobby. (For those who are wondering yes I got to see mg fish bestie).

I got a Sonny Angel as a reward for being so well behaved (okay I may be a bit immature but I cannot say no to a Sonny Angel figure, especially if I can get the frog one) I sadly opened a unicorn.

Then I went home and rested. (Whilst also watching the rest of the amazing lion king)
Nobody talks about how tiring just going to the hospital is, even though I just layed down and watched a movie lmao.

I am currently on the waitlist for spinal fusion, the pain is incrementally getting worse day by day. But I strongly believe I can and will recover.

I just hope I can go back to competitive swimming and do as well as I used to do after surgery. 

I have no clue when the surgery is, I was told I will get 24 hours notice. So welcome to the Australian healthcare system where the waitlists are long but the healthcare is cheap.

More updates coming soon, so stay tuned! And thank you all who have and are supporting my journey!!! ❤️

1iupet3,https://i.redd.it/qlw1bhxyghke1.jpeg,It is amazing to see how Blume breaks down India's market into three layers -,"(a). India 1(Mexico)
- Roughly 10% of the population, APC income → $15K 
- High-spenders who drive trends in premium products and services:like  Blue Tokai Coffee, Licious, Country Delight. 
- Startups target India1 early because they're willing to pay premium prices and their consumption habits drive broader market trends.

(b). India 2 (Indonesia)
- 30% of households, APC income → $3K
- Reading this, startups like KukuFM: Micropayment models to lower entry barriers drive adoption within this segment (Netflix also introduced a mobile only option for ~ ₹150/month, trying to cater to this segment).
- Exceptionally challenging to convert them into paying customers.
