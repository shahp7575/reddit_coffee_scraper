1orw8rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1orw8rv/the_truth_is_im_treated_better/,The truth is I'm treated better,"So many of the posts here are wonderful but I often can't relate to the sentiment that women with children are treated better than women without them. I say this as a woman who is part of a community that has a lot of pronatalist beliefs (tech world) and being child free hasn't affected me negatively at all. People will always do the initial ""are you having kids"" to me and my husband because it's seen as a big deal. For about 30 seconds it's ""ahh, man you guys should really do it!"" and then they move onto asking what I do for a living, what are my hobbies, etc. Then going forward that's all they ask me about because they already know I'm not having kids. 

The conversations with the moms are non-existent unless they're talking about the kid. I recently went to a dinner party where kids were designated to the coffee table with with the moms trying to balance their dinner plates on their laps while feeding their babies. The rest of the adults, including most of the dads, sat at a beautifully laid table drinking wine, talking and having fun. I have no doubt that there are people who say things in the community behind my back about how me and my husband are cliche immature millennials for not wanting kids. But why should that matter to me when the proper taboo about publicly shaming us is in place and I suffer no actual social consequences, only gains? 

I often feel like the only person who actually sees this as a child free woman and tries to bring these women back into the fold and ask about their hobbies and what they've been up to besides child-rearing. It feels like I care more about them than most. I swear the more pronatalist a community is the more men will completely ignore you once you've had kids with another man. You're considered done and over with. No point in inviting you on an impromptu hike or lunch because you're obviously busy with the kids. You stop being seen as a whole person to them.     

I'm always given a bigger role in group activities and there's this weird thing where men feel like they need to be distant and cold towards women who have kids with another man but they feel they can develop a true friendship with me as a woman who is married but childless. Has anyone else noticed this? It's very bizarre, but I can't help but feel that it's somehow connected to the same sentiment that makes men not want to date single mothers even if they are the type to be complaining about the birth rate online.

1orw8rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1orw8rc/the_canva_moment_for_advertising_assembling_ads/,The Canva Moment for Advertising — assembling ads instead of producing them.,"Hey everyone,

I've been thinking a lot about where AI and marketing collide, and I believe we’re about to hit a massive shift — what I call **“The Canva Moment for Advertising.”**

\---

**Why this matters**

Every business, from a local coffee shop to Nike, needs ads. But ads are expensive, slow, and short-lived.

Unlike movies, ads aren’t meant to last — they exist for *exposure*.

Every new product launch, every trending meme, every viral moment creates fresh demand for fast, high-frequency content — keeping campaigns relevant and impossible to ignore.

That’s why brands spend endlessly: they have to keep their content fresh or vanish in the feed.

And here’s the kicker — this makes advertising one of the **highest willingness-to-pay industries** on earth.

\---

**The Pain**

Traditional ad creation is broken:

* Takes weeks of filming, editing, approvals.
* Costs thousands per campaign.
* By the time it’s ready, the trend is already gone.

The result? Most small brands can’t afford to keep up, and big ones are stuck paying for inefficiency.

\---

**The Idea — OneStop Advertisement Platform**

A creative AI system where ad production shifts from *creation* to *assembly* — where every part of an ad already exists in a searchable, modular **AI library**, ready to be **assembled** into new campaigns.

🎬 **Scene Templates:** thousands of pre-built ad storyboards — unboxing, testimonials, lifestyle reels, cinematic brand spots. Drag one in, tweak pacing, adjust tone.

🧍‍♀️ **AI Characters:** choose from a library of virtual models, presenters, or influencers. Edit voice, accent, emotion, even gestures.

🏷️ **Product Slots:** drop in your product image or 3D asset, and AI fits it seamlessly into the scene.

🎧 **Sound & Music:** pick mood-based BGM or auto-generated voiceovers in any language, synced perfectly with visuals.

I still can’t believe this.,"I met a guy from Kenya on hinge. we met for a cup of coffee in Indiranagar and he seemed like a pretty decent Guy to me, but due to different schedules, we were not able to catch up very often and with time conversations faded.

After few months we again started texting and he Initiated 2nd meet up and we both came to a conclusion to meet at his place, but he used to give excuses like his landlord is quite aggressive and he doesn’t allow females. so we have to meet during his absence or after he has slept.

usually the guy will be away offline during the morning, but he’ll be online after 8-9 PM. I know I found it very suspicious, but you know how men are so based on his decent nature, I gave him the benefit of doubt.

Later I was talking to one of my male friend, and I was telling him that I’m going to meet a guy at his place, and it will be quite late in the night and his place is somewhere around hennur-chalakere. he said, that area of Bangalore is not very safe. the people from saudi Arabia and Africa are involved in drug dealing, murders, stealing, so it’s not very safe to go there. Even we localite don’t roam there, so you should not be going there, specially to meet a guy who is from Africa.

I texted the same thing to my match that a friend was supposed to drop me to your place, but now he is resisting to go there saying that area is not safe. Then he asked me what should we do now and I was like I think we have to drop this plan of meeting at your place because I am very scared now. he has not been responding after that. I think I dodged a bullet. I might be wrong here, but he didn’t even try to convince me saying that it’s safe.

They tie a room together, add warmth, and feel great underfoot. But they also act as giant magnets for dirt, pet hair, spills, and who-knows-what-else. Traditional rugs are a nightmare to clean, and deep cleaning services are expensive and often use harsh chemicals.

Then there's the environmental guilt. Many conventional rugs are made from synthetic materials like virgin nylon or polyester, derived from fossil fuels, and treated with chemical dyes and fire retardants.

So, what's a design-savvy, eco-conscious, and practical homeowner to do?

Enter the game-changer: ***eco-friendly machine washable rugs***. These are the superheroes of the flooring world, offering the perfect fusion of sustainability and sanity-saving convenience. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to find the perfect one for your home.

## What Exactly Makes a Rug ""Eco-Friendly""?

Before we dive into the ""machine washable"" part, let's unpack ""eco-friendly."" This term goes beyond just the material. A truly sustainable rug considers the entire lifecycle, from production to your home. Here are the key factors to look for:

*   **Sustainable Materials:** This is the big one. Look for rugs made from:
    *   **Recycled Fibers:** The most common is recycled polyester (rPET), which is often made from plastic bottles. It's incredibly durable, stain-resistant, and washable—giving plastic a second life.
    *   **Natural Fibers:** Materials like ***organic cotton***, ***jute***, ***wool*** (from ethically treated sheep), and ***bamboo*** are renewable and biodegradable.
    *   **Plant-Based Fibers:** Look for innovative materials like TENCEL™ Lyocell, made from wood pulp in a closed-loop process that recycles water and solvents.

*   **Non-Toxic Dyes & Processes:** Conventional rug dyes can contain heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Seek out brands that use low-impact, natural, or OEKO-TEX certified dyes, which are tested for harmful substances.

*   **Ethical Manufacturing:** An eco-friendly brand is often a fair-trade brand. Look for certifications like GoodWeave, which ensures no child or forced labor was used in the making of your rug.

*   **Certifications You Can Trust:** Don't just take the company's word for it. Certifications provide third-party verification. Key ones include:
    *   **OEKO-TEX:** Verifies the textile has been tested for harmful substances and is harmless for human health.
    *   **GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard):** The leading standard for organic fibers, ensuring environmental and social criteria are met throughout the supply chain.
    *   **Fair Trade Certified:** Indicates that the workers who made the rug received fair wages and worked in safe conditions.

## Why a ""Machine Washable"" Feature is a Total Game-Changer

If you have kids, pets, or a tendency to spill your coffee (no judgment here), the convenience of a washable rug is unparalleled.

*   **Hygiene:** Regularly washing your rug removes dust mites, pet dander, allergens, and bacteria, creating a healthier home environment.
*   **Effortless Cleaning:** Red wine? Mud tracks? Pet accidents? No problem. Just toss the rug in the wash instead of frantically blotting for an hour.
*   **Longevity:** Being able to properly clean your rug means it's more likely to look great and last for years, reducing the need for replacements and ultimately saving resources.

## Finding the Perfect Match: Where Eco-Friendly Meets Washable

In the past, finding a rug that was both genuinely sustainable AND machine washable was tough. But innovation has caught up with demand. The magic lies in the materials.

***Rugs made from recycled plastics (like PET) are the stars of this show.*** The plastic fiber is inherently stain-resistant and durable enough to withstand a machine wash cycle. Many brands are now creating stunning, soft, and stylish rugs from this material, proving that sustainable doesn't mean sacrificing beauty or comfort.

Organic cotton is another excellent choice for lighter-weight, flat-weave rugs that are easy to clean and have a more casual, bohemian feel.

## Your Checklist: How to Buy the Best Eco-Friendly Machine Washable Rug

Ready to shop? Arm yourself with this checklist to make a smart choice.

1.  **Prioritize the Material:** Is it recycled plastic, organic cotton, or another sustainable fiber? If it claims to be ""natural,"" verify which one.
2.  **Check the Weave:** Low-pile or flat-weave rugs are almost always better for machine washing. Thick, plush shag rugs will hold too much water and can be damaged.
3.  **Read. The. Care. Instructions.** Seriously. Some rugs are machine washable, but only on a delicate cycle in cold water. Others might recommend air drying over machine drying. Know what you're getting into before you buy.
4.  **Verify Certifications:** Look for those OEKO-TEX and GOTS labels on the product page. They are your proof of a non-toxic, genuinely eco-friendly product.
5.  **Inspect the Backing:** Many washable rugs have a non-slip backing. Ensure it's made from a natural material like latex or a non-toxic synthetic version, not PVC or vinyl.
6.  **Read the Reviews:** See what other buyers are saying. Do they wash well? Do they hold up over time? Are they as soft as they look in the photos?

## Caring for Your Planet-Friendly Rug

To maximize the life of your new rug, follow these simple tips:

*   **Act Fast on Spills:** Blot immediately with a clean cloth.
*   **Shake It Out:** Regularly take your rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and dust.
*   **Wash with Care:** Use a mild, eco-friendly laundry detergent. Wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Avoid bleach.
*   **Dry Properly:** The best method is to air dry. Lay it flat or hang it over a railing. If you must use a dryer, use the lowest, no-heat setting possible.

## A Choice You Can Feel Good About

Investing in an ***eco-friendly machine washable rug*** is more than just a home decor decision; it's a lifestyle choice. It’s about choosing a product that is safer for your family, easier on your schedule, and kinder to our planet.

You no longer have to choose between style, practicality, and your values. You can have it all—right under your feet.",1,1762625293.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False
1orw5yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoFrance/comments/1orw5yw/the_secret_to_pariss_beauty_is_june_or_september/,The Secret to Paris's Beauty: Is June or September Truly the Best Month?,"Dreaming of Paris? You're not alone. The City of Light holds a special place in the hearts of travelers worldwide, but one question comes up time and time again: **What month is Paris most beautiful?**

It’s the million-euro question. Ask ten people, and you might get ten different answers. ""Beautiful"" is subjective, after all. Does it mean perfect weather for picnics? Fewer crowds at the Louvre? Stunning autumn foliage? Or the magical sparkle of Christmas lights?

While there's no single perfect month, there's a fierce debate between two contenders that consistently offer the best of what Paris has to offer. We're going to break it all down to help you find *your* perfect month.

## The Crowd Favorite: Why June Often Wins

When you picture that perfect, postcard Paris—the one with couples kissing on bridges, flowers spilling from windows, and long, golden evenings—you’re likely picturing June. It's the quintessential Parisian summer experience.

*   **Picture-Perfect Weather:** June ushers in consistently warm and pleasant weather. Average highs sit around a comfortable 75°F (24°C). It’s warm enough for an outdoor dinner, but not so hot that sightseeing becomes a chore.
*   **The City is in Full Bloom:** Paris's parks and gardens are at their absolute peak. The Jardin du Luxembourg, the Tuileries Garden, and Jardin des Plantes are explosions of color. It's the perfect time for that classic Parisian picnic.
*   **Endless Daylight:** With the summer solstice in June, you'll enjoy the longest days of the year. The sun sets after 9:30 PM, giving you ample time to explore, dine, and take an evening stroll along the Seine.
*   **Festive Atmosphere:** The city feels alive. There are outdoor concerts, open-air cinemas, and a general buzz of energy. It’s Paris at its most vibrant.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20month%20is%20Paris%20most%20beautiful%3F)

**The Catch?** You're not the only one who had this idea. June is the beginning of peak tourist season. Be prepared for crowds at major attractions and higher prices for flights and accommodation.

## The Understated Champion: The Case for September

For savvy travelers and those in the know, September is the secret weapon. It often delivers everything people love about June, but with fewer of the drawbacks.

*   **The ""Indian Summer"":** The summer heat lingers beautifully through September, with comfortable temperatures often reaching 70°F (21°C). You’ll still have plenty of warm, sunny days.
*   **The Crowds Thinning:** The summer holiday rush is over. Parisian children are back in school, and the tourist hordes have dwindled. You can actually get a decent photo in front of the Mona Lisa (okay, maybe not, but the lines will be shorter!).
*   **An Authentic Vibe:** This is perhaps September's biggest selling point. The city feels like it belongs to the Parisians again. You can sip your coffee at a sidewalk café and watch the rhythm of daily life unfold, rather than being surrounded by fellow tourists.
*   **That Golden Light:** As autumn approaches, the light in Paris changes. It becomes softer and warmer, casting a romantic, golden glow on the city's iconic Haussmannian boulevards. It’s a photographer's dream.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20month%20is%20Paris%20most%20beautiful%3F)

**The Catch?** The days are noticeably shorter than in June, and while the weather is lovely, there's a slightly higher chance of rain as the month progresses.

## June vs. September: The Head-to-Head Showdown

To make it crystal clear, let's put them side-by-side.

| Feature | June | September |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weather** | Consistently warm & sunny | Warm & mostly sunny, risk of rain |
| **Crowds** | Peak season, very crowded | Post-summer, moderate crowds |
| **Vibe** | Festive, high-energy, touristy | Authentic, relaxed, local |
| **Prices** | High | Moderate |
| **Daylight** | Very long days (sun sets ~10 PM) | Shorter days (sun sets ~7:45 PM) |

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20month%20is%20Paris%20most%20beautiful%3F)

**Verdict:** If your priority is the classic summer vibe and you don't mind crowds or splurging, **June** is for you. If you want perfect weather with a more authentic experience and manageable crowds, **September is the undisputed winner.**

## Don't Count Out the Other Seasons!

While June and September lead the pack, other months have a unique beauty all their own.

### `## Spring's Awakening (April - May): The Runner-Up`

Spring is a close second for many. April sees the city shake off winter with blooming cherry blossoms and magnolias. May is even warmer and greener, with a romantic energy in the air. It's less crowded than June, but be prepared for the famous ""April showers.""

### `## Autumn's Embrace (October): For the Coquette Aesthetic`

If your idea of beauty involves cozy sweaters, golden leaves, and steaming cups of hot chocolate, October is your month. The fall foliage in Paris's parks is stunning. The crisp air is perfect for long walks, and museums feel especially inviting.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20month%20is%20Paris%20most%20beautiful%3F)

### `## Winter's Whisper (December): The Fairytale Choice**

Paris in December is pure magic. The Champs-Élysées and entire city are draped in sparkling lights, charming Christmas markets pop up, and the smell of roasting chestnuts fills the air. While it’s cold, the crowds are the lowest of the year, and you'll feel like you've stepped into a Christmas card.

## So, When is Paris *Actually* the Most Beautiful? The Final Verdict

Ultimately, the ""most beautiful"" month depends on what you're looking for.

*   **For the classic, postcard-perfect Paris:** Go in **June**.
*   **For the perfect blend of weather and local vibe:** Go in **September**.
*   **For romantic blossoms on a budget:** Go in **May**.
*   **For cozy aesthetics and stunning foliage:** Go in **October**.
*   **For a magical, budget-friendly fairy tale:** Go in **December**.

There is no wrong answer. Every month reveals a different side of Paris’s enduring charm. The real secret is that Paris is always beautiful, just waiting for you to discover it.

The Tampa Bay Lightning, fresh off a 6-3 drubbing of the Vegas Golden Knights, host the Washington Capitals in a clash that’s less “showdown” and more “cautionary tale for the Caps.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a deflated air hockey table.

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The Lightning are -150 favorites, implying a 60% chance to win. For the Capitals (+125), their implied probability is 44.4%. Combined, that’s 104.4%—a classic sportsbook tax for daring to hope. Statistically, Tampa’s home record (3-3-0) isn’t dazzling, but their recent surge (6-3-1 in 10 games) and a 6-2-0 streak against the Western Conference suggest they’re the NHL’s version of a coffee addict: jittery, unpredictable, and dangerous after 2 p.m.

The Caps, meanwhile, are a team of contradictions. They’ve got Tom Wilson’s nine goals and Dylan Strome’s 10 assists, but their special teams are about as reliable as a toaster in a thunderstorm. In their last game, they went 0-for-3 on the power play while Pittsburgh scored twice on the man advantage. Strome’s postgame quote—“We’re a great team on 5-on-5. Right now, our special teams good”—is the hockey equivalent of saying, “I’m not mad, I’m just… *disappointed* in the universe.”

### Penalties, Power Plays, and Peril

Tampa’s Achilles’ heel? Penalties. They’re a dismal 1-4-1 when committing more infractions than opponents, which is like a chef forgetting salt in a recipe—technically edible, but nobody’s ordering seconds. The Capitals, conversely, are 2-1-0 when avoiding penalties. If Washington can milk the Lightning’s discipline issues, they might eke out a repeat of their ove

I'm in South Florida and am new to the world of GHL. I already have potential leads and can talk more about me and my background when we connect thru DM, but need some help on the following:

1. Best way to learn GHL and its features? 
Please reccomend what you found useful- should I go thru a specific course (Udemy etc) or is there a YouTuber that is the go-to person that really teaches and explains? Who or what did you find most helpful? I plan on practicing on the system alongside learning it.

2. Once I feel comfortable using the system, I'm looking to partner with one or more people/companies for fulfillment. I already have leads and potential clients once I'm ready to ""open my doors"", but I want to learn what I'm doing first (at least feel comfortable doing the basics) before selling any services/packages but once I'm ready to do that I want to have a go-to fulfillment partner 

3. Most importantly, I'm looking to talk with someone over the phone or zoom who already has their own successful GHL agency. I will ""treat you"" to a cup of coffee so that I can learn more from you and ask you some pointed questions. 

Thanks for welcoming a newbie like me and I look forward to connecting

Story: 

The scene opens with a detective driving to a crime scene, a cup of coffee in his hand. He arrives at the location in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where the body of a teenage boy named Alec has been found. The boy was struck on the head and shot in the chest, but the head trauma was determined to be the cause of death.

The detective begins his investigation and learns that Alec was estranged from his mother, with whom no one has had contact for years. With no immediate leads, the detective examines Alec’s phone and discovers a history of drug-related messages. The texts reveal that someone had been supplying Alec with drugs.

Tracking the supplier leads to a chase and a violent confrontation before the detective apprehends the man. The supplier refuses to cooperate until the detective begins burning his stash of drug money. Panicking, the supplier reveals that the money belongs to a mob boss and that his life is in danger if the boss finds out. Terrified, he confesses where he got the drugs.

1orw2jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1orw2jt/cannot_stand_portland_anymore_but_cant_find_a/,Cannot stand Portland anymore but cant find a comparable place,"I am a young 30s female, POC, leftist and work in the service industry. I am from the south.

I moved to Portland several years ago and want to preface by saying this is the MOST gorgeous place I feel like I will ever live, rain and gloom and all. I love the access to the mountains, the  high desert, the ocean, everything. In terms of nature and environment, I feel lucky to be here, genuinely. There's hardly any bugs here too which is wild. Summers are rad. NATURE RULES here.   
  
This city is one of the last cities not touched by Livenation so theres a lot more smaller booking agencies and cooler shows here that are booked over Seattle or the Bay Area (also due to costs there). Yes, we have killer coffee. Too many food options, imo, Im okay with a handful of places to get my indian/thai/japanese/korean etc fixes and Ive never been the person who needs access to thousands of different mid and overpriced food options. 

What doesn't rule here and has been eroding at my soul the moment I got here:

1. The cost of living. Its horribly, so awfully unsustainable here. Its the west coast, I get it, but the steep cost of rent to live in the city proper, on top of working in an oversaturated service industry, no one in this industry is thriving here.  
  
2. Lack of community and ability to make genuine friends. The PNW freeze has made it so painfully hard to make friends here or break into a friend group.  
  
3. Everyone is an artist, dj, or bartender. I mean this in a half joking way, but its also the wage disparity is so vast and everyone whose ""working class"" (but not a tradesman like a welder or woodworker) is so fucking miserable and its inescapable. No one is having a good time. I am so burnt out on constantly being surrounded by miserable people. Im trying to turn my life around. 

4. Lack of diversity and aggressive performativism. So many weird politically leaning people here -- ""I make 600k a year and have a Kamala sign in my yard, but I will not vote on rent control and making life affordable for the people that make this city interesting"" type attitudes here. Aggressive ""I love people of color"" savior complex with no action to back it up.

5. I really cant stand the rain but Im also not afraid to snowbird either and figure out another situation that way.

This feels long and rambly, but I would love to check out some cities that check the boxes of: 

1. decent weather that isnt cold or grey   
2. Blue or purple states/cities that have diversity  
3. access to various parts of nature  
4. People are FRIENDLY so in turn community is built easier  
5. MCOL city

I realize I cant have it all but community and cost of living are probably the top on my list.

I want to share my own experience and thoughts about nootropics in general and my radical experience with ISRIB-A15. I was in biohacking since 2015. I’ve used recreational drugs as well as nootropics. I was addicted to cannabis for 7 years. I am very happy that I am clean now of it, because it was really something that killed cognitive activity for my brain. But I’ve realized that brain fog and cognitive decline, which was caused after drug abuse haven’t disappeared. I became very lazy and apathic. I’ve tried Noopept, Modafinil, microdosing of LSD, lions mane. Lions mane was good for me. I started to feel more concentrated and brain became functioning more efficiently. But the best was my experience with ISRIB-A15. Something that helped to clean my brain fog and helped me to feel like the Limitless pill. Yes, the first dose motivated a lot myself. Like my brain function came back to the level, which was before drug abuse. The next doses was not so radical, but it helped me to stabilize myself and continue going on. But when I gave ISRIB-A15 to my friend, he said that he feels something, but not very clearly. And he said that coffee boost him much more. He said that maybe I experienced placebo. But I definitely didn’t. I haven’t felt as clear as after this research chemical for too long. I started to search the biochemical side of the question. It appears that ISRIB-A15 inhibits eIF2α phosphorylation, which is important mechanism in the brain, which appears on the cell level. It appears as response from the brain to some serious issues like stress, trauma, aging, stroke. This mechanism like block neuron regeneration as answer to the chronic stress. It is research chemical and was studied only on mice. But I have used it. I must say that this NOT Limitless pill, which would solve your problems. If your brain works properly, coffee would make even more sense for you. But ISRIB-A15 definitely can take the brain from deep mental fog.

He arrives at the location in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where the body of a teenage boy named Alec has been found. The boy was struck on the head and shot in the chest, but the head trauma was determined to be the cause of death.

The detective begins his investigation and learns that Alec was estranged from his mother, with whom no one has had contact for years. With no immediate leads, the detective examines Alec’s phone and discovers a history of drug-related messages. The texts reveal that someone had been supplying Alec with drugs.

Tracking the supplier leads to a chase and a violent confrontation before the detective apprehends the man. The supplier refuses to cooperate until the detective begins burning his stash of drug money. Panicking, the supplier reveals that the money belongs to a mob boss and that his life is in danger if the boss finds out. Terrified, he confesses where he got the drugs.

Following the lead, the detective learns that Alec owed money to a drug lord. This strengthens his suspicion that the drug lord is involved in the murder. The trail leads him to the drug lord’s son, Romeo, who also runs a part of the narcotics network. The detective finds Romeo in a bar, captures him, but during a standoff where Romeo takes a cop hostage, Romeo is killed.

Hearing of his son’s death, the drug lord plans a strike, but the detective and his team raid his base first. In the ensuing gunfight, the detective is injured, but the drug lord is captured. Sergeant Brian New, the detective’s superior, congratulates him and orders an interrogation.

During questioning, the detective shows the drug lord a photo of Alec and demands to know why he killed him. The drug lord denies any involvement. Pressed further, he admits to knowing Alec when the detective presents records of bitcoin transactions between them but insists he didn’t kill him. He claims Alec was always accompanied by another boy whenever he came for drugs. As the drug lord describes this boy, the detective suddenly feels dizzy from his injuries and collapses.

At the hospital, he is treated and meets Dr. Ann, who becomes a close friend. Frequent checkups eventually grow into a romantic bond.

Later, the detective visits the prison to extract more details from the drug lord before court, but shortly after leaving, he receives news that the drug lord has been murdered by an inmate. Suspecting a setup, the detective rushes to the scene, but Sergeant Brian informs him that the inmate confessed, claiming to be from a rival gang.

With Alec’s case lacking evidence, the court orders the case closed. Depressed, the detective turns to Ann for emotional support. A flashback montage shows his broken marriage and estranged daughter. Ann encourages him to reach out to her.

One night, drunk and staring at his evidence board, the detective suddenly recalls that the drug lord mentioned another boy before he collapsed. He revisits Alec’s phone records and discovers a contact named Robbie. However, Robbie’s number is inactive, and no school records list anyone by that name. When he visits Alec’s high school, Sergeant Brian confronts him angrily, accusing him of hallucinating due to his injury. Brian escorts him back to the station and demands proof that Robbie exists. Confused and doubting himself, the detective accepts medical leave.

At home, defeated, he re-examines his evidence board and notices a childhood photo of Alec playing football. He realizes he never checked Alec’s football coaching center the same one his daughter attends. When he visits the center, masked gunmen attack. Wounded, the detective fights back and kills them. Brian arrives, claiming they were remnants of the drug lord’s gang. When asked why he was there, the detective lies and says he came to see his daughter.

At the hospital, while being treated, he receives an email from the coaching center containing new information and his face turns pale.

The next scene shows the detective standing in a courthouse corridor surrounded by reporters as Sergeant Brian and a young man in handcuffs are led inside. The detective exchanges a knowing smirk with Brian.

The supplier refuses to cooperate until the detective begins burning his stash of drug money. Panicking, the supplier reveals that the money belongs to a mob boss and that his life is in danger if the boss finds out. Terrified, he confesses where he got the drugs.

Following the lead, the detective learns that Alec owed money to a drug lord. This strengthens his suspicion that the drug lord is involved in the murder. The trail leads him to the drug lord’s son, Romeo, who also runs a part of the narcotics network. The detective finds Romeo in a bar, captures him, but during a standoff where Romeo takes a cop hostage, Romeo is killed.

Hearing of his son’s death, the drug lord plans a strike, but the detective and his team raid his base first. In the ensuing gunfight, the detective is injured, but the drug lord is captured. Sergeant Brian New, the detective’s superior, congratulates him and orders an interrogation.

During questioning, the detective shows the drug lord a photo of Alec and demands to know why he killed him. The drug lord denies any involvement. Pressed further, he admits to knowing Alec when the detective presents records of bitcoin transactions between them but insists he didn’t kill him. He claims Alec was always accompanied by another boy whenever he came for drugs. As the drug lord describes this boy, the detective suddenly feels dizzy from his injuries and collapses.

At the hospital, he is treated and meets Dr. Ann, who becomes a close friend. Frequent checkups eventually grow into a romantic bond.

Later, the detective visits the prison to extract more details from the drug lord before court, but shortly after leaving, he receives news that the drug lord has been murdered by an inmate. Suspecting a setup, the detective rushes to the scene, but Sergeant Brian informs him that the inmate confessed, claiming to be from a rival gang.

With Alec’s case lacking evidence, the court orders the case closed. Depressed, the detective turns to Ann for emotional support. A flashback montage shows his broken marriage and estranged daughter. Ann encourages him to reach out to her.

One night, drunk and staring at his evidence board, the detective suddenly recalls that the drug lord mentioned another boy before he collapsed. He revisits Alec’s phone records and discovers a contact named Robbie. However, Robbie’s number is inactive, and no school records list anyone by that name. When he visits Alec’s high school, Sergeant Brian confronts him angrily, accusing him of hallucinating due to his injury. Brian escorts him back to the station and demands proof that Robbie exists. Confused and doubting himself, the detective accepts medical leave.

At home, defeated, he re-examines his evidence board and notices a childhood photo of Alec playing football. He realizes he never checked Alec’s football coaching center the same one his daughter attends. When he visits the center, masked gunmen attack. Wounded, the detective fights back and kills them. Brian arrives, claiming they were remnants of the drug lord’s gang. When asked why he was there, the detective lies and says he came to see his daughter.

At the hospital, while being treated, he receives an email from the coaching center containing new information and his face turns pale.

The next scene shows the detective standing in a courthouse corridor surrounded by reporters as Sergeant Brian and a young man in handcuffs are led inside. The detective exchanges a knowing smirk with Brian.

1orvntj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Confused/comments/1orvntj/im_trying_to_figure_out_why_im_upset/,Im trying to figure out why im upset,"I need an outside perspective. I have been sick enough to call into work for the past 3 days. I am immune compromised so something as small as a cold can knock me on my booty. I finally went back to work yesterday as a sales person. I was dying all day. Last weekend I suggested to my husband that we have a date night since we haven't had 1 in years. I got off work and did a grocery pick up because I didn't have it in me to shop. We went out for dinner and after about 30 mins of us talking, we started drifting off and looking around the resturant. It suddenly hit me about 45 mins in that we didn't have anything to talk about. I said this and I dont think he really got it. He did try to make more convorstion after this but it was more like yes or no responses from me. It was a ridiculously long wait time because its friday night at the only resturant in town but I understand because it happens. My husband is getting visibly angry. I finally, after an hour and a half, said I just wanted it to go because I lost my appetite. He refused. A little while later the food came. Neither of us really ate anything, boxed it up and went home. I tried to initiate intimacy and he turned me down, like normal, and he went to bed. I stayed up pretty late. This morning, im up early like normal, start making the kids breakfast in my horribly dirty kitchen. I work full time and he cant seem to find a job. I got a promotion yesterday which is why I even agreed to go out at all. My 16 yr old came up and said she was sick now, my husband comes around while im cooking and stares at the Scrambled eggs with little smokies and cheese I am finishing up and says ""why do you have to ruin smokies? This looks gross."" Then walks away. I hear ""smokies only go with bbq sauce crazy woman"" as he leaves the room. Last year I got him a German Shepard puppy, he only wanted a German Shepard. As im carrying in plates to the table the dog jumps on me and knocks my plate to the ground. I open the door to let him out and he almost takes my legs out barreling out the door. My husband gets mad at me for trying to make the dog sit while I open the door. I told him he needs to train his dog since he is home 99% of the time or he needs to go somewhere else where he will be trained. I cant even pet this dog without him tackeling me to the ground for affection. Im the witch though cause im upset I almost got tripped. Apparently I have been in a bad mood all morning. Granted he didn't get my coffee creamer I asked him to get so I didn't get coffee this morning. Now im sitting at the grocery store parking lot, typing this trying to figure out how im the bad guy here and trying to pin point what im actually upset about. I feel like its all of it but is there an underlying issue im not focusing on and am being frustrated in everything because of projection? Am I crazy?",2,1762624100.0,Confused,1,1.0,False

Story: 

The scene opens with a detective driving to a crime scene, a cup of coffee in his hand. He arrives at the location in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where the body of a teenage boy named Alec has been found. The boy was struck on the head and shot in the chest, but the head trauma was determined to be the cause of death.

The detective begins his investigation and learns that Alec was estranged from his mother, with whom no one has had contact for years. With no immediate leads, the detective examines Alec’s phone and discovers a history of drug-related messages. The texts reveal that someone had been supplying Alec with drugs.

Tracking the supplier leads to a chase and a violent confrontation before the detective apprehends the man. The supplier refuses to cooperate until the detective begins burning his stash of drug money.

I had to be induced due to complications and it took my milk forever to come in (when I pumped I didn’t even get colostrum until two days after I had her) so we had to supplement with almost all formula at first. My milk finally came in on day 6 and we started successfully breastfeeding when she was 9 days old. 

Everything was going good for about a week, but then she started getting bad gas and colic. She also had frequent streaky, mucousy poops with small dark flecks in them (I know now to be blood). I blamed it on a bad latch and fast letdown due to having an oversupply from excessive pumping to bring my milk in, so I switched to EP at the insistence of my mother in law (who lives with my fiancee and I) when she was about a month old. That didn’t help either and for the next few weeks she was still up all night crying and in severe pain. Come to find out, the real reason is that she actually has food sensitivities and I was accidentally drinking a little too much coffee during the day! My K cups had a higher content of caffeine than I thought they did and I feel AWFUL for doing that to my baby 😔 so I switched to half caff and have also cut dairy, soy, eggs, and wheat out of my diet. I have noticed a huge improvement in her symptoms by doing these two things. She was on hypoallergenic formula for about 10 days while I was making those changes while still pumping to maintain my supply, and the entire time my fiancee and his mom were both not being very supportive and telling me just to stop BF entirely.

Is it too late to get us latching well again? I honestly hate exclusively pumping and I miss the wonderful bond that I felt while BF my baby; I also don’t want her to miss out on the “customized milk” benefit of direct latching. Over the past 4 days I have been primarily nursing at night so we can get some practice in, but her latch feels much shallower than it used to be. We also did a weighted feed yesterday and she only transferred 3/4 of an ounce. She takes 3-4oz when I bottle feed breast milk, but when I BF her at night she still seems satisfied and goes to sleep after most of her feeds. There have only been two times where she is still hungry afterwards. I’m feeling discouraged and regretful; I don’t know if I should continue trying or just give up. I’m afraid she isn’t getting enough, I don’t want to confuse her if it isn’t going to work out, and I don’t have much support.

3 echos, 300 ECGs, HSCRP is 0.1, LFT, KFT, Ultrasounds, renal dopplers, urinary metanephrenes, CT calcium scan with a score of 0, TMT with METS of 12.7, thyroid, iron, all vitamins and magnesium, all electrolytes are normal, HB1AC is 5, fasting sugar is 85, evening and morning cortisol in normal limits, uric acid All tests done under the sun,

Idk what to do and im really paranoid about the 130/80 new threshold and sometimes im hitting even 150s without panic.

im 69 kgs and 5 feet 11 - super athletic, gym everyday and crossfit 3 times a week.

Ive been to over 10 cardiologists and when they see 170/100 in office reading theyimmediately prescribe amlodipine as well but my PCP asked me not to take any more meds in addition to telmisartan 40. Out of the 10 cardiologists 7 asked me not to take any meds.

What do i do? Today at 190 it felt like i was having a stroke. Severe headache, thudding heart.

I cant take beta blockers as my RHR is 45

idk why this is happening to me. Cant drink coffee. Sober for 2 years. No drink or smoke at all. I have travelled the globe, partied, enjoyed myself without BP ever being a problem!!!!! Now its ruined my life. My PCP asked me to stop measuring it but when i start feeling unconfortable i check it and it viola it is 150 and then 160 and keeps increasing.

I recently moved to Dayton for work and currently work in Finance. I just finished my master's from UC. My native language is Arabic, and although I use English daily at work, I’d like to improve my conversational skills and sound more natural in everyday situations.

I don’t have many native speaker friends here yet, so I’m hoping to meet people who might enjoy chatting, grabbing coffee, dinner, or doing a language exchange. I’d really appreciate anyone willing to help out! ",2,1762623581.0,dayton,1,0.75,False

Then an expensive BMW X6 pulled up outside the cafe and an attractive, well-dressed man got out.

1orvfqi,https://i.redd.it/z83a9x8dk20g1.png,2026 Home Décor Trends: How Homes Will Look,"Home décor in 2026 is all about making spaces warm, comfortable, and welcoming. Compared to 2025, which focused on bold colors and soft fabrics, this year adds more personality. Plain, all-white rooms are less popular. Instead, furniture and décor that feel lived-in and cozy are trending.

# Sofas That Stand Out

**Curved sofas** and **l shaped couches** are very popular. A **curved sofa** softens a room and makes it feel friendly. An l shaped couch gives plenty of space to sit, relax, or spend time with family and friends.

# Comfortable Leather Furniture

Comfort is very important in 2026. **Leather reclining sofas** are trending because they look good and feel great. The *Lakewood Triple Pwr Recliner Sofa in Tan Leather* is modern, functional, and comfortable.[ Lakewood Recliner Sofa](https://midinmod.com/products/lakewood-triple-pwr-recliner-sofa-tan-leather)

A leather reclining sofa works well with a curved sofa or green velvet couch. Mixing materials and textures makes a room feel layered and cozy.

# Small Pieces Matter

Lighting and storage furniture can change how a room feels. The *Beacon Floor Lamp in Oak/Natural* adds warmth and style.

Storage furniture can also be decorative. A mid century modern dresser or a textured TV stand can make a room look complete. The *72” Ash Wood Fluted TV Stand with Storage* is both practical and stylish.[ Ash Wood Fluted TV Stand](https://www.homary.com/item/72-ash-wood-fluted-tv-stand-with-storage-53494.html)

Even a single chair can change a room. The *Agnes Swivel Lounge Chair in Marshmallow White* is small, comfy, and perfect for reading or extra seating.[ Agnes Swivel Lounge Chair](https://www.article.com/product/24748/agnes-39-5-swivel-lounge-chair-marshmallow-white?queryID=edb152a947b18fa70ab64e3df11154ae&index=production_product)

# Colors and Textures

Warm tones are trending in 2026. Soft creams, earthy browns, deep greens, and natural wood colors are popular. Mixing textures like velvet, bouclé, and leather makes rooms feel cozy and inviting.

A simple idea: place a green velvet couch next to a neutral curved sofa, add a soft rug and pillows, and finish with a wooden coffee table. This makes the room feel complete and comfortable.

# Shopping Tips

The best online furniture stores make it easy to find the right pieces. Whether looking for a curved sofa, l shaped couch, or a mid century modern dresser, it is possible to find stylish furniture that lasts.

Focus on a few statement pieces like a green velvet couch or leather reclining sofa, then add small furniture, lighting, and storage pieces. This keeps the room stylish without being too crowded.

# Making a Home Feel Complete

The main idea for 2026 is warmth, comfort, and personality. Curved sofas and l shaped couches make a room inviting. Leather reclining sofas are practical and stylish. Layering different textures like velvet, bouclé, and leather adds depth. Lighting, storage, and accent furniture bring the room together.

Compared to 2025, homes in 2026 feel warmer and more lived-in. Combining different shapes, materials, and colors creates a space that is modern, comfortable, and welcoming.

Home décor should feel simple, enjoyable, and practical. Choosing furniture that adds comfort, texture, and style makes any home feel complete and cozy.",1,1762623552.0,midinmod,0,1.0,False
1orvf6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1orvf6m/how_a_simple_black_friday_stamp_card_idea_turned/,How a simple Black Friday “stamp card” idea turned into my side hustle this year,"Hello everyone! I wanna share my success story: I run a small coffee shop in a college neighborhood and last Black Friday, instead of doing the usual one-day discount madness, I tried s a week-long “stamp card” promo. Each visit earned a stamp, and after five stamps, you’d get a limited Y2K-style mug and a free drink.

The idea was just to keep people coming back instead of rushing in for one deal. And it actually worked! The week’s sales were up about 40% compared to the year before, and we handed out around 200 mugs to regulars.

Here’s where it gets funny: I totally underestimated how much people would love that mug. It was this simple lime-green thing with pixel fonts and a tiny. I ordered 250 from a local printer thinking I’d have leftovers for months. They were gone in four days.

Then came the DMs. People started asking if they could buy the mug online students, locals who missed the promo, even a few who moved out of town. So in December, I put up the remaining 50 mugs for $18 each on our website, and they sold out overnight.

This spring, I did a second run of 300 mugs at $22 each then and soft-launched it on our coffee shop’s Instagram. I didn’t even push it that hard, just a few story posts and a reel showing the design process. That batch cleared in about three weeks, bringing in roughly $5.4k in sales and around $2.3k in profit after costs.

Now it’s basically a mini side hustle. I’m planning to do limited drops every season. I don’t want to become a full merch brand, but it’s wild how one small promo reward turned into something that helps cover rent on slower months and I'm so so happy to have made it work, idk if i'd have been able to keep the coffee shop open without the exta boost

So yeah, mind blowing how a side hustle can actually work!",6,1762623513.0,sidehustle,3,1.0,False

1orvdcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlbaniaExpats/comments/1orvdcb/making_the_big_leap_to_albania/,Making the big leap to Albania,"Hello, everyone! 
I’m moving to from the US to Albani in March.  I have several questions to help me shore up final details. 

I’ve decided on Korcë because I’m really invested in immersing myself in the culture and language and I prefer four seasons.  

A huge barrier to my successful move is that I have two dogs and a cat.  Both dogs are kennel trained, potty trained, and have lived in apartments/townhomes their entire lives and are trained not to bark. Well, one of my dogs will give me a one quick bark if I’m not going to the bathroom fast enough before I go feed her 😂 But that’s about it unless someone knocks at the door but they will stop on my command. (I don’t usually have visitors as an outgoing introvert so a knock at the door is an exciting thing for them, not me. lol) 😅 My cat is so chill.  He does scratch anything but his cat post.  My furniture here in the US is so expensive I would lose my marbles if he did, but he’s never even true so I lucked out with him.  He’s neutered and just really chill and cuddly.  If the landlord came over for maintenance or something my cat would just greet you are the door and say hi and be on his merry way. 

All of that said, I have been having SO MUCH difficulty finding a place that will accept my two dogs and cat. I’m terrified it might not even be possible at this point? 

I’m looking for a two bedroom. Preferably furnished but if not it’s ok, I’ll just have to figure out how/where to purchase furniture when I get there and have it delivered. I need a great sized kitchen as I love to cook. My budget is 500-700 dollars USD. I’d prefer to start with a 6 month lease just for there to be time to learn if it’s an ideal fit for longer (possibly many years to come as I prefer stability). If there is a place that has a yard or something really unique or exceptional, I’d consider paying more for rent.

Is my price point unreasonable? Will I be able to find a place that allows three beautifully behaved pets? I’d also offer a pet deposit if that will offer more confidence to a landlord.  Should I find a realtor to help me? Are there locals who have ideas and can offer advice? 

My next issue is flying to Albania with my pets. Boy has it been a maze to figure out what airline and where to fly to.  Most airlines only allow 2 pets per passenger. So that’s a barrier to overcome.  Maybe I could pay for a round trip ticket for someone (A local in Albania) to fly to the US and they can check in one of my pets) and we can fly back to Albania? Or, maybe I could reverse that and find someone in the US who could fly with me to Albania and then head back to the US? 

On the subject of airlines, I don’t know if it is easiest to fly into Tirana, Greece or Italy? Which would be easiest to get to Korcë with three pets? 

Are Albanians warm to US citizens who want to integrate into their society? I’d love to learn how to cook Albanian food,learn the history, make great coffee, learn hobbies, the language, etc.

The last thing I kind of worry about is that I’ve always lived in big cities.  But, I’m looking for a slower pace. I think the slower pace will freak me out at first but eventually I’ll find ways, activities to keep me busy. What ideas do you have? I’m a 47 year old female by the way and I also really want to find travel buddies (male or female) who like adventure.   

Any ideas and advice is greatly appreciated! Any fair warnings are welcome as well!

I’ve never seen such a brutal crowd in my life — not even at concerts. Because of that, the whole experience was completely ruined. But honestly, one could have expected this: with such a low ticket price, it’s no wonder that such a massive crowd gathers. I truly regret attending, and I’m sure I’ll never go again.

As for my fellow men — it’s simply disgraceful to see grown men approaching the hostesses sitting on motorcycles, asking them to say their names into their phones or taking selfies with them. And we’re not talking about teenagers here, but full-grown adults. Take a look in the mirror, guys. Seriously.

At one of the cafés in the venue we ordered coffee and notice that, due to the rush, they weren’t even washing the coffee cups properly between uses. We got a disgusting, oily coffee, which we immediately sent back and refused to accept until the cup was actually cleaned. Unbelievable.

And to illustrate the crowd level: you stand 20 centimeters away from a motorcycle, and you still can’t actually see it fully, because you’re surrounded by such a dense mass of people. So, thank you, EICMA — you’ve shown me the true meaning of the word garbage. Goodbye.",0,1762623345.0,motorcycles,3,0.33,False

I'm seriously considering going with a coffee advent calendar. The one from Onyx looks incredible but it's pretty pricey. I'm leaning toward the Black & White Coffee advent calendar instead. For anyone who got it last year how was it? I'm a big fan of B&W overall, though I'm not always into their super funky experimental stuff (like this year's Halloween candy coffee). That said, last year's Christmas Candy co-ferment was absolutely incredible - tasted like peppermint candies!

I'm also open to picking up some traditional, crowd-pleasing holiday coffees - the kind of thing that's less fruity/experimental and great to share with family who might not be as into specialty coffee.

I used to answer all of his emails and take care of his invoicing and documentation, but I was severely burnt out from working so much and then trying to do work for him on top of it, so about a year and a half ago I told him I couldn’t do both anymore because I already had zero time for myself (no time to workout, relax, or do self-care) because I was so exhausted from dealing with people, phone calls, and emails for 9-11 hours each day and could not put in more labour on top of it. My brain felt like mush after my shifts were done and I would make small mistakes on his invoices or emails and he would get upset with me, so I told him I couldn’t do it anymore and I needed rest.

Since then he has gotten very upset me weekly, stating that I don’t do anything for him and when speaking about my needs for rest, receiving questions like “well what do you do for me? What about my needs?” To clarify, he is only referencing his need for me to do things for his work or doing more housework (which is usually a result of him making messes and not cleaning them up as I am not home during the day, not utilizing the kitchen or living room, and usually only using 2 rooms of the home — my bathroom and my dressing room). I keep explaining that my job takes all of my battery power each day as it is very busy and my attention is demanded every minute of my shifts, and when I get home I really need to rest and recharge my battery for the next day. I’ve suggested we clean the house together on the weekends and if he could clean up after himself there wouldn’t be really anything that needs cleaning during the week. He always got mad and shut down that idea and said that other women work and also clean and cook and I’m not special and should be able to clean during the week.

Fast forward, I am still working the same as before and my partner’s business is growing and he is looking for a larger space to operate his services from. This means that he is spending more time coming up with business plans, discussions with his accountant and realtor, and more stress sorting out the details of this new venture. I am very proud of him and wish I could be more involved and help more. He still gets after me often about not doing more for him (writing his business plans, doing his emails, documentation, etc.), but I keep explaining that if I didn’t work as much then I would have the energy to, but my work drains my battery and my body needs rest really badly otherwise I will burn out and become a mess.

We had a really big argument about this recently, and to allow me to focus more on his business and to be able to do all of the housework like he wants from me, we are discussing me quitting my job to instead work for him. The only thing we cannot agree on is what would be fair compensation. What I make now allows me to modestly save, not worry about cost and get what I need when I go to the grocery store or my little pleasures like Sephora, coffees, and beauty maintenance. I also pay my fair share in our rent. He wants me to still pay the same amount of rent that I am paying now, but take an extremely large pay cut from what I am making now, which would leave me with less than $200 per month (after taxes are taken off and my car insurance and phone bill paid) and would somehow need to cover my gas, food, beauty maintenance, and anything I need for the entire month. This means I would not be able to have anything leftover to put into savings and I wouldn’t be able to afford much if anything at all. He says I should be able to sacrifice these things now for the sake of our future and his business success.

I don’t want to come across as a materialistic woman, because I am not, but I am under so much stress that little things like getting a coffee from Starbucks and getting my little treats like candles or getting my hair/nails done makes me happy and I am having a hard time imagining not being able to afford anything for myself or to be able to look after myself as I can now. I want to make him happy but I also would like to be happy as well and I don’t feel like being broke while he makes a lot of money is fair, especially when he won’t give me a break on the amount of rent I pay.

AITAH or is he being unreasonable? Is less than $200 each month enough for the average person to cover all of their necessities and save and get themselves a little treat? Am I being unreasonable? I feel so lost.",1,1762622824.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Montreal Canadiens vs. Utah Mammoth: A Battle of Blisters and Bluelines**  
*Hockey Fights Cancer Night, but the Canadiens’ Defense Fights for Survival*

The Montreal Canadiens, hosting the Utah Mammoth at the Bell Centre on Hockey Fights Cancer Night, are a slight favorite (-115) according to the odds, implying a 53.3% chance to win. The Mammoth, at +104, carry a 49% implied probability. But let’s not let math dull the drama—this game is a clash of chaos and consistency, with both teams bringing their A-game (and their share of quirks).

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The Canadiens, fresh off four straight overtime games, are like a coffee addict who’s “allergic to sleep.” Their defense has allowed three+ goals in six straight games, making them the NHL’s version of a sieve at a bakery. Yet, they’re 8-2 as favorites this season, thriving under pressure like a poutine under a ladle of gravy.

The Mammoth, meanwhile, are a rollercoaster of emotions. They started October with seven wins, but their recent 3-4 skid has them looking like a team that forgot how to tie their skates. Their star, Nick Schmaltz, leads the charge with 18 points in 14 games, but he’s yet to break 63 points in a season—like a chef who’s mastered appetizers but still can’t cook a main course.

### News Digest: Injuries, Strikes, and a Side of Charity

Montreal’s woes? Their defense is so leaky, they’d let a Zamboni score a hat trick. Forward Noah Dobson, though, is hot—five points in four games, including a highlight-reel assist against the Devils. But their recent games have been a “let’s go to overtime” lottery, with seven of their last 11 games needing extra time.

Utah’s struggles are compounded by their Northeastern road trip. They’ve split their first two games here, and their offense has the spark of a dying campfire. Schmaltz’s absence of a career season? A my

He asked to meet and we connected on social media. 2 hours after he asked— I unmatched him and cancelled honestly via Insta. I said I wasn’t ready to date and apologized for wasting his time. He took it well and didn’t unfollow me. I thought about reaching out to him again but unfollowed/removed him months later bc I figured it was pointless since it was too late into the year.

I was super attracted to him, we had a good conversation, and I’m extremely picky — but I felt drawn to him for some reason?  I cancelled on him I was avoidant and I lacked strong community back then. I was scared to meet him bc I had not much going on for myself. I deleted the apps after that. For context, we were both exchange students studying abroad at the time in the same city.

Fast forward 1.5 years later as I planned on moving back (same country, diff city), I was having thoughts about what I would and wouldn’t have done in the past. His scenario popped up in my head. I’m in a much better place now so I was like “Why not reach out and see?” So I sent him a follow request. He accepted and didn’t follow me back, but dmed me saying hi an was trying to probe for my intentions. This made me nervous so I was very indirect and came across like I felt bad/wanted to clear the air. He asked why it came up randomly and said he didn’t think much of it back then and that I didn’t say anything wrong.  I was just like “I’m moving back so I was just thinking a lot about my time there. I just wanted to reach out since I thought you were genuinely nice, but I hope you’re doing well.” This was me dropping a hint 😭

He didn’t address the part about me moving back— but he gave specific details that he stayed in the city we studied abroad in, got accepted to university (the same one I had been at— he was at a different one at the time), and that he got a job. Then, right after, he said, “Hope you’re doing well too!” I just hearted the message and unfollowed him because I assumed he curved me? I started wondering if he didnt follow back because he didn’t trust my intentions, what would had happened had I been super direct with him, what if we were both too cautious, etc. Because he literally could’ve just denied my request but he deliberately chose to accept and dm me? And he tried asking for my intentions twice.

I’m visiting the city later this month and I’m debating on sending him a no bullshit direct message like “Hey, I’ll be here soon. To be more direct this time: I regretted not getting to know you and reached out hoping you were still around if you wanted to reconnect. If you’d be down to meet me for coffee/drink then let me know. If not, no worries!”

I don’t want to come off as crazy because obviously we never met. I’m a person who’s genuine and super intentional so I’ll back off if I get a clear no. I don’t know how I’d react if it were the other way around, but if it was someone I genuinely found attractive then I don’t think I’d mind them reaching out. Am I being delusional? Should I even bother sending the message? Or is it just gonna lead to rejection/me getting blocked.",0,1762622545.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

1orv0d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1orv0d8/anxious_attached/,Anxious attached,"Hello. Sorry for the long post.  I have been anxiously attached for as long as I can remember. Despite lots of therapy, it seems to be getting worse as I get older (39 F). Other parts of my life are good (career, family, etc.) but I have never once had a healthy romantic relationship. My son's father left me and honestly, I can not say I blame him. My most recent relationship with a man lasted about 4 months. I am fairly certain he is a dismissive avoidant (surprise surprise) and it has absolutely caused the worst bouts of anxiety/protest behaviors/shame I have EVER had. 

I keep cutting it off with him because he does not want a relationship but is happy to be FWB. But then, like clockwork, around the three week mark I feel an uncontrollable urge to reach out to him. It is like someone else has taken over my body. Until he picks up, my nervous system goes into overdrive.

Usually, I can never extricate myself from these situations and the other person has to block me or just refuse contact. This particular man refuses to do so (I even asked him to block me out of desperation). He picks up and engages me in hours' long conversations and then the whole thing restarts. But each time gets more chaotic, he retreats quicker and my protest behaviors get more severe. 

Well here we are once more. This time, he offered to get coffee with me instead of the usual him coming around my place after dark...I asked if he missed me and he said vaguely ""you already know"". So all of this sent me into a complete preoccupied obsession of what does it all mean. Without any evidence, I became convinced he was now with someone else. The spiral was so bad I think I called him six times in a row. Then I became frantic I ruined my chance for the closure/final coffee. More calling, more spiraling, more shame. 

Now I am entirely preoccupied with whether he will still have this coffee with me. The main theme is always can I redeem myself in his eyes. I feel like a zombie, just trying to get through each day until this undetermined coffee date. I barely even know this man...sometimes it feels like I just choose a random person and give them the keys to my life.

  
What feels most right is just saying to myself, I don't need this person, I don't need this coffee. I just want to be free. But I know that Monday will come around and I will reach out to him. If I do see him, the torture starts again. If he does not reply, the torture starts again but worse. I feel completely powerless to stop this.

  
I want this to be over, not just with this situation but for my life in general. 

And again, I have tried many many things including therapy to manage but none of it has helped. ",1,1762622504.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I noted that most people here don’t even mind a 100-km range if they could recharge in just 5–10 minutes, the same time it takes to fuel a regular car, grab a coffee, and stretch. Well, I am not sure why most people could think that way, I connected this to a Stanford Advanced Materials post that made this point even clearer on research into lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries that could charge quickly and hold more charge 
Whereas most people might look at it that way, I think the real issue goes much deeper than just charging speed. Even if batteries could recharge in 5–10 minutes, that doesn’t solve the bigger problems — like the availability of electricity, the cost of installing charging points, and the fact that some regions barely have the infrastructure to support large-scale EV adoption in the first place. Fast charging means nothing if there’s nowhere to actually charge. Whereas sulfur-based batteries show potential for ultra-fast charging that could shrink today’s EV 1–3 hour recharge down to just a few minutes. a  true breakthrough would be when EVs can not only charge quickly, but also rely on a charging network that is affordable, universally accessible, and doesn’t overload existing power grids. Until then, even the best battery chemistry won’t fix the bigger picture.
This article here https://www.samaterials.com/lithium-sulfur-batteries-lithium-ion-batteries.html explains how sulfur-based batteries show potential for ultra-fast charging that could shrink today’s average 3 hour recharge down to just a few minutes but that is nothing when there are no charging points. The fact that sulfur is lighter, cheaper, and more abundant than the materials used in lithium-ion batteries, which makes the whole thing of sulfur batteries more promising, we are still far from replacing hydroelectric power, it might never be replaced with solar in my reasoning.",0,1762622448.0,batteries,3,0.4,False

I have a tabby cat, Milo, who is usually full of energy but also ridiculously cautious about new things. A few weeks ago, I bought a little step stool for my kitchen so I could reach the higher shelves more easily. Milo, of course, was immediately suspicious. Every time I put it in the kitchen, he would circle it, sniff it from a distance, and then retreat like it was some kind of alien invader.

For days, I’d hear him tapping around the kitchen while I cooked, keeping an eye on the stool but never actually stepping on it. I started to forget it was even there but apparently, Milo hadn’t.

This morning, while I was making coffee, I glanced over and saw him cautiously placing one paw on the stool. Then the other. I held my breath. He froze, tail flicking, and then slowly stepped up with all four paws. And just like that, he climbed onto the stool and peered curiously at the counter.

It wasn’t a huge achievement in the grand scheme of things, but I felt a little burst of happiness. Milo jumped down a few minutes later and went back to napping, but the stool was no longer mysterious. He’d figured it out at his own pace, in his own quiet way.

I think that’s what I love about small moments like this they’re tiny victories in everyday life that often go unnoticed. A cat conquering a stool might seem trivial, but it reminded me to slow down and appreciate the little things: a sunny kitchen, a warm cup of coffee, and a pet figuring something out for themselves.

The title says it how it is.

I’m coming up on about a year since I broke up with her. I won’t get into all the details as it’s not important to the situation, but it was very mutual at first. A little bit after we broke up, she texted me a laundry list of things essentially blaming me for why the relationship went south, but later apologized. 

Also, an important note, she told me when we broke up that she doesn’t want to be judged for how she moves on. When I asked what that meant, she said “seeing other people” so distract herself and move on essentially. Obviously not thrilling to hear while ending a nearly five-year relationship regardless of how checked out I was.

I told people about this, and they assured me that I didn’t need to wait to try to meet other people. Why would I sit and try to respect the relationship when I know she isn’t? You know? Anyways, I got on dating apps for fun. Not really expecting anything. My ex was also on the apps, as my friends saw her account.

I then got word from my friends that she was posting Tik Toks about me and our former relationship. She was apologizing for making mistakes in our relationship, saying she hopes I do well, saying she hopes my next partner treats me well, etc. I didn’t give it much attention because I was still not thrilled with how she treated me after we broke up. 

Fast forward about a month after we broke up, I meet a girl on the apps and she is super ambitious and super cool. She asked to get coffee, so I agreed and this was the first time I engaged with someone after the break up. This new girl ended up being everything I ever wanted. We became exclusive about a month after that. 

About three months after I started dating my girlfriend, she joined me on a trip to visit my friends where I once studied abroad. This was the first time I ever posted her on social media. This was like 5 months ago.

Ever since then, my ex has been on a ridiculous Tik Tok posting spree. She’s claiming I cheated on her (with my girlfriend whom I met a month after we broke up), I “manipulated” her, and saying all of these nasty things about my character that are simply not true. There is an utterly insane inconsistency in the things she is saying and posting which further proves my point that none of this is rooted in any truth, but rather an attempt at a large “get-back”. 

Anyway, I want this to stop. She has a decent following online and she has been putting my face to all of these terrible labels. We (my girlfriend and I) once tried to tell her by commenting that I never cheated (we are blocked on literally everything) and she blew up and it only made the situation much worse. 

We were told to “stop seeking her out” as she “doesn’t want anything to do” with either of us. These were not sent to us privately, but instead another post addressing the fact that we tried to clear things up via our only channel of communication (commenting).

What do I do? How can I get this to end?

I (22M) used to go to the same uni as this girl here in Antwerp, but I changed universities last year. About a month ago, I started talking to her again on Instagram — small talk at first, then we started messaging pretty regularly.

After a few weeks, I asked her to hang out. We met up last week, went for ice cream, and then grabbed coffee afterward. We ended up talking for about two hours. The vibe felt great — she was laughing, joking, and even started singing and dancing a bit when music from a pub next to the café started playing. She also let me open every door for her, sometimes even waiting for me to do it, which I thought was a nice sign of comfort.

When the evening ended, I ordered her a cab and told her to text me when she got home. She did — just said, “I’m home, thanks.” I texted back that I really enjoyed spending time with her, and she replied, “yeaa me too.”

The next day, I tried to keep the convo going on Instagram, but it kind of died out — and since then, she hasn’t reached out at all. I realized I was always the one starting conversations, and it’s been quiet since Wednesday.

I’m leaving Antwerp in a week for about three months (going to the US), and I’m not sure what to do. Should I try reaching out before I leave, or just stay quiet and see if she texts first?

I started college this year as a freshman and I found out a while ago which academic mentor i got assigned to, but in my college we don't have mandatory meet ups with our mentors so we are supposed to reach out to them and schedule our own. However, I am reaching my end of the semester and finishing freshman year soon, but I have never reached out to my mentor mainly because of overwhelming coursework loads (I was barely keeping up with deadlines.... idk why I thought it was a wise choice to take a 2nd year level course this sem...)

Although my mentor specialises in bioinformatics and I want to major in biotechnology, I'm also interested in bioinformatics and I thought it would be useful to have both wet lab and dry lab skills (I aim to pivot into biomolecular engineering for postgrad). Thing is, according to my institution's rules, I would not be able to double major nor minor in bioinformatics and due to many course clashes I can't take most bioinformatics courses in uni. However I did find one that states it’d be helpful to know python, R, and linux…

So now I plan to teach myself coding (since I don't have prior experience) and I would also like to try for a summer internship for (ideally) wet+dry lab positions. I feel like I should raise my aspirations and questions (like where to start?) to my mentor but I'm not sure how to reach out to them so I would not sound like I'm ""wasting"" their time..... and also I'm not sure how to do a coffee chat like, I have many uncertainties but idk what to ask (????)... any advice is appreciated!!!",2,1762621965.0,bioinformaticscareers,0,1.0,False

I had a CT with contrast on the 12th and they didnt see anything.

Endoscopy on the 14th showed 4 ulcers in my stomach but none actively bleeding.

I was in the ER Sunday, CT was fine . Just high heart rate (160 standing, 140 sitting, 120 laying.) higher BP but not dangerous . Troponin was concerning but it lowered so thats good.

Was transfered to a room at a more equipped hospital. Doc came in told me he compared my blood levels from 3 weeks prior to now and it seems i lost almost 5 pints with the numbers.

Tuesday I had an endoscopy done, there were 4 ulcers in there but no active bleeding.

Never threw up at hospital. But what had happened was I threw up 30-40 times in 3 hours Sunday (12th) morning from 330am to 630am . Ignored my GF about the coffee ground looking vomit and went to bed. Woke up, went to pee, lost my vision and hearing and got dizzy.

I just wanted to share my home espresso setup that I use for practice.  
It's a small, beginner-friendly machine, but I've been experimenting with different shots and grind settings.  

I’m still learning, so any tips or feedback on my setup or workflow would be much appreciated!

I firmly believe any claims of there being contract call center companies that are on the level and not hell to work at are manufactured to trick people into applying.

​

What you take calls for may vary, but the experience is the same, you start each day hoping that it won't be back-to-back calls, and end the day kicking yourself for hoping working conditions would be fair this time.

​

Eventually, the client catches on to the company half-assing their work, and they get dropped.

​

That leads to scrambling for a new client who if they’re working with us, that’s an indicator of shadiness right off the back.

​

In my case, the trouble began when our client UltraSAT, was acquired by another company called “IFTV”.

​

None of us could find much about the company, but everyone was worried about what could come from this.

​

Pay cuts were expected, along with possible relocation, or INFTV deciding they didn’t want to pay the lease on the building and make us work from home. We did find out that they would be making changes to programming available, so that meant tons of calls where people would be asking “where did these channels go?”.

​

The changes were said to go into effect that Friday, at the end of our work week.

​

That Friday, I sat down at my cubicle and readied in.

​

Within half a second, I was on a call, it was a pretty basic one, an older sounding customer asking why his screen was stretched.

​

I started out asking probing questions, then explained that older TV shows are in a different aspect ratio, and his receiver was trying to correct the resolution to make it fit.

​

It sounds simple, but for our customer base, I might as well be explaining quantum physics in another language.

​

Little did I know my first call of the day would be one of the last normal calls I’d get for the rest of my shift.

​

The next call came in, I’m going to try my best to recall it and the other ones I received that night from memory.

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT. How may I help you today?”

​

All I heard at first was the sound of someone sobbing, then he spoke.

​

“I… I can’t see my TV.”

​

I checked my knowledge base and got ready to play twenty questions to get to the problem.

​

“Alright, have you checked to make sure the TV is plugged in and turned on?”

​

“I can’t… I can't see anything.”

​

Visually impaired customers weren’t a rare scenario, so I had to pull up what we did to troubleshoot with them.

​

“Okay, sir, is there anyone who can help you?”

​

He started to sob again.

​

“No, they’re gone… he took them from me.”

​

“He?”

​

He started to sound frustrated.

​

“The TV man you sent over, he said he was here to update our cable box, but instead he took my family away!”

​

“Sir, please calm dow-“

​

He cut me off with angry shouting.

​

“The bastard knocked me to the floor while another one ran at my wife, and he dug his thumbs into my eyes!”

​

That last part caught my attention.

​

“I’m sorry, did you just say one of our technicians stuck his thumbs in your eyes?”

​

“YES! While he held me down, I heard the other one dragging my wife away! I don’t even know how long it’s been. I had to feel around for just the shape of my phone, and when I asked Siri to call 911, it just kept calling your fucking company!”

​

He was just yelling. I would have rerouted him to emergency services, but we can only transfer to other departments.

​

“Help me! There has to be someone you can put me through that can at least get an ambulance out here!”

​

I finally went to Slack and asked for help. I saw that I wasn’t the only one getting customers screaming for help, every single one was responded to with “transfer to supervisor line.”

​

I hated that, because normally all that happens is , they just go to another department because we don’t have a supervisor line, which means they eventually call back even angrier than before, but I was starting to get messages to get off the phone, so I told the customer I said that I would get him to a supervisor and transferred the call.

​

This became a call type I would get, and that was how they would end most of the time.

​

The second type of call I got would be people complaining about the new channels and programming, which included:

​

The pain channel, whose programming consisted of shows about people being severely injured with names like “That should have killed ‘em”, “extreme animal mauling's”, and “Who wants to be a pile of red goo?”.

​

The Monster Network, these shows all revolved around monsters ripping people apart.

​

And one that most would just describe as “the staring channel”.

​

These were also resolved by transferring to a “supervisor”.

The last type of call, I dreaded getting again.

​

It would go like this:

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT-“

​

“Please! Send a technician, something is wrong with our TV!”

​

“Okay, calm down, ma’am. What’s wrong with your TV?”

​

“It’s trying to eat me!”

​

“What?”

​

“It’s trying to EAT ME!”

​

That’s when I heard the sound of banging on a door.

​

“You’ve got to send someone! Please! It’s about to-“

​

Her pleas were interrupted by the door being broken down, the remainder of the call consisted of the customer screaming. Per our rules, I had to hang up after she failed to respond after I reached out to her three times.

​

10 hours of these calls, with my only reprieve being 2 15-minute breaks, lunch, and one final 10 minute break.

​

We weren't allowed to use our phones in the breakroom, so I just walked in, bought a snack, and walked out. I didn't notice at the time that more and more of my coworkers were just sitting there at the tables.

​

It was near the end of my shift, so to spare myself from going into overtime with these calls, I did an old trick:

I made sure that as soon as the call was over, it went to break.

​

From there, it was just a matter of luck, I was hoping the next call would not end before 11:50.

​

I got very lucky, it was one of the now rare basic troubleshooting calls, a welcome change from what I had been experiencing all night. After helping the customer with his TV input problems, the call ended, and I went right to break.

​

It was when I arrived at the break room for the last time that I noticed something was wrong with my coworkers. They were all just standing in a circle in the middle of the room, most of them I remember seeing on my prior breaks and lunch, they clocked out hours ago, they shouldn't still be here. I walked over to them, a little confused.

​

That's when I noticed the smell, well smells, tandem odors competing to see which one would make me gag first, what I can now identify as Sulfur, and Flesh.

​

“Um, hey, what's going on? Is there a meeting or something?”

​

My question hung in the air, it was like they didn't even know I was there.

​

“Hello? “

​

I got in front of one of my coworkers, and immediately recoiled… his eyes were missing, I turned to see that everyone on the other side of the circle were missing their eyes as well.

​

I looked down and saw in the center a pile of human eyes.

​

“What the fuck?!” I remember shouting and backing away from the circle

​

“What is wrong with all of you?!

​

Nobody answered, instead, they all started holding hands and whispering.

​

I backed up to the door, and I saw the time on the clock, it was midnight.

​

It starts becoming a blur from here. I remember the temperature getting higher, and an orange light coming from inside the circle of coworkers.

​

And what looked like the silhouette of a person rising up from the floor, then clear as day, it spoke:

​

“Hello former UltraSAT employees, and welcome to the start of your new career as an employee of Inferno TV! Now hold on tight, as you will have to relocate.”

​

It was when the ground began shaking violently, I finally felt like I was able to leave the break room and ran out the exit door to my car, I sped out of the parking lot, in my rearview mirror I saw my now former place of work continuing to shake, before what i could only describe as large red fingers emerging from the ground.

​

They wrapped around the building and began to pull it down. The last thing I remember was driving home, locking all of my doors, and sitting in the corner of my bedroom holding a bible to my chest.

​

I woke up the next morning and felt compelled to go back to work, or at least the building.

What I found was the aftermath of A giant demonic hand pulling a building into the ground, looks like I'm unemployed.

​

In between job hunting, I found an article that had been written about UltraSAT, that my building had been built on top of limestone caves and that a sinkhole had formed and caused the collapse, and no bodies could be exhumed at this moment.

Looking at the national news confirmed it was not confined to just my building.

I did get my last paycheck, though, well, I got a stack of  money  with slightly burned edges on my coffee table with a note that read.

1orumg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Treyblowski/comments/1orumg1/things_have_really_gone_to_hell_at_the_call/,Things have really gone to Hell at the call center I work for,"If there is a job that no one actually wants to do, it's call center work. I firmly believe any claims of there being contract call center companies that are on the level and not hell to work at are manufactured to trick people into applying.

​

What you take calls for may vary, but the experience is the same, you start each day hoping that it won't be back-to-back calls, and end the day kicking yourself for hoping working conditions would be fair this time.

​

Eventually, the client catches on to the company half-assing their work, and they get dropped.

​

That leads to scrambling for a new client who if they’re working with us, that’s an indicator of shadiness right off the back.

​

In my case, the trouble began when our client UltraSAT, was acquired by another company called “IFTV”.

​

None of us could find much about the company, but everyone was worried about what could come from this.

​

Pay cuts were expected, along with possible relocation, or INFTV deciding they didn’t want to pay the lease on the building and make us work from home. We did find out that they would be making changes to programming available, so that meant tons of calls where people would be asking “where did these channels go?”.

​

The changes were said to go into effect that Friday, at the end of our work week.

​

That Friday, I sat down at my cubicle and readied in.

​

Within half a second, I was on a call, it was a pretty basic one, an older sounding customer asking why his screen was stretched.

​

I started out asking probing questions, then explained that older TV shows are in a different aspect ratio, and his receiver was trying to correct the resolution to make it fit.

​

It sounds simple, but for our customer base, I might as well be explaining quantum physics in another language.

​

Little did I know my first call of the day would be one of the last normal calls I’d get for the rest of my shift.

​

The next call came in, I’m going to try my best to recall it and the other ones I received that night from memory.

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT. How may I help you today?”

​

All I heard at first was the sound of someone sobbing, then he spoke.

​

“I… I can’t see my TV.”

​

I checked my knowledge base and got ready to play twenty questions to get to the problem.

​

“Alright, have you checked to make sure the TV is plugged in and turned on?”

​

“I can’t… I can't see anything.”

​

Visually impaired customers weren’t a rare scenario, so I had to pull up what we did to troubleshoot with them.

​

“Okay, sir, is there anyone who can help you?”

​

He started to sob again.

​

“No, they’re gone… he took them from me.”

​

“He?”

​

He started to sound frustrated.

​

“The TV man you sent over, he said he was here to update our cable box, but instead he took my family away!”

​

“Sir, please calm dow-“

​

He cut me off with angry shouting.

​

“The bastard knocked me to the floor while another one ran at my wife, and he dug his thumbs into my eyes!”

​

That last part caught my attention.

​

“I’m sorry, did you just say one of our technicians stuck his thumbs in your eyes?”

​

“YES! While he held me down, I heard the other one dragging my wife away! I don’t even know how long it’s been. I had to feel around for just the shape of my phone, and when I asked Siri to call 911, it just kept calling your fucking company!”

​

He was just yelling. I would have rerouted him to emergency services, but we can only transfer to other departments.

​

“Help me! There has to be someone you can put me through that can at least get an ambulance out here!”

​

I finally went to Slack and asked for help. I saw that I wasn’t the only one getting customers screaming for help, every single one was responded to with “transfer to supervisor line.”

​

I hated that, because normally all that happens is , they just go to another department because we don’t have a supervisor line, which means they eventually call back even angrier than before, but I was starting to get messages to get off the phone, so I told the customer I said that I would get him to a supervisor and transferred the call.

​

This became a call type I would get, and that was how they would end most of the time.

​

The second type of call I got would be people complaining about the new channels and programming, which included:

​

The pain channel, whose programming consisted of shows about people being severely injured with names like “That should have killed ‘em”, “extreme animal mauling's”, and “Who wants to be a pile of red goo?”.

​

The Monster Network, these shows all revolved around monsters ripping people apart.

​

And one that most would just describe as “the staring channel”.

​

These were also resolved by transferring to a “supervisor”.

The last type of call, I dreaded getting again.

​

It would go like this:

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT-“

​

“Please! Send a technician, something is wrong with our TV!”

​

“Okay, calm down, ma’am. What’s wrong with your TV?”

​

“It’s trying to eat me!”

​

“What?”

​

“It’s trying to EAT ME!”

​

That’s when I heard the sound of banging on a door.

​

“You’ve got to send someone! Please! It’s about to-“

​

Her pleas were interrupted by the door being broken down, the remainder of the call consisted of the customer screaming. Per our rules, I had to hang up after she failed to respond after I reached out to her three times.

​

10 hours of these calls, with my only reprieve being 2 15-minute breaks, lunch, and one final 10 minute break.

​

We weren't allowed to use our phones in the breakroom, so I just walked in, bought a snack, and walked out. I didn't notice at the time that more and more of my coworkers were just sitting there at the tables.

​

It was near the end of my shift, so to spare myself from going into overtime with these calls, I did an old trick:

I made sure that as soon as the call was over, it went to break.

​

From there, it was just a matter of luck, I was hoping the next call would not end before 11:50.

​

I got very lucky, it was one of the now rare basic troubleshooting calls, a welcome change from what I had been experiencing all night. After helping the customer with his TV input problems, the call ended, and I went right to break.

​

It was when I arrived at the break room for the last time that I noticed something was wrong with my coworkers. They were all just standing in a circle in the middle of the room, most of them I remember seeing on my prior breaks and lunch, they clocked out hours ago, they shouldn't still be here. I walked over to them, a little confused.

​

That's when I noticed the smell, well smells, tandem odors competing to see which one would make me gag first, what I can now identify as Sulfur, and Flesh.

​

“Um, hey, what's going on? Is there a meeting or something?”

​

My question hung in the air, it was like they didn't even know I was there.

​

“Hello? “

​

I got in front of one of my coworkers, and immediately recoiled… his eyes were missing, I turned to see that everyone on the other side of the circle were missing their eyes as well.

​

I looked down and saw in the center a pile of human eyes.

​

“What the fuck?!” I remember shouting and backing away from the circle

​

“What is wrong with all of you?!

​

Nobody answered, instead, they all started holding hands and whispering.

​

I backed up to the door, and I saw the time on the clock, it was midnight.

​

It starts becoming a blur from here. I remember the temperature getting higher, and an orange light coming from inside the circle of coworkers.

​

And what looked like the silhouette of a person rising up from the floor, then clear as day, it spoke:

​

“Hello former UltraSAT employees, and welcome to the start of your new career as an employee of Inferno TV! Now hold on tight, as you will have to relocate.”

​

It was when the ground began shaking violently, I finally felt like I was able to leave the break room and ran out the exit door to my car, I sped out of the parking lot, in my rearview mirror I saw my now former place of work continuing to shake, before what i could only describe as large red fingers emerging from the ground.

​

They wrapped around the building and began to pull it down. The last thing I remember was driving home, locking all of my doors, and sitting in the corner of my bedroom holding a bible to my chest.

​

I woke up the next morning and felt compelled to go back to work, or at least the building.

What I found was the aftermath of A giant demonic hand pulling a building into the ground, looks like I'm unemployed.

​

In between job hunting, I found an article that had been written about UltraSAT, that my building had been built on top of limestone caves and that a sinkhole had formed and caused the collapse, and no bodies could be exhumed at this moment.

Looking at the national news confirmed it was not confined to just my building.

I did get my last paycheck, though, well, I got a stack of  money  with slightly burned edges on my coffee table with a note that read.

1orumf9,https://i.redd.it/7cuxsasre20g1.png,"My TSH yesterday was tanked compared to 6 weeks ago. Major bleed last month, could that explain why?","I went to the ER yesterday because I was so weak , still throwing up a lot when I eat, severe constipation . For some reason they did a TSH test when they were trying to clear up my constipation and it was low . Especially compared to the one only 6 weeks earlier. I already messaged my PcP to see what she wants to do but just curious if this is concerning or if it could just be a one off ? Also worried my RBC went back down in a couple days.

C/P of a post about my bleed for more context:

I had a CT with contrast on the 12th and they didnt see anything.

Endoscopy on the 14th showed 4 ulcers in my stomach but none actively bleeding.

I was in the ER Sunday, CT was fine . Just high heart rate (160 standing, 140 sitting, 120 laying.) higher BP but not dangerous . Troponin was concerning but it lowered so thats good.

Was transfered to a room at a more equipped hospital. Doc came in told me he compared my blood levels from 3 weeks prior to now and it seems i lost almost 5 pints with the numbers.

Tuesday I had an endoscopy done, there were 4 ulcers in there but no active bleeding.

Never threw up at hospital. But what had happened was I threw up 30-40 times in 3 hours Sunday (12th) morning from 330am to 630am . Ignored my GF about the coffee ground looking vomit and went to bed. Woke up, went to pee, lost my vision and hearing and got dizzy. My dumbass said fuck it and went back to bed. 2 hours later woke up again to pee (i got isues waking to pee) and wasnt feeling well. Went upstairs to talk to my mom , on the way up lost my vision and hearing again, but worse somehow, and when I got to our kitchen I collapsed and was loopy in the floor.

He asked me to meet and we connected on social media.  I wanna say like 2 hours after he asked— I unmatched him and cancelled honestly via Insta. I said I wasn’t ready to date and apologized for wasting his time. He took it well and didn’t unfollow me. I thought about reaching out to him again but basically unfollowed/removed him months later bc I figured it was pointless since it was too late into the year. 

I was super attracted to him, we had a good conversation, and I’m extremely picky (so he genuinely stood out to me). I felt drawn to him for some reason?  I cancelled on him because reality set for me. I was avoidant and I lacked strong community back then. I was scared to meet him bc I had not much going on for myself. I deleted the apps after that. For context, we were both exchange students studying abroad at the time in the same city. 

1.5 years later as I was moving back to the same country (diff city), I was having thoughts about how I changed— what I would and wouldn’t have done in the past. His scenario popped up in my head. I’m in a much better place now so I was like “Why not reach out and see?” I sent him a follow request. He accepted and didn’t follow me back, but dmed me saying hi an was trying to probe for my intentions. This made me nervous so I was very indirect and came across like I felt bad/wanted to clear the air. He asked why it came up randomly and said  he didn’t think much of it back then bc I didn’t say anything wrong to him. And I was just like “I’m moving back so I was just thinking a lot about my time there. I just wanted to reach out since I thought you were genuinely nice, but I hope you’re doing well.” This was me dropping a hint 😭

He didn’t address the part about me moving back— but he gave specific details that he stayed in the city we studied abroad in, got accepted to university (the same one I had been at— he was at a different one at the time), and that he got a job. Then he was  like “Hope you’re doing well too!”  I just hearted the message and unfollowed him because I assumed he curved me? I started wondering if he didnt follow back because he didn’t trust my intentions, what would had happened had I been super direct with him, what if we were both too cautious, etc. Because he literally could’ve just denied my request but he deliberately chose to accept and dm me? And he tried asking for my intentions twice. 

Anyway, I’m visiting the city later this month and I’m debating on sending him a no bullshit direct message like “Hey, I’ll be here soon. To be more direct this time: I regretted not getting to know you and reached out hoping you were still around if you wanted to reconnect. If you’d be down to meet me for coffee/drink then let me know. If not, no worries!” 

I don’t want to come off as crazy because obviously we never met. I’m a person who’s genuine and super intentional so I’ll back off if I get a clear no. I don’t know how I’d react if it were the other way around, but if it was someone I genuinely found attractive then I don’t think I’d mind. Am I being delusional? Should I even bother sending the message? Or is it just gonna lead to rejection/me getting blocked. ",2,1762621520.0,Advice,16,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

1orujn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1orujn5/a_few_reflections/,A few reflections,"**Side note**: I feel (somewhat) established within the 8 precepts and have done so for a few months now. Occasional slip ups on entertainment and eating do tend to happen though so I'm not sure whether that qualifies as establishment proper.

The latest HH video featuring Ven. Anigha and Ven. Nyanamoli (as well as the previous one being the Sutta study on the simile of the man carrying oil) adressed a theme that's been prominent in my experience lately; namely, that of not becoming absorbed in sense objects.

Until fairly recently, I was pretty unaware of how often I'd be completely 'lost in thoughts' or just in the particulars of experience altogether. Especially when just sitting or walking, I would be completely oblivous of how my 'contemplating and rehashing ideas and words of others' was, in fact, coming out of a compulsion to always be *doing something*.

Now I've started to sort of ""catch"" myself doing this - almost a 'waking up'-moment - and recognize that I'd lost the greater context of my overall situation (where I am, what is going on etc.). It really feels not much different from being lost in mundane daydreaming or absorbed in a particular task.  
And then keep making an effort to not allow oneself to lose the context (the context of not acting out of unwholesome states).

This has become easier to recognize now, not only as I'm sitting but also during bandwidth-requiring tasks such as when I'm working or when I'm having a conversation with someone. I've recently taken up the precept on idle chatter and that one in particular seems to highlight this aspect of making sure to 'keep my head above water' and not allowing myself to become overly absorbed/engaged in the conversation due to some emotional pressure to say the next thing, appear a certain way/feel socially included and so on. It is definitely tough at times to keep an eye on the mind and not lose sight of it.

Noticing that this tendency to 'become lost' in experience and forget the greater context can happen with almost any activity suggests to me that *anything* can sort of become 'entertainment' (or a hindrance?) if one is not keeping an eye on the mind.

A few things I'd like to get some clarity on as I am not sure if my reflections are off the mark:

* Is recognzing this tendency to become absorbed and then maintaining (i.e. refusing to let oneself get 'pulled back into' what had captivated you) part of seeing the signs of the mind/abandoning the hindrances?
* Especially lately, I've noticed very strong feelings/moods where on one day there will be a lot of clarity, perspective and things making sense and a sense of elation. And then the next day, a lack of clarity, strong doubt and just a very harassing mind. In both instances, it can be very difficult to 'wake up' and maintain perspective as the mind just keeps pulling and pushing and it can feel almost impossible to *not* act out of the enduring pleasant or unpleasant feeling (especially when there is that sense of clarity and pleasantness overall it can be fairly easy to become careless). Are these fluctuations a sign that I'd been doing something wrong before that or is that to be expected?

I know that the same practice of neither giving in (i.e. becoming absorbed/proliferating/dwelling on) nor resisting the discomfort of not having given in applies here with regards to these strong moods too. But it can be so overwhelming sometimes to not get carried away when these colour the entire experience (in particular when everything suddenly seems incredibly hopeless and gloomy). Recognizing that suble expectation of ""*When is this mood going to end? I don't think I can endure this much longer.*"" and not acting out of it can be really hard to maintain. Especially as one is filled with doubt in those moments.

* If there *isn't* that palpable pull/tendency to dwell on and become absorbed, say, in the idea of having a sweet treat as part of a meal or grabbing a cup of coffee, wouldn't that suggest that that action would not be rooted in craving?

If I question myself (as honestly as I try to anyway) and tease the idea of *not* going through with the action - and there isn't that sense of discomfort at the prospect of not getting it - it's fine, isn't it? The child is not screaming, it's just asking kindly and hence it can have it.  
However, with this, I sometimes get unsure if I am just bullshitting myself.  
But lately, I would then recognize unsureness as doubt (as it would often lead to a tendency to start becoming absorbed in thoughts of ""*Should I do it*?"" and ""*No, you're acting out""* etc. and then refraining from proliferating that further.

I know this is a lot but this is just something that's been on my mind lately. Feel free to also adress the stuff that wasn't marked with a bullet point.

I'd appreciate to also get a perspective on all this from one of the venerables.",5,1762621377.0,HillsideHermitage,0,1.0,False

I know how that sounds. But you have to understand, my husband was suffocating me. Every time I went to the grocery store he'd text asking when I'd be home. If I stopped for coffee he'd see I wasn't heading straight back and call. It was exhausting.

So when he confronted me about it last month, I told him he was being obsessive and paranoid. I said normal couples don't track each other like criminals. He got really quiet and said, fine, if that's how you feel then maybe I should stop caring where you are.

I turned off my location that night.

Two weeks later, the guy from my gym asked if I wanted to go away for a weekend. We'd been hooking up since April, nothing serious, just something that made me feel alive again. My husband works all the time anyway. He barely noticed me anymore except to check where I was.

I told my husband I was going to visit my college friend three hours away. He said okay and went back to his laptop. Didn't even look up.

The resort was perfect. Right on the water, huge pool, really nice restaurant. We got drinks, laid by the pool, had sex whenever we wanted. I felt free for the first time in years. No one watching my every move. No one questioning me.

I used our joint credit card. I figured my husband never checked it, he just paid it off every month without looking. And honestly, part of me didn't care anymore.

Monday morning I got home around eleven. My husband was sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop open. He looked at me and said, nice trip?

I said yeah, my friend and I had a great time catching up.

He turned his laptop around. It was our credit card statement. Ocean View Resort. Two hundred and forty dollars at the resort restaurant. Spa charges. All from this weekend.

My stomach dropped.

He said, your friend must really like expensive hotels.

I tried to lie. Said we decided to splurge, treat ourselves, why was he monitoring our finances now too?

He just stared at me. Then he said he'd already sent the charges to my mom with a message explaining that I'd been lying about my trip and he was pretty sure I'd been cheating.

I lost it. Screamed at him that he had no right to involve my mother in our marriage. That he was trying to control me by turning my own family against me. That this was exactly why I needed space from him.

He said, space? You mean fucking someone else at a beach resort on my dime?

I didn't answer. Just grabbed my phone and left.

My mom called me seventeen times before I finally picked up. She was crying. Not sad crying, angry crying. She said she'd suspected something was off with me lately but she thought I was just stressed with work. She asked me point blank if I'd been cheating on my husband.

I said it was complicated. That he'd been suffocating me and I felt trapped.

She cut me off. Said there was nothing complicated about it. Said I'd made vows and I broke them, and worse, I'd lied to her face for months. She asked if I had any idea what I'd done to a good man who loved me.

I said he was controlling and obsessive.

She said, honey, he was checking your location because he knew. He's known for months and he was trying to catch you in the lie.

That stopped me cold.

She said my husband had called her two months ago, crying, asking if she knew anything because he thought I was having an affair but he had no proof. She'd told him he was probably just paranoid, that I would never do that. She'd defended me.

Now she said she felt like an idiot. That she'd told him to trust me and I'd made her look like a fool.

I tried to explain about feeling suffocated and unappreciated but she just said, then you get marriage counseling or you get divorced. You don't fuck around behind his back and lie about it.

Then she said the thing that really got me. She said, you've finally gone too far, and I don't know if I can forgive this.

My own mother.

I'm staying at a hotel now, a cheap one this time. My husband changed the locks. My mom won't return my calls. My sister sent me a text that just said, seriously?

Everyone is acting like I'm this monster when all I did was try to find some happiness. Yes, I cheated. Yes, I lied. But he pushed me to it with his constant surveillance and control. If he'd just trusted me and given me space, none of this would have happened.

I don't think I'm the only one to blame here.

Am I really the asshole for wanting to feel free in my own life?

1orufwa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orufwa,My Coffee Making Set-Up as an Extreme Minimalist,"We were very recently talking about coffee as an extreme minimalist. Some folks said instant coffee, some preferred coffee shops, and I thought I’d share my extreme minimalism coffee making set up.

So I am a teacher, basically broke, and inter mix frugalism in with my extreme minimalism. I am by no means a zero waste minimalist, but I do try to be somewhat environmentally conscious. This means I generally make coffee at home everyday and allow myself the treat of take-away or coffee shop coffee about 2-3 times a month. I’ll also get it every day that I am on vacation to support local shops and for the fun experience.

As far as at home, over Christmas break 2024 I had a few safety incidents which made me change it up a bit. I used to heat water in a pot on the stove, then twice over break we almost had a fire because I got distracted (trust me, the clumsy distracted me will come into play a few times in this post). Therefore I purchased an electric kettle about 10 months ago. I had a pour over glass coffee carafe until 2 years ago when I accidentally shattered the glass carafe. Keeping the mesh filter part, I now use a random $1 plastic pyrex pitcher to do the pour over method (see pic). I pair this with brown paper filters. 

I had a nice porcelain camp mug I used to drink my coffee out of, had it for like 20 years, and then, yep you guessed it, dropped it and it broke. My bf bought me this nice clay pottery mug made by a local artist, used that for 2 years then, yep, dropped and broke that too. Sensing a pattern? Lol! So for the last 5 years or so I use a titanium camp mug by vargo, (only has one small dent) as my coffee and tea mug. 

I buy ground coffee and keep the package in the freezer except what's decanted into an old talenti jar for daily access, kept in the fridge. I do buy nice creamer, usually Silk brand vanilla almond creamer, though I am a sucker for International Delight pumpkin spice when its available. I use sugar-in-the-raw turbinado sugar. I used to buy it in the 1 lb box and decant it into a recycled mason jar from Prego Farmers Market brand tomato sauce, but we live in the south and bugs were becoming an issue. Unfortunately I did have to switch to the paper packets of sugar. I may try to come up with a better solution for that. 

Anyways long story short, too late!, that is my coffee making set up as an exteme minimalist.

1orufna,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1orufna/the_coffee_maschine_pact/,The coffee maschine pact,"So, my flatmate Jonas and I made this ridiculous pact about six months ago.
We decided that whoever breaks the coffee machine has to buy dinner for the other one for an entire week.

Now, to be clear, this coffee machine is… old. Like, wheezing-when-you-turn-it-on old. It’s one of those models that still has a tiny analog dial for temperature and a mysterious button that does nothing but feels important. Jonas got it secondhand from his cousin “who barely used it“ - which was obviously a lie.

Anyway, every morning, one of us goes through this ritual: grind the beans (which we store in an old jam jar because the original container broke ages ago), fill the water tank halfway because otherwise it leaks, and then whisper a silent prayer while hitting the power switch.

It’s been working fine, mostly because we’ve both been terrified of being the one who kills it. Every squeak, every sputter, every puff of steam is met with a glance that says “Don’t you dare die on my turn.”

Fast forward to last Tuesday.
I’m running late for work, hair still damp, laptop half-charged… the usual morning chaos. Jonas is still asleep, and I figure, hey, I’ll just make a quick cup before I go.

The machine gives its usual sigh, blinks once, then makes a noise I can only describe as “electrical death rattle.”
I freeze.
It hisses once, a puff of smoke rises, and then… silence.

I poke it. Nothing.
Unplug it, replug it. Nothing.
Jonas walks in, rubbing his eyes, and just stands there staring at the crime scene.

“You killed her,” he says.

I swear I didn’t, but the evidence was brutal, the smell of burnt plastic and a faint whiff of betrayal.

So yeah, I accepted defeat. That night I bought him dinner.
But then, here’s the twist: two days later, Jonas texts me from the kitchen.
“Bro. The machine works.”

Turns out the plug socket was dead. The machine had never been broken, I just hadn’t noticed because I was late and panicking.

So now he’s insisting that technically, I still owe him dinner for the “psychological distress” of believing the machine was gone. I told him to shove it, but I still ended up cooking pasta that night, mostly because I felt guilty laughing about it.

And now, every morning, before turning on the machine, one of us taps the plug twice like some kind of superstition.
Because apparently, that’s how rituals are born… from sheer paranoia and the fear of losing caffeine.",2,1762621126.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Pre-entery 

I don't know where to start from, my mental health or what has happened to me recently, it's all a mess. Sorry for not introducing myself, I'm Francis Porter, I'm a 30 year old man who has been going through some horrifying things. 

I work as a night guard here in zhven, It's a minimum wage job but peace can't be bought at least not for me. Though I often times like to go down and stroll around in the mountains of the city and the woods that It has, it's one way to remove the loneliness from my life. 

Chapter 1

November 14th a day off for me, it was a Sunday.
At around 2 am it was just me in the woods sitting by a rock, when it started to stream in my mind, the voice of a disaster. It wanted everything and anything, it was desperate and frantic even and suddenly suicidal. 

I knew it didn't belong in my head but somehow it's here... It spoke to me ""C'mon do it, jump in the bonfire"" it kept repeating itself over and over while I tried to control myself and restrain from any decision that I may regret in the future. 

I decided to walk around with the torch of my phone on, it still kept nagging me ""You missed a good opportunity!"" I tried ignoring it, like a broken cd player it continued with the same sentences again and again. 

I was starting to feel numb to it, right then I heard a scream, my mouth shut and my body froze while I looked around to see any possible movements, there were none.

After what felt like ages I could finally rest in my mind, It was close to dawn so I decided to track back home, I was still shaken from this experience though I brush it off and continue whilst listening to music on my way home.

Halfway there I could make out a figure in the distance, From the darkness that the trees upholded I couldn't find a face. I walked cautiously but in fear. 

The figure spoke ""Hey Francis, it's me your co-worker. I recognised his voice and approached him, it was truly him, he was missing one of his front teeth. 

""Hey Tony, you had me there"" He laughed and said ""Didn't mean to scare you, though beware of the dark, don't become a friend of it, it will bite you"" I felt unsettled after what happened and this wasn't helping me, I told him good night and continued my journey home.

When I finally reached there, I was relieved to find comfort and a safe spot to rest. Had a thought maybe I shouldn't go to the woods or mountains anymore, I fell asleep mid discussion of that thought.

Chapter 2

November 22nd a Monday late night. 
I was just starting my shift, got the keys to the surveillance office in the hallway, and like that I went into the room, it was full of cigarette smoke. I guess my co-workers were heavi smoking.

And then it hit me when it was 2 am again, the same voice comes back and decides to annoy me repeatedly. I just look at the camera monitors and try to turn my head off but it doesn't work. It manages to grab my attention fully.

Shiver crawled over my spin when the office door behind me slowly opened and a loud scream ""I know you"" I anxiously got up and rushed with a gun in hand but there was nobody there.

I managed to relax myself with some water and called a friend over the phone, he talked me into calming myself, I really thank him for that. Otherwise it would have been a nightmare to be alone with whoever roams in my head every now and then. I started to develop a fear of being alone... slowly.

I fell asleep and jumped out of my seat when my co-workers woke me up in the morning ""Hey buddy relax it's us. I saw the team and burst out laughing out of relief. "" Oh guys it's great seeing you all here"" I was happy to not be alone.

I went home and slept again, I was exhausted and mentally drained. Oh well this is the nature of my job, while people sleep I stay wide awake.
I guess I gotta introduce coffee into my life is what I thought.....
Right?

Chapter 3

November 24th Wednesday, As usual I went to work though on my way there. I started to feel anxious and pre-alarmed for something that I had no idea of. Out of nothing and nowhere I was scared of solitude, and then it hit me. 

""Why all this effort for nothing? Just end it"" It spoke to me like a fly near my ear. My body started to tense up and I was sweating as I thought and thought about it. 

I found myself running to work, when I got inside my co-worker which was Tony during that shift seemed worried like there was something he saw in me. 

""Are you okay Francis? Do you need water or something? Your face is a picture"" He squinted his eyes as he was trying to read me but couldn't quite figure me out, and then I decided to speak up.

""Nothing to worry about (I laughed nervously) just a few street dogs gathered courage to chase me to work today, eh how's you?"" 

I could see relieve in his eyes as he sat back in his chair and then everything was alright, he left though he said something that I still think about.

""Listen carefully to what kind of barks those dogs make, they could be signalling something. Though enjoy that chair for 8 hours"" We both laughed and he went....I couldn't stop thinking about what he meant.

Did he know? Was he aware of such a presence in my mind? I started to form all sorts of questions that I didn't have answers, heck I thought I was mentally ill or unstable.

I decided to occupy myself with work and sleep whenever I could to get myself away from all of this. I didn't rest much as unusual sounds kept waking me up, doors opening and closing, old tv sounds in the hallways of the building...I started to ask myself is there someone here? 

It should only be me here, perhaps a co-worker forgot something and so I didn't bother to check and went back to sleep.

As I slept away till the end of my shift, in my dreams I saw myself running around whilst people yelled at me...one in particular in a dusty black coat and a hat with red eyes kept looking at me. It let out such a loud yell that I still twitch from it....

I woke up abruptly from the dream, And after a few moments I noticed a paper on my desk, it read out ""You'd be needing a new pair of eyes if I wasn't so kind"" 

At first I thought it was a joke but as I checked the surveillance monitors and patrolled around, I saw nobody and there were no footprints on the ground and no door was opened.

What was I dealing with? I find myself engraved in the fears of something that I couldn't identify or figure out, apart from calling myself crazy.
I decided yet again to side away these things and go home....I really needed to sleep as I felt exhausted even though I slept at work...
Felt terrible that night, I wondered why?

Chapter 4

November 31st Wednesday, waking up as usual as it gets. I can say for one week I was free from anyone and anything, I went to work with music in my ears. 

Tony smiled and pat me on the back.
""In a good mood today huh?"" 
I replied ""Absolutely!"" and there he went.

I found myself doodling on a random notebook that I had on the table, we kept a lot of small notebooks in the office. We need them if there was something we need to write, I decided to go through them... nothing just work related stuff until I went through a certain page.

What I read turned my face pale,
""I watch and watch, left to right and up to bottom. I know your strolls and walks around the city and woods"" 

I never told anyone that I spent time in the woods, where did they get this information from?....then a door opened in my head...it entered the reddish demon, the voice.

""Why live in misery when you can give up and find peace? Perhaps you'll be more content somewhere else"" 

It repeated itself at least three times until I started saying ""stop, stop, stop and get out of my head. I could see random creatures in the office moving around and smiling at me, I wasn't sure what to make of it. 

Was I hallucinating all of this? Can't be I'm not insane or sleep deprived, I thought to myself.
I kept just looking at them until one of them decided to charge at me with lightish speed and a ferocious growl, I managed duck it and run out of the office and outside the building. 

I was gasping for oxygen as I was outside in the strobe lights of the city shining at me, I was constantly looking back and forth. Paranoid of what could surround and devour me, like an ant.

I proceed to sit on a random bench at the park, wasn't far from work. I knew I had to get back in but decided to give myself a break from that asylum of hell. Heck I was even thinking about resigning from work.

Though something occupied my mind, the monster's eyes, they grew and shrinked...its smile faded and re-appeared spontaneously. I was left in debt for words as I couldn't make a case between reality and fantasy.

What did I take with me from the woods or mountains? The fact that I met Tony there all alone and that he threw something at me when I told him about the dogs..left me thinking, it felt like he knew something or he was ""something"". 

Though after a while of dwelling there on the bench I got up and decided to head back, I entered the building cautiously only to find nothing whilst checking every room like a moron.

There was truly nothing even when I reached the office, I didn't even think about sleeping there. I just waited for the shift to end, felt like an eternity but he finally came and I left. 

Even though it was dawn I kept looking around and walked cautiously or till home, I felt something was watching me but with my eyes I couldn't find anything. 

I got in my house, looked around and found nothing. I locked the all the doors and slept with the lights on that night, I wasn't in the bravest mood.

I guess even the strongest and fearless men shake from the unknown? Perhaps I knew this thing? 

Chapter 5

December 3rd Saturday,
 Yet again another wave of nightmares comes my way, I see demonized figures follow me around the city in my dreams. 

I wake up in sweat and screams, After a few minutes I calm down. I get up and decide to head out to work.

""What's the point of this anyways"" 
There's the oddly familiar voice that never seems to leave me, desperately suicidal.
It wanted the worst for me on a consistent basis but I never gave in, though it never quit.
I guess I was a pro in ignoring it.

Cleared my head and managed to side it to a corner, I felt watched on my way to work but I also ignored that. 

I got there and saw Tony smiling, 
I spoke ""You're too happy today, what's the cause?"" 
He replied shortly with a smirk on his face
""Probably a bonfire with a witch"" 

At first I didn't get it, before I could say anything he got up and left me with a pat on my back.
I said to myself ""This guy is one weird mess"" 
I proceeded to sit in the same old chair for the remaining 8 hours of my shift, boring ones but paid ones.

Not much happened but I often found myself thinking about Tony and how he was behaving, something felt and seemed off.

A strange though suggested I'd go to the woods, It remained unclear what's there but I had a gut feeling.
Firstly I needed to get some sleep at home and take a bath.

I got home from work and slept for like 5 hours and then woke up and took a bath, I was all set for my walk around the trees of fate but I could see something in the window's of my room. 

Glowing red eyes with bloody hands on it and noticeable white teeth, those teeth were ones the size of a horse.

It screamed ferociously and growled, I closed my eyes and put my fingers in my ears, I couldn't take it anymore. 

And after a few moments it stopped, I couldn't see it anymore, there's something or someone messing with me but I have no clue.
Until I go to the tallest trees in town.

*-Writing-*

Francis's fate a red raining mess of fanatic deviation.
His eyes of no harm done wrong, the commitment to righteousness torn apart.

The portlands call upon ancestors to help repell the waves that he can't escape.
Unfortunately they gave way and he's abandoned in his own grave.
Promised land? promised words.

Chapter 6

December 4th Sunday, day off as usual.
I decided to go to the woods with earbuds in my ears, listening to music made the darkness of the night less scary.

As I walked around I felt a suffocating notion like something was ambushing me or that a bad presence was there.
And there it came
""This is where we met and here we shall depart"" The weirdsh voice of death wishing upon my confused brain.

Something inside of me pushed me to reply loudly in the woods, 
""Leave me alone, get out of my head""
It laughed maniacally and I could feel something move in the bushes...What could have possible caused all of this? 

I thought to myself in the burning wood of the bonfire, I kept looking at the bushes but nothing came out of it.

I was really considering being unstable until I felt a soft grip on my shoulders, I turn rapidly and see Tony with the biggest grin I've ever seen and he spoke with the same voice that I had in my head.
""We finally met each other""

I pushed him into the bonfire and sprinted and rushed till I could see the large buildings of the town, I didn't want to look back but eventually i did and I didn't see anyone.... only black smoke in the air.
Perhaps I burnt him and whatever bad he did to me? 

I reach home, I march in and close all doors and windows. I was curious to see what happened to him so I called him...they say curiosity killed the cat and the same is happening to me.

I dial his phone but it says that the number doesn't exist.... strange, I call my colleagues and they say that a guy named Tony is unknown to them.

I was baffled but couldn't be happier, though I felt the need to record this whole situation if anything did happen to me in the future.

May this pre-recorded be useful to whoever finds it, Of course if I'm no longer here.
""Screams fade in the distance as the port's waves rise and fall""

I have been making espresso for mostly lattes and americanos for the last 5 years. I'm not usually the type of person to really dial in the perfect volume, duration, etc. I typically make a shot and it is pretty good which is good enough for me. I have been using the Breville Bambino Plus with a Baratza Encore at a grind setting of 8 and have not varied any settings. I use the Peet's Italian Roast (a dark roast) whenever I use the machine.  
Everything has tasted great up until yesterday when my extractions started tasting very sour. I tried again and it was the same. I tried fiddling with some settings such as lengthening the extraction time, using a finer grind, and even using a new bag of beans, but all of these changes make marginal differences. The last time I had cleaned and descaled was probably a couple months before this, so I cleaned and descaled this morning and tried again, but I still find the taste to be sour.  
As far as I'm aware, I did not change anything between when it tasted fine and when it started tasting sour, but maybe I just can't remember.

Last week of August, nakamatch ko siya sa g app and ayun nagkafun kami but sides lang. tas after nung sides, diretso na agad ako umuwi kasi nahihiya ako sa kaniya kasi type ko siya huhu pero di ako nagpakita ng signs na bet ko siya. nag thank you at alis lang agad ako kasi dadating na parents niya. after nun walang convo na naganap. pero after 2 days ata nun, nagchat ako sa kaniya (nasa tg kami kasi nagdelete me g app after namin mag match kasi baka makita ng friends ko app sa phone hahaha) na baka pwede ako makahingi o bili ng small bond paper para sa zipgrade ko sa school kasi madaling araw na nun e ubos na pala zipgrade (answer sheet sa exam) ko nun. tas di siya nagreply and seen kaya naghanap nalang ako sa bayan ng bukas na tindahan nun. hanggang dumating yung hapon, di siya nagreply tas nung gabi, ayun dinelete niya for both convo namin sa tg. na-sad me kasi di niya ko type bwahahaha. 

after that, 1wk after, nag dl me uli at nakita ko siya uli sa g app. chinat ko siya kunyare di ko siya kilala hahahaha tas send loc siya tas sabi ko ""ay ikaw ba yung sa tapat nung ****?"" sabi niya ""yeah. are you the nursing guy?"" so naalala niya tas sabi ko ""oo hahahaha"" tas ayun di na siya nagreply so ayun saklap di talaga ata ako na-bet-an. so yun, delete g app and focus sa school nalang ang bakla. and magkalapit lang kami ng bahay pero never nag cross paths namin uli hahahaha.

1orua4j,https://i.redd.it/0q6ttcfgc20g1.jpeg,Outstanding service experience and a question,"Me again with the new-to-me 23 OB Onyx XT.  Took it in to my local Subaru dealer yesterday for an oil change (last one was 3k miles ago in May, mostly just to establish a relationship with the service department and get it checked out). 

During the inspection the tech found a leaking right rear strut. Pointed out the windshield wipers were a little frayed on the tips, and said the battery was still cranking fine but had low reserve (?). Oh, and the infotainment system needed an update (I did an OTA update when prompted when I first got it). About $1400 all told, including alignment after the strut replacement, all covered under the factory warranty.

Super attentive and courteous service reps, free Ubers if I didn't want to wait (I ended up getting a loaner -- 2025 Touring XT -- that leather!), and a free coffee bar with barrista. Whaaaaa? 

Been a long time since I've used any dealership for service, but I was blown away. Is this standard at all Subaru dealerships or just Georgetown (TX)?

Here's the question: previous owner installed  a Blue Ox BXH7003 Class III hitch receiver, but oddly, no wiring harness for trailer lights.

Subaru quoted me $600ish to install that -- said it would require bumper modification. I really just need a flat 4 connector for a small boat or utility trailer.

Just do that myself? Advice appreciated.

Pre-entery 

I don't know where to start from, my mental health or what has happened to me recently, it's all a mess. Sorry for not introducing myself, I'm Francis Porter, I'm a 30 year old man who has been going through some horrifying things. 

I work as a night guard here in zhven, It's a minimum wage job but peace can't be bought at least not for me. Though I often times like to go down and stroll around in the mountains of the city and the woods that It has, it's one way to remove the loneliness from my life. 

Chapter 1

November 14th a day off for me, it was a Sunday.
At around 2 am it was just me in the woods sitting by a rock, when it started to stream in my mind, the voice of a disaster. It wanted everything and anything, it was desperate and frantic even and suddenly suicidal. 

I knew it didn't belong in my head but somehow it's here... It spoke to me ""C'mon do it, jump in the bonfire"" it kept repeating itself over and over while I tried to control myself and restrain from any decision that I may regret in the future. 

I decided to walk around with the torch of my phone on, it still kept nagging me ""You missed a good opportunity!"" I tried ignoring it, like a broken cd player it continued with the same sentences again and again. 

I was starting to feel numb to it, right then I heard a scream, my mouth shut and my body froze while I looked around to see any possible movements, there were none.

After what felt like ages I could finally rest in my mind, It was close to dawn so I decided to track back home, I was still shaken from this experience though I brush it off and continue whilst listening to music on my way home.

Halfway there I could make out a figure in the distance, From the darkness that the trees upholded I couldn't find a face. I walked cautiously but in fear. 

The figure spoke ""Hey Francis, it's me your co-worker. I recognised his voice and approached him, it was truly him, he was missing one of his front teeth. 

""Hey Tony, you had me there"" He laughed and said ""Didn't mean to scare you, though beware of the dark, don't become a friend of it, it will bite you"" I felt unsettled after what happened and this wasn't helping me, I told him good night and continued my journey home.

When I finally reached there, I was relieved to find comfort and a safe spot to rest. Had a thought maybe I shouldn't go to the woods or mountains anymore, I fell asleep mid discussion of that thought.

Chapter 2

November 22nd a Monday late night. 
I was just starting my shift, got the keys to the surveillance office in the hallway, and like that I went into the room, it was full of cigarette smoke. I guess my co-workers were heavi smoking.

And then it hit me when it was 2 am again, the same voice comes back and decides to annoy me repeatedly. I just look at the camera monitors and try to turn my head off but it doesn't work. It manages to grab my attention fully.

Shiver crawled over my spin when the office door behind me slowly opened and a loud scream ""I know you"" I anxiously got up and rushed with a gun in hand but there was nobody there.

I managed to relax myself with some water and called a friend over the phone, he talked me into calming myself, I really thank him for that. Otherwise it would have been a nightmare to be alone with whoever roams in my head every now and then. I started to develop a fear of being alone... slowly.

I fell asleep and jumped out of my seat when my co-workers woke me up in the morning ""Hey buddy relax it's us. I saw the team and burst out laughing out of relief. "" Oh guys it's great seeing you all here"" I was happy to not be alone.

I went home and slept again, I was exhausted and mentally drained. Oh well this is the nature of my job, while people sleep I stay wide awake.
I guess I gotta introduce coffee into my life is what I thought.....
Right?

Chapter 3

November 24th Wednesday, As usual I went to work though on my way there. I started to feel anxious and pre-alarmed for something that I had no idea of. Out of nothing and nowhere I was scared of solitude, and then it hit me. 

""Why all this effort for nothing? Just end it"" It spoke to me like a fly near my ear. My body started to tense up and I was sweating as I thought and thought about it. 

I found myself running to work, when I got inside my co-worker which was Tony during that shift seemed worried like there was something he saw in me. 

""Are you okay Francis? Do you need water or something? Your face is a picture"" He squinted his eyes as he was trying to read me but couldn't quite figure me out, and then I decided to speak up.

""Nothing to worry about (I laughed nervously) just a few street dogs gathered courage to chase me to work today, eh how's you?"" 

I could see relieve in his eyes as he sat back in his chair and then everything was alright, he left though he said something that I still think about.

""Listen carefully to what kind of barks those dogs make, they could be signalling something. Though enjoy that chair for 8 hours"" We both laughed and he went....I couldn't stop thinking about what he meant.

Did he know? Was he aware of such a presence in my mind? I started to form all sorts of questions that I didn't have answers, heck I thought I was mentally ill or unstable.

I decided to occupy myself with work and sleep whenever I could to get myself away from all of this. I didn't rest much as unusual sounds kept waking me up, doors opening and closing, old tv sounds in the hallways of the building...I started to ask myself is there someone here? 

It should only be me here, perhaps a co-worker forgot something and so I didn't bother to check and went back to sleep.

As I slept away till the end of my shift, in my dreams I saw myself running around whilst people yelled at me...one in particular in a dusty black coat and a hat with red eyes kept looking at me. It let out such a loud yell that I still twitch from it....

I woke up abruptly from the dream, And after a few moments I noticed a paper on my desk, it read out ""You'd be needing a new pair of eyes if I wasn't so kind"" 

At first I thought it was a joke but as I checked the surveillance monitors and patrolled around, I saw nobody and there were no footprints on the ground and no door was opened.

What was I dealing with? I find myself engraved in the fears of something that I couldn't identify or figure out, apart from calling myself crazy.
I decided yet again to side away these things and go home....I really needed to sleep as I felt exhausted even though I slept at work...
Felt terrible that night, I wondered why?

Chapter 4

November 31st Wednesday, waking up as usual as it gets. I can say for one week I was free from anyone and anything, I went to work with music in my ears. 

Tony smiled and pat me on the back.
""In a good mood today huh?"" 
I replied ""Absolutely!"" and there he went.

I found myself doodling on a random notebook that I had on the table, we kept a lot of small notebooks in the office. We need them if there was something we need to write, I decided to go through them... nothing just work related stuff until I went through a certain page.

What I read turned my face pale,
""I watch and watch, left to right and up to bottom. I know your strolls and walks around the city and woods"" 

I never told anyone that I spent time in the woods, where did they get this information from?....then a door opened in my head...it entered the reddish demon, the voice.

""Why live in misery when you can give up and find peace? Perhaps you'll be more content somewhere else"" 

It repeated itself at least three times until I started saying ""stop, stop, stop and get out of my head. I could see random creatures in the office moving around and smiling at me, I wasn't sure what to make of it. 

Was I hallucinating all of this? Can't be I'm not insane or sleep deprived, I thought to myself.
I kept just looking at them until one of them decided to charge at me with lightish speed and a ferocious growl, I managed duck it and run out of the office and outside the building. 

I was gasping for oxygen as I was outside in the strobe lights of the city shining at me, I was constantly looking back and forth. Paranoid of what could surround and devour me, like an ant.

I proceed to sit on a random bench at the park, wasn't far from work. I knew I had to get back in but decided to give myself a break from that asylum of hell. Heck I was even thinking about resigning from work.

Though something occupied my mind, the monster's eyes, they grew and shrinked...its smile faded and re-appeared spontaneously. I was left in debt for words as I couldn't make a case between reality and fantasy.

What did I take with me from the woods or mountains? The fact that I met Tony there all alone and that he threw something at me when I told him about the dogs..left me thinking, it felt like he knew something or he was ""something"". 

Though after a while of dwelling there on the bench I got up and decided to head back, I entered the building cautiously only to find nothing whilst checking every room like a moron.

There was truly nothing even when I reached the office, I didn't even think about sleeping there. I just waited for the shift to end, felt like an eternity but he finally came and I left. 

Even though it was dawn I kept looking around and walked cautiously or till home, I felt something was watching me but with my eyes I couldn't find anything. 

I got in my house, looked around and found nothing. I locked the all the doors and slept with the lights on that night, I wasn't in the bravest mood.

I guess even the strongest and fearless men shake from the unknown? Perhaps I knew this thing? 

Chapter 5

December 3rd Saturday,
 Yet again another wave of nightmares comes my way, I see demonized figures follow me around the city in my dreams. 

I wake up in sweat and screams, After a few minutes I calm down. I get up and decide to head out to work.

""What's the point of this anyways"" 
There's the oddly familiar voice that never seems to leave me, desperately suicidal.
It wanted the worst for me on a consistent basis but I never gave in, though it never quit.
I guess I was a pro in ignoring it.

Cleared my head and managed to side it to a corner, I felt watched on my way to work but I also ignored that. 

I got there and saw Tony smiling, 
I spoke ""You're too happy today, what's the cause?"" 
He replied shortly with a smirk on his face
""Probably a bonfire with a witch"" 

At first I didn't get it, before I could say anything he got up and left me with a pat on my back.
I said to myself ""This guy is one weird mess"" 
I proceeded to sit in the same old chair for the remaining 8 hours of my shift, boring ones but paid ones.

Not much happened but I often found myself thinking about Tony and how he was behaving, something felt and seemed off.

A strange though suggested I'd go to the woods, It remained unclear what's there but I had a gut feeling.
Firstly I needed to get some sleep at home and take a bath.

I got home from work and slept for like 5 hours and then woke up and took a bath, I was all set for my walk around the trees of fate but I could see something in the window's of my room. 

Glowing red eyes with bloody hands on it and noticeable white teeth, those teeth were ones the size of a horse.

It screamed ferociously and growled, I closed my eyes and put my fingers in my ears, I couldn't take it anymore. 

And after a few moments it stopped, I couldn't see it anymore, there's something or someone messing with me but I have no clue.
Until I go to the tallest trees in town.

*-Writing-*

Francis's fate a red raining mess of fanatic deviation.
His eyes of no harm done wrong, the commitment to righteousness torn apart.

The portlands call upon ancestors to help repell the waves that he can't escape.
Unfortunately they gave way and he's abandoned in his own grave.
Promised land? promised words.

Chapter 6

December 4th Sunday, day off as usual.
I decided to go to the woods with earbuds in my ears, listening to music made the darkness of the night less scary.

As I walked around I felt a suffocating notion like something was ambushing me or that a bad presence was there.
And there it came
""This is where we met and here we shall depart"" The weirdsh voice of death wishing upon my confused brain.

Something inside of me pushed me to reply loudly in the woods, 
""Leave me alone, get out of my head""
It laughed maniacally and I could feel something move in the bushes...What could have possible caused all of this? 

I thought to myself in the burning wood of the bonfire, I kept looking at the bushes but nothing came out of it.

I was really considering being unstable until I felt a soft grip on my shoulders, I turn rapidly and see Tony with the biggest grin I've ever seen and he spoke with the same voice that I had in my head.
""We finally met each other""

I pushed him into the bonfire and sprinted and rushed till I could see the large buildings of the town, I didn't want to look back but eventually i did and I didn't see anyone.... only black smoke in the air.
Perhaps I burnt him and whatever bad he did to me? 

I reach home, I march in and close all doors and windows. I was curious to see what happened to him so I called him...they say curiosity killed the cat and the same is happening to me.

I dial his phone but it says that the number doesn't exist.... strange, I call my colleagues and they say that a guy named Tony is unknown to them.

I was baffled but couldn't be happier, though I felt the need to record this whole situation if anything did happen to me in the future.

May this pre-recorded be useful to whoever finds it, Of course if I'm no longer here.
""Screams fade in the distance as the port's waves rise and fall"" 

-Writing- 

Two poles but which is you? 
The one with the silky smooth flow that naturally drives you to the madness of the calmness?

Which port do you own and which owns you?
What does your heart crave when you're a mess?
Francis's fate or Portland's past mistakes?
Be wise in the envelope of destiny.

1oru8sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oru8sq/choosing_the_best_commuter_backpack/,Choosing The Best Commuter Backpack,"I'll never forget the morning my laptop sleeve failed on the subway. The impact when my bag hit the platform floor—that sickening thud—still makes me wince. Three years of work presentations, personal photos, everything. Gone. Because I'd bought a cheap backpack with a ""padded"" compartment that was basically decorative foam.

That $50 lesson cost me $1,200 in data recovery and a week of stress. Here's what I learned about actually choosing a commuter backpack that works.

# The Daily Reality Check

Your commuter backpack works harder than you think. Morning rush, weather changes, overcrowded trains, that walk from the parking garage in the rain. If you're like me and spent years cycling through disappointing bags that looked great online but failed in real life, this guide will save you time and money.

After testing dozens of packs across different commutes—subway, bike, walking—I've figured out what actually matters. Spoiler: it's not the features list on Amazon.

# What Makes a Good Commuter Backpack?

# Laptop Protection That Actually Works

Not all padded compartments are created equal. I learned this the hard way.

Your laptop compartment needs:

* **True padding** (at least 15mm of protective material, not decorative foam)
* **Floating bottom** design that suspends your laptop away from ground impacts
* **Size fit** for 15-17 inch laptops depending on your device
* **Separate access** so you're not digging through lunch containers to grab it

The YETI Crossroads ($230) overdoes laptop protection—which some find excessive until they drop their bag. Budget options like the Volher Travel ($60-80) use velcro sleeves that work fine if you're gentle. Premium packs like the Incase Icon ($180) add dedicated sleeves for tablets and a second laptop.

# The Sweaty Back Problem

Nobody talks about this enough. Arriving at work looking like you swam there destroys confidence.

Ventilation features that matter:

* **Suspended mesh back panels** (like the Osprey Aoede) create airflow channels
* **Contoured designs** minimize surface contact
* **Breathable materials** in the harness system

The CamelBak MULE Commute 22L uses air channels that genuinely work. Cheaper packs skip ventilation entirely, assuming you won't notice until summer hits.

If you bike commute, ventilation isn't optional—it's mandatory. Trust me on this.

# Size: The Goldilocks Problem

Too small and you're juggling grocery bags on the way home. Too large and you're the person everyone hates on the crowded train.

**The 20-30L sweet spot** works for most commuters:

* 20-22L: Minimalists, short commutes, laptop and essentials
* 24-26L: Standard workday needs, room for gym clothes or lunch
* 28-30L: Heavier loads, overnight items, versatile weekend use

I use a 26L pack daily. It fits my 16-inch laptop, lunch, a book, gym shoes, and an umbrella without feeling stuffed. When fully loaded with my actual daily carry, it weighs about 12 pounds—right at the recommended maximum for comfortable all-day wear.

Oversizing seems smart until you realize every extra liter tempts you to overpack. Your shoulders will thank you for choosing smaller.

# Water Resistance vs. Waterproof: Know the Difference

My first ""water-resistant"" backpack turned my notes into papier-mâché during a 10-minute drizzle.

**Water-resistant** repels light rain and splashes. The coating on nylon fabric (measured in mm, like 1000mm rating) determines effectiveness. Works for: Quick dashes, light weather, general protection.

**Waterproof** has sealed seams, specialized zippers, and heavy-duty coatings. Works for: Bike commuting, serious weather, paranoid protection of electronics.

The Arc'teryx Granville ($300+) is genuinely waterproof with taped seams. The North Face Recon ($100) is water-resistant enough for typical commutes. Budget packs often claim water resistance that's really just ""slightly damp-resistant.""

If your commute involves extended outdoor exposure, invest in real waterproofing. If you're mostly subway-to-office with occasional rain sprints, water-resistant works fine.

# Organization: The Hidden Dealbreaker

A backpack with poor organization becomes a black hole where keys vanish and pens explode.

Essential organizational features:

* **Quick-access front pocket** for phone, wallet, transit card
* **Dedicated tech compartment** separate from main storage
* **Internal dividers** or mesh pockets for cables and chargers
* **Water bottle pockets** (external or internal)
* **Pen holders and key clips** so small items don't disappear

The EVERGOODS Civic Half Zip 22L ($250) has smart organization that doesn't overwhelm—enough structure to stay sorted without being fussy. The Osprey Radial adds blinker light attachments for cyclists. Budget-friendly options like the MATEIN Travel Laptop Backpack ($40-50) surprise with decent organizational pockets.

Some people love 19+ pockets (looking at you, LTT Commuter). Others find that overwhelming. Know yourself.

# Comfort: Because Your Back Matters

Comfortable shoulder straps aren't luxury—they're necessity. After carrying a poorly designed pack for six months, I developed shoulder pain that took physical therapy to fix.

Comfort essentials:

* **Padded shoulder straps** (at least 15mm thick at contact points)
* **Sternum strap** for weight distribution on longer walks
* **Padded back panel** for lumbar support
* **Adjustable harness system** to fit your torso length

Premium packs like the Osprey line use hiking tech—contoured panels, breathable mesh, adjustment systems—adapted for urban use. Budget options often skip proper padding, assuming you won't carry the bag long enough to notice.

You will notice.

# Durability: The True Cost Calculation

A $50 backpack that fails in 8 months costs more than a $200 pack lasting 5 years.

Durability indicators:

* **Denier rating** (400D+ for high-wear areas; higher number = thicker, tougher fabric)
* **Reinforced stress points** at zipper corners and strap connections
* **Quality zippers** (YKK is the gold standard; cheap zippers fail first)
* **Bottom material** (ballistic nylon or reinforced base prevents wear)

The Filson Surveyor uses waxed Cordura nylon that laughs at scratches. The Peak Design Travel Backpack ($300) is overbuilt but practically indestructible. Budget packs use thinner materials that work fine until they don't.

Consider warranty too. Osprey offers lifetime guarantees. YETI backs their products aggressively. Budget brands typically offer nothing.

# Professional Appearance (When It Matters)

Some commuters need backpacks that look boardroom-ready. Others don't care.

If you work in conservative offices: Look for streamlined designs, neutral colors (black, navy, gray), minimal external straps, and leather or premium fabric accents. The Harber London Classic Rucksack ($400+) screams executive. The Troubadour Apex ($300) works from conference room to coffee shop.

If professional appearance doesn't matter: Prioritize function. The CamelBak MULE looks sporty but performs brilliantly. Hiking-style packs from Osprey work great if your office culture accepts them.

I've seen tech workers commute with bright orange hiking packs. I've seen lawyers with $600 leather backpacks. Know your environment.

# Budget Reality: What You Actually Need to Spend

**Budget tier ($40-80):** MATEIN, Volher Travel, basic JanSport models. Expect: Basic protection, adequate organization, 1-2 year lifespan. Skip if: You bike commute, carry expensive gear, or commute daily long-term.

**Mid-range ($100-220):** North Face Recon, Cotopaxi Allpa, standard Osprey models. Expect: Good protection, thoughtful features, 3-5 year lifespan. Best for: Most commuters, daily use, reliable performance.

**Premium ($230-300+):** YETI Crossroads, Arc'teryx, Peak Design, EVERGOODS. Expect: Exceptional durability, advanced features, 5+ year lifespan. Worth it if: You commute daily, carry valuable gear, want buy-once-cry-once.

I spent years buying $50 packs that failed. Finally invested $200 in a quality pack. Three years later, it looks new. Do the math.

# Red Flags to Avoid

Shopping for commuter backpacks, watch for these warning signs:

* **No laptop specifications** (how big? how protected?)
* **Claims of ""waterproof""** on sub-$100 packs (usually false)
* **Excessive external straps** that snag on subway doors
* **No ventilation features** if you walk/bike more than 10 minutes
* **Unclear return policy** (can't test properly before committing)
* **Generic brand with no reviews** (quality lottery)

# The Decision Framework

Here's how to choose based on your actual commute:

**Subway/Bus/Train commuters:** Prioritize compact size (20-24L), quick laptop access, professional appearance, and water resistance for platform-to-office dashes.

**Bike commuters:** Require ventilation, reflective elements, 22-28L for gear, and genuine waterproofing. Consider hi-vis features.

**Walking commuters:** Focus on comfort (padded straps, sternum strap), weight distribution, and weather protection. Size based on distance.

**Car commuters with short walks:** Organization and laptop protection matter most. Less emphasis on weather resistance or ventilation.

# My Honest Recommendations

After testing extensively, here's what I'd buy based on different situations:

For **tight budgets**: Volher Travel (around $70) delivers surprisingly solid performance. Not fancy, but it works.

For **most commuters**: North Face Recon ($100) or Cotopaxi Allpa ($220) balance features, durability, and price intelligently.

For **bike commuters**: Osprey Radial ($150) or CamelBak MULE Commute ($120) handle the specific challenges of cycling.

For **premium buyers**: YETI Crossroads ($230) if durability matters most, EVERGOODS Civic ($250) if you want maximum versatility.

# The Bottom Line

Your perfect commuter backpack depends on your specific commute, not someone else's recommendation.

Before buying, honestly answer:

* How long is my commute?
* What weather do I face?
* How much gear do I actually carry daily?
* Does professional appearance matter?
* What's my realistic budget?

Then test it. Most good brands offer returns. Load it with your actual daily carry. Wear it around the house for 30 minutes. If anything bothers you in that test, it'll infuriate you after 100 commutes.

The best commuter backpack isn't the one with the most features or highest price—it's the one that makes your daily grind slightly less grinding. Mine has paid for itself countless times in comfort, protection, and peace of mind.

TLDR; my friend who was recently diagnosed with autism 1 and I are having a disagreement on expectations of each other. We’ve talked about it several times and can’t come to terms :/. I just want them to be kinder to me

I feel really stuck and want to support my friend but don’t know how to talk to them about this. We’ve been friends for nearly 20 years and I try my best to be a kind supportive friend. She was diagnosed with autism 1 and lately they’ve been very critical of me and if I ever pose to do something they don’t want to do they get vehemently angry.

We were on a weekend trip and went somewhere I’ve never been before for a movie. On the way out there was a store they wanted to go to so we did. As they were shopping I stepped outside, saw a cool outdoor bar and some music. So I grabbed one beer. They saw me and said something along the lines of what are you doing I thought we were leaving and walked away obviously bothered. Earlier in the day we were walking around the pool and I wanted to lounge by the pool and have a drink. I was wearing a t shirt and shorts as it was warm and they were wearing thick pants. Didn’t want to do that bc it was too hot for them and they also didn’t want to sit at a bar for one drink.

They’re not the biggest drinker but I’m talking about wanting to have one beer here and there during our ‘vacation’

I also lost my hat and was looking for it - but I’m not the best at searching for things and get overwhelmed. They told me that they’ve seen me search for things and thought if I just tried harder I would find things. That really made me upset.

Meanwhile when we were heading to the airport for the trip they said I stressed them out because I casually mentioned I was thinking about going to the corner store for a coffee. There was also a brief confrontation with someone - they started arguing with them but I immediately read the situation and made the call that the fastest way to deal with it was to just activate a fawn response and let it slide. Didn’t want to waste time arguing because we had a flight to catch. When I got in the car I was putting in the gps and focused on driving/getting there. They said the way I acted was dismissive of their feelings later. I really didn’t understand what they were talking about - there is no scenario where arguing with a person gets them to move faster? They also point blank told me something mean and then said they don’t assign value to their statement yet they read so deep into this interaction?

They also don’t understand my limitations on things. I’m not always the most organized and need to triple check that I have everything before leaving the house. I tend to lose things and need to search. I have a high pressure job and put all my mental energy into that - when I’m not at work I need to relax my brain a bit and I’m pretty laidback / go with the flow. I struggle with keeping my apartment clean and self care. I have a history of trauma and I’m either highly focused on work or I’m kinda just zoned out/chilling/just go with the flow. I do the best I can and they know I’m on antidepressants and a mood stabilizer. I listen to their struggles all the time, and I’m truly happy they finally have a diagnosis that helps them make sense of things and that they’ve found their voice. 

However, they’re putting all these expectations on me and I feel not good enough to be their friend because I don’t have my sh!t enough together. And yes we’ve talked this through several times. At this point it’s not miscommunication it’s a disagreement. 

Any advice? My friends are my family so I want to figure out a way through this.",3,1762620460.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1oru5ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1oru5ph/germans_living_in_america_a_question_about_favors/,"Germans living in America: a question about favors, treating your friends, owing money, etc","Hi there,

I'm curious about the difference between German and American culture, specifically when it comes to offering and asking for favors, being treated to a meal or a coffee, or paying for eachother in different ways. 

I remember reading that for Germans, it's rude to owe someone money, so if a friend covers you for the cost of something, you try to pay then back right away. Correct me if I'm wrong! 

For Americans, it varies based on socioeconomics, but in general it's more rude to ask for money back from a friend, especially if it's a small amount, and paying for each other's coffee or lunch once in a while is normal. Most people don't consider that ""owing"", but a friend will say ""oh you got lunch last time, it's my turn."" 

So if you're a German living in America, what is your experience with this? It seems like it'd be difficult to adapt to a totally different mindset! 

 If someone does you a favor, are you uneasy until you can do something nice for them? If you loan someone a few bucks, and they don't pay you back right away (or at all) is it always on your mind when you see them? 

Thanks for indulging my curiosity!

If anything I was used in my past relationships and paid for everything. My boyfriend and I started officially dating recently, about 2 months ago and I moved in about a month ago due to it being long distance. However, we’ve know each other for about 2 years now. I took a chance to make the relationship work and closed the distance. I’m not anywhere near where I’d like to be financially, and moving to a small town (as I’m used to larger cities) has made making income difficult. I’ve only been here about a month and my boyfriend pays for a lot of things, but I do try to chip in when I can. I just can’t afford to eat takeout/ dine out all the time (which is where most of the costs are coming from). I chip in for groceries to cook , pay for coffee, and random things because I’ve been feeling horrible. I recently started a job and told him last night that I’d give him my first paycheck . I’m not used to being in a financial rut and I’ve always taken care of myself and others. But I’m not trying to financially ruin myself in the process. My boyfriend and I had a conversation last night to figure out if our goals align, and he mentioned that his mom thinks I’m using him. I’ve only been here for a month and his rent has only gone up $100 because I’m here now. I feel it’s a bit unfair to move out here struggling to make money in a small town and be automatically expected to pay for a large sum of the rent since it’s not even my place (or even enough space for all of my things) and he would have had to pay the 1200 (with the exception of the additional $100) on his own. I’m not expecting him to pay my way, but I figured giving me 3-6 months to settle in finically to start paying half of the rent would be fair.  If roles were reversed I would’ve done the same for him. I’m not the type to argue about money, I’ve never been. Also, he mentioned that he wants to buy a home and would like me to buy one with with him, but like I’ve said we’ve been only officially dating 2 months now and he’s talking about buying a house soon. I told him my time line would be 3-5 years after we get married unless he wants to buy one on his own. And he doesn’t seem exactly %100 thrilled about that. Am I being selfish/user?

I'm looking for someone to share thoughts/feelings that I have that I really can't share with anyone in my life. I don't struggle with any mental health issues and don't have harmful thoughts, but I grapple a lot with myself on relationships with people - be it friends or partners. In every aspect of my life, I am masking. And I just want to be able to take that mask off with someone far away who will never know my face or my name, but knows me in a way the people who know my face & name never will. 

That being said, I also want to make a disclaimer that I don't want every letter exchanged to be heavy/reflective/poetic - I would also just love to write about the things I see in my day to day life that I don't think anyone else in my life really cares about, but I do, and read about someone's day. 

I think my life currently lacks intentional connection - and so I'm looking for a snail mail Penpal where everything about it is intentional by nature. I am located in Singapore 🇸🇬 and open to penpals from anywhere, but strictly snail mail. 

More about myself & my hobbies: 


🧠 I have total aphantasia, so I have zero visual imagination and no inner voice. I'd deeply appreciate photos of cool things, and will likely send you printed ones too :) 

📚 I love reading all genres but I find myself drawn to books with darker themes especially around human nature like Jose Saramago's Blindness, Bruce Holsinger's Culpability and sad-ish books like Kazuo Ishiguro's Remains of the Day. I read at least 1 book a week. 

🖼️ I enjoy museums and art, especially ones on niche topics like Museum of Package Culture in Japan. 

☕️ I like black coffee, teas (especially green) and of course matcha strawberries. 

🗺️ I'm also decently-traveled, especially around Asia (except South Asia because I tend to travel solo) 

🔮I don't believe in a particular God, but I believe there is some greater power out there. I get my tarot cards read every now and then by an astrologer. I also believe in the supernatural and have had some encounters.

Ang akong tinuod nga pagsugod kay Lunes pa, pero gusto ko nga moadto daan aron makaila sa mga tawo ug makasabot sa daloy sa opisina.

Pagmata nako kadlawn, excited kaayo ko. Plano unta nako nga isul-ob akong tuxedo mao ra gyud to akong “pang-formal” nga sinina, ug gusto ko nga magtan-aw nga presentable kay unang adlaw baya. Pero pagkahuman nakong mopalit ug kape sa usa ka coffee shop, aksidenteng nayabuhan sa barista ang tasa, ug diretso nga natagak ang mainit nga kape sa akong tuxedo. Naulbo akong kasing-kasing, pero unsaon man mao ra gyud to akong tuxedo.

Wala nay oras pa-labhan, mao nang nagsul-ob ra ko ug limpyo nga polo ug slacks, simple pero disente. Sa akong hunahuna, dili man ang sanina ang basehan sa respeto. Sayop diay ko.

Pag-abot nako sa entrance sa kompanya, gipara dayon ko sa guard.

“Sir, asa man ka padulong?” pangutana niya nga medyo istrikto ug tingog.

“Naa koy orientation karon, Kuya. Ako ang bag-ong legal counsel Atty. secret(maulaw ta), CPA,” tubag nako nga kalma ra.

Nagsukod-sukod siya ug tan-aw gikan ulo hangtod tiil, unya niingon, “Ah, abogado ug accountant diay ka, sir? Abi nako visitor lang. Diri man gud kasagaran mga niaaging lawyer, naka-amerikana.”

Ningisi ra ko gamay. Sa akong sulod, niingon ko sa kaugalingon, “Kung kabalo lang ka nga mao ra gyud tong akong tuxedo, ug nayabuhan pa gyud ug kape ganina.”

Pag-abot nako sa reception, gipangtan-aw ko sa pipila ka executives nga niagi. Wala pa gani sila kaila nako, pero ilang panan-aw murag nagsulti, “Kani, mao ni ang giingon nilang bag-ong legal counsel ug CPA?” Murag wala sila katuo nga ang usa ka lalaki nga nagsul-ob lang ug ordinaryong polo, maoy abogado ug accountant sa ilang kompanya.

Usa gani ka babae nga taga-admin, niingon pa nga medyo hinay: “Murag sayop man tingali ni, HR? Dili man ingon ani ang mga lawyer nga muadto diri.”

Nasakitan ko gamay, pero gilingi ra nako sila ug giingnan ang akong kaugalingon, “Ayaw na lang ug tubag. Ipakita na lang sa trabaho ang tinuod nga bili nimo.”

Pag-abot sa HR, giila ko ug gi-welcome. Didto nausab ang dagan sa sitwasyon — nakit-an sa tanan nga tinuod gyud nga ako ang ilang bag-ong legal counsel ug CPA.

Paglakaw nako pauli, nakita nako ang guard nga nihimo ug gamayng saludo. Nganisi ko, ug sa akong sulod, niingon ko:

“Usahay, dili kinahanglan ug mamahaling sanina aron makilala ang usa ka propesyonal. Kay kung tinuod kang abogado ug accountant o bisan unsa nga tawo nga tinarong ipakita na lang sa buhat, dili sa hitsura.”

Pag-abot sa Lunes, magsugod na gyud ko dili lang isip abogado sa kompanya, pero isip tawo nga nakasabot nga ang respeto, dili ginahatag; ginapamatud-an. Mao sad ni nakahuna huna ko magbuhat ug reddit kay discreet ra dri dapita.",1,1762619805.0,pahungaw,0,1.0,False

I’m 30F, 39+1 pregnant with our first, married for 6 years. My husband is 41M, only child in his family (important here I guess). 

From the beginning my parents in law, especially mother in law, were HEAVILY involved in our lives, like calling my husband 10 times a day, visiting our apartment unannounced etc. I love my parents and we have a good bond, but sometimes we just talk through WhatsApp to let each other know everything’s ok, they visit us sometimes, but never touch our stuff and are in ‚guest mode’.

My MIL though - she always starts to clean things, move them to different cabinets because ‚it’s better this way’ etc. My husband seemingly has no issues with that, he’s even welcoming it because then he doesn’t have to clean our house 🤡 I started telling them how I’m increasingly uncomfortable with it, because we are ADULTS and should take care of our stuff ourselves. There was this whole idea my MIL and FIL will come to our house to clean it when I’m in labour and I’M SO UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT. I just want to be left alone. I told my husband multiple times to please stop them, and it still hasn’t worked - today I’ve heard they are still planning to come, so I reached out to my MIL myself, trying to set my boundaries, but being kind (it’s really nice you want to help and you are always welcome for a coffee, but please let us be adults and clean our own apartment) and she flipped out on me that I’m weird and it’s normal in their family, it has never hurt anyone, her mom was helping her too, blah blah blah.

I guess my question is - is it really this common? I know my parents would clean my house if I asked them to, but I’ve always been pretty independent and it would bother me. Maybe I’m really wrong here? 🫠",5,1762619759.0,pregnant,8,1.0,False

Lost all hope.,"feel like crying all day. i exercise everyday and have been on hypertension meds for 10 years and i am 29 now. Was on amlodipine and telmisartan first and then i lost weight and doc just put me on telmisartan 40 cause my bp was falling to 100/60. in 2023 i developed a panic disorder and before that all my in office readings were 120-30/80. suddenly during the panic attack the bp spiked to 200 and that started happening everyday. i moved in with my parents and started checking my bp everyday for 2 years. no relief from OCD of bp checking all day despite paroxetine.

Now im not on any meds. Today my bp was high since the morning and it was 146/86 and then 123/80 as well. Average was 131/79 from 70 readings. Severe chest pain as well. Started panicking in the evening and bp reached 190/100 and then rushed to thje ER where they confirmed the reading. Severe headache and chest pain. ECG was normal. Gave me clonzapam 0.25 and checked after 1 hour and it was 144/92 and then discharged me.

Got home and ate food and it was 125/82 and now it is 116/65.

However ive been checking my bp everyday and i have severe anxiety as well.

yesterday i checked my bp during a severe headache and it was not going below 140/80.

Mark asked me excitedly. I had.

 “Total lunar eclipse this Friday.”

His perverse excitement irked me, but I had known he’d always been fascinated by it throughout our marriage.

“I talked to Steve about it today,” he said, lowering his voice as if savoring the words. “He told me they’ve known for a while, astrological calendar or something. Steve’s been tracking it at the station. Had someone at the school told you?”

“Yes,” I lied.

“You should have told me!” His irritation sharpened, then softened into something almost gleeful. After a beat of silence, he asked,

“How many do you think he’ll kill this year?”

I drew a breath, forcing myself to steady the irritation in my voice.

 “I don’t know, Mark. You know I don’t like to talk about it.”

But the numbers clawed their way back, unbidden. Everyone in town knew them.

 Tuesday, July 6th, 1982, one killed.

 Thursday, December 30th, that same year, one more.

 Thursday, August 17th, 1989, four.

 Wednesday, December 9th, 1992, another four.

 Monday, November 29th, 1993, four again. 

 And just this spring, Wednesday, April 3rd, 1996, six gone.

Twenty bodies in Amherst. No, I did not like to think about it.

“More than last time, I’d imagine,” I said at last, if only to placate him.

“Honey,” Mark’s voice lifted with a strange, eager brightness, “Steve says they’re certain they’ll catch him this time.”

It wasn’t the first time the police thought they were closing in on their killer.  
“They’ve said that before,” I reminded him.

“I know,” Mark rushed, excitement rising. “But Steve, he couldn’t give me details, you know, cop stuff, but he swears it’s different this time!”

Steve was a good man and meant well for a cop, but half the time, he didn’t know his ass from his elbow.  
“I hope he’s right,” I said, though I didn’t believe it.

The first killing had shaken the town to its core. Wednesday, July 7th: an early morning jogger stumbled across the mangled body of Michael Strong, a 16-year-old delinquent, along the banks of Puffer’s Pond. His throat had been slashed so deep his head was nearly severed. The sheer brutality suggested someone who knew him. One of his mother’s revolving boyfriends was hauled in, questioned, and just as quickly cut loose.

The town was buzzing that summer, the summer after Mark and I graduated. Our relationship had only just begun. He’d been terrified I’d meet someone else at school that fall. Then the murder happened, and he was horrified, yet unable to look away. After all, his younger brother had gone to school with Michael Strong.

“Me too, really want to see the monster who could be doing this.” He paused. “The bus is here.”

“Tell Shar I love her.”

“Will do. Love you.”

“Love you too. I’ll see you tonight.”

It was hard to believe Sharon was already seven. August 2nd, 1989, still the hardest day of my life. Nine hours of labor, each contraction a tidal wave tearing through me. I remember clutching Mark’s hand so tightly my nails left crescents in his skin, his voice steadying me through the pain. And then, at last, her cry split the air, sharp, fierce, alive. The nurse laid her on my chest, warm and squirming, and Mark’s eyes brimmed with tears as if he’d never seen anything so perfect.

Mark had always wanted a baby. I made him wait, first my undergraduate, then my master’s. We married in the middle, his plumbing jobs keeping us afloat while I scraped for lab grants that always came too late. When I finally told him we could try, the joy in his face was something I’ll never forget. And Sharon, our Sharon, was the greatest gift we’d ever been given.

Just over two weeks later, four students were butchered on campus.

August 17th, 1989, the night of freshman orientation. Someone had slipped through an unlocked window on the first floor of Baker House, in and out, quick as a shadow. The girls, Lisa Rathbone, Shannon Armstrong, Tracy Lloyd, and Denise Derwick, had left the latch undone. It was enough.

The killer started with Lisa and Denise, crushing their skulls with a hammer before the others even stirred. By the time Shannon and Tracy woke to the sound of hammer squelching brain, it was already too late. Their screams tore through the dorm, echoing down the hallways, but the orientation chaos and the lunar eclipse that had drawn so many students outside kept help from coming.

By the time anyone forced the door, the room was a slaughterhouse. Lisa and Denise lay unrecognizable. Shannon wasn’t in much better of a state. Tracy was still alive, barely, her body twitching as she slipped into a coma she would never wake from.

Mark was horrified. And me, if it hadn’t been for the pregnancy, I might have been there that night, working.

That was the first time anyone began whispering about the pattern, how it might not be a coincidence at all.

Michael Strong’s murder, and then Chelsea Murphy’s that December, had rattled the town. Both were brutal, senseless killings in a place that prided itself on safety. But they were treated as isolated tragedies, the kind of horror that struck once a generation. No one, at least not openly, spoke of the fact that both deaths had fallen on nights of a lunar eclipse.

Mark would later claim that after Murphy’s murder, he knew the killer only struck beneath an eclipse. But I knew he was lying. He hadn’t seen it. I had. I recognized it immediately, though I never told him.

To his credit, after the second murder, he was quick to call it what it was: a serial killer. It was the early ’80s, though, and every brutal crime was a serial killer’s work, until months passed, then years, and the fear dulled. Even Mark let it slip from his mind.

Until 89, then everything shifted. I rolled my chair back, opened the bottom drawer of my file cabinet, and the astrological calendar peered up at me;  Friday, September 27th. The paper smelled faintly of dust and old coffee, the corners softened from years of being thumbed.

It hadn’t been a coincidence that Michael Strong and Chelsea Murphy were killed under lunar eclipses. Full eclipses that crossed over Amherst coincided with killings; eclipses that missed the town did not. Partial eclipses produced nothing. For a while, I let doubt creep in; maybe I’d been seeing patterns where none existed. Then Baker House. And now, September 27th glared back at me from the calendar, heavy as an omen. That old feeling twisted, stirring in my stomach. I swallowed hard, trying to push it down and to steady myself.

’89 had been the year I began my doctorate, and the year panic swept the University. Security patrols doubled, curfews were enforced, and dorm windows were nailed shut. The campus they called “the Zoo,” fell silent. Thank God for our parents, whose babysitting let me return to the lab, and for Mark, by then a newly minted master plumber, who threw himself into work.

When the school year ended without another attack, a memorial plaque was set in the ground outside Baker Hall. By the following year, the speeches grew shorter, the vigil crowds smaller, the memories dimmer. And by December of 1992, the murders had been all but forgotten.

By then, I was teaching 100-level classes to rooms of glassy-eyed underclassmen. Finals were looming, the holidays hung in the air, and even after a lifetime in this town, the sight of it dressed for Christmas could still coax a smile from me, yes, even that December. The bricks glowed warm against the cold, lanterns burned in the town center, and campus lawns sprouted Christmas trees and snowmen.

We’d only been in our first house since February, but Mark made that first Christmas there feel enchanted. It was the kind of calm that settles in just before January and February bury the town beneath snowdrifts higher than windows, the wind cutting sharp at ten below.

My students, out-of-staters, internationals, and Eastern Mass kids alike, chattered with wide-eyed excitement about the coming lunar eclipse, calling it a Christmas miracle. I smiled and let them. I didn’t have the heart to tell them what it really meant.

I was grateful that none of my students were killed. None from the University, at all.

Wednesday, December 9th: four Amherst College students had been laughing amidst a snowball fight on East Drive when the shooter struck. Jamal Naveer, Elizabeth Hawkins, and Dorothy Freeman went down instantly, gunned down with precision no amateur could manage. Jacob Donnelly ran. The shooter clipped his shoulder, dropped him in the snow, and, while he begged and pleaded, put a final round in his head, execution-style.

It had stopped snowing earlier that afternoon. Steve, by then on the force, told Mark that if the flakes had kept falling, they might’ve been able to track the tires. Horse shit, if you ask me. Steve was working a desk, not homicide. What they did have were seven shell casings, all .45s from a Colt M1911.

The manhunt exploded. The press gave the killer a name, the “Blood Moon Killer.” I don’t know who coined it, but it stuck, spreading like wildfire. Police began dragging in every Amherst resident who owned a .45, interrogating veterans, burning through leads.

And then, just after New Year’s, the whole of UMass reeled when Professor Ian Lowe was arrested. A veteran, his service pistol conveniently missing, his wife refusing to confirm his alibi. Mark was stunned; we’d eaten dinner at Lowe’s house just weeks before, over Thanksgiving. He tried to save face by insisting Lowe had always rubbed him the wrong way. Attractive men often did.

The trial began that June, a full-blown circus. Reporters flooded Hampshire District Court; Western Mass had never seen anything like it. The police, the prosecution, the whole community believed they had their man. Lowe had lived in Amherst since ’78. He was large, fit, a veteran. His gun was gone. He couldn’t explain that away. They tried to tie all ten murders to him. The details that didn’t fit, that he wasn’t in Amherst on July 6th, 1982, that he couldn’t possibly have squeezed through Baker House’s window, were conveniently left unspoken.

I still remember the broadcast in September. Sharon was playing with Mark on the carpet as I watched the news. The defense had introduced a new witness, Graduate Student Kelly Horan. I knew her. I knew about her relationship with Lowe. I knew about his relationships with TAs, with staff, with anyone who batted an eye his way. It didn’t take long before the prosecution’s case started to fray.

But as November neared and the next anticipated lunar eclipse approached, the town held its breath. One way or another, we would find out whether the Blood Moon Killer was already in custody or still at large.

Monday, November 29th, 1993, the moon had darkened to the deepest shade I had ever seen. “Blood moon” is a misnomer; it is usually a dull orange. But that night it was nearly red, glowing like a burning coal as I drove home beneath it. People said the eclipse lasted an hour. In truth, it was 46.7 minutes.

When I walked in, Mark told me the news: four more dead. Two students had been killed just off the north of campus near Fairfield Street, out under the sky, watching the moon: Riley Tomkins and Sarah Jacobs.

Riley had taken a knife to the back of her throat, the blade driven deep enough to push through where her Adam's Apple had been. Sarah had made an awful scream as she ran, but she was silenced by a single round from a Colt .45. The bullet punched in just at the juncture of neck and shoulder, tearing through muscle, artery, and bone. It should have killed her. It did not. The killer finished the work by stomping her skull.

A neighbor, fifty-six-year-old Ken Williams, had heard the shot and stepped outside with his own revolver, hoping to help. Instead, he came upon the killer scraping brain matter from the soles of their boots on the curb. Ken took a single shot above the left eye. He dropped instantly.

The killer then drifted back toward the University. Graduate student Li Xiu had just left the life sciences lab. He did not run. He took a bullet to the chest, dropped where he stood, and never rose again.

Mark had been horrified. How could he not? I worked right there.  
I was horrified, too, though for a different reason. I had known Li Xiu. He had been an exceptional student: quiet, precise, courteous, his work in the lab meticulous.

Professor Lowe was released soon after, his marriage dissolved, and he moved far from Amherst. The town barely whispered his name again.

Steve told Mark the rest one night over beers at our kitchen table, while I strained my ears from the other room. The CCTV footage had caught a little, but not enough: Li Xiu pausing outside the life sciences building, waving at someone off camera, then lowering his hand in confusion a split second before the shot punched through his chest.

Steve admitted that he believed the killer was a student. There had been no real suspects, no trail to follow, just a body on the pavement, a half-wave frozen in time, and a single .45 shell left behind.

In a move that shocked everyone, the University shut its doors and sent students and faculty home. The press tore them apart for it. After all, hadn’t it become obvious by then that the killer only struck under eclipses? Sending everyone away was little more than theater. Worse, the police signed off on the decision before realizing they might have just delivered the killer back to whatever hometown he’d come from. Everyone could see it; they were desperate. Grasping at straws, as lost as the rest of us.

Mark, meanwhile, was transfixed, awestruck, horrified, fascinated, as if he couldn’t look away from a fire even while it consumed everything around it. I was left with something else. The same hollow aftermath that always followed: a pounding headache, sharp and sour like a hangover; a creeping numbness that dulled the edges of thought; and, beneath it all, the crushing futility of knowing it would happen again. 

After those four deaths, the town’s frenzy dulled. The headlines shrank, the nightly news moved on, and the chatter in grocery store aisles faded to silence. The case went cold, another unsolved knot consigned to rumor. The University, eager to wash its hands, erected yet another plaque, this one just off Governor’s Drive, for the three students lost. No mention of Ken Williams. A middle-aged man didn’t carry the same weight as students with futures ahead of them. His name slipped into silence, a footnote, if even that.

Months without an eclipse bled into years. Sharon started school, and life found its strange rhythm again. My career in academia began to gather momentum just as Mark’s plumbing business took off. We built a life that looked, from the outside, almost enviable. A neat house, steady work, laughter at the dinner table.

Mark longed for another child, a son, he said, to balance the scales. I managed to talk him out of it, sheltering behind the excuse of my career. Grants, research, conferences, I told him I needed time. But the truth was simpler and far darker. I couldn’t imagine bringing another child into a world where the air itself seemed haunted, where shadows returned every time the moon burned red. One child was enough, one was already too much to risk.

Nearly three whole years slipped by. We had moved into a larger, prettier house on Pine Hollow, ironically, just down the road from where Michael Strong had been butchered years before. The neighborhood near Puffer's Pond was quiet now, scrubbed clean of memory, though I could never quite forget.

I buried myself in work, papers, and lectures piling one on top of another, until March crept in almost unnoticed. It was then that the familiar sensation returned, settling into me with a weight I could neither shake nor name. It began in the gut, a hollow gnawing. Not pain, exactly, but an emptiness. My skin felt restless, my blood quickened, my thoughts turned jagged. I had learned to recognize it over the years, though no explanation ever followed. It was always the same: a slow, ravenous stirring that left me uneasy in my own body, as though I had been hollowed out and replaced with something that craved more than I could ever give.

Wednesday, April 3rd, brought with it a flicker of hope. The eclipse that day would pass unseen, swallowed by the afternoon sky, and some whispered that perhaps this time Amherst would be spared. But hope, like every other illusion, dissolved quickly.

Police and National Guard patrolled in droves, posted on every corner, and clustered in pairs across campus, hell, across the town. Their presence was loud, visible, meant to reassure, and yet it left blind spots large enough for a body to slip right through. The killer did just that.

They walked unnoticed into the Mullins Center, where life went on as though nothing could happen under such heavy guard. Inside the women’s locker room, amid the steam and hiss of the showers, senior Chelsea McRae. The weapon was simple, domestic, no larger than a dinner knife, yet sharp enough to punch through bone. It was driven upward with such force that the blade lodged to its hilt in her jaw, pinning her scream where it started.

Water continued to run, curtains drawn, steam swirling lazily through the tiled room. For several long minutes, her body went undiscovered, the scene hidden in plain sight while the killer slipped away. Only when another girl pulled back the curtain after seeing blood did the silence finally break, and the air filled with the screaming that never really leaves you once you’ve heard it.

Students and staff poured from the Mullins Center in a blind surge, bodies colliding, voices shrieking, while the authorities stumbled over themselves to cordon the exits, to push inward, to simply make sense of the chaos. In the crush of it all, the killer moved unnoticed. Their hand twitched against the grip of the concealed .45, an almost uncontrollable urge to fire into the crowd. Why didn’t they? Perhaps some primal reflex of self-preservation intervened. The instinct that usually drove them forward had, for once, held them back.

Instead, they slipped toward the Physical Plant. Inside, the workers carried on, almost untouched by the commotion outside, the muffled roar of the crowd barely reaching them. One man, Devon Wade, even stopped the killer to ask what was happening. They walked past him without a word. Seconds later, inside, the killing began.

Robert McMillan was the first. A single shot below the right eye, neat, clinical, and he fell without so much as a cry. The sound drew Kevin Faherty from a side door. He froze at the sight, Robert’s body sprawled on the floor, the gun already swinging toward him, and managed only a strangled “No” before the bullet buried itself in his chest.

Behind the killer, another door opened. Devon Wade again, the same man who had asked so casually a moment before. Why had he come running toward gunfire? Maybe the sound was dulled, maybe the chaos outside distracted him. Whatever the reason, he lasted only a breath. A round caught his neck, sending him staggering, hands pressed to the wound as blood sprayed in great wet bursts. He collapsed, gargling on the floor.

The killer pressed on. In a supply closet, Javier Madeira was discovered curled up in a ball, whispering in accented English: “Please.” It was the only word he got out before the .45 split his skull open, painting the shelves behind him.

At the far end of the Plant, a flicker of movement gave away Raymond Gibson. He lunged before the killer could fire, a heavy fist cracking across their face. The gun discharged, the round grazing his thigh, but Gibson was built like a wall and bore down with brute strength. One massive hand clamped around the killer’s throat, the other wrenched the pistol free. For a moment, it seemed over.

But the Blood Moon Killer was not sustained by human limits. In that frenzy, they clawed downward with their free hand, nails ripping through fabric and flesh, tearing Gibson’s scrotum open in a savage, animal motion. His scream was primal, reflexive, and his grip faltered. The killer seized the .45, shoved the muzzle against his skull, and fired. Bone and brain matter spattered the wall. Gibson toppled, finally still. The Plant was silent, save for the echo of dripping water, settling dust, and the faint hiss of blood pooling on the concrete.

The killer moved on instinct alone, slipping out of the Plant with a predator’s caution, hugging the shadows, skirting the buildings where cameras were mounted. Blood clung to their skin, soaked their clothes, hardened in their hair. It should have made them visible to anyone with eyes. And in truth, people did see. Faces turned, gazes lingered, but no one intervened. In the chaos, who would step in front of a 5’3” woman dripping red when the killer was still at large?

They reached their car unchallenged, hands trembling only as the key slid into the ignition. That same nameless force that had driven the slaughter pulled them onward, down Long Plain Road, where they veered off and waded into the brook. The water was glacial, biting, yet no shock registered. Flesh numbed as the blood peeled away, drifting downstream in black-red ribbons. They stripped, tugged on stained gym clothes from a duffel bag, and weighted their ruined outfit with stones before sinking it in the current. Then back into the car, northbound, the steering wheel quivering under their grip.

Above, the Blood Moon loomed, ripe, swollen, deeper than rust. Impossible not to stare. Impossible not to feel the hunger ease, the body settling into the quiet tremor of satiation.

By the time they reached Baystate Franklin, the call had been made. A husband’s frantic voice on the other end, demanding to know what had happened. She soothed him in steady tones, explained she’d only been caught in the stampede at the Mullins Center, elbow to the eye, a forearm to the throat, the crush of bodies in flight. That, she said, was why she bore a shiner, the dark rings around her neck, the concussion pounding through her skull. The concussion justified the drive north.

The doctors weren’t convinced, not fully. Their expressions flickered with doubt, catching on the seams in her story. But she was injured, she was trembling, she was a victim. That was enough. The world bends toward the simplest explanation, and no one looked closer. And really, who could blame a woman for hysteria after escaping the Blood Moon Killer?

I never really come to until the morning after. The edges of the night arrive first, fragments, impressions, and only with daylight do memory congeal into something I can hold without it slipping through my fingers. Over the years those fragments have multiplied; where there was once a black hole, there is now a series of jagged images I can piece together like a child’s brutal collage.

As a child I was described as having terrible tantrums. I remember only an echo: nine years old, a bat, my brother’s leg broken. He never forgave me. I never forgave myself once the story was told aloud and sealed into the family record. In middle school, there was a sleepover, Shelly Thomas, and I woke to a frenzy I could not name; the police were called, I was taken for observation, and released, the adults shrugging it off as a fleeting aberration. They saw me; they didn’t see what pushed me.

For a long time, I tried to contain it. I would lock myself in the house on nights when the moon threatened blood, pad the windows, and chain the doors. The ravenous thing in my gut, however, paid no attention to locks. It boiled until it burned through. If I did not feed it, if I did not give it its obscene satiation, I felt as though I would be unmade. The hunger was not metaphor. It was a pressure, a clawing pressure beneath ribs and reason, a demand that blurred thought and will until all that remained was animal survival.

After Michael Strong, the nightmares began in earnest. I could not remember the day itself, but his scream lived inside me, a throat that would not close. Chelsea Murphy’s cry joined it, then, and the sound of bodies falling. I sought help; I sat in therapists’ rooms and tried to explain the vertigo of dread that seized me on certain nights. They assumed I was like a hundred other people in town, haunted, terrified, a sensible victim of circumstance. I let them believe it.

There were seven blank years: a strange mercy. Sharon was born; Mark and I built a life that looked ordinary. For a while, the tides of the thing within me subsided. Then Baker House happened. I could no longer pretend, no longer delude myself. The facts lined up like nails on a board. 

I have thought about ending it. I have imagined walking into a precinct and unspooling everything, names, dates. I have sat in the dark and pictured Mark’s face when he read the confession, Sharon’s small hands in his when the bars slammed shut. The thought recoils like a hand from a flame. Could I do that to my daughter? To the man who has loved me? Could I hand them the orphaned wreckage of a life I had already broken?

And now I watch the calendar, this Friday drawing near, September 27th. The hunger has already started gnawing, a hollow ache that no food can touch. It coils tighter with each passing hour, a quiet reminder that resistance is futile. I don’t know what I hope for anymore. Deliverance? Discovery? Death? Perhaps all three. But I do know this: when the Blood Moon climbs the sky, its shadow swallows me whole. And when it does, the world will bleed.

I’ve been a travel enthusiast for years, planning dozens of trips, and I’ve always struggled with clunky apps or overpriced planners that don’t quite fit quick getaways. So, I built a simple tool called Jurnjoy to create customizable 3-day itineraries for things like weekend city breaks, family outings, or solo adventures—mostly focused on Europe right now, but expanding.
The idea is straightforward: You pick a spot (e.g., Paris or Barcelona), and it generates a day-by-day plan with practical tips, hidden gems, estimated costs, and Google Maps links for each activity. Everything’s editable—you can tweak the schedule, add a packing list, plug in your bookings, track expenses, and even export it as a .ics file for your calendar or print it out. It’s all web-based via a personal link, no apps or subscriptions needed, and updates monthly based on real traveler feedback.
To give you a taste, here’s a quick free snippet from a sample Paris weekend itinerary (feel free to copy and adapt!):
•  Day 1: Arrival & Icons – Start with a stroll along the Seine (free), grab coffee at a local café (~€5), then hit the Eiffel Tower at sunset (tickets ~€25, book ahead via official site). Evening: Picnic in Champ de Mars with market finds.
•  Day 2: Art & Neighborhoods – Morning at the Louvre (focus on highlights like Mona Lisa; €17 entry), afternoon wandering Montmartre (free, Sacré-Cœur views). Lunch at a bistro (~€15-20).
•  Day 3: Day Trip & Relax – Train to Versailles (~€7 round-trip), explore the gardens (free entry days vary). Back in Paris for a relaxed walk in Luxembourg Gardens.
What do you think—too straightforward, or could it use more features like public transport details? I’m genuinely looking for input from folks here to make it better, as I use it myself for my trips.
What’s your favorite hack or tool for whipping up short-trip plans? Sharing ideas would be awesome!

Well Los Angeles, you’re welcome.  
Starting next week there will be one less poor soul trapped on the 405, also known as the highway that stole my will to live one exit at a time.

Somehow I survived 10 straight years of commuting from the San Fernando Valley to the Westside. Every week I willingly launched myself into that nightmare cluster at the 101 and 405 where the interchanges merge into a single swirling vortex of bad decisions, blinker denial, and existential dread. Where your brain cramps at the decision making process at an early hour of the day that may deeply impact the next 2-hours of your life. ""Do I take Van Nuys to Kester, or brave the Sepulveda exit and cut around the back of the mall?"" (which in future days when that construction of the apartment building is finished and 500+ people join in the commute from the point where it all crashes - it is going to be Hell). I am happy to be finally be done with the 101 and the 405.  

I am officially escaping.  
I am loading up my car, grabbing my dog, and heading across the country to Philadelphia. I found a job where I can walk to work. I also found an *affordable* townhouse. When I realized both were real things, I had to sit down because my Los Angeles brain could not process the idea of having a home and a commute that do not involve sacrifice or suffering.

To everyone staying behind to wage war on the 405:  
May your coffee be strong, your brakes be reliable, and your lane changes be respected for once. May your lanes be open, your exits appear before Waze tells you to cut across four lanes, and your sanity hang on by a thread in the most graceful way possible.

Enjoy that tiny, barely noticeable but deeply symbolic reduction after I leave and I will not miss it on Monday, when I will be exiting and driving East on The 134 to The 210 to The 15 to The 40, etc... Be kind to each other and remember you ARE the traffic.

A steel tiffin with lemon rice, one cup curd, and some papad. That’s it.

He says his full meal costs ₹60. No cold drink. No snacks. Just water from the office cooler.

Before this, he used to order from Zomato daily — around ₹250 to ₹300 per meal. Now he saves about ₹200 a day. That’s ₹6,000 a month!

He makes everything in bulk on Sunday evening. Keeps small boxes ready in the fridge. Morning he just packs and leaves. No stress, no waste.

Even when someone orders pizza or biryani, he just smiles and says, “Na food ready aachu da.”

And here’s the best part. Earlier he used to go to those fancy coffee places once or twice a week. ₹200 for one cup. Now he goes to the small tea stall near our office gate. ₹10 chai. Same peace, more savings.

I’d fall in love slower,
not like fire this time,
but like rain, soft and endless,
the kind that soaks everything it touches without asking for permission.
I’d watch the way your eyes hold light
the way oceans hold secrets,
and I’d swear I could drown there
and still call it peace.

If I could meet you again,
I’d learn your laugh like scripture,
repeat it until it lived in my chest
and echoed whenever the world went quiet.
I’d hold your name on my tongue
like a fragile fruit I was scared to crush,
and when you spoke,
I’d listen with both silence and skin,
because your words were warmth,
and I was too cold to feel them before.

If I could meet you again,
I’d thank every moment that led me to you,
even the ones that hurt,
because they made me look up and find you.
I’d trace the outline of your kindness
the way an artist studies light,
carefully, reverently,
knowing that one wrong stroke
could ruin something divine.
You were that divine thing,
and I ruined it anyway.

If I could meet you again,
I wouldn’t test your patience to measure its depth.
I wouldn’t turn love into a battlefield
just to see if you’d still stand at the end.
You would, I know you would,
because you always did.
Even when my words were daggers
and my silence was a wound,
you stayed, bleeding quietly,
smiling through the pain
like forgiveness wearing human skin.

You were the calm river,
and I was the stone that refused to move.
You kept flowing around me,
soft, patient,
until I mistook mercy for indifference.
Now I see it,
how your love was the water that kept me alive,
and how my pride built the dam that stopped it.
I dried the very thing that made me bloom.

If I could meet you again,
I’d apologize before loving you,
so you’d know what kind of storm you were walking into.
I’d tell you I was fragile in all the wrong places,
and cruel where I should have been kind.
I’d tell you I loved you,
not in the way people say it,
but in the way gravity holds planets,
unseen, constant, destructive, necessary.

If I could meet you again for the first time,
I’d still recognize you,
by the way my soul would go quiet,
by the way every noise inside me would turn to prayer.
I’d take your hand like it was forgiveness itself,
and I wouldn’t let go this time.
You’d smile that same unguarded smile,
the one that made the world feel less cruel,
and I’d finally understand
what it meant to be loved without conditions.

But I can’t meet you again.
I can only dream of it,
and in that dream, you never walk away.
You stay.
The room smells like rain and coffee,
your laugh spills like light through the blinds,
and for once, I don’t ruin it.
For once, I just love you,
quietly, endlessly,
like the sky loves the horizon,
always meeting,
never staying.

Last night I came from work. He had his tail up and was walking by my legs, massaging them. It was like the fight that morning never happened. I went to bed and he came to get petted and play with my arm. The next morning, I get waken up by him wanting to be petted. I'm extremely tired and can't pet him more than once or twice, so he continues to headbutt. I turn. It was this annoying dance I have with him every morning until I feed him.

One commenter suggested that I do the feeding in a separate room now, since they're excited for food. That's exactly what I did, I went to the bathroom and closed the door. The older cat (named Meowstic) hissed at me before I closed the door. I cracked open the can, put them in a bowl, then opened the door and placed them in their feeding slots. The little one (named Zaslinha) was excited and ready to eat. The other one, however, was hiding. I started making coffee, and when I finished, I see Meowstic eating in the other bowl. I'm like fine whatever. I'm walking by his direction (remember, I live in a studio, no space) to get dressed. He walks away and hides in my bed before hissing me twice. After getting dressed, I went to where the stove is at to cook. He's in the way. He don't move. I wait for him to move. He still does not move. I do have work today so I move in and I guess invade his space. He lays in a defensive position, stomach exposed BUT claws out, in a defensive position ready to strike me. I yell at him to move, and he goes and hides in a cabinet.

I'm late for work because I went to the vet first to make an appointment for Meowstic to be seen tomorrow. I'm thinking of buying them long leather cat gloves for behavior since I'm afraid of how I'm gonna put him in a cage to take him to the vet tomorrow.

My applications look like I am a prestige whore. I would love to know which colleges fit my profile, which ones I'd actually enjoy and not want to do bad things to myself at, and which colleges would actually want me there were I to apply.

**\*\*\*HUGE preference given for schools in China. I am a China whore. I love China. GLORY TO THE CCP! (serious)\*\*\*** (I am taking the HSK 6 and if I do well I will apply to chinese schools)

A itsy-bitsy bit of context: I want to major in Physics (maybe double major applied mathematics). I want to pursue a Ph.D in astrophysics and study gravitational wave detection / binary star system evolution, though obviously I am interested in far more than just those areas. I want to become a college professor.

Also, please do not recommend UK schools, because I've already submitted my UCAS application and don't want to think about it - I'll probably regret the 5 schools I picked (UCL, KCL, ICL, Manchester, Edinbruh)

Here is a very quick summary of my commonapp if you're at all interested 😭 b/c other reverse chanceme posts have them:  
3.91 UW GPA (according to uc calculator), 4.54 W SAT: 1560 superscore, 1550 single score, 9 APs (7 5s, 2 4s, currently taking 8 APs), ECs 1. debate 2. piano 3. schoolhouse tutor 4. uc berkeley summer student 5. scioly 6. animal shelter volunteer 7. church volunteer 8. independent research (not published...yet) 9. FBLA 10. piano teacher @ public library) Honors 1. debate national champion 2. debate superior distinction (\~4%) 3. nmsqt semifinalist 4. state piano semifinalist (\~10) 5. piano concerto comp 2nd place. ESSAY: its ok. RECS: 3 recs. Was the fav student of my APUSH teacher, was a pretty ok student in my physics C class, counselor loves me i practice spanish w her)

Here is what I'm looking for in a college from most important to least important:

1. Employability. Not in the sense that I *need* a HYPSM graduation or anything, but for college professors where you went to school really matters. I've heard that you always teach at a school a step down from the school you learned from. Ex: Brown university graduate goes to UT Austin for graduate school and becomes a professor at UT austin (true story). I want to be a college professor, but I still want to teach at a decent school to do research.
2. Location. This is more important than campus IMO because in a sense your larger surroundings *is* your campus. I absolutely adored UC berkeley when I went there for a debate tournament and studied there over the summer (yikes waste of money) because although the campus was just decent (not the prettiest IMO when stanford is literally in the same area) the food was AMAZING and the vibes of oakland and the bay area and the metro were im-ma-cu-late (minus some high homeless people that pull you aside when you're walking around on campus). Location also includes weather. Basically, I just  want to be somewhere where it gets cold enough. There should be snow in the winter.
3. Campus. Basically, how universally instagrammable each location on campus is. I want to be able to study anywhere, to sit down at a coffee shop and lock in for 3 hours. I want to be able to spend my weekends hiking or at parks or... ykwim. Campus also includes walkability! I am NOT going to buy a car, I am going to probably bike around or e-scooter around and devote all my money to paying off college tuition (yikes).
4. Cost and tuition (ouccchhhh). I have already decided to get a job the first thing I can because my parents don't make a *ton* of money (though we are relatively well-of - 150k-ish/year), but they're still not willing to dig 90k out of their pockets every single year for a school like Princeton, even if I were to get in (which I highly doubt). The university needs to be affordable (a huge reason I'm applying to so many international schools!) in a reasonable respect, though obviously FAFSA exists and my job can alleviate some of the burden.
5. Networking opportunity. I have some qualms about this - I am debating about NYU because although networking opportunities are awesome I value campus highly. However, networking opportunity is important for any field, especially for STEM-heavy research (though not so much as a field like business). Though, as long as I am able to form pretty good connections and make my summers busy with research and stuff, I'm happy.
6. Clubs!!! I want to go to school somewhere where you can apply to clubs, but other clubs are free for anyone to join. I want to be able to find community and not have to submit a ton of forms telling each club ""please accept me"". Though I'm not sure that clubs differ between universities.
7. Time to myself. I am extraordinary at procrastination and using time inefficiently, but I am also similarly extraordinary at creating time to do everything (which usually involves some level of self-sabotage). I think that I will be fine with most university grinds, I'm sure I'll be able to get used to it if it is faster-paced than the grind that I am currently in.
8. Quality of education... to an extent. I've heard generally that undergraduate quality of education doesn't really differ between school to school, but up to a certain extent. Obviously, I want to learn and take interesting classes, but anything T50 is all gonna be the same to me.
9. Diiiiiiiiversity. Obviously I don't want to go to a school that's only female or only male, or 90% asian or 90% white or 90% black (I also think it's weird for non-black applicants to apply to HBUs), but otherwise I don't notice diversity. Everyone is diverse from each other in their own respects, not only demographically, and friendships should not be contingent on race or sexual orientation or etc etc (though I do feel weirded out when I see a group of exclusively all-asian friends lol)
10. Social life. Yes I would love to have time to hangout with friends, just not in the social events type of thing. I really enjoy time alone and time with just a few friends, but ""social life"" is not like a requirement. I think that I can trust myself to make my own time or to balance my priorities, but I don't think that having specific undergraduate hangout events, or having a wealth of local clubs/bars or frats is something that I value too much.

There are only a few things I want the school to value from me:

1. Well-roundedness and diversity of interests. I am someone who loves physics, yes, but also loves reading, loves philosophy, theology, the performing arts, foreign languages, etc. My highschool extracurriculars reflect this, and because of this they are all over the place. I want a university that values this about me at least to an extent, or at least is not partial *against* this diversity of interests (MIT, Caltech, Stanford)
2. My identity. I know I'm an overrepresented group (asian male, double cooked) at basically every top university, but that doesn't lead me to believe I should be penalized for factors that I cannot change. I said this once, but I am so much more than just my skin color, just my sex, and I want the college to value me for me, not for my skin color.",1,1762619082.0,chanceme,2,1.0,False

Top On **Massive Giveaway Alert Recommendations!**  

Hey everyone! Okay, not gonna lie—I’m kind of losing my mind over this one because this holiday event feels like the internet equivalent of opening presents every five minutes. 🎄🎅  

The **🎉 Holiday Giveaway Extravaganza** just dropped, and wow—it’s stacked with **free ebooks, coupons, digital goodies, and even bonus gifts** that actually feel premium! One second I'm thinking it’s just another random drop... but nope, it’s real, it’s live, and yes—you’ve been personally invited!

Now, before you brush this off thinking ""meh, probably small stuff,"" here’s what’s actually inside:  

- 🎁 Free **Ebooks** (yep, full-length — perfect for cozy nights)  
- 💌 Exclusive **discount coupons** for digital products  
- 💳 Surprise **gift cards** (we’re talking Amazon, Google Play, maybe more 👀)  
- 🌐 A shot at **bonus mystery gifts** for lucky participants  
- 🕒 And apparently it’s only up for **24 hours** before the links reset!  

Like, what? Why did nobody tell me these kinds of things exist?  
I’m literally sitting here sipping coffee wondering if I should grab my second email just in case another gift code drops.  

⏳ **24H Giveaway: Free Digital Tools + Amazon Gift Cards!**  

This thing moves fast! I tried to join late on the last event, and the page was *already full*. So this time I’m not hesitating. It kind of feels like the digital era’s version of those ""Black Friday flash sales,"" but online, and with infinitely more freebies.  

🤔 **Want Free Digital Products + Gift Cards? Here’s How!**

Come join before it’s gone because 24 hours moves *way* faster during the holidays.

Couldn't post in A2C because it didn't get approved (maybe strong language?),"Right now, I have no idea what schools to apply to. My applications look like I am a prestige whore. I would love to know which colleges fit my profile, which ones I'd actually enjoy and not want to do bad things to myself at, and which colleges would actually want me there were I to apply.

**\*\*\*HUGE preference given for schools in China. I am a China whore. I love China. GLORY TO THE CCP! (serious)\*\*\*** (I am taking the HSK 6 and if I do well I will apply to chinese schools)

A itsy-bitsy bit of context: I want to major in Physics (maybe double major applied mathematics). I want to pursue a Ph.D in astrophysics and study gravitational wave detection / binary star system evolution, though obviously I am interested in far more than just those areas. I want to become a college professor.

Also, please do not recommend UK schools, because I've already submitted my UCAS application and don't want to think about it - I'll probably regret the 5 schools I picked (UCL, KCL, ICL, Manchester, Edinbruh)

Here is a very quick summary of my commonapp if you're at all interested 😭 b/c other reverse chanceme posts have them:  
3.91 UW GPA (according to uc calculator), 4.54 W SAT: 1560 superscore, 1550 single score, 9 APs (7 5s, 2 4s, currently taking 8 APs), ECs 1. debate 2. piano 3. schoolhouse tutor 4. uc berkeley summer student 5. scioly 6. animal shelter volunteer 7. church volunteer 8. independent research (not published...yet) 9. FBLA 10. piano teacher @ public library) Honors 1. debate national champion 2. debate superior distinction (\~4%) 3. nmsqt semifinalist 4. state piano semifinalist (\~10) 5. piano concerto comp 2nd place. ESSAY: its ok. RECS: 3 recs. Was the fav student of my APUSH teacher, was a pretty ok student in my physics C class, counselor loves me i practice spanish w her)

Here is what I'm looking for in a college from most important to least important:

1. Employability. Not in the sense that I *need* a HYPSM graduation or anything, but for college professors where you went to school really matters. I've heard that you always teach at a school a step down from the school you learned from. Ex: Brown university graduate goes to UT Austin for graduate school and becomes a professor at UT austin (true story). I want to be a college professor, but I still want to teach at a decent school to do research.
2. Location. This is more important than campus IMO because in a sense your larger surroundings *is* your campus. I absolutely adored UC berkeley when I went there for a debate tournament and studied there over the summer (yikes waste of money) because although the campus was just decent (not the prettiest IMO when stanford is literally in the same area) the food was AMAZING and the vibes of oakland and the bay area and the metro were im-ma-cu-late (minus some high homeless people that pull you aside when you're walking around on campus). Location also includes weather. Basically, I just  want to be somewhere where it gets cold enough. There should be snow in the winter.
3. Campus. Basically, how universally instagrammable each location on campus is. I want to be able to study anywhere, to sit down at a coffee shop and lock in for 3 hours. I want to be able to spend my weekends hiking or at parks or... ykwim. Campus also includes walkability! I am NOT going to buy a car, I am going to probably bike around or e-scooter around and devote all my money to paying off college tuition (yikes).
4. Cost and tuition (ouccchhhh). I have already decided to get a job the first thing I can because my parents don't make a *ton* of money (though we are relatively well-of - 150k-ish/year), but they're still not willing to dig 90k out of their pockets every single year for a school like Princeton, even if I were to get in (which I highly doubt). The university needs to be affordable (a huge reason I'm applying to so many international schools!) in a reasonable respect, though obviously FAFSA exists and my job can alleviate some of the burden.
5. Networking opportunity. I have some qualms about this - I am debating about NYU because although networking opportunities are awesome I value campus highly. However, networking opportunity is important for any field, especially for STEM-heavy research (though not so much as a field like business). Though, as long as I am able to form pretty good connections and make my summers busy with research and stuff, I'm happy.
6. Clubs!!! I want to go to school somewhere where you can apply to clubs, but other clubs are free for anyone to join. I want to be able to find community and not have to submit a ton of forms telling each club ""please accept me"". Though I'm not sure that clubs differ between universities.
7. Time to myself. I am extraordinary at procrastination and using time inefficiently, but I am also similarly extraordinary at creating time to do everything (which usually involves some level of self-sabotage). I think that I will be fine with most university grinds, I'm sure I'll be able to get used to it if it is faster-paced than the grind that I am currently in.
8. Quality of education... to an extent. I've heard generally that undergraduate quality of education doesn't really differ between school to school, but up to a certain extent. Obviously, I want to learn and take interesting classes, but anything T50 is all gonna be the same to me.
9. Diiiiiiiiversity. Obviously I don't want to go to a school that's only female or only male, or 90% asian or 90% white or 90% black (I also think it's weird for non-black applicants to apply to HBUs), but otherwise I don't notice diversity. Everyone is diverse from each other in their own respects, not only demographically, and friendships should not be contingent on race or sexual orientation or etc etc (though I do feel weirded out when I see a group of exclusively all-asian friends lol)
10. Social life. Yes I would love to have time to hangout with friends, just not in the social events type of thing. I really enjoy time alone and time with just a few friends, but ""social life"" is not like a requirement. I think that I can trust myself to make my own time or to balance my priorities, but I don't think that having specific undergraduate hangout events, or having a wealth of local clubs/bars or frats is something that I value too much.

I am based in the GCC and want to leverage my ability to get access to these farms.

Am I better of working as a broker between roasteries and the farm? Bear in mind its a long winded process of showing samples then finding a price they both agree on, agreeing on payment terms etc.

Or should I just order a 20kg and start selling on a small scale to roasteries and build up from there

1ortipc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1ortipc/best_mini_backpacks_for_your_essentials/,Best Mini Backpacks For Your Essentials,"I'll be honest—I didn't get mini backpacks at first. They seemed too small to be useful, too cute to be taken seriously. Then I took one to a music festival last summer, and it changed everything. No more death-gripping my phone and wallet while trying to navigate crowds. No shoulder pain from a crossbody bag digging into my neck all day. Just hands-free freedom with exactly what I needed.

That's the magic of mini backpacks. They're not trying to replace your travel backpack or work bag. They're for those in-between moments—theme park days, quick errands, concerts, or when you just want to carry your phone, wallet, and maybe a water bottle without feeling weighed down.

After testing way too many (my partner thinks I have a problem), here are the mini backpacks actually worth your money.

# Fjallraven Kanken Mini – The Icon Everyone Loves

**Capacity:** 7L | **Price:** $70-85 (often on sale for $54-60)

This Swedish backpack was originally designed to prevent back problems in schoolchildren, and somehow became the most Instagram-worthy mini pack on the planet. The square shape, those distinctive top handles with snap buttons, and that little fox logo—you've definitely seen it everywhere from airports to coffee shops.

Here's why it actually deserves the hype: The Vinylon F fabric is weirdly durable and water-resistant (though it feels stiff at first). There's a foam seat pad hidden in the back sleeve that doubles as structure. The shoulder straps adjust to fit both kids and adults.

**The catch?** It's boxy and not particularly padded, so don't expect cloud-like comfort. The stiff fabric takes time to break in. And yes, it's pricey for 7 liters. But I've seen these things last for years, traveling the world and still looking fresh.

**Best for:** People who want a pack that'll last forever and don't mind the premium price. Great for petite people or as a stylish everyday bag.

# Herschel Classic Mini – The Budget-Friendly Stylish Pick

**Capacity:** 6.5L | **Price:** $28-40 (frequently on sale)

If you want the aesthetic appeal without the Fjallraven price tag, Herschel's got you. This is basically a tiny version of their signature Classic backpack, made from 100% recycled fabrics. The striped fabric liner inside is a nice touch that makes it feel more premium than its price suggests.

The main compartment fits the essentials—phone, wallet, keys, a small water bottle (emphasis on small). Front pocket for quick-access items. That's it. Nothing fancy, which is exactly the point.

**What I like:** It's lightweight without feeling flimsy. Limited lifetime warranty. Enough color options to match any vibe. And at under $30 on sale, you're not stressed about it getting beat up.

**The downside:** At 6.5L, it's genuinely tiny. If you're the type who needs to carry ""just in case"" items, this will frustrate you. Side pockets don't hold much.

**Best for:** Minimalists who literally just need phone-wallet-keys freedom. Students. Anyone wanting style without spending a fortune.

# Osprey Arcane Small Day – The Organized Person's Dream

**Capacity:** 10L | **Price:** $65-75

This is the mini backpack for people who hate digging around for stuff. Osprey crammed an almost offensive amount of organization into 10 liters: padded laptop sleeve (fits 13-inch), tablet pocket, pen slots, mesh organizers, and a soft-lined front pocket for your phone.

The narrow profile (15"" tall, just over 10"" wide) means it doesn't look bulky despite holding way more than you'd expect. Water-repelling recycled polyester keeps your tech safe in light rain. The padded mesh shoulder straps are surprisingly comfortable for extended wear.

**Reality check:** This is almost too organized for some people. All those pockets and compartments mean you need to actually think about where things go. And at $70+, it's competing with budget full-size daypacks.

**Best for:** Tech-carrying commuters, students who need to haul a small laptop, anyone who gets genuinely upset when they can't find their pen.

# Amazon Basics Mini Backpack – The ""I Need Something Cheap That Works"" Option

**Capacity:** Varies (8-12L typically) | **Price:** $20-30

Look, not everyone wants to drop $80 on a mini backpack. Sometimes you just need something that works for Disney trips with the kids or festivals where you're not worried about it getting destroyed.

Amazon's loaded with budget mini backpacks, and honestly? Many of them punch above their weight. Look for ones with 1,000+ reviews averaging 4+ stars. Check that they have YKK zippers (seriously—cheap zippers kill otherwise decent bags). Make sure the capacity actually matches your needs.

I tested a generic one with my 7-year-old nephew at a water park. He stuffed it with sunscreen, snacks, a change of clothes, and his Nintendo Switch. The zippers held up. Nothing got wet. It cost $23.

**The trade-off:** These won't last for years. The materials feel budget. Limited warranty or none at all. But for short-term use or kids who'll outgrow stuff anyway? They're perfectly fine.

**Best for:** Parents buying for kids, festival-goers, anyone needing a cheap temporary solution.

# Pacsafe Citysafe CX Anti-Theft Mini – The ""I'm Paranoid About Pickpockets"" Pack

**Capacity:** 11L | **Price:** $110-130

Traveling to Barcelona or Rome and worried about pickpockets? This is your pack. Pacsafe built their reputation on anti-theft gear, and they didn't skimp on the mini version.

What makes it secure: eXomesh slashguard straps (can't be cut with a knife), lockable zippers, RFID-blocking pockets, and you can even lock the strap to furniture. Yes, the locking zippers take practice to use. That's kind of the point—thieves aren't figuring them out in a crowded metro.

**The catch:** At 11L and $130, this is the priciest option here. It's also a bit bulky for a ""mini"" pack. But if you're carrying valuables in high-theft areas, the peace of mind is worth it.

**Best for:** Solo travelers in major cities, anyone carrying expensive electronics, travelers with anxiety about theft (no judgment—Europe can be sketchy).

# JanSport Half Pint – The Nostalgic Classic

**Capacity:** 10L | **Price:** $25-35

JanSport. You probably had one in middle school. Turns out they make a mini version, and it has that unbeatable lifetime warranty.

The Half Pint is dead simple: one main compartment, one front pocket, adjustable straps, done. No fancy materials, no tech pockets, no pretense. Just a solid little backpack that'll hold your stuff and probably outlast your car.

**What I appreciate:** The lifetime warranty is legit—they really will repair or replace it. It's proven durability. Tons of colors and patterns. You can stuff it full without worrying about seams ripping.

**The downside:** It's not particularly stylish or modern-looking. Limited organization. The material feels... exactly like what you remember from school.

**Best for:** People who value function over fashion, anyone who wants a worry-free backup pack, nostalgia enthusiasts.

# Character Mini Backpacks – The ""Fun Over Function"" Option

**Capacity:** 6-10L typically | **Price:** $25-80 (Disney licensed ones run higher)

Here's something I learned: character mini backpacks are having a major moment. Hello Kitty, Disney characters, Marvel heroes—these aren't just for kids anymore. I've seen plenty of adults rocking a Stitch mini backpack at Disneyland, and honestly? It looked perfect there.

These vary wildly in quality. Licensed Disney/Loungefly ones are surprisingly well-made but expensive ($60-80). Generic character packs on Amazon are cheaper ($25-40) but check reviews carefully.

**Why they work:** They're conversation starters. Perfect for theme parks where you want to lean into the vibe. Kids obviously love them. And sometimes you just want something that makes you smile.

**Reality check:** Most sacrifice practicality for aesthetic. Limited organization. Not built for daily heavy use. But for their specific use case—making Disney trips or cosplay events more fun—they're perfect.

**Best for:** Theme park visits, collectors, people who prioritize cute over capacity.

# The Hidden Budget Winner: Outlander Packable Mini

**Capacity:** Up to 33L (yes, really) | **Price:** Under $20

This is the weird one that surprised me. It's packable (folds into its own storage bag), weighs under a pound, made from rip-proof nylon, and somehow fits 33 liters while still qualifying as ""mini"" because of its packable nature.

I've seen travelers use this as a daypack at their destination—pack it flat in your main bag, then pull it out for daily excursions. It's not structured enough to be your primary bag, but as a secondary packable option? It's shockingly capable for under $20.

**The limitation:** Zero structure when empty. Limited padding. Feels cheap because it basically is. But for what it costs and what it does, it's hard to complain.

**Best for:** Travelers who want a packable daypack, hikers needing an ultralight summit pack, anyone wanting a dirt-cheap backup bag.

# What Actually Matters in a Mini Backpack

After testing all these, here's what I learned matters most:

**Capacity reality:** 7-10L is genuinely mini. You're fitting essentials only. 10-15L gives you a bit more breathing room. Anything claiming over 20L probably isn't actually ""mini.""

**Zipper quality is everything:** Cheap zippers kill otherwise decent bags. YKK zippers are the gold standard.

**Comfort vs. capacity trade-off:** Smaller packs with minimal padding are fine for light loads. If you're carrying a water bottle and electronics, padded straps matter.

**Think about your actual use case:** A music festival pack needs different features than a daily commute pack. Character packs work for Disney but look silly at the office (probably).

**Materials matter more than you think:** Water-resistant fabrics save you headaches. Cheap nylon tears. Canvas looks great but adds weight.

# The Bottom Line

If money's no object and you want something iconic that'll last forever: **Fjallraven Kanken Mini**.

If you want style on a budget: **Herschel Classic Mini**.

If you actually need to stay organized: **Osprey Arcane Small Day**.

If you're worried about theft: **Pacsafe Citysafe CX**.

If you just need something cheap that works: **Amazon Basics** or **JanSport Half Pint**.

And here's my actual advice: Think about where you'll use it most. A mini backpack for Disney needs different features than one for daily errands. Don't overpay for features you won't use. And for the love of all that's holy, check the actual liter capacity—not all ""mini"" packs are created equal.
