1hwiwvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1hwiwvh/my_48hrs_in_rome/,My 48hrs in Rome,"My wife surprised me with a short notice, 2 night trip to Rome, with only the hotel booked. What a lovely city üòç 

I spent the day before reviewing this sub reddit for ideas on places to eat, getting around, what to expect etc.

For future travellers this is how we got on:

Day 1: 

Arrival at 10am. Collection of bags, as we were walking out of the airport we saw 3 kiosks for buses to Rome Termini. A quick chat with the helpful lady and our return tickets were bought and we were on the bus. (‚Ç¨12 each)

We ate at Osteria il riposto, as we were early for check in. Lovely friendly place, good food, recommended!

Got to check in early at Hotel Sonya. Basic hotel, but it was booked solely for sleeping/washing in.(think travel lodge or premier inn, but touch more basic.) Beds were comfy, staff friendly, place was clean.

After that we went for a walk to explore, get our bearings  found the colloseum and walked around that (too late to get tickets for it) then wondered and found the 
Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major

Another beautiful chapel, with amazing architecture to enjoy.

Back to hotel for shower, change and then to Pizzeria est est est for dinner, probably my favourite place of the trip.

Day 2:

Colloseum - we did the basic tickets. Buying these was interesting. Being a very last minute trip, we were booking these for the next day. We had wanted a morning slot, but they only had 2.45pm. We left it, started planning to do Vatican instead, looked again, 2.45pm no longer available, but 1.15pm was. And so the fun began, we were on and off the booking site, as 1 timeslot vanished, another would appear, or sometimes it showed as all sold out. We were lucky in that we had already walked the outside of it, so if we got no tickets inside, we had other ideas. Then an 11.30am slot was available, so we booked that there and then!


Well worth the walk around. Everyone stops right at the start to get their photo of it. Ignore them, keep walking, plenty of places to get pictures of the colloseum as you walk round.

Roman Forum:

Part of the colloseum tickets, again look at what they built, what it was used for and soak it all in.
 
We then talk a walk along by the river to Vatican City. Took about an hour plus our stop at Glenda bistrot cocktail for lunch. Before we continued on.

Vatican city - absolutely stunning (and free!). Could walk around there in amazement all day!

Sistene chapel - closed when we got there, sadly. So check your opening times!

Walk back to the hotel before dinner at Antica boheme -lasagne, amatrciano, wine, salad, bruschetta - ‚Ç¨70

On leaving, 10 min walk to Termini, sarnie, crossing, 2 soft drinks at Eataly ‚Ç¨16, then 2 doughnuts (real ones, with decent jam, far better than the UK ones!) Tea and coffee for ‚Ç¨10.

TLDR Section:

Romeairportbus by schiaffini from Ciampino ‚Ç¨12 return, each.

Hotel Sonya, basic, cheap, clean and comfy. If you're only sleeping/changing there, recommend it. 

A dinner or lunch for 2 with alcoholic drink  is around ‚Ç¨60.

Wear comfortable shoes.

Look up. Look around. It's a beautiful city!


Every place we ate had a lovely vibe from fellow patrons and the staff. Could not complain at all. Oh and that brown bag has your bread in it.

Busy city, as you'd expect. Watch out for cars, they dont stop for zebra crossings!and people don't move out of your way. Just treat it like any other major capital city.

If you can read a map, it's well worth the walk, we did colloseum to Vatican back to Opera house, and whilst it's quiet far, break it up with lunch, Gellato and look and enjoy the architecture that's just around every corner.


**Where we ate:**

Antica boheme -lasagne, amatrciano, wine, salad, bruschetta - ‚Ç¨70

Osteria il riposto near hotel/opera house  beer, coke, amatricana, ravioli ‚Ç¨44.50

Glenda bistrot cocktail - beer, coke, veal meat balls, bruschetta, risotto ‚Ç¨53

Pizzeria est est est, wine, stuffed courgette, 2 x pizzas ‚Ç¨60

Eataly - Crossiant, ham, mozzarella and pistachio sandwich, 2 soft drinks ‚Ç¨16.

Ignore any resteraunt that is inviting you in!

Also, bear in mind, we use ZERO synthetic fragrances, so all of these are scents crafted with the art of perfuming. Top, middle, base notes, carefully balanced.

I know that there might be difficulties in trying to see from the perspective of some of Michael‚Äôs victims because when you haven‚Äôt been abused, it‚Äôs hard to understand, and even for survivors it‚Äôs hard to understand sometimes.

I was five years old, this is *such* an important note to remember because the younger the victim is, the more effective the brainwashing is‚Ä¶ My abuser was my father, so I was raised by the man who was abusing me but would also comment with disgust about news stories where other children were being abused. ¬†In a conversation he had with my mother he linked her to a story about child neglect, saying ‚Äúthis sickens me‚Äù

He was my biological father... so I grew up with him talking about how incest was good and normal and ‚Äúif everyone is consenting it‚Äôs fine‚Äù these are things that I internalized, if what he was saying was correct, then I was obviously the one who was wrong, and this is what he wanted me to think‚Ä¶ this is what he hoped for. ¬†It was to the point where there was a time when I was older, ‚Äúold enough to know better‚Äù (or as MJ stans say about Wade, a fully grown adult)‚Ä¶ that I didn‚Äôt get why people were so upset about age gaps, and even incest was something that confused me, people seemed so mad and disgusted about it, for good reason.

But the brainwashing that was drilled into my head would not let me understand, I never asked anyone either. ¬†I didn‚Äôt get it, I thought ‚Äúit was fine‚Äù and I repeated my fathers words over and over again, because if it was ‚Äúfine‚Äù as he said, it wasn‚Äôt abuse. ¬†

It‚Äôs hard to come to terms that your father was the first sexual experience you had, and technically the first relationship at all. I have lost a lot of memories surrounding my abuse and I know that there were moments that what was happening was scaring me, he was violent, but there were also things I remembered about being jealous when he would make comments about other people, I was jealous because I thought that if he stopped abusing me, he didn‚Äôt love me anymore, even though I hated what was happening to me‚Ä¶ I thought it was all I had. 

When I was 22 like Wade in court defending Michael, or when I was 24 like Frank when he went on Court TV and defended Michael‚Äôs art books (badly), I was also saying things that were instilled in me as normal by the man who abused me. ¬† I knew things about my father, I knew that he abused me, I didn‚Äôt know for CERTAIN that he had other victims but I thought that it was possible given the type of predator he was. ¬†But I still stayed quiet, passive.

I thought that if it was just me, it wouldn‚Äôt happen to anyone else, I‚Äôd take that hit. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a conscious choice at the time, it was more like‚Ä¶ autopilot, defend him, protect him, love him, keep him out of jail, do whatever I can.

When the sexual abuse ended as I aged out of his preference, or he may have just decided it was ‚Äútoo risky‚Äù, the brainwashing did not end and I was still convinced that I was the one who was wrong when I would grimace at my fathers disgusting and vile jokes about child abuse, even though he claimed to care about children so much, he also seemed to be obsessed with true crime involving children, kidnapping, abuse, sexual abuse‚Ä¶ you name it, he loved reading those news stories. ¬†I knew what he was saying was wrong, I knew that he had abused me, I knew he likely had other victims, but I stayed silent and I praised him because the brainwashing.

Abusers will often make their victims feel complicit in their crimes, and sometimes they will make them LITERALLY complicit in their crimes, because they know if that happens the person will never -ever- tell. ¬†‚ÄúLucky‚Äù for me, my father did not make me literally complicit, but that doesn‚Äôt mean his brainwashing didn‚Äôt have a hold on me until well after he died.

If a victim covered for their abuser, it‚Äôs because the abuser made them feel as though it was THEIR own choice, the victim cannot see anything that is happening or that has happened as wrong simply because, by design, victims are often trained from a very young age to be compliant, to listen, to be secretive, paranoid, and if the abuser is still not convinced that will keep them quiet, they force them to be more involved, there are many stories of victims who were made to SA their siblings, that is an insurance policy for the abuser. ¬†That victim is silent, leashed forever to a pole in hell, because their abuser made sure they were ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù.

And there are so many people who will never come forward for so many reasons, but one of the hardest ones is being complicit either morally, emotionally, legally.

Michael did this to James by saying that it was James‚Äô idea, that JAMES taught him french kissing, that it was ALWAYS James that initiated it.

One of the worst nightmares of a victim is turning into their abusers, and with the incorrect notion online that there is an epidemic ‚Äúhurt people hurt people‚Äù / ‚Äúmost victims go on to be predators‚Äù, we‚Äôre even more scared to come forward. Yes, there are some victims who go on to be abusers, but the statistics do not support the idea that everyone who was abused will turn into their abuser.

But society thinks so, and abusers KNOW this is a great fear and a great motivator for silence.

Even at the ‚Äúbig‚Äù ‚Äúfully grown‚Äù ‚Äúadult‚Äù age of 22-25, I was still unable to process what happened and think of what he did to me as abuse, or to think that what I did by lying was protecting him from the justice he should have faced. ¬†It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it‚Äôs so insidious that it seeps into your bones, your abusers voice telling you over and over again that he is right and that the things he does are normal.

You NEED to be able to get away from the abuser in order to deprogram what has been instilled in you, even if you feel uneasy about something your abuser is telling you to do, they will paint it in such a way that it seems ‚Äúfair‚Äù, they trade sexual acts for promises that they won‚Äôt hurt anyone else, some victims will appease their abusers by indulging them, thinking that it will stop abuse.

But this is still abuse.

Survivors, especially survivors who were made to believe that the things happening to them were normal, will praise, protect and defend their abuser and their actions even though they know fully‚Ä¶ that the actions are wrong, but there‚Äôs a voice in the back of some of these victims heads that makes sense to them, they are protecting this person, and maybe what they are doing will stop other abuse from happening, or that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an issue‚Äù because the abuser trains you to believe that.

MJ stans don‚Äôt seem to get that Michael often employed literal cult brainwashing and manipulation tactics with his victims, brainwashing doesn‚Äôt just go away when you‚Äôre a legally of age, it takes a lot to break through that. ¬†Some victims never will.

He brainwashed them to be compliant, to be complacent, to believe it was love, and to do anything that they possibly could to keep that love, because being on the wrong side of Michael Jackson was not on any of these people‚Äôs to do lists.

Both Frank and Wade (and Brett) defended the art books, claiming it was ""just a book"" but also both stating that they wouldn't ever look at or own a book like that, I believe Wade said it was something like a coffee table book, and Frank's assessment was that ""Michael was an artist in more ways than one"" which I have no idea what means, but I do know that I can't hold those words against these boys, they were physically and psychologically damaged by what Michael did to them. I cannot judge them for that, because the *only* reason they were saying that is because they were brainwashed by Michael who instilled in them that the things he did were fine, he convinced James that old european movies with child nudity was ""not pornography"" even though he used that sort of shit as pornography. 

It's hard to break free from an abusers hold, even when you're ""an adult who should know better""

3. **Creative Flexibility**: From captivating visuals in Stories to in-depth carousel ads, Facebook offers diverse formats to match your message. The platform's ability to integrate video, images, and interactive features allows businesses to stand out and engage users on a deeper level.
4. **Powerful Retargeting**: Facebook‚Äôs retargeting capabilities let you reconnect with website visitors or previous customers. You can remind potential buyers of products they viewed or abandoned in the shopping cart, effectively driving conversions.
5. **In-Depth Performance Insights**: Beyond just likes and shares, Facebook‚Äôs analytics provide granular insights into customer behaviors, which means you can fine-tune your content and optimize your ad strategies for better ROI.

It has elements such as the Fate Chart (yes/no oracle), Chaos Factor, Random Events, Interrupt/Altered Scenes, Meaning Tables (many d100 tables), NPC List and Threads list. These are modular so you can use the parts you want *(I usually ignore Chaos factor and keep it at 5)* or mix and match with other systems.

There are also many examples and variations to help customise Mythic to work for you or the current game. There are also [Mythic Magazines](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/480/word-mill-games/category/37897/mythic-magazine), the [1st Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/20798) and a [One-Page version](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/432955).

1hwic3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hwic3j/mental_health_and_break_ups/,Mental health and break ups,"A bit long winded, so apologies.

So, early October 2024, I split up with an amazing woman. 

She had told me she was having a few mental health issues, I tried to find out what the problem was. However, she didn't want to talk about it. I didn't know what else to do. I then had to go away for a few days with work. Whilst away she had messaged me saying I wasn't there for her when she needed help. Things came to an end, I told her that I still care for her (and I truly do). But I couldn't be there for both of us. As what I hadn't told her, was that I had been having some mental health issues myself.

I'm a military veteran, served in the Middle East. And although I wasn't directly in any direct incidents, I was exposed to things, that have since played on my mind. This was from a young age of 18/19. 

After the military, I worked as a contractor across Africa. Here I was directly involved in incidents, that I have always known have affected my mental health. A few close calls.

In the background, I was married, since the age of 23, and with 2 children. As my time working in Africa came to an end, it became apparent that my ex-wife had been having other relationships elsewhere. There had been flickers of this throughout our marriage. It all came to an end (Aug 2023), especially when I caught her in a toilet, with another man.

Fast forward to Feb 2024, and I meet this stunning and amazing woman. Around March/April 2024, we had a short break, as I was having a bit of a rough patch. But we got back together and spent some good months with each other over the summer. Then the dark thoughts started entering my head. I told this new partner, about the incidents that I have been exposed to, but never how much they were affecting my head. 

So we split, and I went my way, with my demons, but still always thinking of this woman. Wishing I could have been better for her. But they were my demons, and I didn't want to add any unnecessary issues onto her. I took to heavy drinking, and avoiding discussing anything about any issues I was having. This helped me sleep, even for a short period of time, whilst I was struggling.

This has been continuous since, and over the festive period. In the new year, I crossed paths with the her in a coffee shop, and in a pub. She was dating someone new, and had been since early December. 

I've sinced messaged my recent ex, I know it was wrong of, as she has moved on. I told her everything about my issues. But I couldn't deal with the thought of her not knowing. I've also been to the doctors about my mental health, and I'm hoping to get to a good place again.

I just can't help but wish I hadn't, messed up that relationship because of what was happening in my head.

I'm looking for my first relationship (It's never too early, eh?).

Heading to this subreddit because in my opinion dating apps aren't made to find matches, but rather to keep you hopeful. People are filtered based on their interests.

Firstly, something about me:

\- somewhat of a nerd or at least really interested in a lot of things revolving around IT

\- pretty introverted, and likely everything it's being associated with

\- Pretty tall (\~190cm), skinny (\~60kg), mustache, long hair (muscle rating: 15/100)

\- rarely, if ever, alcohol, non-smoker, no drugs; water, tea, coffee and oxygen enthusiast

\- at the moment not really the kind of person that goes partying, hangs out at bars or goes travelling a lot. Mostly at home since I don't have a lot of reasons to go outside lol

\- Currently studying computer science in my first semester

\- I'm neither vegan, nor a member but accepting of LGBTQ...

\- Politically, I'm green (first and foremost Anti-Extremist), Pro-Israel (In short; no genocide (yet - only option?), hamas bad (terrorists, genocide on Israelis (look it up)), Pro-Climate-Change, Anti-Plastic where feasible

\- Atheist

\- likely too insecure for an in-person date until we actually know each other (make sure you have the signal messenger lol)

\- fan of discussions, as in, the constructive exchange of opinions

\- pretty off-grid in terms of social media. Reddit is probably the worst I have - No twitter, instagram, snapchat, whatsapp, or whatever. I do have discord though.

\- related: I have no idea how to take selfies. I usually don't take any, so don't roast me.

\- desinfectant conosseur - covid has left traces in me, trying hard to ""sober up""

\- I despise public toilets

I'll admit I'm somewhat picky - I'm looking for somebody who

\- is at least somewhat skinny and has personal hygiene (my god, I cannot even wear the same set of clothes at home that I wear on the go)

\- is at most four years older than myself

\- can live without excessive amounts of makeup and other beauty stuff - really, I'm looking for a visually basic (not meant defamatorily) partner

\- has similar political views

\- has at least Abitur/graduated high school/...

\- I can have an open and truthful conversation with

\- preferably has as little relationship experience as me

\- can put up with terrible (and I mean utterly terrible) jokes

\- and please, no narcissism. If you're narcissistic, just don't message me at all.

His mother didn‚Äôt answer, her grip tightening around his wrist. Arin‚Äôs mismatched shoes splashed through puddles as he struggled to keep up.

Finally, they stopped in front of a tall, gray building. It loomed over them like a silent judge, its iron gate creaking as she pushed it open.

‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù Arin asked again, his large brown eyes scanning the unfamiliar place. A sign above the gate read, Sunrise Orphanage.

His mother knelt in front of him, pulling his tiny backpack off his shoulders. Her hands shook as she adjusted his coat, her eyes darting around nervously.

‚ÄúArin,‚Äù she began, her voice breaking. She cupped his face, forcing a weak smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to stay here for a little while, okay? These people will take good care of you.‚Äù

Confusion clouded his face. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ why? Aren‚Äôt you staying with me?‚Äù

Her hands trembled as she wiped the rain from his cheeks. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt, Arin. I need to‚Äî‚Äù She paused, her voice caught in her throat. ‚ÄúI need to do something important.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore important than me?‚Äù His words were sharp, piercing through her like a blade.

Tears welled in her eyes, but she didn‚Äôt let them fall. She leaned in and kissed his forehead. ‚ÄúI love you, Arin. Always remember that.‚Äù

Before he could respond, she stood and walked away, her figure disappearing into the rain.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù Arin screamed, running to the gate. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me! Mom, please!‚Äù

But she didn‚Äôt turn back.

Why his mother left

Months earlier, life had been different. Arin‚Äôs mother, Olivia, was a single parent working tirelessly at a diner to make ends meet. Despite her struggles, she never let Arin feel the weight of their poverty. She read him stories at night, packed his lunches with care, and promised him they‚Äôd build a better life together.

But then came Patrick‚Äîa wealthy businessman who began frequenting the diner. He noticed Olivia‚Äôs beauty and charm and offered her a life she could never imagine. There was just one condition: she had to leave Arin behind.

Olivia wrestled with the decision for weeks. She loved her son, but the constant pressure of unpaid bills, eviction notices, and the shame of poverty wore her down. Patrick‚Äôs promise of security was too tempting.

And so, with a heavy heart, she chose wealth over her son.

Arin‚Äôs life in the orphanage

Inside the orphanage, Arin sat on a cold, metal bed. The room smelled of damp walls and old furniture. Around him, other children played or whispered among themselves, but he stayed silent, clutching his backpack as if it were the only piece of home he had left.

Each night, as the other children slept, Arin would pull out the faded photograph of his mother from his bag. The edges were worn, and there was a faint tear across one corner, but it was all he had left of her.

Lying on his narrow bed, he placed the photograph on the pillow beside him and hugged it tightly, closing his eyes. He whispered into the darkness, ‚ÄúGoodnight, Mom. I miss you.‚Äù

The weight of his loneliness was unbearable, his tiny frame shaking with quiet sobs as he clung to the photo. In those moments, he pretended his mother was there, stroking his hair and singing him to sleep, just like she used to.


---

The letter

One night, under the dim light of the orphanage‚Äôs hallway, Arin wrote a letter on a scrap of paper he‚Äôd found.

‚ÄúDear Mom,

I miss you every day. I don‚Äôt understand why you left me. Did I do something wrong? I promise I‚Äôll be better if you come back.

Sometimes, I hug your picture and pretend you‚Äôre still here. But it‚Äôs not the same. I‚Äôm scared here, Mom. It‚Äôs cold, and the other kids don‚Äôt like me. I don‚Äôt know how to smile anymore.

I hope you‚Äôre happy with your new life. I hope he‚Äôs good to you. But sometimes, I wonder if you think about me at all. Do you miss me like I miss you?

Love,
Arin‚Äù

He folded the letter carefully and placed it in an envelope he‚Äôd borrowed from one of the orphanage staff. The next day, he handed it to the caretaker. ‚ÄúCan you send this to my mom? Please?‚Äù

The caretaker hesitated, her heart aching for the little boy. ‚ÄúDo you know where she lives, Arin?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ but maybe someone will find her.‚Äù

The caretaker nodded, taking the letter with a heavy heart.


---



The nights at Sunrise Orphanage were colder than the weather outside. Not because of the walls or the drafty windows, but because of the absence of love. Arin‚Äôs days blurred together in a haze of scoldings, hunger, and isolation.

The other children taunted him relentlessly. ‚ÄúYour mommy didn‚Äôt want you!‚Äù they would sneer. At first, Arin tried to fight back, but their words pierced deeper than any shove. Soon, he stopped responding altogether, letting their taunts wash over him like an icy wave.

The caretakers, stretched thin and indifferent, offered no solace. ‚ÄúStop crying, Arin,‚Äù one teacher snapped when she caught him sobbing over his mother‚Äôs photo. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only child with a sad story here. Grow up.‚Äù

Each night, as the dormitory lights dimmed, Arin whispered into the photograph of his mother, hugging it like a lifeline. ‚ÄúI miss you, Mom. Please come back for me,‚Äù he murmured, his voice trembling with hope that grew fainter each day.

Olivia Receives the Letter

In a sprawling villa, Olivia sat in a grand living room, her silk gown shimmering under the soft glow of a chandelier. From the outside, she was the picture of wealth and success, married to a man who gave her everything‚Äîeverything except love.

Patrick, her husband, barely acknowledged her presence. He was always busy with meetings, deals, or parties where she was expected to look perfect and stay silent. The warmth she had once dreamed of was nowhere to be found.

One morning, as she sipped coffee by the window, the maid handed her a letter. ‚ÄúThis came for you, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Patrick‚Äôs heart stopped when she saw the childish handwriting on the envelope. It had been months since she had left Arin, and not a day passed without her thinking of him. Her hands shook as she opened the letter.

As she read Arin‚Äôs words, tears spilled freely down her cheeks.

‚ÄúSometimes, I hug your picture and pretend you‚Äôre still here. But it‚Äôs not the same. I‚Äôm scared here, Mom. It‚Äôs cold, and the other kids don‚Äôt like me. I don‚Äôt know how to smile anymore.‚Äù

Olivia clutched the letter to her chest, sobbing. Memories of Arin flooded her mind: the way he used to hold her hand, his laughter as they played games, the nights she sang him to sleep. How could she have left him?

She grabbed her coat and rushed to the orphanage.


---

Arin Runs Away

Meanwhile, at the orphanage, Arin had reached his breaking point. Days of taunts, nights of restless sleep, and a gnawing ache for his mother had drained every ounce of strength from him.

One night, as the others slept, he crept out of bed. With his mother‚Äôs photograph tucked into his pocket, he slipped through the back door and ran.

The winter air bit into his skin, but he didn‚Äôt care. He ran until his legs gave out, collapsing onto the cold pavement of an unfamiliar street.


---

Life on the Streets

For days, Arin wandered the city streets, his thin jacket no match for the biting wind. He sat on sidewalks, watching people hurry past him, their faces turned away. The hunger clawed at his stomach, a constant reminder of his helplessness.

One night, he found a corner near a bakery. The smell of fresh bread made his hunger unbearable. He waited until the baker left for the night and rummaged through the trash, finding a half-eaten roll. Tears streamed down his face as he ate it, the cold hard bread scraping his throat.

‚ÄúWhy did she leave me?‚Äù he whispered to the darkness. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt I enough for her?‚Äù

Arin curled up under a thin cardboard sheet, shivering as the frost crept into his bones. He clung to his mother‚Äôs photo, the edges now fraying from constant handling.


---

Olivia‚Äôs Visit to the Orphanage

Olivia arrived at the orphanage, her heart pounding. She imagined Arin‚Äôs face lighting up when he saw her, the way he would run into her arms.

But the caretaker‚Äôs words shattered her. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, gone?‚Äù Olivia demanded, panic rising in her chest.

‚ÄúHe ran away a few days ago,‚Äù the caretaker said, her tone flat. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where he is.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs legs gave out, and she sank to the ground, clutching the letter. She thought of him out there alone, vulnerable, and the guilt consumed her.

She remembered how Arin had loved her unconditionally, how he had never once complained about their struggles. All he ever wanted was her presence, her love. And she had abandoned him.


---

Arin‚Äôs Struggle

Arin‚Äôs small frame was now frail, his cheeks hollow from hunger. The cold seeped into his very soul, but he kept walking. He didn‚Äôt know where he was going, but he couldn‚Äôt stop.

He passed families laughing together in warm houses, the light spilling out onto the streets. He stopped in front of one window, watching a mother tucking her child into bed. His chest ached with a longing so deep it felt like it would crush him.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, tears freezing on his cheeks.


---

Olivia‚Äôs Reflection

Back at the villa, Olivia sat in silence, staring at Arin‚Äôs letter. The words echoed in her mind: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to smile anymore.‚Äù

Her luxurious surroundings felt like a prison. Patrick‚Äôs cold indifference made her ache even more for the warmth she had once shared with her son. She remembered how Arin used to wrap his arms around her neck and whisper, ‚ÄúI love you, Mom.‚Äù

In that moment, Riya realized the truth: no amount of wealth could ever replace the love of her child.


---

This leaves Olivia desperate to find Arin, while he fights to survive on the streets.


---

Arin‚Äôs Struggle Deepens

Snow fell steadily as Arin wandered aimlessly through the streets. His thin jacket was soaked, his fingers numb from the cold. His small body trembled violently, but he kept moving, clutching his mother‚Äôs photograph against his chest beneath his coat.

Days had passed since he‚Äôd had a proper meal. His cheeks were hollow, his lips cracked and bleeding. Every step felt heavier, but the thought of stopping terrified him. If he stopped, the cold might claim him entirely.

At a park bench, he sank down, too exhausted to go on. A faint memory surfaced‚Äîhis mother wrapping him in a warm blanket after a bath, her soft voice singing him to sleep. The warmth of that memory brought tears to his eyes.

‚ÄúI wish you were here, Mom,‚Äù he whispered, his breath visible in the icy air. ‚ÄúI wish you still loved me.‚Äù


---

Olivia‚Äôs Search Begins

Meanwhile, Olivia was frantic. She scoured the city, visiting parks, shelters, and alleys, asking everyone she saw if they had spotted a small boy with bright eyes and an innocent face.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she begged a street vendor, showing Arin‚Äôs photograph. ‚ÄúHave you seen him?‚Äù

The vendor shook his head apologetically.

Every ‚Äúno‚Äù felt like a dagger to her heart. She couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt sleep. Her nights were spent curled up on the floor of her room, sobbing into Arin‚Äôs letter.

Patrick, her husband, noticed her absence. ‚ÄúWhy are you acting so strange lately?‚Äù he demanded one night.

‚ÄúI need to find my son,‚Äù she said quietly, her voice trembling.

His face darkened. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget our deal, Riya. If you bring that boy back, you‚Äôre out. Don‚Äôt expect me to let you stay here.‚Äù

Riya stared at him, her heart twisting. The man she had left her son for had turned out to be cruel and selfish, treating her more as an accessory than a partner. For the first time, she felt the full weight of her mistake.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll leave,‚Äù she said, her voice breaking.

Patrick‚Äôs face twisted in anger, but Olivia didn‚Äôt care. She packed a small bag and left the villa that night, determined to find Arin.


---

A Chance Encounter

Arin was now so weak he could barely stand. One night, as he staggered down a quiet street, he collapsed in front of a small shop.

A kind old man stepped outside to lock up and spotted the boy lying on the ground. ‚ÄúDear God!‚Äù he exclaimed, rushing to Arin‚Äôs side.

The man carried him inside, placing him near a small heater. Arin‚Äôs eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, he thought he was back home. ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù he whispered weakly.

The man‚Äôs heart broke. ‚ÄúNo son, but you‚Äôre safe now.‚Äù

The man fed Arin a bowl of hot soup and wrapped him in a thick blanket. Tears streamed down Arin‚Äôs face as the warmth returned to his frozen limbs. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he whispered, his voice barely audible.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name, son?‚Äù the man asked gently.

‚ÄúArin,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I ran away.‚Äù


---

Olivia and Arin‚Äôs Crossing Paths

The next morning, Olivia was walking through a nearby market when she overheard two women talking.

‚ÄúDid you hear about the boy the old shopkeeper found? Poor thing was half-frozen, starving too.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs heart leapt. ‚ÄúWhere is this shop?‚Äù she asked urgently, running to the women.

They pointed her in the direction of the old man‚Äôs store, and she took off, her breath coming in short gasps.

When she arrived, she saw Arin sitting on a chair inside, a blanket draped over his shoulders. He looked so small, so fragile.

‚ÄúArin!‚Äù she cried, bursting through the door.

Arin turned at the sound of her voice. For a moment, he thought he was imagining it. But then he saw her face, streaked with tears, her arms outstretched.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù he whispered, his voice shaking.

She dropped to her knees in front of him, pulling him into her arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, baby. I‚Äôm so sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I should never have left you.‚Äù

Arin didn‚Äôt move at first, his mind reeling. The anger, the hurt, the longing‚Äîeverything he had buried came rushing to the surface. He pushed her away, tears streaming down his face.

‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúYou left me! You didn‚Äôt care!‚Äù

Olivia sobbed, clutching his small hands. ‚ÄúI cared. I cared every single day. I thought I was doing the right thing for us, but I was wrong. I was so wrong.‚Äù

Arin looked at her, his lips trembling. ‚ÄúI was so hungry. I was so cold. And you were not there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Arin,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúAnd I can never undo the pain I caused you. But please, give me a chance to make it right.‚Äù


---

An Uncertain Reunion

The old shopkeeper watched from the corner, wiping a tear from his eye. He had seen many sad stories in his time, but this one hit him hard.

‚ÄúTake him home,‚Äù he said softly to Olivia. ‚ÄúHe needs you.‚Äù

Olivia nodded, holding Arin close. She kissed his forehead, her tears soaking his hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never let you go again, I promise.‚Äù

But Arin remained silent, his small body stiff in her embrace. He didn‚Äôt know if he could trust her again.

As they left the shop, Olivia carried him in her arms, shielding him from the cold. She whispered to him softly, trying to soothe the wounds she had caused. But in Arin‚Äôs heart, the scars ran deep, and the road to forgiveness was uncertain.


---


A Fragile Reunion

Olivia carried Arin through the bustling streets, her arms trembling not from exhaustion but from fear. Fear that her son might never forgive her. His small frame was limp in her embrace, his silence cutting deeper than words ever could.

As they reached a small motel where Olivia had been staying since leaving her husband, she set him down gently on the bed. Arin stared at the floor, clutching the blanket the old shopkeeper had given him.

‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù she asked softly.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

Olivia knelt in front of him, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúArin, please‚Ä¶ I know I don‚Äôt deserve your forgiveness, but I love you. I always have. I was selfish and scared, and I made the worst mistake of my life. I‚Äôll spend the rest of my days making it up to you.‚Äù

Arin finally looked up, his eyes filled with tears. ‚ÄúThen why did you leave me? Why wasn‚Äôt I enough for you, Mom?‚Äù

His words shattered her. She placed her hand on his cheek, but he flinched, pulling away. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt leave because you weren‚Äôt enough, Arin. You were everything to me. But I thought‚Ä¶ I thought I needed money to give you a better life. I didn‚Äôt see that you just needed me.‚Äù

Her voice broke as she continued. ‚ÄúAnd the truth is, I was weak. I chose the easy way out because I was tired of struggling. But in trying to escape my pain, I gave you so much more.‚Äù

Arin‚Äôs tiny shoulders shook as he began to cry, and for the first time in months, he let himself feel the full weight of his emotions. ‚ÄúDo you know how cold it was, Mom? How frightening it was? How much I missed you?‚Äù

Olivia sobbed, wrapping her arms around him despite his resistance. ‚ÄúI know, baby. I know, and it kills me every second. I can never undo what I did to you, but I promise you this: I will never leave you again. Never.‚Äù

Arin hesitated, his small fists clinging to the blanket. Slowly, he let go and wrapped his arms around her neck, burying his face in her shoulder.

‚ÄúI missed you so much,‚Äù he whispered, his voice muffled by her embrace.

Olivia held him tightly, rocking him back and forth. ‚ÄúI missed you too, my little boy. I‚Äôm so sorry I wasn‚Äôt there for you.‚Äù


---

A New Beginning

The next morning, Riya took Arin to a small diner, one she had worked at long ago. They shared a simple breakfast of toast and eggs, and for the first time, Arin ate without fear of when his next meal would come.

Olivia sold the jewelry Patrick had given her, using the money to rent a small one-bedroom apartment. It was nothing like the luxurious villa she had left behind, but it was warm, and it was theirs.

At night, Olivia tucked Arin into bed, just like she used to. She sang his favorite lullaby softly, her voice trembling with emotion. Arin clutched her hand, his mother‚Äôs photograph still under his pillow.

‚ÄúWill you leave me again?‚Äù he asked, his voice small and hesitant.

Riya kissed his forehead, her tears soaking his hair. ‚ÄúNever, Arin. Not for anything. You are my heart, and I will never let you go again.‚Äù


---

Healing the Scars

The journey wasn‚Äôt easy. Arin had nightmares for weeks, waking up crying and calling out for her. Each time, Olivia would hold him until he calmed down, whispering words of comfort and reassurance.

One day, as they walked through the park, Arin saw a group of children playing. He hesitated, then looked up at Olivia. ‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶ play with them?‚Äù

Olivia smiled, tears glistening in her eyes. ‚ÄúOf course, baby.‚Äù

As she watched him run off, laughing and smiling for the first time in months, her heart swelled with both joy and sorrow. She had nearly lost her son, but she had been given a second chance. She silently vowed never to take it for granted.


---

The Letter Revisited

One night, Arin found the letter he had written to his mother. He handed it to her, his eyes searching hers.

‚ÄúYou got this, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked.

Riya nodded, tears welling up. ‚ÄúIt was this letter that brought me back to you. Your words‚Ä¶ they reminded me of the love I had forgotten in my own pain. You saved me, Arin, even when I didn‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù

Arin hugged her tightly, resting his head on her chest. ‚ÄúI just wanted you back, Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm here now,‚Äù she said, holding him close. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll never let you go again.‚Äù

Bonjour, pastry lovers!  France is synonymous with delicious food, and a big part of that culinary magic lies in its incredible pastries.  From delicate macarons to rich croissants, there's a French pastry to tantalize every taste bud.  This guide will walk you through some of the most iconic, helping you navigate the delightful world of French patisserie.

**The Classics You Absolutely Must Try:**

* **Croissant:** Arguably the most famous French pastry worldwide, the croissant's flaky, buttery layers are simply irresistible.  The best croissants have a light, airy texture and a delightful crispiness on the outside.  Enjoy it plain, with jam, or even with a savory filling.

* **Pain au Chocolat:**  Often mistaken for a chocolate croissant, the *pain au chocolat* actually uses a different dough.  Instead of the crescent shape of a croissant, it's a rectangular pastry with a rich dark chocolate filling.  The combination of buttery pastry and melting chocolate is pure bliss.

* **√âclair:** This elegant pastry consists of a light choux pastry shell filled with creamy pastry cream and topped with glossy icing.  Variations abound, from classic vanilla to more adventurous flavors like coffee or pistachio. The airy choux pastry and rich cream create a perfect balance.

* **Macaron:** These dainty meringue-based cookies are known for their vibrant colors and delicate flavors.  Sandwiched together with ganache or buttercream, macarons offer a sophisticated sweetness and a satisfying textural contrast.  They are often found in a wide array of delicious flavors.

* **Madeline:** These shell-shaped little cakes are incredibly tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Their subtle sweetness is perfect with a cup of coffee or tea.  While often plain, they can also be found with lemon or other flavorings.

* **Mille-feuille:**  Meaning ""thousand leaves"" in French, this impressive pastry showcases layers of puff pastry, pastry cream, and icing. It's a showstopper dessert that's as delicious as it is visually appealing.


**Beyond the Basics:**

While the above are some of the most well-known French pastries, there's a whole world of deliciousness waiting to be discovered.  Look out for other treats like:

* **Palmiers (elephant ears):** These delightful pastries are made from puff pastry, rolled and shaped to resemble elephant ears, then baked until golden brown and crisp.
* **Tarte Tatin:** This upside-down apple tart is a classic French dessert, featuring caramelized apples baked in puff pastry.
* **G√¢teau St-Honor√©:** A beautiful and complex pastry featuring choux pastry puffs, cream, and caramel.

**Tips for Enjoying French Pastries:**

* **Freshness is key:**  The best pastries are enjoyed fresh from the bakery.
* **Pairings matter:**  Consider pairing your pastry with a coffee, tea, or even a glass of wine.
* **Don't be afraid to experiment:** Try different flavors and variations to find your favorites.


So, there you have it! A delicious introduction to the wonderful world of French pastries.  Next time you're in France (or lucky enough to find a great French patisserie near you), be sure to indulge in these sweet treats.  Bon app√©tit!

1hwhvlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hwhvlt/the_starlight_beast_part_4/,The Starlight Beast - Part 4,"I dropped to my knees and lit a flare as I hit the ground. A second later the Beast‚Äôs claws ripped apart the cupboard next to me, sending glass, shelves, and plates all over the place. The bright red flame hurt the monster, and I held it in front of me like a sword. Johann was up in a second, and he did the same, orange sparkles flew from his flare as he closed in on the Beast. It lashed out, but only with the back of its hand, and my friend dived away quickly. I heard Nell‚Äôs screams and the curses of Sufar. The captain lit another flare, and she yelled at the shocked Greli to stay with Nell, ordering them to hide.

The three of us hounded the Beast. Its body shifted, turning invisible in parts or maybe phasing to a different place entirely. And for some reason, its hundred eyes were locked in on me as if I was the main course. The monster was bleeding, but its sheer anger kept it in the fight, and its sharp claws searched for us in wide arcs, wrecking furniture and lamps with almost every miss. Its blood, or whatever liquid oozed from its horrid body, left an even worse smell than before. The captain stumbled backwards, leaving Johann vulnerable, but the Beast just tried to swat him away again. It wanted me, I was sure of it. Sufar finally came to help, he threw one sparkling rod after the other at the creature, from a safe distance.

The Beast decided it had taken enough damage ‚Äì I even saw something sparkle deep within the left side of its chest ‚Äì and it fled, leaving a trail of black bile in its wake. We gave chase, but the marks vanished before the elevator, and the monster was nowhere to be found. The vent nearby was only a foot wide at best, there was no way it could hide the creature's hulking form.

""I told you it was phasing,"" I said, pinching my nose to keep out the stench.

""Can‚Äôt be, it would mean it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ toying with us. It‚Äôs an animal, a dangerous one, but nothing more,"" Sufar argued.

""Maybe it follows certain rules,"" Johann said, smelling the blood again.

""Why are you doing this? Don‚Äôt touch that crap! Disgusting!"" Sufar definitely wanted to punch my friend.

""Because I know what this is,"" for a moment I thought he would taste the blood. ""Mutagenics. I transported a few from the Belts, back in the day. The miners reeked of the same smell, and later I checked out the crystals when no one was watching. Exactly the same stench.""

""I will stop you right there. The crystals are used to make electricity on a small scale and in a few chemical processes as a conductor or substitute. All other supposed applications come from the addled minds of conspiracy theorists and alleged whistleblowers,"" Sufar leered at Johann, and I realized I didn‚Äôt want to get familiar with those unofficial reports. Sailors had almost as many tales about the crystals as the Beast, and they weren‚Äôt prettier. Sufar too, he was more afraid than angry. ""We don‚Äôt need this nonsense on top of the Beast, tell them, captain,"" he nodded to our Bilox shipmaster.

The captain stumbled forward, holding her chest. She took long, labored breaths, and slid to the floor trying to hold on to the wall. Her bright green blood joined the Beast‚Äôs black bile and they mixed on the white tiles. I ripped open her suit and looked at the wound on her chest, while Johann grabbed the bandages and painkillers. It was a long and nasty cut, but not too deep thankfully. Nell knelt beside me.

""I took first-aid classes; I think I could help,"" she said. I had patched myself up a few times in the past, Johann too, but I trusted the girl. We lifted the captain to the table. She coughed some blood on me, and Nell dressed the wound quite expertly.

""Get the clotters, they should be in a blue box,"" she instructed us. Johann found it and handed the box to our young medic. There were twenty vials with different colored caps inside. She picked out one with a pink top, punched in the needle, and searched for the main artery on the captain‚Äôs neck. She almost pushed it in, when a wave of terror washed over her gentle face and she quickly switched out the pink vial for a green one. She took a deep breath and stabbed, the formula rushing into the captain‚Äôs body.

""They ought to separate these by species,"" Nell sighed.

""I didn‚Äôt take you for a segregationist,"" I jested before brushing her braids.

""Not funny,"" she said as she chuckled. We laid the captain on the couch and administered some painkillers. If the Beast‚Äôs cut didn‚Äôt carry some nasty surprises, she should make it.

Sufar turned on the lights while we patched up the captain ‚Äì he tried rather. Everything except the LED string above the counter was wrecked, and even the sockets were ruined. But we also realized the creature had, in fact, turned off the lights before the attack, all three switches were scratched, but not destroyed; the Beast was careful not the rouse us. There was no denying now that it was more than an animal. The flares soon went out, leaving the mess hall almost as dim as the upper reactor room was before things went to hell.

One more nasty surprise came, however, when I went to get my coffee and realized what the soft, dry object was on the counter. Brak‚Äôs mummified corpse stared at me with empty eye sockets. I waved Johann to me, and we tried to sneak out to put him in a body bag until we found something more dignified, but Nell noticed we were hiding something. I had to spill the beans, and the poor girl broke down in tears. She didn‚Äôt believe the little Gro‚Äôller survived the last attack, but seeing him like this was a different story. We found a fairly hidden spot for Brak in storage and laid him to rest. We were as careful as possible, but his dried-up corpse didn‚Äôt take well to the transit, and his head almost came off, with only a few strings of skin keeping it in place. My species wasn‚Äôt known for such affection, but I hugged Nell tight when we returned.

We turned on all the torches to be safe, that one sorry LED string wasn‚Äôt going to protect us and our supplies were enough to repel maybe another attack. I was not afraid of the Beast returning soon though, we hurt the bastard badly that night. We collected all the spares from the deck, thinking of our next move. Nell said the captain had to rest at least a few hours before we could wake her, the clotter needed time to work.

We played cards to pass the time, and an apologetic Greli waited on us on hand and foot. He also cleaned up the blood all alone, and that helped a lot with the smell.

""I think it wanted you, Tran,"" Sufar blurted out once.

""I told you a few times already, shut up if you don‚Äôt have anything useful to say,"" Johann grunted, folding his hands behind his blond head, and he turned to face my compatriot.

""It makes sense. The Beast hunts to eat. Tran wounded it, and now it wants revenge. If the creature is near-sapient as you say, if it is intelligent enough to use light switches, it must understand the concept of vengeance too.""

""Yeah, because extrapolating our feelings to a creature of darkness that lives in interstellar space is sensible,"" my friend spat. ""Besides, now the captain and I also got a piece of the Beast‚Äôs ass, so don‚Äôt even think about anything‚Ä¶ silly, Suf.""

My green compatriot scratched his neck with his claws. ""Maybe we should split up. You two can stay here with the captain, while me, Greli, and Nell, we can hunker down at the bridge.""

""You are a damned coward,"" the Bilox lad grunted. ""I‚Äôm not going to abandon my friends.""

""Me neither,"" Nell agreed, moving her chair closer to me. Her purple eyes burned with derision. ""We are in this together. But you can go if you want.""

Sufar‚Äôs tongue flickered with disapproval, but it was obvious he wasn‚Äôt planning to go anywhere alone. We returned to the cards. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was right. I could see the hair of a hundred stares leer at me when I closed my eyes. ¬†If I could sneak out somehow‚Ä¶ I lost quickly in the next round on purpose and checked on the captain. She was breathing steadily and her fever went down a bit. I told the others I was grabbing drinks, and they gave me their orders. I went around the table and to the fridge, the dim corridor to the elevator was only a few steps away. I was hidden from the view of my friends, and I felt up my gun and the spare torch on my right, before stepping forward. My heart was pounding in my throat, or at least it felt that way, and the air was heavier than ever. Suddenly a strong grip stopped me in my stride.

""I thought you could use some help; you only have two hands after all,"" Johann said, squeezing my shoulder. ""Don‚Äôt be an idiot,"" he chided.

""Sufar is an asshole, but he is right, he must be! The Beast was gawking at me the whole time. Damn it, I‚Äôm sure he was right about the atomics too. If it gets me‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôll try to hurt it as much as I can. I don‚Äôt want to risk your lives to save my own skin. You just make sure to get Nell and Greli out of here.""

""Aye, he may be right,"" Johann agreed, ""but serving up yourself as a snack won‚Äôt prove it."" He looked at the elevator, and a strange fire ignited in his gray eyes. ""But if you want to go and hunt down the bastard‚Ä¶ that is a whole other ballgame. We could do that. It bleeds."" He absentmindedly lit a cigarette and took a few puffs. I looked at him as if he had lost his mind. Hunting the Beast? What an insane idea. Yet, something atavistic burned inside Johann, an ancient instinct coming down from a long line of hunters. I realized now, that the change inside him happened earlier, just after the attack in the reactor room. Once he saw the black blood of the monster, he knew it could be killed. No, he wanted to kill it. I stepped back and his hawkish gaze softened.

""Although it‚Äôs probably safer if we all stayed together. We are not far from Calan, and I don‚Äôt think the Beast can survive near a star."" He wasn‚Äôt hesitant. He gave me an out.

""Yeah, you are probably right. Let‚Äôs grab those drinks,"" I whispered with a dry throat. My determination evaporated, this new face of my friend filling me with dread. His eyes gleamed at the thought of hunting the horror that prowled in the dark for millennia, feasting on our kind. My plan of serving up myself to the monster seemed rational in contrast. Yet, that fire still burned in his eyes, though dimmer now. If the Beast were smart, it would stay away from him.

We got the stuff from the fridge, but I stopped him for a moment. ""Did you see it? It‚Äôs heart. I only saw them in pictures, but I think it looked like a‚Ä¶""

""Mutagenic crystal. Yeah, I saw.""

""What do you think it‚Ä¶"" I didn‚Äôt know how to phrase the question.

""It means that the Beast is either one of the ancient crystal monsters they yap about around the Belts, or one of the horror stories about mutagenics is true; if we are to believe the tall tales about the crystals' abilities,"" he said, scratching his face. ""And that‚Äôs a big if. No use to speculate now, we can‚Äôt prove anything.""

We returned with the drinks. Nell was giggling at a joke Greli made, and I couldn‚Äôt help, but smile at them. It softened the grip on my heart.

The morning came, as much as it can come on a spaceship, and we woke up the captain. She was groggy but didn‚Äôt grow any fangs or phasing abilities, so that was a plus. Nell changed the bandages, they smelled bad, but the captain was in fairly good shape.

""If there is anything I can do‚Ä¶"" Greli started, but Johann interrupted him.

""Don‚Äôt overcorrect, kid. You screwed up, you will remember it and do better next time.""

""He‚Äôs right you know,"" the captain agreed, as she sat up with a grunt. ""Eyes on the ball, and we may get out of this mess."" Bilox sturdiness was legendary, and the captain wasn‚Äôt going to disgrace her kind.

We checked the tapes after breakfast, our grumpy guest did some damage on all levels right before the attempt on my life. The cargo bay was almost completely dark, only the two lamps in front of the elevator door remained, but the reactor room in the back was suspiciously intact. The bridge level lost a camera and around half the lights, it was in the best shape out of the decks overall. I couldn't help but feel the monster was trying to flush us out.

We counted our remaining light sources, eight flashlights, six flares, and some glow sticks, for what they were worth. We needed the emergency supplies from the other decks and hoped we could collect them while the Beast was recuperating. I chose the cargo bay and took Sufar with me, Johann went to the bridge with Greli. The captain wanted to go instead of the Bilox lad, but we threatened mutiny if she didn‚Äôt rest some more. Nell placed her doll on our shipmaster‚Äôs pillow before taking up her position at the surveillance screen.

""Lansy will help you heal. She always made me feel better when I was a kid,"" she said with that sweet smile of hers.

The elevator complained in a shrill tone as we went downwards, the old machinery wasn‚Äôt going to take much more punishment. Our target wasn‚Äôt too reassuring either. Beyond the safety of the elevator and the area in front of it, the dark realm of the Beast waited for us.

""All right, Tran, I switched to infrared, you are good to go,"" Nell‚Äôs voice crackled through the radio. We turned on our flashlights, they were strong, yet they almost bled into the darkness of the vast cargo area. We walked carefully, searching for the supplies while sticking to the gray walls. Johann taped flares to the walls every thirty steps or so a few days back, but it looked like the Beast was a fast learner, they were cut in half, lying useless on the ground. I could no longer look at the creature as if it were a simple-minded predator, it was no animal, it was intelligent and‚Ä¶ evil. It was hunting us for sport.

Suddenly loud pounding struck our ears, and we crouched down, our flashlights frantically searching for the source. I had to resist the urge to ignite my flare, we only had so many left.

""It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs attacking the reactor. Oh, Tran."" Nell whispered.

There‚Äôs a photo on our mantelpiece, a snapshot of two toddlers sitting on a picnic blanket, smiling like they‚Äôve just discovered the meaning of joy. The little girl‚Äîme‚Äîis clutching a stuffed bunny, her cheeks pink from the summer sun. The boy beside her‚ÄîBen Carter‚Äîhas cake smeared across his face and a mischievous glint in his eyes. Our parents love that photo. They call it ‚Äúwhere it all began.‚Äù

What they don‚Äôt mention is that ten minutes after it was taken, Ben ripped the ear off my bunny, and I retaliated by dumping my juice box on his head.

‚ÄúMeant to be,‚Äù they say, laughing over stories of our childhood battles, as if our constant fights were adorable preludes to some grand love story. I think they‚Äôre delusional.

Growing up two doors down from Ben meant that I never had to look far for trouble. He was always there, ready to ruin my day. If I built a tower out of blocks, he‚Äôd knock it down. If I drew a picture, he‚Äôd scribble over it. Once, he buried my favorite doll in the backyard and wouldn‚Äôt tell me where.

‚ÄúEnemies,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, glaring at him across the sandbox.

‚ÄúForever,‚Äù he‚Äôd reply, grinning like he‚Äôd won some invisible game.

Our parents, of course, didn‚Äôt see it that way. To them, we were destined for something more.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll grow out of it,‚Äù my mom would say, sipping coffee with Mrs. Carter at our kitchen table. ‚ÄúOne day, they‚Äôll look at each other and see what we see.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrandbabies,‚Äù Mrs. Carter would sigh dreamily, as if Ben and I weren‚Äôt in the next room plotting each other‚Äôs downfall.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine anything more ridiculous.

Take the summer I turned nine, for example. My dad had spent hours building me the perfect treehouse in our backyard. It had a rope ladder, a tiny balcony, and a sign that said NO BOYS ALLOWED. Ben, naturally, took this as a challenge.

‚ÄúThis is my kingdom,‚Äù I declared when he tried to climb up one afternoon, brandishing a foam sword I‚Äôd gotten for my birthday.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop me,‚Äù he yelled, hoisting himself onto the lowest branch.

‚ÄúOh, yes, I can.‚Äù

What followed was a war of wills that ended with Ben falling into the mud and me grounded for a week because I‚Äôd poured a bucket of water on him ‚Äúto defend my territory.‚Äù

Our parents just shook their heads, smiling like they knew something we didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll thank us one day,‚Äù Dad said when I complained about having to invite Ben to my birthday party that year. ‚ÄúWhen you two get married, you‚Äôll laugh about all this.‚Äù

Married. The word felt as foreign to me as algebra equations and mortgage payments.

I looked at Ben‚Äîhis mud-streaked face, his too-big sneakers, the gap where his front tooth had fallen out‚Äîand thought, Not in a million years.

But that‚Äôs the thing about childhood. You think you‚Äôve got everything figured out. You think you know exactly who you are and who you‚Äôll never be.

And then life comes along, cracks open the world like an egg, and spills out something entirely unexpected.

She said WHAT ready to fight she was like u really tryna call me out right now I was here the whole time you physco bitch. I grabbed an old lady worker and she kicked her out. It was finally my turn and I asked the lady infront of me what she usually gets. I forget the name of the drink I just remember it was pastel purple with black boba iSnide. It was a 20$ drink and I was broke. I put my card in and I owed 2$ the lady behind me offered to pay the rest and the lady ringing me out offered to pay as well but then I look behind me and it‚Äôs that girl that got kicked out but she brought a dude to push through anyone that got in her wAy. At this point I just wanna get back to billie and our fun little talk but she keeps tryna fight me and I had the Starbucks worker and the lady behind me in line on my side so it was war.

1. make a drink or go to a cafe. idk but just having a matcha latte (yes, i'm snobby about not drinking coffee and honestly not scared to defend it) is just on point, yk? like writing an essay while just sipping is the life. 

2. use one of those virtual study rooms. i forgot what it's called but i love the one where you facetime popular characters or smthg. it's practically saved me in exam season; its kinda like 'i can't slack, rory gilmore is there!!' that sounds really dumb but istg it works

3. have a whiteboard??? i have one and it just sits there and it's so good to just look up and keep track of stuff, and also it makes mindmapping a dream. 

4. study in different places. ik i talked about going to a cafe, but libraries, dammit! i overly associate my desk with procrastination and doomscrolling, so different surroundings help so much. 

5. getting different handwritings. i'm one of those ppl with a billion handwritings no joke. i have a swirly cursive one for english, a super scrawl like one for math, a nice tilt for social science... yk what i mean. it also helps in tests when i use the same handwriting i use when i make notes or study because it triggers some weird memory mechanism? i have no idea, for now it's just a cute little thing. 

i know these are so arguable and there are so many more tips out there so let me know what you think :)",1,1736334246.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False
1hwhnhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/oneanddone/comments/1hwhnhh/it_feels_weird_to_be_oad/,It feels weird to be OAD.,"For some background, my wife and I lived the DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) lifestyle for about ten years, and we really loved it. We‚Äôve been inseparable since we first met, and that freedom was amazing. We could travel on a whim, grab overpriced coffee, or go out to eat whenever we felt like it‚Äîlife was simple and flexible.

We always thought we‚Äôd have more than one child since we both love kids, but when we had our first, it didn‚Äôt change our lives as much as we expected. Sure, things are different now, but we‚Äôve been able to maintain a lot of the easygoing lifestyle we had before. Having a baby has shifted things, but it hasn‚Äôt taken away as much of our freedom as we thought it would‚Äîand that‚Äôs been a nice surprise.

I‚Äôve got a ton of hobbies, and my wife works full-time while running her own successful business. We both love spending time together, but I‚Äôm also juggling college and a full-time job, so the thought of adding more kids to the mix felt pretty overwhelming.

At the same time, I feel guilty for only wanting one child. It feels almost trivial when I think about how much I enjoy making music, gaming late at night, and just relaxing with my wife. More kids would take time away from those things I love, and I can‚Äôt help but feel selfish for prioritizing my personal hobbies over expanding our family. Initially, I was leaning toward having two, while my wife was thinking three. But after going through a tough pregnancy and now caring for our super chill newborn (which still feels overwhelming at times), we both realized that one child is really all we want now.

I also never want to struggle financially, and I want to be able to invest my all into raising a single child without worrying about stretching myself too thin. We‚Äôve already gotten a few snarky remarks from people about only having one, which adds to that feeling of being ‚Äúout of the norm.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre OAD ,but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it‚Äôs a bit unusual. I wonder if anyone else has had similar thoughts. On one hand, I‚Äôm content with our decision and don‚Äôt want more kids, but on the other, it still feels kind of weird. Anyone else feel that way?",2,1736334230.0,oneanddone,6,0.67,False

As you can see in the video, I've been suffering from this eye twitching for years. It twitches as soon as I move my face, laugh, talk or eat. There are days when it's not so bad, and there have also been months when everything was normal without my eyes twitching. After a month it came back. I suffer from ulcerative coltis and I'm not sure whether the eye twitching is one of the symptoms. I've been to numerous doctors: Neurologist: he said it could be facial spasm. Ophthalmologist: stress or magnesium deficiency or vitamin B deficiency. I've also been to a physiotherapist because I might be too tense. I drink 3 liters of water every day and take magnesium every evening before going to sleep. I sleep 8 hours and go to the gym regularly. My bad habits are: I drink too much coffee, I feel stressed and I keep everything inside, I am on my cell phone a lot. When I am nervous, my eyes twitch a lot. Perhaps one of you has had similar experiences or symptoms and has a solution to improve it. I would also reward the person for it, I don't know what to do anymore.

1hwhjye,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_voyced-voip/comments/1hwhjye/understanding_virtual_phone_numbers_a_simplified/,Understanding Virtual Phone Numbers: A Simplified Guide for Solopreneurs and SMBs,"In the ever-evolving world of business communication, the term ‚Äòvirtual phone number‚Äô is buzzing more than ever. But what does it really mean, especially for solopreneurs and small to medium-sized businesses ([SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises)s)? Let‚Äôs demystify this in a straightforward, non-techy way, much like explaining it to a friend over coffee.

# The Basics of Virtual Phone Numbers

Imagine you have a phone number that isn‚Äôt tied to a single phone line or device ‚Äì that‚Äôs essentially what a virtual number is. Unlike¬†[traditional phone numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers),¬†[virtual numbers](https://www.voyced.eu/), also known as digital numbers, operate over the internet. Think of it as having a chameleon-like phone number that can work anywhere and on any device, be it your mobile, laptop, or even a desktop.

# Why Virtual Numbers? Flexibility and Features

For businesses, particularly solopreneurs and SMBs, flexibility is key. Virtual numbers allow you to be reachable anywhere, without being chained to a desk. Whether you‚Äôre on the move, working remotely, or juggling multiple roles, your business number stays with you.But there‚Äôs more! Companies like Voyced offer virtual numbers packed with features. From voicemail-to-email services, call forwarding, to a host of other functions, these numbers aren‚Äôt just about making and receiving calls; they‚Äôre about optimizing your business communication.

# The Cost-Effective Communication Tool

One of the most attractive aspects of virtual numbers is the potential cost savings. Traditional landline setups can be expensive, but with digital numbers, businesses can save up to 80% on their phone bills. Voyced, for instance, provides very competitive pricing, making high-quality communication accessible without breaking the bank.

# Types of Virtual Numbers ‚Äì Expanding Your Reach

Voyced offers a variety of Digital Inward Dialing (DID) numbers to fit different business needs:

* [**Geographic Numbers:**](https://www.voyced.eu/clients/store/standard-telephone-numbers-geographic) Have a¬†[local presence](https://www.voyced.eu/)¬†in cities across the globe.
* [**National Numbers**:](http://standard%20telephone%20numbers%20(national)/) Establish a nationwide presence in your country of choice.
* [**VoIP Mobile Numbers**:](https://www.voyced.eu/clients/store/voip-mobile-telephone-numbers) Ideal for SMBs, these numbers blend mobile accessibility with VoIP benefits, enhancing the likelihood of inclusion in mobile call packages and improving connectivity for your clients.
* [**Toll-Free Numbers**:](https://www.voyced.eu/clients/store/tollfree-freephone-numbers) Make it easy for clients to reach you.

These options empower businesses to establish a local or national presence in markets worldwide, enhancing their¬†[global reach](https://www.voyced.eu/5-benefits-of-using-virtual-telephone-numbers-for-your-business/)¬†effortlessly.

# Voyced‚Äôs SoftPhone and OfficeSIM ‚Äì The Ultimate Tools

The SoftPhone app turns any internet-enabled device into a fully functioning phone, perfect for businesses on the go.

I have an online store in Romania, selling Specialty Coffee, that also has a Subscription program selling in Romania. [https://prettygoodcoffee.ro](https://prettygoodcoffee.ro)

I am not a webdesigner or something similar, but I didn't trust to pay a lot of money to someone to create this online store for me, so I decided to start on my own.

I am quite happy with what I did until now with Woocommerce. Maybe is not the fastest website, but is the maximum I manage to do myself. So any feedbacks or ideas, will be really appreciated.  
  
Now, I plan to grow my business and start to sell outside Romania. To do this, I need to add a second language to my website (will be only EN) and a second currency (will be only EUR) as I plan for now to sell/ship only to Europe.

I am a bit reticent to add WPML and add a second language to my website, as I feel that will increase a lot the load time of it. Also that my current domain is a "".ro"" one.

  
I need some advices from you, what will be the best scenario to do this:

1. Add a second language and second currency using WPML and keep the .ro domain and maybe add a .ro/eu  
2. Create a second store, sync the products and stock between them and make it only for EU.  
2a. Create a new Woo store  
2b. Create a Shopify store for an easier setup.

One of the Classroom departments deals with mercenary work, and other with eugenics. It should come as no surprise that Dietrich hunts down valuable Quirk holders like pokemons(with a respectable arsenal of those already, called Core Retinue), as well as periodically culling opposing forces through disposable assets.

Apocrypha knows eleven languages, is proficient in several kinds of martial arts(although mostly focused on Muai Thai except for Dietrich himself who goes for grappling), is a formidable marksman and sniper, has an official confirmation of his performance driving in one of countries that have his base, and has just generally spent his years acquiring skills to be passed on through his Quirk.

Dietrich is very fond of quoting Bible, and occasionally makes references to other religions that are awful in their befouling candor. He also likes to reference ""power of friendship"", for what friendship is stronger than one with yourself?

Classroom can actually be qualified as an overgrown polycule: Everyone is with everyone, because - duh - they are all the same person. As well, they are fanatically devoted to the group, in a way a normal person is only able to be devoted to themselves. No difference to Baumanns, though. When talking of Dietrich in text form for any reason, Baumanns always capitalize his pronouns.

# Questions from the Guy Questions list:

1hwh8xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1hwh8xv/why_not_just_go_for_it/,Why not just go for it?,"Today Benjamin Kdak√© and I continue ‚ÄúThe Beneficial Workings of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth and the Functions of the Five Elements,‚Äù the third section in the January installment of Ikeda Sensei's commentaries on [The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life and Death](https://www.worldtribune.org/2024/the-oneness-of-mentor-and-disciple/).

First, some big news from the Longhouse School project. The renovation on the new house should be finished by early February. Mr. and Mrs. Dewey are delighted by the progress and are looking forward to moving into a truly senior-friendly home. At that point, the Daycare will move to a rented facility inside a nearby church while renovation proceeds on the second floor of the old Dewey house to accommodate our small kindergarten and first grade classrooms. So who do you suppose *finally* agreed to be the new first grade teacher and the school‚Äôs educational director? Right!

Coffee break over, everyone. Back to business!

Sensei now jumps to Nichiren‚Äôs description of the life state embodied in each of the names of the four bodhisattvas. In addition, what are their spiritual characteristics or enlightened attributes *when they are actually combined*? Sensei summarizes: ‚ÄúThey comprise an unsurpassed state of being in which ‚Äòthe sufferings of birth and death are nirvana‚Äô and ‚Äòearthly desires are enlightenment.‚Äô‚Äù

The Dewey's (I am writing this with their permission) have become our closest of friends. They are at an age when they have outlived almost all of their dear friends. With no children or grandchildren, they are pretty much alone besides a few distant relatives. They tell us that their greatest suffering had been loneliness. Then along came the Longhouse Daycare and serving on the board of trustees. They now find their days and nights are full of delight. They don't use the word ‚Äúnirvana‚Äù but they said it's fine if I use it to describe how they feel. And they look sprite and healthy to match.

They were the ones to convince  Mr. Holdout Guy to commit to teaching first grade and being the educational leader of the school. ‚ÄúBut I really don't have experience teaching the little ones,‚Äù had been his call to resisting. 

‚ÄúThat's exactly why you should take on this responsibility!‚Äù they told him. ‚ÄúYou can fight in Afghanistan but you can't deal with a dozen 7-year-olds? And you carry the vision of the school inside of you! We can't hire somebody with that quality!‚Äù

Translating this into Buddha-ese, ‚Äúearthly desires are enlightenment‚Äù means life is fulfilled as we face our weaknesses (earthly desires) and transform them into great victories (enlightenment). 

Besides, in a blink the Twinettes‚Äìand, a year later‚Äìthe Twinmen, will be sitting in that first grade classroom and he had better have this all figured out!

In *The Orally Transmitted Teachings* (p. 118), Nichiren describes the four bodhisattvas‚Äô relationship to birth and death: 

>There are times when a single person possesses all four of these principles, namely, the four virtues of eternity, happiness, true self and purity. 

Jumping around text a bit, Nichiren talks about transcending ‚Äútwo types of death.‚Äù What's that? There is birth and death in the six paths (the first six worlds) and birth and death in the higher realms. Yes, depending on your life condition, the experiences of both birth and death are radically different! Who can plow the snow away so that regardless of life condition, both life and death are full of joy and value? That is the function of *Bodhisattva Superior Practices (BSP).*

BSP has a life condition so robust that even dark patches from the past can transform into joy and value! Like those five years I spent in New York, Paris, and Berlin. (Maybe you are just a bit too young to hear the story.) BSP enthralls me to turn each dreg into multiple treasures. Benjamin Kdak√©, you can watch [The Banger Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banger_Sisters?wprov=sfla1) when you are a bit over and get an idea about how BSP does her work.

But there are three more leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth! According to Nichiren:

>To go beyond the two opposing views that life is cut off after one existence or that it is eternally the same is called *Boundless Practices*. 

Huh??? Here is my take. Many people think that a lifetime is like leasing a car: the lease is over, return the vehicle. On the other hand, there are others who believe in an everlasting afterlife, in the form of a heaven or hell. Both ways of thinking lead to ‚Äúwhy bother, it doesn't really matter‚Äù ways of thinking. Boundless Practices, however, imbues eternal life into the moment. It's quite the accomplishment!

Next:

>Because one overcomes the five categories of illusions and entanglements, that state is designated *Pure Practices*. 

Here, false and incomplete mistaken ways of thinking no longer limit, tangle, and trip up trip us up, Benjamin Kdak√©. [On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Clear_Day_%28You_Can_See_Forever%29?wprov=sfla1).

Finally:

>And because *one is as perfect in virtue as the Buddha* who attained enlightenment under the bodhi tree, that state is named *Firmly Established Practices.*‚Äù 

What do you think, Benjamin Kdak√©? Should we aim for ‚Äúas perfect in virtue as the Buddha‚Äù?

It all started back in 8th grade when a girl (let‚Äôs call her A) joined my school. Over time, I developed a crush on her, but I never told her directly until much later. We started talking after I messaged her about some photos from a school picnic, and from there, we became friends.

By the time we reached 10th grade, we mostly talked online. Then, during the lockdown in 11th grade, we started chatting every day‚Äîsharing reels, YouTube videos, and just talking a lot. Eventually, I confessed to her that I had feelings for her, but she said she didn‚Äôt feel the same way. After that, we stopped talking for a few months.

In 12th grade, we started talking again, but it wasn‚Äôt the same. I could feel some distance between us, but I didn‚Äôt push it. I tried to make her feel special on her birthday‚ÄîI bought her a cute coffee mug and chocolate and gave it to her outside her home, her parents are strict. We also hung out a couple of times (like grabbing ice cream or shakes), but she was often uncomfortable if classmates teased us.

On scribble day, I wrote ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù on her shirt, and didn‚Äôt talk about it after that. One day out of the blue she told me she wasn‚Äôt interested. That was it‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mention my feelings after that, but we eventually stopped talking regularly again.

Fast forward to my drop year for JEE prep, I saw her at my coaching center (she was preparing for NEET). We started talking again, and I made small gestures, like getting her gifts on her birthday (a photo album, keychain, and cake). I left for college, but we stayed in touch and met alone whenever I came home.

One time, I bought her jhumkas, and we went to cafes and hangouts. On her next birthday, I gave her a Harry Potter hoodie (we‚Äôre both fans) and a letter. After that, we didn‚Äôt meet until her NEET exam.

Fast forward to now: she didn‚Äôt get into a GMC but joined a college in my university. Since then, we‚Äôve grown closer. We meet more often, and I‚Äôve done small things like cooking gajar ka halwa and pasta for her. We also talk on calls for hours (sometimes 2‚Äì2.5 hours).

Here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs been almost three years since she said she didn‚Äôt see me that way. I‚Äôve never brought it up again, but I still have feelings for her. I can‚Äôt tell if her feelings have changed or if she still only sees me as a friend.

What do you think I should do? Should I talk to her about it and ask her directly if her feelings have changed? Or should I let it go and stay friends? I genuinely care about her and don‚Äôt want to ruin what we have, but it‚Äôs hard to keep wondering.",4,1736332486.0,OffMyChestIndia,4,1.0,False

A good thing ! I am self-employed. At the moment I am barely scraping by and haven't been able to get myself in the mindset to make any changes. This is a standard networking event specifically for my sector in my city, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but it's a chance to make an impression and hopefully gain some new connections. 

I wouldn't be going at all if I was drinking. I've missed _loads_ of these sorts of events over the past few years simply because I've felt too disgusting and worthless. Even if I had a few days sober, I have still always felt that my face would be red and bloated and that I am awkward and would be embarrassed. 

This opportunity is a good one to focus on as something other than simply staying sober. It's a reason outside of my own health. ""I am staying sober today because I want to be fresh faced and feel like I have some worth in a few days"". ""I am staying sober today because I am excited to open doors for myself"". ""I am staying sober today because I am starting to feel better about myself and may be able to step up another rung on the ladder out of addiction"". 

So today I will spend time preparing instead of self-destructing.

Hey, coffee lovers and design enthusiasts! üåü

So, I recently found myself staring at my living room, feeling like something just wasn't right. You know the feeling? Everything‚Äôs in its place, the walls have a fresh coat of paint, but something‚Äôs missing‚Ä¶ and then it hit me: my coffee table! It had seen better days and was demanding an upgrade. This minor existential crisis led me down a rabbit hole of researching coffee table trends, and let me tell you, I've come out the other side enlightened and caffeinated!

**Let's start with a confession:** I spent an irrational amount of time surfing Pinterest and design blogs trying to determine what the latest ""it"" coffee table was. It‚Äôs crazy how much design has evolved! Gone are the days of the simple, no-frills wooden table. Today, it‚Äôs all about making a statement. These tables are no longer just utilitarian pieces; they're the centerpiece of our living rooms.

**Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs brewing in the world of coffee tables:**

1. **Mixed Materials**: Recently, I‚Äôve noticed a wave of mixed material tables. Think glass combined with wood or metal. This combo brings a sleek, industrial vibe to the space while still maintaining warmth. I stumbled upon one where the tabletop was a chunk of reclaimed wood framed with metal, and it was love at first sight!

2. **Sculptural Designs**: Who said art belongs only on walls? Some of the trendiest coffee tables are sculptural in design, blurring the line between furniture and art. I‚Äôve seen tables shaped like abstract sculptures that are sure to be conversation starters!

3. **Sustainability**: More people are leaning towards sustainable choices - tables crafted from recycled materials or sourced responsibly. It feels good to know that the choices we make can be stylish and planet-friendly at the same time.

4. **Multi-functional Wonders**: With the rise of tiny homes and multi-purpose spaces, coffee tables that double as storage units or transform into work desks are trending. I‚Äôve always admired pieces that marry form and function seamlessly.

**And here‚Äôs my personal take:** I finally decided on a classic round glass coffee table with wooden legs. It ticks boxes for both style and function without overpowering my smallish living room. It dances with natural light during the day, making my space feel airy and open.

Now, that‚Äôs enough about my design journey. I‚Äôm curious to know what's holding court in your living room! What coffee table trends have caught your eye, and why? Drop your thoughts, experiences, or even some photos if you‚Äôre feeling extra generous. Let‚Äôs brew up a vibrant discussion right here! ‚òïÔ∏è

So, a little bit about myself so you know what awaits you :D
- My favorite music is metal. Nearly all sorts of metal (no matter if power, symphonic, death), folk and medieval rock. I like going to concerts and festivals and have a good time there.
- I really like photography. Taking my camera out and goind for a walk with it is very calming and I like to think about challenges for myself to improve my skills there.
- Coffee adict. No... Coffee nerd! For me coffee is more than just that black and bitter liquid, it's more like what wine is for other people.
- I relly like good books and reading, even though I'm not the fastest reader. But if a book catches me, I like to dive in and explore the world together with the protagonist.
- Everybody has a nerdy side, too, right? So mine is DnD and Star Trek (Discovery sucks, change my mind :D). 

Oh and don't hesitate to simply sneak into my DMs or chat. I would love to hear from you and so long, I wish you a wonderful day and an amazing time.",1,1736331692.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
1hwgzi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hwgzi4/i_removed_camgirl_addiction_somehow_not_even/,I removed camgirl addiction - somehow not even trying,"It just went away. I started interacting with camgirls around 2008, putting something like 300EUR monthly, sometime more, on them. I think in 15-16 years of this i have ""invested"" an amount of 50-75K EUR. Not proud of that. Finally the thrill to get there is gone, after several attempts of noFap, reading forum, sharing my issue. I have lost count of how many months i don't log in that site, probably around a year now.

One of the thing which helped me the most was finding and pursuing alternative satisfying hobbies and passions, but I feel one event cut the rope definitely.  I was with one of my favourite models, she apologized for accepting late my pvt request because she explained she was chatting with one of her most devoted fan through years, he was desperate because he was very sick and going to die within weeks, or months, he was barely logging.

Suddendly, that guy was me. I felt like a cold shower in thinking one day me, old and sick, doing the same revelation to a model. There are even other factors of course, but this sudden clarity really did stick a diamond in my brain. 

I am also going to theraphy, from about 5 months now, trying to help myself in healing my personality, trying not to always feel so hopeless and secluded. I signed up to a gym (more than a year now), and I try to keep my life busy in sharing with others humans, even if it is going to a bar and having a chat with a stranger for 5 minutes in front of a coffee.

I also try to ""redirect"" my expenses in more clean buyings: books, steam games, whatever. I renewed my guardrobe, I tried many months to have ""nothing"" available to get into that sick money sink.

To whoever is fighting the same issue: you can do it. Don't lose hope, and please think the most important factor in getting rid of this sick habit, is yourself. Ask for help, sign to a gym, go walk. Anything. Think that such interaction mostly is not worth a minute of your time, or a penny of your savings.

I also hope for ""that dying guy"" which he is at peace now, he doesn't know how much he helped me.  


God bless you all.",2,1736331688.0,NoFap,1,1.0,False
