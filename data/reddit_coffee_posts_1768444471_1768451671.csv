I don’t mind if they come in and buy themselves what they can, and even on a day where I feel I am capable I will occasionally offer to buy them a donut and coffee or offer a courtesy cup of water. 

However, I am often advised to not do any of the such as it gives the idea that we will do it consistently. So often I am met with erratic and aggressive people when they don’t receive what they want. If they’re not inside they’re harassing our customers knocking on their car windows, begging at the outside menu, following their cars, climbing into our dumpster, even today we had someone take a shit by our dumpster. We’ve had plenty of them steal our tips, steal bottled drinks and throw tantrums outside of our store or storm around our building in a fit of rage. 

I often don’t feel safe tending to these customers or telling them to leave the premises. I feel horrible telling them no or calling security on them and I wish I knew a better way of handling these interactions. If theres any at all.",1,1768451352.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1qd9u0w,https://i.redd.it/jhl1a96oxfdg1.png,1 year old raptor puppy going through a nipping biting and bad behavior phase. What signs should I look out for and how do I nip this in the bud now before it gets worse?,"Meet Freddy! He's a very sweet, 1-1.5 year old boy as a best guess. Recently, he seems to have regressed his behavior and I'm sure I overlooked some things that allowed it to progress to a problem.

Quick background: we live with my folks because I fell on hard times and they let me move back in. They already had 2 seniors (a 14 year old mutt and a 9 year old husky) and then Freddy got added to the mix (don't ask, it's a long story that complicates everything).

I work 2 jobs. I have a 7-4 (which is really a 6-5 with the commute) and, sometimes I work for the mermaid coffee company from 5-10:30pm. This leaves my folks to take care of Freddy during the day. My dad is disabled but he's able to take the huskies to the dog park in the mornings and then the dogs mostly just sleep and get restless before dinner at 4:45-5pm. My mom WFH but she's very busy and can't have Freddy causing chaos and consternation post-dinner.

Lately, he also has had some behavior issues where he seems calm and then goes a little bezerk. I admit to being part of the problem because I roughhouse with him and get him excited. He's also gotten very nippy, especially with my mom. She's threatened to take him to the shelter as soon as he fully bites her. Yes, she is aware that that is a death sentence. It's not fair to anyone in the house to have him be a problem and bite people and I don't have any wiggle room here.

I have not taken him to training class because my work schedule has been so all over the place, but my mom also keeps dissuading me from doing so. She doesn't think it'll help.

**Potential questions**:
**Can I move out?** I don't have the finances to do so at the moment, let alone find a place that'll take a 50lb husky.

**How much exercise does he get?** In the mornings, it's about an hour at the dog park and then home, where he just chills out and he seems fine (as reported by my dad). In the evenings, he and the other husky will often go for about a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood. With me, it's longer, and I let them run around the park off leash and then we walk home. On good weather weekends, I try to take him for longer hikes, in which case he loses his furry little mind. 

**Does he have toys, etc?** Yes! And he's a big chewer and he's destroyed most of them. I got him the hard plastic, which he loves, but he cracked a tooth, so that's out. He loves chewing, but I'm trying to avoid costly vet bills with his teeth, so I don't want to buy rawhide or bones or anything. He's had the rawhide alternative collagen chews, but those are gone in maybe 30 seconds. Nubz and other dental chews don't stand a chance. He's also destroyed two (three?) leashes.

**What other behavior modifications have I tried?** Leashing in-house; crating; redirecting to a toy; increased exercise; verbally/physically correcting (sharp no, clapping, pushing him off when he jumps, turning my back to him)


.

I've grown rather fond of Freddy. My last option to save his life is to preemptively surrender him to the shelter before he truly becomes a bite risk. I am willing to put in the work, but I'm just overwhelmed and part of me feels like I'm going at this alone and that I'm spinning in circles. I had two other dogs I raised from 12 weeks (the current 14 year old is one; the other died of cancer a few years ago) and I don't remember it being this hard. The other husky in the house is a stubborn PITA, but she's calm and getting calmer as she gets older. Freddy seems to be growing wilder. I admit this is my first time with a husky this young. Yes, I made a critical error in judgement when I adopted him in October. But how do I fix this here and now?",2,1768451304.0,husky,0,1.0,False

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night.","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

1qd9t30,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qd9t30/rf_lovely_isnt_it/,"[RF] Lovely, isn't it?","The words were written with a shaky hand across a pack of Newports. I’ve never known if Newport 100s actually contained more tobacco or if they just burned a little slower. Surely there’s a study somewhere proving it one way, and another study contradicting it. To the eye, they look bigger, fuller, which raises a question I’ve asked myself more than once: if they cost the same, why buy shorts at all? Maybe that’s the game cigarette companies play, charge the same for less, so people convince themselves they’re making the “healthier” choice. Or buy the longer ones because you feel you are getting more for your money. Two types of people, really.



This pack, the one with the scribbled phrase, was the shorts. The man who owned it is dead now. Four cigarettes remain. He never got the satisfaction of finishing the last one. Smokers usually have a new pack waiting before the old one runs out, but maybe he wasn’t that type. Maybe he waited until he was down to his final two. The last cigarette in a pack always has a certain weight to it, almost as satisfying as the first, or the tenth. He was 62 when he died. By then, he’d had through so many firsts, lasts, and middles. I wonder if he noticed them as much as I do.



Most people, hearing of his death, would assume cancer. That’s the easy guess. But it wasn’t,  it was kidney failure. He didn’t even pick up smoking until his fifties, some late-life crisis or rebellion, who knows. Still, it’s easier for people to point to cigarettes. Habits are all we usually see of a person. It comforts the non-smoker: *He smoked, I don’t. That means I’m safe.* Smokers, on the other hand, will point to anything else.  Trying their best to rationalize the death as if it wasn’t related to smoking. I guess the smokers got the better end of this statistic.



But what I keep circling back to is that phrase: “Lovely, isn’t it?” Why write it on this pack? Did he write it on all of them, or just this one? If his family finds it while cleaning out his things, will they notice? Or will they just see the cigarettes and toss them in the trash? If he left other packs with other messages, they’ll vanish too, discarded with no second thought. Or will they notice? If so, would they raise concern? Would they look around the house for journals or check his phone and computer for anything that might lead to it. Or would they just say “it’s just so and so, he was just doing his own thing like always.”



His belongings will scatter over the coming days and months to different relatives and friends. His favorite chair will end up in a friend’s garage. His computer wiped clean, passed along to a nephew. His coffee cups and pour-over kit boxed up for an aunt’s best friend. The things he held onto, the objects that filled his days, will become background clutter in other people’s lives.



He never married. No children. A few long-term girlfriends, all of them remembering him kindly. Thoughtful, communicative, even-tempered. Yet for some reason or another, it never lasted. He held the same middle-management job for decades. Not rich, not poor. Always steady, always there. Survived rounds of layoffs and mergers and more layoffs and more mergers. When he died, the company replaced him within the week, announcing: *He would want us to keep working, to meet our KPIs.* Everything always moves forward, indifferent.



And yet the cigarettes stay in my memory, fixed. That single pack holds more questions than anything else he left behind. Maybe no one will ever understand why he wrote those words. Maybe he kept so much hidden that no one could. Perhaps he was waiting his whole life for someone he could truly share himself with, and never found them. If I had known him, I suspect I’d have only known the surface. The polite, steady version he showed to everyone else. I would never have seen the scrawl on the pack. That’s the paradox: the beauty lies in the imperfection. It’s not neat or clean. It’s fractured, ambiguous, maybe even meaningless. But that’s what makes it beautiful.



I can’t tell anyone about this. They’d laugh, or think I was overthinking. At best, they’d call it strange. So I keep it to myself. Share a fragment here, a half-thought there, but never the whole. And in that choice, I feel a little closer to him. Maybe we all live this way. Keeping our deepest thoughts folded tight in the dark, showing only the simple parts to others. And maybe that’s fine. Banter with friends, small joys with family, those moments refresh me. Why burden them with my depths when I don’t want to carry theirs?



Still, I can’t help but imagine what it would be like to share everything with one person. To have someone who understood me completely, where nothing had to be hidden. A space where doubts and fears and wild ideas could all be laid out without fear of judgment. The rush of it, two minds shaping each other, building something bigger together. Thoughts spilling into thoughts like water filling a carved divot in sand.



It sounds beautiful, but the thought of it terrifies me too. If I gave away everything inside me, would I lose myself? Would I be reshaped, brainwashed even, by such intimacy? That’s the tension we all live in. The endless calibration of what to give and what to hold back. It’s exhausting. It’s exhilarating. A pendulum swinging between quiet sadness and loud joy, always moving, always shifting under the light and shadow of each day.



I didn’t know this man. But I thank him. His pack of cigarettes made me pause, made me think. That’s what drew me in at first. Not the words, but the cigarettes themselves. I don’t buy brands. I roll my own. But I’ve always liked the feel of a pack in my hand. When I saw them sitting on the hospital bedside after he passed, I picked them up. Four left inside, waiting. Frozen in time.

when her phone sang and my name
was not the music.

I had offered her a circle—
small, honest, diamonds—
a vow you could knock against a glass,
a promise that would bruise the skin
and never disappear.
She smiled the way people do
when they are grateful for something
they do not want.

The Ring she wanted was a sound.
Not metal, not weight,
but the electric tremor of a call
lighting up her palm.
A ring that vanished the moment it arrived,
leaving no mark except
how quickly she turned away.

I learned the language of pauses.
How her laugh took an extra breath
after work.
How “just a coworker”
was said like a door
quietly closing.

In meetings and calendars and shared coffee,
another man held what I never could:
the power to interrupt her life
and be welcomed for it.
His ring fit perfectly—
slid into her day
without asking permission.

At night, her husband lay beside her,
My finger bare,
M heart loud.
I wondered how devotion could be so solid
and still lose to something
made of air and distance.

I realized then—
some people don’t want forever
wrapped around their hand.
They want the thrill of being chosen
again and again,
by someone who will never promise
to stay.

I couldn't come back from that last glare my aunt shot across the dinner table. A relative had never studied me as a stranger. 

""I'll leave first thing in the morning I had some wine at dinner"" 

""Ok. Pick me up on the way. Big red house on Gun Shop Rd""

""DM don't knock""

After setting several alarms, I managed about two hours of sporadic sleep. Forcing myself awake at the first 5:30 AM chime was a struggle between physical comfort and logical action. The hangover malaise made the moments both blurry and anxious. 

Carefully, quietly, I lifted the old iron door latch. Applying just enough pressure as to not allow the parts to scrape. I pushed upwards on the handle so that the hinges wouldn't creak.  
The house was quiet. From the hallway I listened for signs of life. No coffee was percolating, the TV was off, no footsteps from the loft.  
With the coast clear, I made a hard right into the bathroom and didn't close the door. Those hinges groaned no matter what. My parents would always wake me in the mornings when they began their days up here. 

I relieved myself of last night's wine with a stream aimed as high in the bowl as manageable. Turning the faucet handle only an eighth of an inch, I collected the cold trickle of water in my cupped hands and slowly cleared the sleep from my face.

Having just arrived the night before, my bag was still fully packed. I slid my arms through my denim jacket sleeves and cautiously slung the duffel over my shoulder. Making my way down the hallway, slowly, I remained hyper vigilant for any stirring. In the moments it took to silently unlock the front door, I prayed softly that my car would survive a cold-start. Flurries had come down overnight which dampened the fallen leaves. Easier to make a quick and quiet walk across the driveway. As i hastened my pace, I smelled cigarette smoke. 

""Mornin' bud."" 

I halted, then turned to face Joe. Sitting on a birchwood bench, his rosacea popped against the A-frame's snow spackled facade.

""Hi Joe.""

""Your aunt is gonna be sad to find you gone.""

""Yeah I've just gotta get back. I don't want to wake her.""

Best I could come up with on the spot. 

""Listen bud, I don't remember what might've got said last night, but it's not worth runnin' off over."" 

I saw an opportunity. 

""Oh it was nothing bad. I think everyone just had a little too much you know?"" 

""Mhm.""

""Well... I wouldn't worry about it. I hope the rest of your weekend is nice.""

""I am worried... I'm worried about your aunt Max.""

The smoke form his cigarette tailed straight up. He sat there, staring at me. Still as a rock. 

""She's gonna be real upset if you just up and leave. Don't think I can bare to see it.""

""I'll give her a call when I get home. And make sure she knows we're all good.""

""Mm. Won't be no good. Why don't you come back inside? We'll get some breakfast going and everyone'll feel right as rain by noon.""

I thought for a moment. Weighed my options.

""Joe. I'm gonna head out.""

He took a slow drag and let the smoke out while shaking his head. I should've turned and left, but I couldn't bare to miss what was behind that expression.

""Joe?""

He spat.

""Don't listen too hard. Only gets louder when they think they've got ya."" 

He stubbed his cigarette in the snow and went back inside without looking at me. 

By the time I'd reached my exit I was cusping a panic attack. My aunt and Audrey were certainly up by then, Joe probably woke them with the news I'd fled. Part of me couldn't shake the thought that I'd made my aunt sad, but I had to remember that woman was hiding something from me. She knew something bad. She at least knew about the sound from the woods and lied about it. Why would she encourage me to live there if she knew? My head was spinning, and at the time, there were barely enough pieces to put together.

""Here""

As instructed, I DM'd Jesse while parked outside her house. I'd passed it before on the way to work. It was a newer construction compared to most of the homes it the county. Firehouse-red vinyl siding, big windows covered with black shudders, and a wraparound porch. Stuck out like a sore-thumb from between the trees.  
A wraparound porch seemed strange on a house so boxy and plain.  
  
The front door opened half way and Jesse slipped outside. She closed it carefully with a palm against the windowpane and her keys clutched tightly.  
It was strange not to see her in the usual convenience store polo. Our meetings were always so structured. Between eight to nine AM or five to six PM, in our respective uniforms.  
She got in the car quickly. The flush of winter air carried the scent of fabric softener and shampoo. Usually our talks took place between the hot dog roller and taquito warmer. 

""You good?""

I didn't know in what context she meant that. But no I wasn't. 

""Yeah, yeah... Where to?""

""You have breakfast yet?""

""No I just got in my car and drove."" 

""Go to the Denny's in Newburgh.""

""That's like twenty minutes away.""

""Yeah I don't want to talk about this in town.""

I took that very literally and remained quiet for the drive. She looked serious, intense. 

At breakfast she asked earnestly if I'd felt anything strange since moving to the area. I told her about the sound. As much as I didn't want to put her off, the circumstances made the admission feel normal. When she told me she's only ever heard it faintly, I was elated. Then I wasn't. Knowing I wasn't losing my mind was a momentary relief. But having the phenomenon confirmed, well it felt like the floor was dropping out.

""It's been happening since my parents were kids. We all get taught to ignore it.""

""How can you? I mean it's, it's impossible. It's impossible to ignore, but it's impossible that it's even happening at all."" 

""Our parents just said, 'the grown-ups are having a party'. I guess when you're trained to ignore something your whole life it just becomes regular. Like when your parents are talking serious and want you out of the room.""

""The whole 'not now the grown-ups are talking', yeah...""

""Don't get me wrong, you eventually realize something's off. Like Santa Claus. We try not to talk about it though, try not to give it any attention. But if we have to, we just call it The Party. Like, we won't go out after dark if the party's a little loud.""

I sat back in my seat to marinate on Jesse's anecdote. My head felt hot and the shared plate of hash browns were starting to look blurry. I got a little frustrated because I didn't want her to think I was about to cry.

""Why didn't you tell me when I came into the store on Halloween? I asked you if you heard anything.""

""Well I thought you might've heard *it*. But outsiders usually don't. And you didn't give me too much to go on, so I didn't want to take the chance and open that door.""

I quietly accepted her reasoning. We both took sips from our mugs and glanced around uneasily. She gave me ample time to process until I finally asked the big question. Selfishly, I hesitated. Because whatever her answer was, I wouldn't be able to unlearn it.

""How do you know my aunt?""

I feel like I need to be convinced to not message him, my brain is tricking me into thinking he misses me.

Context:
Was blindsided by my partner of 5 years. We had a couple rough months I was struggling at work, got irritable and stressed and he worked all the time so we were out of sync. He kept all his doubts to himself and on a random day he broke up with me. Right after his parents stayed for dinner at our apartment.

Right away he became cold and numb even tho the night before he told me he loved me and acted so sweet. I was distraught so I left to stay with my mom for the weekend. Ended up moving my stuff out of the apartment since he made me feel unwelcome.

I got very depressed and ended up reaching out to my ex. I think he realized how much he fucked up and he apologized profusely. He suggested going for coffee and depending how it went we could go to therapy together.

I asked for a bit of time to heal mentally before seeing him. I called him 3 weeks later and he says he wants to be friends and has no romantic feelings for me. He was very blunt and I felt so led on. He kept saying he didn’t want to lose me and he’s open to just being friends but I said I can’t keep talking to him because he keeps hurting me with his hot and cold behaviour.

I basically told him if he goes to therapy he can reach out to me. (He was already planning on going but who knows when) so now I have no idea when he’ll reach out but he told me he would it just might be a while.

I want to message him soooo badly but it takes away my power and healing. But my brain is telling me he loves me even though I sobbed the last time we called.

After finishing the Infinity Castle Arc, I was compelled to explore what life would be like for the characters following the final battle. This inspiration led me to begin development on a fan-made visual novel titled **""Light of the Afterlife.""**

Here is the premise of the story:

The game is set one year after the final showdown. With Muzan defeated and the demon threat essentially eradicated, the Demon Slayer Corps has officially disbanded. Its former members are now faced with the challenge of adapting to a ""world without demons"" and starting normal lives.

You play as a former Kakushi member who survived the war. However, with your life's singular goal—""destroy all demons""—now gone, and grieving the loss of so many comrades, you have fallen into a state of profound confusion and helplessness. Overcome with survivor's guilt, you contemplate taking your own life, but are stopped by Giyu. He offers you a new beginning with a job as a barista at the coffee shop he opened after the war.

Through weekly gatherings, holiday parties, seasonal events, and personal invitations, you will have the opportunity to build deep bonds with the cast. The goal is to romance your former comrades from the Corps, heal from your shared trauma, and ultimately find your own reason to live in this new, peaceful world.

**FEATURES:**

You can choose your gender, which will unlock different romance routes.

**Female Protagonist Routes:**

* **Tanjiro:** A path centered on finding a stable family and unwavering friendship.
* **Inosuke:** A path to discovering freedom and living life unrestrained.
* **Zenitsu:** A path toward finding a romantic partner.
* **SECRET ROUTE - Shinobu Kocho:** A story that explores the deep bond between sisters.

**Male Protagonist Routes:**

* **Kanao:** A path to help her discover her own heart's desires.
* **Nezuko:** A path focused on her journey of rediscovering her humanity.
* **Side Story - Mitsuri:** A special chapter about the search for true love.
* **SECRET ROUTE - Shinobu Kocho:** A story of a love that transcends life and death.

**A Call for Artists:**  
The biggest challenge for the project right now is the art. I am currently in need of artists, as I am handling all other aspects of development alone. If you are an artist and this project interests you, please contact me to discuss a potential collaboration.

A preliminary demo will be released in the near future. Please look forward to it.

If you would like to play this game, your likes and support would be greatly appreciated. Your encouragement is the greatest motivation for this project's completion.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

[Part 8],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pptvib/i_took_a_job_digging_a_hole_in_the_mountains_now/)

I wake up at 6:47 AM from the same nightmare.

Plato's standing in that underground chamber we never reached, back turned, surrounded by arranged stones in geometric patterns I almost understand. He won't turn around. His voice comes out flat, automated: ""You're clocked in forever, T. The benefits are terrible. But you keep showing up.""

I jolt awake in my apartment. Portland. Studio in the Pearl District. Ikea furniture. Spotify playing lo-fi beats. The whole 'I'm a together twenty-something' bullshit aesthetic. Like I'm performing 'functional adult' for some invisible audience.

The routine begins.

Pour-over coffee from beans I researched on Reddit. Ten-minute guided meditation app—Day 67, though I've repeated Day 67 four times because I keep forgetting I already did it. Journaling in a Moleskine: ""Gratitude: sunlight, hot water, having options."" It reads like corporate training for being a real person.

At 10 AM, I have a video date. Chloe. Marketing consultant, twenty-six, likes hiking and natural wine. She's on my laptop screen, smiling, asking about my hobbies. I'm charming. Self-deprecating. Engaged. She's impressed I'm ""so together for twenty-two"" and ""taking time for self-improvement.""

""Yeah, I took some time to figure things out after school,"" I say.

I wasn't lying, exactly. Just... empty words filling up empty space. Like I was auditioning for a life I didn't want.

She suggests coffee next week. I say yes. Won't remember to text her back. She won't be surprised. We're both just playing our parts in this fucked-up dance of pretending to give a shit.

We are both performing ""connection"" for an audience of algorithms.

The second bedroom is supposed to be an office. I don't use it for work. Just this.

Multiple monitors. Browser tabs in the hundreds. Folders labeled ""Personnel,"" ""Sites,"" ""Timeline,"" ""Proof.""

___

I search for Joseph every day. Reverse image search. Business registries. LinkedIn. Corporate filings. ZoomInfo. Leaked datasets. Every shell company name I can invent—GeoThermal Surveying, Northwest Geodetic, Thurberg Mineral. Nothing. Zero. It's like he was rendered in a lab, deployed for a single purpose, then erased.

Carli. Security contractor databases. Private intelligence firms. Military discharge records. Her face yields no matches. She should be somewhere—ex-CIA, Blackwater, corporate espionage. I search ""female security consultants Montana"" and get stock photos.

Koke. I find him. Kurt Okenhauser. Seabee, born 1924, listed MIA in the Pacific Theater, 1944. The archived photo is degraded but the eyes could be his. That would make him a hundred and one. Not possible.

Unless.

I search ""life extension industrial minerals"" and get transhumanist blogs and conspiracy sites. I read them anyway.

Plato's the hardest. I never knew his real name. Never asked. I try facial recognition on a cropped photo from my phone—him grinning at the motel on Day 1. No hits. Missing persons reports, nothing. It's like he was born in that van and died in the chamber and the months between were a glitch.

The hole itself. Forest Service report: ""Unauthorized excavation, Thurberg Wilderness Area, Sector 7-G."" Fine: $2,500, paid by Northwest Geodetic, Inc. I search the company. Dissolved 2005. Twenty years before the dig.

Impossible.

The most terrifying thing isn't that they covered their tracks. It's that there were no tracks to cover. They're like fucking ghosts. Not there until you look away, then they're everywhere. Negative space bullshit that makes you doubt your own eyes.

My proof stored in a fireproof lockbox under my bed:

A photo on my phone. The hole, grainy, taken from the edge. Day 1. The metadata says the date is three weeks after the collapse. Location: Unknown. That's wrong. I remember taking this before we even descended.

Plato's notebook. Wrapped in plastic. Pages covered in frantic handwriting, diagrams, those symbols from the shack. The ink looks fucked, faded one second, sharp the next. Like it's breathing or some shit. Makes my eyes water if I stare too long.

Four hundred dollars in remaining per diem cash. I never deposited it. The bills feel wrong. Too crisp, too heavy. Sometimes the serial numbers look rearranged. I tried to spend a twenty at a grocery store once. The cashier held it up to the light, frowning. ""I think this is fake."" It wasn't fake. It was other.

A photo of me and Plato. Laughing, arms around each other. I don't remember taking it. The metadata says it was shot the morning after the collapse. Plato's eyes, if you zoom in, are vacant. That post-conversion stare. In the background, barely visible: a woman's silhouette. Carli's posture.

I open the lockbox. My fingers brush a page titled ""The God Stones,"" and I am pulled back into the memories of the hole.

The cough hits. I double over, hacking into the black bandana I keep in my pocket now.

Open my hand.

Black dust. Glittering with faint iridescent blue threads. Like the veins in those stones.

Proof ain't for convincing other people. It's for convincing yourself you haven't lost your fucking mind. And I'm running low on convincing.

Sold Koke's stone three months back. Rent was due, fridge was empty, and that fucking thing was humming in my drawer like a vibrator from hell. Needed it gone.

Found a buyer through Reddit—/r/ObscuraMineralia. Posted a vague listing: ""Unique geological sample, small, black, warm to touch, unknown origin.""

The buyer called himself TechBro\_Ascending. Claimed to be a ""biohacker"" in the Bay Area. Wanted it for ""meditation enhancement."" Offered a hundred thousand through crypto, no questions.

Met in a Denny's lot like we were selling weed. Dude shows up in a Tesla, hoodie, that tech-bro smile that says 'I disrupt industries.' Touched the stone and lit up like he'd seen God.

""I can feel it already. This is going to change everything.""

I handed it over. Took the cash. Drove away.

Two weeks later, I checked the forum. His account was deleted. His last post, still visible in Google cache: ""Can't sleep. Can't stop working. Haven't eaten in four days.""

No further posts.

I didn't follow up.

I told myself I didn't kill him. But I knew what the stone was. I sold it anyway. That makes me what? Complicit? Just another node in the supply chain?

I go for a run to clear my head. The cough is worse today. I need air.

The urban park is sleek, manicured, full of young professionals walking dogs. I see a man in a charcoal suit walking a greyhound. The dog never sniffs, never strains. Just walks in perfect sync, staring straight ahead. The man's face is bland, forgettable. Not Joseph. But the aesthetic is identical.

A woman on a bench with Carli's precise posture. Back straight, tablet in lap, stylus moving in controlled strokes. She never looks up. Could be anyone. But my pulse spikes.

An old man feeding pigeons near the pond. Skeletal, weathered, wearing a faded military jacket. When I pass, he turns. For one frame, I see Koke's pale, empty eyes. Then he blinks and he's just old and tired.

They are not them.

But they feel like placeholders. Like the Company's aesthetic leaking into my world, marking territory.

I run harder.

Get turned around. End up in a residential area. Craftsman houses, gardens, families. I stop to catch my breath, look up at a yellow house with a wraparound porch.

In the second-floor window: Plato's face. Staring down. Mouth moving silently: ""Why did you leave me down there, man?""

I blink.

Just the reflection of a tree branch.

The cough seizes me. I bend double, hand braced against a mailbox.

Into my palm: black dust, but this time they move. Writhing. Alive.

Crazy ain't seeing shit that ain't there. It's knowing in your gut that what you're looking at is just fucking wallpaper covering the real deal. And the real deal is a hole that wants to eat you.

Back in my apartment. Hands shaking. Pour whiskey. Don't drink it.

My laptop pings.

An encrypted email client I don't remember installing opens automatically. Sleek interface. Corporate. Logo-less.

GPS coordinates. Middle of nowhere. Montana wilderness.

A signed digital contract. My signature, lifted from my state ID, dated six months ago. The day after the collapse. I never signed this. Or don't remember signing it.

Deposit confirmation. Three hundred thousand dollars just cleared through my crypto wallet. Timestamp: thirty seconds ago.

I open my banking app with shaking hands.

The fifteen thousand is there. Real. Spendable.

My phone buzzes. New calendar alert I didn't create:

**FLIGHT: PDX → BZN (Bozeman)** **TOMORROW 6:00 AM** **Pack for cold weather. Work boots required.**

I never got out. I was just on unpaid leave. And the boss is a mountain. And the HR department is a hole in the earth. And the performance review is whether you die screaming or smiling.

I don't fight it.

And just like that, I can breathe again. Six months of holding my fucking breath, and now I can exhale. Because the hole wants me. Needs me. And being needed beats being free. Like a muscle I've been clenching for six months finally unclenching.

I pack. Carhartts. Thermal layers. The boots I bought and never threw away. Plato's notebook wrapped carefully like a Bible. The cursed cash that might spend at the camp. That poem of his I got printed out.

I look around the apartment. It already looks staged. An Airbnb. Someone else's idea of what a ""together twenty-something"" lives in. The lease is paid through December. Month-to-month after. The landlord can keep the deposit.

I cough into my hand once more and wipe it against my jeans, forcing myself to think clearly.

The job was garbage, the management bordered on unhinged, and the work had literally broken men's minds. Yet it was tangible, and I was good at it. When I couldn't remember who I was, they did.

The apartment door clicks shut behind me as I leave it unlocked and don't bother with a final glance backward.

My neighbor appears in the hallway, a young guy who works in tech, perpetually pleasant.

""Hey man, early flight?""

I nod at him. ""Work trip.""

""Cool, cool."" He shifts his weight slightly. ""What do you do again?""

""Extraction.""

He doesn't probe any further.

The pre-dawn streets stretch empty before me as I walk through the city, coffee shops still shuttered in the darkness.

This isn't a dash to the airport but something more like magnetism pulling me forward.

I'm not fleeing toward the hole but escaping from the fugue state that passed for normal life. The apps, the online courses, the performance art of stability. That was the real nightmare, drifting through this bullshit life with no purpose, no use, no reason to exist. The hole gave me a job. Gave me meaning. Even if that meaning was dying in a fucking hole.

The hole was savage and brutal, but it had use for me.

And I need to be useful.

We’ve all known each other about a year or two. Let's call her Katie. 

Katie joined our social circle around the same time she moved here for work. Our first real hangout was just the three of us (me, my wife, and Katie) at a coffee shop. I was ridiculously nervous — voice cracking, couldn’t stop looking at her. She reminded me of someone I used to be into, but more than that, we just clicked instantly. 

Same traumatic religious upbringing, same weird sense of humor, same references. It felt easy in a way that caught me off guard.

I tried to squash it early. Invited her to play pickleball with another friend thinking familiarity would kill the fantasy. Nope — made it worse. She’s thoughtful, kind, funny, beautiful, and has been through some hard things. We just… get each other.

She was dating a guy I actually really like — someone I’d consider a friend. The four of us hung out a bunch: Oktoberfest, birthdays, game nights, Super Bowl. They were great together. I genuinely rooted for them, even while quietly dying a little every time I saw how well they fit.

My wife is not the jealous type and has even joked that this woman is “my type.” She’s noticed attractive people too — we’re pretty open about that stuff. But I’ve never told her about the depth of this crush. I don’t see the point in dropping a bomb that will just create tension when I’m committed to staying married and doing nothing about it.

Well...just a few weeks ago Katie texted me: they broke up.

I’m honestly gutted. Not just because she’s single now (though yeah, that feels loud and dangerous), but because I lost the version of our group where the four of us existed as a unit. And I hate that she’s hurting.

I’m not planning to do anything. I love my wife, I value our life, I’m not trying to blow anything up. But this feels so much heavier than any passing crush I’ve had before. I catch myself wondering what she’s feeling, if/when she’ll date again, and it makes me feel selfish and gross.

Mostly I just needed to get it out somewhere. I can’t talk about it in real life without risking damage, so here I am.

Anyone else been through something like this? 

How do you sit with the feelings when you know acting on them isn’t an option?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

[no budget]","Hello - I wanted to do a general check in with this sub regarding my plans to get a new machine/grinder. There is no specific budget, but the items I’m eying up generally fit my criteria, but I could also move up/down a bit in price.

For the last few years I have had a Profitec Go and Niche Zero, but I recently sold both as I’m moving country and shipping costs wouldn’t be worth it. Once I settle in to my new place I want to get a higher end set up and I’ve got my eye on a Profitec Drive and Mazzer Philos.

I like single dosing and tend to go for medium/medium-dark roasts - more traditional espresso and also milk drinks Cortados/flat whites. I will usually stick with a bag of coffee until I finish it (usually 250g bags, but sometimes 500-1000g for tried and tested beans).

On weekdays I usually make at least 2 drinks for my wife and me (more if I work from home) and on weekends average about 4 a day for us.

In terms of grinder, the Mazzer Philos with the 189 burrs (for better body) seems to hit all the boxes I’m looking for - I’ve looked into the mini G too which would be available, but I think I’d miss the single dose aspect and do want the ability to change beans etc. easily.

For the machine - I really love the aesthetic of the black Profitec Drive. I know the Synk II exists and there are arguments for that, but I just like the look of the Drive in black better and the hardware seems broadly the same. I’ve also considered a LM micra and Mini but the Drive seems to hit all the boxes I would want for a lower price point whilst still being a top end machine (and even has some additional features).

Just want to get opinions - please let me know your thoughts and if there is anything I should consider before pulling the trigger! Thanks",1,1768448146.0,espresso,6,1.0,False
1qd8qa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1qd8qa4/considering_cancelling_amex_gold_to_bilt/,Considering cancelling Amex Gold to Bilt Palladium as my daily driver. Sanity check?,"Hello,  
  
As title said, I’m thinking about canceling my Amex Gold and moving most of my spend to Bilt Palladium as my main card. Looking for a sanity check from here before I commit.

Current cards: Amex Gold + Bilt (current) + Prime Visa as a backup.

Why I’m considering it:

* I’ve realized I’m not really an Amex/MR person. I earn MR points but don’t enjoy juggling transfer partners and I don’t have a clear redemption plan.
* My one clear points goal is Alaska miles (I want to book STARLUX through Alaska), and Bilt transfers to Alaska. (I was able to transfer all the points via Hawaiian when it was still allowed)
* I already use Bilt for rent, so consolidating there feels simpler.

Spend profile (rounded, annual):

* Total spend: \~120k/year across cards
* Travel/transport: \~35k
* Dining + groceries: \~20k (restaurants \~9k, groceries \~7k, coffee/takeout \~4k)
* Healthcare/pharmacy: \~16k
* Shopping: \~12k
* Services: \~8k
* Other misc: small

The 'boring spend' (healthcare, shopping, services) is a big reason Palladium appeals to me if it really earns well on non-category purchases.

Plan for my existing MR points:

* I’ll transfer out my MR points before closing Gold so I don’t risk losing anything. I’m not trying to churn, I just don’t want to keep paying the Gold fee if it’s not aligned with what I actually do.

Credit profile (rough):

* Oldest account is my Prime card, \~12 years.

Questions:

1. Is it too risky to make Bilt 2.0 my daily driver early (mechanics changing, merchant coding issues, credits being annoying to use, etc.)?
2. If you were me, would you keep a no-fee MR “keeper” card as a hedge, or just exit MR entirely after transferring out?
3. Any obvious one-card alternatives that handle heavy non-category spend better? I considered Venture X, but no direct Alaska transfer partners makes it feel like the wrong ecosystem for my goal.

I’m not asking 'is Palladium worth it' in the abstract. I’m trying to stress test the logic of replacing Gold with a single main card that matches my spend mix and redemption goal. Hopefully that makes sense. Appreciate any critiques!

[I already covered some of the basics of An biology in Chapter 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BtGWN/comments/1n4038a/the_anunnaki_who_were_they/), but I felt that a more scientifically in-depth post was in order.  If you're at all familiar with [the Varginha UFO incident,](https://youtu.be/E76kpPjxMcw?si=sfsFq1lnNu9DTs7E) then you might already be aware of some aspects of our biology.

Based on the description of the beings given by the witnesses of that incident, I'd say they were Anu from the Genetic lineage of House Alchemy.

[I posted a brief explanation on the different Genetic specializations here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BtGWN/comments/1o2l93j/the_13_houses_of_an/)

I've been on the fence about publicly confirming this information for quite some time now, and I still hesitate to go into the specific physical attributes of the different variations within our race. There is safety and security in obfuscating specific details, but I think anyone with even a moderate interest in the topic of UFOs and aliens has already concluded that there's much more out there than just the ""common grey"".

This much I will confirm.

Just cut me some slack, because biochemistry is not my strong suit. I may use some words incorrectly. I have a fair grasp on basic chemistry - which I'd say isn't bad for someone who didn't receive formal education past public high school - but when it comes down to the complex interactions within the human body, I will likely come up short.

By comparison I feel that An physiology is less complex in that aspect. Or - perhaps - it is just more intuitive for me to understand. Where human anatomy is broken down into differentiated specialized parts - bones, skin, organs, muscles, blood, nerves. An anatomy can be more likened to Cnidaria - like siphonophores, corals and anemones - with all parts internally connected by something very similar to a dense mycorrhizal network.

Where Earth's evolution was driven by competition, evolution on Ki was driven by symbiosis and cooperation between all organisms. Natural selection was based on what niche need could be filled and to what degree.

Before I get myself too sidetracked, I'd like to start with the aspect of our physiology that prompted me to write this in the first place. It's a good starting point because it allows me to begin this journey from the outer most layer of our bodies and work inwards.

So let's talk about the ammonia/sulfur/iodine smell that everyone seems to be so familiar with all of a sudden.

[Ki - The planet we evolved on - has a nitrogen rich atmosphere.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BtGWN/comments/1n7qdtd/ki_the_homeworld_island_in_the_stars/)

Earth's atmosphere has a 21% oxygen (O₂) content, and 78% nitrogen (N₂). By comparison, our home world has closer to 10% O₂ content, and 86% nitrogen content.  Much of our atmospheric Oxygen is bound as CO₂, which is close to 2% of the total composition. The remaining 2% is divided up between methane, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and NOx compounds.

If that sounds fairly harsh and inhospitable to most Earth life, you'd be correct. However I'd make some comparisons to the human gut biome, it's sulfur cycle and the nitrogen cycle on Earth.

Ki is a tidally locked planet, part of a binary system that has a secondary dwarf star that dimly illuminates the side of the planet facing away from the main star. CO₂ is important in trapping that warmth, which allows life to thrive on the dark side of Ki. Imagine a humid jungle or swamp teeming with life that somewhat resembles plants and fungi, but have the skin and texture of Earth amphibians.

Ki is also rife with an incredibly diverse biome of microbes that live in symbiosis with us and all other forms of complex life. Not unlike fungi and plants here on Earth. The entire dark side of the planet acts as the atmospheric stabilizer. All complex life on Ki is susceptible to oxidative damage from O₂ exposure, but all life on KI also uses oxygen as a key metabolizer.

So how does that work?

Well, the microbes are a bit more complex than single celled bacteria here on Earth. When exposed to O2, they undergo a process similar to polymerization - forming a protective, aerobic layer that uses O2 to form other compounds and molecules.

These microbes live on *everything.*

Most of the complex - macro - lifeforms on Ki rely on compounds like CO₂, SO₂, and NOx to receive what oxygen they need.  Some of these sources are atmospheric, and some are produced by the microorganisms that live in and on our bodies.

Let's start with CO2. Very similar to photosynthesis - the CO2 is respired - inhaled - and O2 is liberated from the carbon internally, to be used on-demand in other biological reactions. Also similar to photosynthesis, this process provides us with simple nutrients.

Evolving on a tidally locked planet, with little to no exposure to UV light, this doesn't work the same as it does in the plants on Earth.

This is where the abundant N₂ comes into play. Our outermost layer of skin - like our epidermis - is actually a thin film of the 'polymerized' microbes that process N2 into ammonia and nitrates (NOx) aerobically.

You may be getting a picture that our physiology is very similar to fungal and plant life here on Earth, and you would be correct. We could be likened to a cross between amphibians, certain plants, certain fungi, and a coral reef.

Beneath that outer layer is a thin viscous layer that contains anaerobic microorganisms - some of which use the ammonia and nitrates/nitrites to build sulfates from the atmospheric SO2. All of these essential chemicals are absorbed through our skin. We are effectively surrounded by a sac of microorganisms and nutrients that are constantly providing us with the necessary fuel to keep our bodies moving.

These aren't the only nutrients that our bodies need, obviously. Manganese, potassium, sodium, magnesium - all the typical electrolytes. Though you might find it odd that we don't need Iron the way Earth organisms do.

We don't eat or consume food either. Instead we drink or soak in a nutrient dense bath to replenish our stores of micro nutrients as needed. All life on Ki maintains an internal reservoir of these lesser used minerals - our life forms are so efficient at it that our oceans are effectively freshwater. 

Over time, the lesser used minerals do become depleted, but the microbes are always working. So when there's an imbalance or excess, it gets released as waste in the form of ammonia or hydrogen sulfide. That's when we know it's time to uptake more micronutrients - maybe once or twice a Ki year.

Back home, on Ki, this was never an issue. Any excess waste we produced was ultimately used in the biochemical processes of other life forms. Even then, up until the UdUg event, we kept our population growth in line with our planet's atmospheric stability.

The difference between Earth and Ki is like night and day.

The UV radiation of the Sun here, along with the oxidative damage caused by the oxygen rich atmosphere, makes venturing out impossible without protective measures. We have protective suits that cover our bodies to shield us from UV radiation, and we carry technology that surrounds us in a field of concentrated nitrogen to shield us from oxidative damage.

The creatures known as the greys - because they were created here on Earth, and posses mostly Earth physiology -  don't need all of those protective measures. That is why they are present for so many physical interactions with humans.

They're essentially drones that carry out any tasks we assign to them without question. We are also able to project our consciousness into them and control them that way, but quite a few of us find that a very unsettling prospect.

An, though? On our transport craft - in our settlements - we don't need those protective measures. So when something catastrophic happens, like a craft crashing with Anu on board - without any protection - oxidative damage is the first thing that sets in.

The higher O2 content of Earth's atmosphere sends our outer microbe biome into overdrive, over saturating it to the point that it darkens and thickens as a response. This affects its permeability. This process is slow - comparatively speaking - taking place over the course of a few hours.

UV damage - on the other hand - sets in rapidly. Only a few minutes of exposure is enough to kill the outer layer of microbes, changing it from soft and flexible to hard and brittle. With too much motion or activity, the outer layer would rupture and release all sorts of ammonia and sulfur compounds along with the anaerobic bacteria.

This is pretty much a death sentence for An without the proper treatment. It wouldn't be an immediate death. Instead, without that biome creating the metabolizing chemicals we need, our bodies would stop working within days.  Without that viscous protective layer, our skin would dry out and we would - essentially - no longer be able to respire.

With the outer layer damaged, the microbes within our protective layer - if they got into the human body they would wreak absolute havoc. The bloodstream has all the necessary elements for them to thrive and reproduce rampantly.

Once inside, they would behave the same way they do on our bodies. The microbes that come into contact with 02 would form an elastic permeable layer, basically creating tiny sacs of the same viscous substance full of anaerobic microorganisms that surrounds our bodies. The same material that produces sulfides and other nitrogen compounds.

I have a very limited understanding of human blood chemistry, but I can say there would likely be some extremely detrimental interactions with hemoglobin, chlorides, and salts in the human body.

This was a lesson we learned early on when directly interacting with humans, but the danger goes both ways. Your gut biome can make us just as sick if it gets past the outer membrane of our ""skin"". This is another reason that greys are the most frequently encountered being during physical interactions. They're the ones who do the retrieving.

Fortunately our outer layer is extremely selective in what it allows to permeate, and has a very aggressive response to most foreign bacteria or microorganisms. It is effectively our immune system.

This is the primary reason why humans are sedated during their encounters. It's for their protection more than ours. If they did something to injure one of us, and got our anaerobic microorganisms on their skin, the risk of infection is very high. UV would render them unable to ""polymerize"" with adequate exposure, but once inside the human body, there's very little that can be done.

Beneath the outer protective layer, and the thin viscous layer, is our skin. 

Actually, I should clarify that; we don't have skin as humans understand it. If anything, I suppose the outermost protective layer of microbes would be considered our skin.  This is where I'll return to my comparison of Cnidaria - specifically siphonophores and corals. 

Our bodies are colonial in nature - we are effectively a colonial organism made up of a cooperation of smaller specialized organisms that can only exist within the whole.  We've already talked about the colony that makes up the skin, so lets talk about what's beneath the skin.

Corals on Earth are made of individual parts called polyps, and our bodies are not all that dissimilar. Our flesh is comprised of tightly packed individual organisms that are all attached to a central core network. 

These organisms act as our muscle tissue, expanding and contracting in tandem to move water around like tiny pumps. This alters the internal water pressures, which allows us to move our limbs. At the same time, these organisms metabolize the previously mentioned compounds of nitrogen, sulfur, carbon, etc, and transfer those metabolites to our core material to be used by the whole network.

This is the thing similar to the mychorrizal network I mentioned earlier. It is dense and fibrous, and I have often compared it to what you might find at the heart of a palm tree or cactus. This core is effectively our brain, neurons, nutrient distribution system and skeleton all in one. It's what gives form to our bodies, and where intelligence takes root. It's how we feel sensation, process information - touch, sound, scent, light, emotion.

So, how do we sense the world? Let's start with sound. Since our bodies are surrounded by a fluid filled sac at all times, we're extremely keen on feeling sound vibrations well beyond the human range, and pinpointing the source with extreme accuracy. 

This also leads directly into our ability to touch and feel. 

Humans have a central brain with nerve cells that stretch into every part of the body, and we are not all that different. Your brain is in your head, ours exists as the entire network that permeates into every millimeter of our bodies. It is especially dense in our fingers and hands, which makes them very receptive to tactile sensations.

However, I believe the human body is superior in this aspect on the whole. An do have places that are very sensitive to touch - and one specialized organ I'll talk about in a bit - but we're surrounded by a layer that prevents direct contact. It's only on certain parts of our fingers where this layer is absent. 

Now, to that specialized organ I mentioned. In the book I named it the Nai'thera - to be honest I kinda hate the name I gave it, but I guess it's as good as any. 

An are created in pairs, and[ I really do suggest you read Chapter 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BtGWN/comments/1n4038a/the_anunnaki_who_were_they/) to understand some of the more complex aspects of our intimacy. We don't have genders, nor do we sexually reproduce. We're given life by an organism we call the Ig Asu, and just like humans - we are attached to it by an umbilical until our bodies are fully formed. 

Unlike humans, we keep this umbilical for life - tucked away within our bodies. At the end of this umbilical are interfacing cells that once attached us to our creator. We can use these cells to link with each other directly - one 'brain' network to another.

I'm sad to say that no human expression or experience could come close to bonding with another soul in this way. Two become one, lost within one another - at least until the connection is severed again. This isn't a hive mind, instead I'd describe it as a complete understanding of one another. So complete - in fact - that communication can seem telepathic afterwards.

However it's our sense of smell that largely contributes to how we communicate with one another. We do use sound, though I wouldn't describe that sound as words, or even verbal. Most of those sounds are vibratory beyond the range of human hearing, though you might be able to *feel*  those vibrations.

Like our ability to process sound, our whole body processes scents. I wouldn't describe it as smelling a scent- instead I would say it's more like *experiencing* scent. Everything has a scent. Thoughts, emotions, people, places - scent for us is like music. It is how we add context to communication. 

Humans involuntarily use facial expression, tone and volume, body gestures, and different sounds to convey emotional context.  An don't use any of those cues, so we might seem extremely emotionless to humans. 

I promise you we're not.

We feel emotions deeply and profoundly - all the same emotions you do.

Lastly, let's talk about our eyes. They are specialized organisms directly connected to our 'brain network.' They are also the largest single organism that comprises our bodies. If there were a single part of our body - a single organism - that I could point to and say ""This is the An"" it would be the eyes.

I'm not sure how to properly explain it, but the eyes hold as much individuality for us as the uniqueness of every human face. We maintain our sense of self - our memories - across multiple lifetimes;  though our bodies may change from one life to the next, it is the eyes that are somehow always the same for each individual.

I've seen a lot of different things stated about the anatomy of our eyes, so let me confirm or dispel some of them. 

We evolved on a world of twilight, with no moon. The sky was never brighter than the colors of sunset. So our eyes are adept at seeing in the dark, both well into the IR and UV range of the spectrum. I suspect we developed the ability to see in UV for much of the same reason humans developed the ability to taste bitter and feel pain. These things alert us to danger or harm.

Yes, our eyes do have color, but we don't have irises or sclera. The color is uniform throughout and ranges from deep blue to deep red - from rich earthy brown to pearlescent grey. Our eyes are naturally dark to capture as much light as possible, so they may often look black in low light. 

We don't have eye shine, but their surface is reflective, and we don't use coverings to protect them from bright light. The eyes have their own layer of the organisms that cover our bodies, and they darken in bright light. UV damage, on the other hand, would require full body coverage anyway, so there's no special protective measures just for the eyes.

Now, circling back to the Varginha incident - if there was a crash with Anu on board, with no protective clothing, the first thing they would've done is seek shade from the Sun. Second to that, they would've gone to the first source of water.  If they had any control over where they crashed then it was highly likely they found a remote stream or creek to ""land"" near. 

They would've followed that stream searching out larger and larger bodies of water. To the west of VarginhaI see a huge body of water to get lost in. So I'm wondering why the detour to Varginha. 

My first hunch is they must manufacture fertilizers of some sort. If the Anu can no longer produce their own metabolites, their third goal would be to find a source of those chemicals to try and regenerate their protective microbiome. Fertilizers and farms are a good source of the necessary elements. 

Varghina doesn't manufacture fertilizer or other minerals, but it is one of the major producers of coffee in the world. Plenty of fertilizers to be found for that level of production. Likely plenty of runoff into the local rivers and streams too. 

That's where they were likely waiting for rescue or recovery - or to die. 

From the descriptions... it sounds like they were in pretty bad shape by the time they were captured. It's not uncommon for An to emit the smell of ammonia, but to have the smell linger for days and stick to people like an oily substance means their microbiome had been irradiated; It was no longer able to readily undergo that 'polymerization' I talked about earlier.

That they were encountered out in the open, in broad daylight, means their bodies were shutting down and they were trying to minimize movement to conserve energy. It means they were likely very aware of the fact that they were going to die.

If you haven't read any part of my book, then you don't really understand the significance of Anu being in a situation like that alone - without their Anum counterpart or companion. It has made the whole thing difficult for me to research without getting a little emotional. So this might be a good place for me to stop. Besides, I think I covered everything I wanted to.

I (21) learned a day ago that my dad (68) is on his deathbed. This wasn’t too much of a surprise since he has always had heart issues and had to receive a transplant around the middle of last year. I’ve had contact with him on and off for most of my life, partially because he’s unfortunately always been a deadbeat to all of his (double digit) kids. But he’s generally been at least somewhat available.

Unfortunately that changed when his newest gf (60+) took over his life and cut him off of everyone. That includes all of his friends and unfortunately also me. She also stole a bunch of my stuff and was abusive towards her kids but that’s a whole new can of worms so I’ll keep it at that lol. Well, she took over his phone, which was my last way of communication with him after he moved in with her, so for around two or three years there has been no contact at all.

Yesterday I was messaged by my best friend (whose boyfriends’ mom is the best friend of his partner) that his gf had died in December and he’s been in the hospital since November. Organ failure. The only way I even know he had a transplant is through my friend, cool, right? So she asked around and found out which hospital he’s at, it’s one not super close to me but close enough that i could have a friend drive me there so i could visit.

So earlier I called the hospital and after confirming that I was his daughter, I was told that no, they would not be telling me anything. Not how he is, not if he’s stable and not if I can visit him. A stepdaughter of his had forbid me from having any contact with him.

Ok, nice. He doesn’t have a stepdaughter. Something is off here. I tell them that and I’m told to come in as soon as possible. So I message my neighbor to ask if she could drive me and she says yes and invites me for a coffee so I can explain the situation. We plan for her to drive me there tomorrow but since we didn’t know when their offices are open, she calls them and asks and that lead to even more questions.

She explains who she is and while I was too panicked to really remember much, I do remember her confirming again what I said and trying to get some way to contact the “stepdaughter” so we can plan for me to meet her, since thats what the hospital recommended. My neighbor works in healthcare so she knew how to talk to the hospital staff properly and be taken serious. She ends up being told entirely contradictory information. He’s not dying, he’s often aware of his surroundings and no, me going there would not make any sense since I legally am not allowed to know anything of his status and going in person would be a waste of time. She ends up connected to the doctor i was referred to and they have a bit of a back and forth where she explains that we can’t get in contact with the stepdaughter if we don’t even know her. In the end the hospital agreed to let my dad know that I would like to have contact and a number for him to call, but both me and her doubt that will actually happen.

The call ends and we kinda just sit there in disbelief for a bit because absolutely none of that made sense. My friend was told that they needed a living relative of his for papers and that he was DYING. like “dead in a few days” type of dying. And of course her boyfriend’s mom had told everyone (from his girlfriends’ friends) all of that. And since she had just visited him TODAY, she would also know who this unknown stepdaughter was. My friend talked with her and tried to find out who that was and ended up being yelled at for telling me anything about my dad at all. Luckily she did let the name of the stepdaughter slip.

Turns out it’s his girlfriends’ daughter is the one behind all of that. And because his gf didn’t like me or anyone from his past, she told a bunch of shit about me. And shes not even alive to fix it :)
The fun part is that they never married. She legally is not his stepdaughter. I know that only because his gf never wanted to marry again so she could keep getting money out of her dead partner.

I’m not rich, I don’t care for any inheritance because frankly, all of it would be crippling debt, I just wanted to see my dad before he dies. This woman would rather lie to a hospital to keep me away from him than to even ask any questions. If my dad himself said he didn’t want to see me, sure, i can accept that. But I don’t intend on letting this woman play around with his life in the same way her mom did for years. I could sue her, it wouldn’t cost me much, but it would hopefully show her to stay in her lane and let him make his own decisions. I also just have a decent hatred for the whole family and kinda think I deserve to at least let her suffer a little bit.

Chapter 1
Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

1qd8fmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1qd8fmh/top_surgery_was_today/,Top Surgery was Today!,"Thanks to anesthesia I have mostly been sleeping today but unable to move all that great I'm bored so here I am detailing some of my experience.

I had top surgery today :)

It was also coincidentally my first ever surgery. So here's how it went down so people like me who also have anxiety know what to expect.

Checking in. Pretty easy. They checked me and my mother in (because she's my ride, legally you have to have a ride and it can not just be an uber or lyft.)   
They took her number to text her updates and call her when I was out of surgery because she had to run family around.

They take me back in a wheelchair. I dont know if the wheelchair was because I had my cane, but they did put me in a wheelchair to wheel me to the bathroom where they gave me stuff to change into and bags for my stuff.   
I got see-through hospital underwear, grippy socks, a hospital gown, and a hair cap.

They had me do a urine sample. They didnt have like, a specific urine sample cup, they gave me one of those disposable foam coffee cups. Which was funny to me. Because I went to the bathroom right before surgery, and it averages a 2-4 hour surgery, I didn't need a catheter (thank god).

The nurse also gave me a bitty bottle of iodine and a set of four foam swabs that look like q-tips. I had to use them to shove iodine up my nose.  
Surprisingly didnt stink, but my nose still feels weird. When i rubbed my nose later my hand turned yellow. Something about preventing a specific infection, dont remember which one.

They got me onto a waiting chair with a leg rest.   
Did my blood pressure and checked my heart rate. Did my IV. IVs suck, they went through the back of my hand. I'm lucky I dont have a bruise, but I can clearly see the spot where the IV was on the back of my hand. Left the blood pressure squeezy thingy on my arm the whole time because they used it in OR too.  
The nurse helped me put on see-through thigh-high compression socks and slid on some sort of sleeve that would squeeze my legs every minute-ish to help bloodflow. The compression thigh highs were funny because she put plastic baggies on my feet to slide the socks on, because the socks have holes in the toe and it gets them on easier. Helped me slide them up to my thighs, slid the plastic baggie out through the toe-hole, and put my grippy socks back on over it.   
They put tags on my two bags of belongings and put a sticker with my info on my cane. 

They gave me the meds I was supposed to take with a little sauce-cup of water and replaced the nausea patch they put behind my ear. They put my medical bracelets on me. Apparently I was a fall risk. I imagine that's because I showed up with my cane and knee braces. 

The surgeon came to talk to me before he scrubbed in. The anesthesia doctor came and talked to me. Told me not to be worried, as I've never been under before and have very very few risk factors. Apparently being on testosterone extremely marginally raises your risk of a heart attack, but the number he gave me was like ""it's basically 1 in 10,000 people, so you're gonna be fine."" And just to tell them if I got nauseous.

They offered me anxiety medicine in my IV. I didn't take it, but appreciated the option being freely given once I mentioned I was nervous. Shit in the IV seems to work fast as hell, so if you get there and you're super nervous but think it wont help because surgery is in just a few minutes, take it. 

They walked me, not wheeled me, from the waiting area where I was set up to the operating room. The nurse handed another doctor the bag of my iv fluids to hold while I laid down.

They didnt do that thing where they put the mask on and ask you to count back from ten. I laid down, they put a pillow underneath my knees because I've got a history of sprains (very nice of them imo) and I laid back.

Suddenly my vision was rocking back and forth. I didn't know if that was nerves or what, but looking back, I think the guy probably did my IV anesthetics as soon as it was handed to him.

I remember glancing at my nurse and going ""hey full disclosure my vision is starting to spin, is that normal?""  
""Yes honey, that's normal.""

And then I was dreaming.

Apparently one of the meds for nausea they put me on can cause nightmares. I didn't have nightmares, but she did warn me. I dont remember what I dreamed about. Snippets of whatever, pretty normal dreams, and then my eyes fluttered open in the recovery room. The way I woke up I felt confused, like ""ah shit its surgery day today"". It felt like I was waking up from normal sleep, not like i was knocked out and woke up.

A different nurse was there and asked me how I felt. I told her I was tired. She told me to go back to sleep. I dont think i actually realized my chest was gone at that point.  
I remember laying there thinking ""ah man my nipples feel weird"", before remembering ""oh shit I dont have those anymore, what feels weird?""   
It was the drains. The drains felt weird. They still do. 

Slept for about an hour before I could keep my eyes open longer than 20 seconds. They went and got my mother, taught her how to help my drains and did my first drain clear right there. Gave me a little cup of water with a straw.   
Which was nice, because I've always been told you dont get water after surgery, you get ice chips. They gave me the option of water or applejuice. They didnt offer gingerale because apparently Im supposed to limit carbonation. But they did say Im allowed a little gingerale or coca cola for nausea. 

Had a sore throat when I woke up. I was also told the gas they use during surgery after IV anesthetics can often give people sore throats. Not that bad, I expect it to be gone tomorrow.  
  
Got home. Got on the sofa.  
Called my grandmother, who was so anxious about me going under the first time she was apparently crying to my mother on the phone (very supportive, just an anxious old lady)  
Passed out for 3 hours.  
Mom woke me up to clear the tubing of clots and check my drains. Feels weird. I can feel where the drains enter my skin.  
Went back to sleep.   
She woke me up to have me take my meds and eat some soup. And now I'm teetering between sleeping and being just awake enough to be bored. 

So here we are.

I was given oxy, and they encouraged me to take it in the hospital. I said I didnt think I was in quite that much pain. The nurse told me ""dont think you have to tough it out. If you think you need it, please take it.""

I told her to give me the two tylenol. She gave me two tylenol. It helped settle the pain just enough to stand and get my clothes on at the recovery room. 

It only hurts BAD when I change positions. Which I do every so often for my bad knee and Im supposed to walk around every hour to prevent deep vein thrombosis. 

I feel the best when I just wake up. Feels like a snug binder, wrapped up in ace bandages.  
It's funny looking down and seeing my fat belly instead of my tiddies :)  
My proportions are gonna give me the funkiest looking pot-belly ever but even that I'm thrilled about.

I had to have one straight incision all the way across my chest- pit to pit- because my breasts meet in the middle. Fun fact thats why lots of top scars look different, it's based on the shape and size of your breasts and whether or not they remove/reattach your nips.

Because it's a straight incision all the way across, I drain more fluid on the side I lean to, alternating about every other time.

My chest is however still covered in iodine and the markings the surgeon did before he started.   
Hopefully when I see him tomorrow and he re-does my bandaging he'll let me wipe that off. I have purple 'cleavage' drawn on because that's how he had to mark the midline lmao.

All in all just super tired.  
Figured a clear breakdown of everything that happened might be good.

Bonus facts:  
Yesterday my roommate's cat, who is notoriously not a cuddler and the only way she ever gets on someones lap is jumping off the stairs behind the sofa onto you to use you as a stepping stone, came and laid in my lap for two hours purring up a storm and rubbing her head all over me.   
I think she knew.

And today, home with my parents for recovery, our pitbull has been sitting in the corner very concerned.   
When mom cleared my drains the dog sat next to me, extremely concerned, with the biggest pitbull-pouty lip I've ever seen. She never comes close enough to pet her (im not supposed to anyways) but she keeps changing spots in the living room like she's keeping an eye on me. ",2,1768447276.0,trans,2,1.0,False
1qd8f7i,https://i.redd.it/d349wujujfdg1.jpeg,Cloudy with a Chance of Conspiracy: The Wild World of Chemtrails vs. Contrails,"I was lying on my back in the grass last Tuesday, watching a jet etch its white line across the blue, when my neighbor leaned over the fence.

""They're at it again,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Who?""

""*Them*. Spraying us.""

I blinked. The contrail was already dissolving into wisps.

This is how it starts ... not with dramatic music or a smoking gun, but with a simple question: *What are those lines in the sky?*

And depending on who you ask, you'll get two very different answers.

# The Science: What's Actually Happening Up There

When a plane flies at high altitude, we're talking 30,000 feet and above, its engines burn fuel and spit out hot, humid exhaust. The air up there is cold. Really cold. Often colder than -40°F.

What happens next is basic physics: water vapor from the exhaust hits that frigid air and instantly condenses into tiny ice crystals. Those crystals catch the light. That's your contrail ... short for ""condensation trail.""

Sometimes they vanish in seconds. Other times, if the air is humid enough, they stick around and spread into cirrus-like clouds. The atmospheric conditions determine how long they last, not what's in them.

Meteorologists have been documenting this since the 1920s, back when high-altitude flight was still new and strange. It's the same principle that lets you see your breath on a winter morning, just happening six miles up.

# The Conspiracy: Enter the Chemtrail

But for a growing number of people, those lines aren't innocent byproducts of combustion. They're evidence of something darker.

The chemtrail theory suggests that certain aircraft are deliberately releasing chemical or biological agents into the atmosphere ... for weather modification, population control, psychological manipulation, or some combination thereof. The trails that linger too long, spread too wide, form grid patterns in the sky? Those aren't contrails. Those are *chemtrails*.

I've gone down this rabbit hole more than once, late at night with too much coffee. The forums. The YouTube documentaries with ominous music. The analysis of ""unusual"" flight patterns. There's a whole ecosystem of people photographing skies, testing rainwater, connecting dots.

And I get it. I really do.

# Why This One Sticks

Most conspiracy theories ask you to believe in hidden agendas. This one asks you to believe your own eyes.

Look up. There they are. White lines crisscrossing the sky, sometimes dozens of them. If you've never thought about it before, it *does* look weird. It *does* look like something's being sprayed. And once you start noticing, you can't stop.

The chemtrail narrative offers something seductive: an explanation for the vague unease many of us feel about the world. Why does everything feel off? Why do so many people seem sick, anxious, exhausted? Maybe it's not capitalism or climate change or the slow grind of modern life. Maybe it's *the sky*.

It's a story that makes the invisible visible. It names the enemy. And in a world that often feels impossibly complex and out of our control, that clarity, even if it's false clarity, can feel like relief.

# The Gap Between Feeling and Fact

Here's where I land, and it's not a place of smug certainty.

The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Atmospheric scientists, chemists, meteorologists, people who've spent their entire careers studying air and weather, all say the same thing: those are contrails. Ice crystals. Not chemicals.

Independent researchers have tested the air, the water, the soil. No secret spraying programs have been verified. Commercial pilots, military pilots, aviation engineers, thousands of people who would have to be in on it, have spoken up to say: this isn't happening.

But feelings don't care about consensus.

If you feel unsafe, if you feel manipulated, if you look at the institutions that are *supposed* to protect you and see corruption or indifference... then why would you trust them about this? Why would you believe the ""experts"" when experts have been wrong before, when they've lied before, when they serve power before people?

That's the real conversation here. Not the science. The trust.

# What I Think About When I Look Up

I believe there are experiments and ongoing cloud seeding projects but I don't believe in wholesale chemical warfare. It's easy to track the cause of a trail by going to flightradar24.com.  I believe in the instinct that makes people look up and question what they're being told.

I think we live in a time when it's rational to be suspicious. When corporations *do* poison communities and cover it up. When governments *have* conducted secret experiments on their own citizens. When the truth has been bent so many times that skepticism feels like survival.

The tragedy is when that healthy skepticism gets misdirected. When we're so busy staring at contrails that we miss the actual pollution,  the stuff we *know* is killing us. The carbon. The plastics. The forever chemicals in our water. The air quality alerts that are becoming routine.

Those things don't require a conspiracy. They're happening in broad daylight, with paperwork.

# Living in the Question

I'm not here to convince anyone. If you believe in chemtrails, nothing I say will change your mind, and honestly, that's okay. We're all trying to make sense of a world that often doesn't make sense.

What I will say is this: the sky is big enough for uncertainty.

You can look up and wonder. You can notice the planes, the patterns, the way some days the trails linger and some days they don't. You can ask questions. You can be curious about what you're breathing, what's being done to the planet, who benefits and who pays.

Just maybe... also leave room for the mundane answer.

Sometimes a contrail is just ice crystals catching light.

Sometimes the conspiracy is quieter and closer than we think, not in the sky, but in the soil, the water, the policies written in fine print.

Sometimes the hardest truth is that there isn't a single villain to unmask. Just a thousand small violences we've all agreed to live with.



I still lie in the grass and watch the planes. I still see the white lines. I still wonder about the world and what we're doing to it.

But mostly, I'm just here. Present. Breathing. Watching the sky do what it does.

And that, I think, is its own kind of power.",1,1768447243.0,Wealthness,0,1.0,False

One strap had already given up and slid down her arm, revealing the soft, upper curve of her breast. She didn't bother fixing it. She just kept stirring the coffee, humming to herself.
​I didn't say 'Good morning.' I just walked up behind her, wrapped my arms around her waist, and buried my face in the crook of her neck. She didn't flinch. She didn't pull away or act 'proper.' She just leaned back into me, letting the warmth of our bodies fuse together in the morning light.

​Later, we were sprawled out on the couch. I was resting my head on her lap, and I told her my theory. I told her that a Mother’s love should be unconditional, sure but it should also be physical.

There’s nothing 'wrong' with being attracted to the one person who is truly yours.

right off the bat, he made it very clear he was interested in me romantically which I respectfully shut down and he did one of those, ""handles it well in the moment but keeps persisting passively"", type deals and still does. he has started to bring me gifts. An Xbox, things for my cats, pretty decorations for my place, etc. a lot of very thoughtful things. i have made sure to remain grateful, but neutral, and stress that gifts are not an expectation.

now, he has always has boundary issues. more like he will tell me something he thinks I should do (you should move this thing here, or try this, or go to this place) and does not take no for an answer. He tried to get me to go to the gym with him today and asked for HOURS relentlessly. Sometimes it almost feels like a memory issue but idk. anyway.

A few days ago, he asked if we could get some plants for my place. i said ""sure, let's go tomorrow."" He didn't answer, but I assumed he would text me in the morning. I wake up, and he is IN my house, (he had my keypad code from cat sitting for me one weekend), with coffee and breakfast. I was fucking terrified.

Then i check my phone and he said ""I'm coming in hope you don't have anyone over."" Like yeah what if i did? I am single with no roommates but even it just being me is like what the FUCK.

Fast forward to today, he asks to come over bc he lost his job and i need help with some maintenance so i agree. He asks me what I would do if someone broke in. And repeatedly pretends to ""charge"" me. Well, the final time, he grabs me by the neck and chokes me. I didn't lose consciousness, but it hurt and hours later still does. He is sitting next to me rn bc he got too drunk to leave but like idk what to do. He is getting agitated as he is drifting in and out of consciousness bc he can tell i'm being ""off.""

This behavior is completely unacceptable and I know the stats behind putting hands around necks. i need to cut this off, but he has a history of violence and so does his family, even my ex best friend said he can revert back to those tendencies when he's drunk which he is rn. How do I tactfully cut off a friendship with a violent person who literally has my keypad code and has already shown will use it as his convenience?? ty in advance.

1qd84bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/tokyoirl/comments/1qd84bv/lets_read_more_in_2026_starting_a_monthly_book/,Let’s Read More in 2026 — Starting a Monthly Book Club in Tokyo,"Hello! I'm an American with a New Year's resolution of reading at least one book a month this year, and what better way to reach this goal than with others? I’m hoping to gather a small, steady group of around five people in Tokyo who want to read more in 2026.

The book club would be fiction-focused (we’d potentially take turns choosing the book of the month) and would meet once a month to discuss the book and hang out, likely after work on a weekday or on a relaxed weekend at a cafe/coffee shop.

I’d love for this to be a long-term thing, so I’m looking for Tokyo residents only, and folks who can genuinely commit to reading one book a month and showing up. No pressure to be a literary scholar! Just curious minds and decent follow-through. No costs are associated with this group. Just pay for your own book/coffee when we meet up!

Let’s read more in 2026, together! ",2,1768446395.0,tokyoirl,2,1.0,False

Still, I would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.**

**TL;DR:**  
**I’m in a long-distance relationship where I feel I’m putting in much more effort than my boyfriend. He rarely initiates calls, replies late with short messages, and hasn’t kept his promise of regular video calls. This makes me feel emotionally neglected.**

**He had a long, intense relationship with his ex and, although they broke up due to toxicity, they are friends again. The way he talks about her and the fact that she’s close to his family makes me fear he still has unresolved feelings.**

**He recently changed plans and decided to move back to his home city instead of staying near his current city for a PhD, due to visa and financial concerns. This means we’ll be long-distance for at least six more months, and I’m afraid the distance and his ex’s proximity could lead him to leave me for her.**

**I don’t think he’d cheat, but my insecurities are triggered by past experiences with an ex who wasn’t over his exes. I want to know if my fears are reasonable, how to manage my insecurity, and whether this relationship can realistically work.**

COMPLETE BACKGROUND:

Background about my bf: He was born in the same country as me, but has lived in a neighboring country for 10 years. His home city and current city are around 3 hours apart by car. He's currently doing his master's and works two shifts (7–11 a.m. and 6–10 p.m.). He also lives with relatives who rely on him for many errands, so he’s usually busy and tired. He met his ex while visiting his home city and they did long distance for around 4 years. He broke up with her due to toxicity in the relationship 3 years ago and blocked her everywhere. A fewmonths before I met him (this year) she contacted him through a friend and asked him if there was any possibility they could get back together and he refused. After that they became friends and she told him about the issues he had with her partner (I'm not sure if she's still dating this new guy). My bf says he only talks to her if she contacts him first.

About my relationship with my bf: We met late September while I was doing a semester abroad in his country. It started casually and later became official. He treated me well in small ways (like bringing me coffee), and we saw each other about once a week (more frequently toward the end), sometimes staying together until very late. However, there where some issues that where very frustrating to me: cancelling dates last minute,not returning calls, taking too long to respond to my texts, he also never properly asked me to be his gf, he just started introducing me as such and later asked if I was ok with it. I made effort to make sure he felt loved by helping him whenerver I could, but maybe I wasn't doing enough. We dated in person for around 3 months and have been doing long distance for 1 month.

Current situation: Long distance has been hard, sometimes he takes too long to answer texts and if he answers fast it's mostly short replies and I don't always like it when he turns the conversation into something sexual. He promised me we could do videocalls 3 times a week, so far it's been 4 times in the span of 5 weeks and I'm always the one that takes the initiative and ask him to call me. The first time we even had a fight because he didn't call me at the time we agreed and I had to call him and then the call ended abruptly because he ran out of battery. He promised he will take more initiative but hasn't done anything about it.

The issue with his ex: Whenever he talks about his ex iit feels like he still misses her. He has said he’ll never forget her, which I understand, but the way he talks about their past makes me feel like he loved her more than he will ever love me. He had told me that they facetimed and texted a lot, had dates, gave her flowers and he has never done those things for me. I understand he had more free time back then and she lived closer by, but it still makes me feel like he's making excuses for me. One time he posted me on my instagram and he told me she messaged him: ""Is that your new gf?"" and he talked to her about me, which made me feel a little uncomfortable.When I talk about my ex, I only mention behaviors that hurt me and that I don’t want repeated. A few weeks ago I asked him to not talk about his ex because I just keep comparing myself to her.

MAIN ISSUE: He had told me that after graduating this May he was going to move to another city in the same state to do his PhD and work. However, yesterday he told me he canceled those plans and will move back to his home city instead. He said it’s because he’s worried about renewing his permit (he’s not a permanent resident) and about money. This confused me because he’s lived there for 10 years and had been saving to become a permanent resident. I can somehow understand because laws in that country have become more strict regarding foreigners.

MY INSECURITY:I feel very anxious about him suddenly moving back, especially since I won’t graduate until December, meaning we’ll be apart for at least six more months. He has always said I could move with him after graduating, even before changing his plans. I don't think I am going to feel comfortable if his ex contacts him (she still lives in his home city) again, which could happen since she became close to his family. I don't think he will cheat on me but I feel like there is a high chance he could leave me for her because they would be able to have a normal relationship without the distance. He told me that when he was with her, he often asked her to “wait for him,” and it seems like she still wants him back. This triggers me deeply because my previous ex left me because he was never over his first ex and was secretly talking to another ex.

MY QUESTIONS:

Part of me still has hope that things might improve once he moves back to his city and has more time, but I feel very unsure about where this is going. Still, I want to try to make it work.",1,1768446348.0,relationships,7,1.0,False

I finally got him to leave. I gently woke him up and told him another friend was on their way so I needed him to go. He protested a bit, but did leave. I don't even know what to feel. I have been assaulted before, honestly several times, but not like this. My neck is throbbing and already bruising. It hurts to even breathe and this happened hours ago. Thank you for the kind words. I hear you to press charges, I don't disagree. But I moved to get away from an abusive situation and feared retaliation in my old city. I pressed charges on that person and NOTHING happened. So candidly I'm jaded from the system, and scared to have to create another environment where I have to look over my shoulder. Especially bc he has other violent friends that get mad when he's mad. I know it's the logical thing. I just can't even think straight.

I also don't know if I should send him a text expressing he is not to come back so it's documented or leave all communication alone. Idk. I am introvert, I don't go out much. I really try to be discerning with the little company I keep but I completely failed here and failed myself. I'm embarrassed....

I (30f) have a friend (31m) who i met via an ex best friend. she did me super dirty, (did him dirty as well tbh), and we kind of bonded from it. plus, i am new to the city, (she used to live here but no longer does), so having company is nice.

right off the bat, he made it very clear he was interested in me romantically which I respectfully shut down and he did one of those, ""handles it well in the moment but keeps persisting passively"", type deals and still does. he has started to bring me gifts. An Xbox, things for my cats, pretty decorations for my place, etc. a lot of very thoughtful things. i have made sure to remain grateful, but neutral, and stress that gifts are not an expectation.

now, he has always has boundary issues. more like he will tell me something he thinks I should do (you should move this thing here, or try this, or go to this place) and does not take no for an answer. He tried to get me to go to the gym with him today and asked for HOURS relentlessly. Sometimes it almost feels like a memory issue but idk anyway.

A few days ago he asked if we could get some plants for my place, i said sure let's go tomorrow. He didn't answer but I assumed he would text me on the morning. I wake up and he is in my house, (he had my keypad code from cat sitting for me one weekend), with coffee and breakfast. I was fucking terrified.

Then i check my phone and he said ""I'm coming in hope you don't have anyone over."" Like yeah what if i did? I am single with no roommates but even it just being me is like what the FUCK.

Fast forward to today, he asks to come over bc he lost his job and i need help with some maintenance so i agree. He asks me what I would do if someone broke in. And repeatedly pretends to ""charge"" me. Well, the final time, he grabs me by the neck and chokes me. I didn't lose consciousness, but it hurt and hours later still does. He said he was trying to ""teach me how to protect myself."" He is sitting next to me rn bc he got too drunk to leave but like idk what to do. He is getting agitated as he is drifting in and out bc he can tell i'm being ""off.""

This behavior is completely unacceptable and I know the stats behind putting hands around necks. i need to cut this off, but he has a history of violence and so does his family, even my ex best friend said he can revert back to those tendencies when he's drunk which he is rn. How do I tactfully cut off a friendship with a violent person who literally has my keypad code and has already shown will use it as his convenience?? ty in advance.",0,1768446338.0,AITAH,17,0.33,False

Full disclosure, we are not campers or serious outdoorsy people, but we do enjoy casual hikes and beautiful nature. We  are not very athletic but we live in NYC so we do not have concerns with walking.

We both work very stressful jobs and like to relax on vacation, but we are not lay on the beach for a week kind of people. The most adventurous we've probably been a weeklong trip to the White Mountains in NH and Acadia National Park in Maine and we loved it, but we definitely did it at our pace. That being said, this is the itinerary I have come up with. I also like keeping itineraries loose and leaving time open to chill, which I hope I have done! Let me know your thoughts and if it sounds good?

Questions:

1. My husband and I are big foodies. Part of our hesitation going here is that the food doesn't seem to be outstanding, but we've gotten to the point where we have stopped caring about the food because we want to go. That being said, are there any hidden gems worth going to? We don't need fancy food - hole in the walls are fine as long as they are good!
2. Does my schedule seem ok for a slower / relaxation pace? Anything major I am missing? I know Shi Shi Beach - I so desperately wanted to add it but I fear it's beyond what we are willing to do. I'm not concerned about the mileage; I am just concerned about the ruggedness of it and being unprepared. I don't want to get halfway there and regret our decision and have it ruin a day. Will I regret skipping it?
3. Seattle: We are torn between leaving on Friday on a red eye, Saturday during the day, or a Saturday red eye. We have never been to Seattle and though the point of trip is to go to ONP, we know we probably won't be back anytime soon so want to spend some time in Seattle too. The red eye on Friday feels like we would be rushing since we wouldn't even have a full day there, but I absolutely loathe flying during the day from the west coast to the east coast and losing so much time. But I'm also old and getting home on a Sunday morning after a redeye flight will fuck me up for the work week because I'm a baby and can't deal with poor sleep (I can't believe I used to take redeyes on Sunday nights and work on Monday). Which flight would you take?

It all started when I was 16 trading options on Robinhood under my moms name/ account. (I’ve always been a hustler/risk taker but i’m realizing this truly has to stop). When I first traded options I made around 8k with a 1k investment with AMC when it short squeezed and bought myself a nice challenger w that (v6 lol). Long story short I kept trying to replicate that over and over and over again. Either with crypto, sports betting, trading options, actual gambling with bacarrat you name it i’ve done it. But yeah all in all i’m probably down around 40k maybe a bit more. And 25k was given to me by my Dad before he passed  away. I lost it all with crypto 2 years ago (Somehow went down to 3k and ran it all the way back up to 25k and got greedy and lost it all) I know right? But i’m sure some of y’all can relate. I guess my question to you guys is how do you get rid of this nasty addiction? The weird thing is i’m still moving forward in life (not as much as I should have been all things considered) but I should be becoming a nurse in 2-3 more years and I also have a photobooth business and do deliveries for Walmart.

His hands felt weak from holding the receiver; his heart slowed to something resembling normal. Reaching the bed, Jake lay down, the blanket closing around his lonely body. The dim light attracting careless moths reflected in the droplets slowly sliding down his cheek.

Morning arrived like a loop—again with birdsong. His body ached as if after heavy training: sore muscles, dull joints. He got up, walked to the kitchen, and made black coffee with cream. The drink woke him, but also mirrored his emptiness: he looked older than his age, the stubble making him seem worn, as if he had aged several years overnight.

The search had become routine. Many possible paths, but every one led to a dead end. Walking the streets felt like repeating the same equation—same steps, same answers.

The sunlight shifted from white to pink as the city grew quieter. Heavy thoughts dissolved for a moment, but the scars on his arm pulled him back to what had happened. Jake sat on the curb by the labyrinth, looking at the landscape and feeling the dried crust of blood under his fingertips.

Click.

The sound came from the right, echoing off the labyrinth’s walls.
A click — old, rusty shears.

Squinting, Jake saw an elderly man. He was different from the others — alone, a real figure among cardboard townsfolk.
Click — another sprout snapped off and fell.

The gardener, whom Jake had never noticed before, was tall and wiry, wearing round glasses that reflected the world as a flat picture. A dark yellow coverall hung on his frame, his face covered with stubble, thick unkempt mustache and brows. Despite the warm weather, his arms were hidden under a heavy dark sweater pulled down to his wrists.

He worked automatically, movement after movement repeating itself. Jake watched him as the man slowly approached.

A little more than a meter away, the gardener stopped, turned his head, and said:

“Good afternoon. Night is coming quicker now, which means winter is close. Got a cigarette?”

Jake silently pulled one from his pocket and handed it over. The man took it with thin fingers, tore off the filter, and clamped it between his lips.

He thanked him — his voice surprisingly clear for someone smoking straight tobacco.

The gardener sat beside him, calmly drawing in smoke. He didn’t rush, exhaling into the fading light, almost dissolving in it.

The two of them sat together, leaning against the thick foliage, quietly watching the evening advance.

“What’s the meaning of all this?” the man asked.

“All of what?”

“The meaning of existence. Of life. What do you think?”

“I don’t think about that. I have bigger problems.”

“Think about it. Then you’ll find the answers you’re looking for.”

“What do you want me to say? I’m not a philosopher. This stuff doesn’t interest me.”

“I’m not a philosopher either. But you still haven’t thought about it. Try.”

“Just get to the point.”

“The point is meaning. The whole meaning is to live life in happiness.”

“Happiness?”

“A state anyone can reach. Anywhere, whatever they’re doing. Happiness is brief, but you can catch it.”

“I can’t be happy until I find what I’m looking for.”

“And what are you looking for, boy?”

“I lost my love. Lost my girlfriend. And my child.”

“You’re tied down. Bound like with rope. Let go — and it will ease.”

“I can’t. And I won’t. I need to know what happened to her.”

Beckett’s voice followed, lazy and detached. “Keep your mouths shut. As long as none of you run your mouths, Sage Hollis won’t find out.”

One door. That was all that separated me from the man I’d loved for years, and in that thin space my whole life went weightless.

Tears blurred my vision so fast I couldn’t even blink them back.

“Ms. Hollis, I need to confirm,” the woman on the phone said gently. “Once we start, it takes about two weeks. Your legal name change and relocation paperwork goes through, and the people who know you won’t be able to track you down the way they can now.”

They won’t be able to find me again.

Perfect.

I let out a small, bitter breath that almost sounded like a laugh, then forced my voice flat. “I’m sure.”

She paused, then continued, businesslike but kind. “Okay. Your new documents and transition plan will be ready once it’s complete. I hope this gives you a fresh start.”

A fresh start. I wanted to believe in that so badly it hurt.

When I hung up, I stood up too fast, my legs prickling from crouching there so long. I walked out to the curb, flagged a ride, and went home like I wasn’t carrying something broken inside my ribs.

I’d barely finished showering and was about to slide into bed when the door pushed open. The smell of whiskey hit first, then Beckett himself—warm, familiar, confident.

“Wifey,” he slurred, wrapping me up and pressing his face into my neck. “Why didn’t you come pick me up? I kept waiting. I swear, I did. You smell so damn good…”

His hands started roaming, greedy and comfortable, like my body was already his consolation prize.

I stared at the ceiling and let him nuzzle into me, and my mind drifted back to the beginning—the version of him I’d trusted with my whole life.

Beckett Northcott had chased me for three years. He’d brought coffee to places I never told him about, showed up in the rain, looked at me like I was the only woman on the planet.

When his mother tried to shut us down, he’d held me tight, “If my mom won’t let me marry you, then I just won’t get married. We’ll date forever. I’m never marrying anyone but you, Sage. You hear me?”

Then Mrs. Northcott stopped targeting me and dragged him home instead, pushing the Ransom family arrangement like it was a business deal she’d already signed.

When he finally came back to me, he looked wrecked—pale, hollow-eyed. I found out later he’d been refusing to eat, like starving himself was his way of proving he still belonged to me.

After that, no matter what his mother threatened, I didn’t back down, because I believed someone was fighting beside me.

How stupid.

How lucky I was to hear that conversation tonight, because if I hadn’t… how long would he have kept acting?

Until the wedding day? Until someone pointed at me in public and called me the mistress, and I finally understood I’d been set up to take the fall?

I swallowed the ache and gently pried his hands off me. “I’m tired tonight.”

He didn’t push, and somehow that made it worse. He guided me onto the bed like I was delicate, then climbed in behind me and wrapped himself around my back, warm and possessive.

“You’ve been looking thinner,” he murmured, soft with concern. “Get some sleep, okay? I’ve got you.”

I didn’t answer. I let my eyes close and pretended I was already gone.

The next morning, I woke up to him at the closet, changing like nothing in the world had shifted. He heard me move, turned, and came over with that easy confidence of a man who assumes he still owns tomorrow.

Reserved the basic room, $75 US. The upgraded Room offers a small desk, and room for a suitcase.   I cleared customs around 4:30pm.  Unfortunately, you can not check in until 7pm.  They did check me in and hold my luggage.  Went out had a beer and Ramen.  Came back a little after 6.  Hung out in their lounge with free WIFI and a few amenities.   Finally about 6:55pm they let me in.  They split the men and women into two sides.  The room is literally the size of a double bed.  Has a  TV, a lock box and a long shelf.  Very clean and comfortable.  The doors don't lock and are literally roll down doors,  Once I got settled and locked a few things in my box,  I headed to the Onsen. Not my 1st rodeo, do I followed protocol, cleaned up and soaked in the bath.  It was not a hot as other onsen, but it didn't suck. Everything was very clean and well equipped.  After settling back in my tiny spot, clean and relaxed, I crashed and slept like a rock, except for a moment when a drunk guy accidentally opened my door and I yelled at him.  I had an early flight to Akita so I got up 5:30 and had another soak in the Onsen.  This time is was a bit hotter.  Packed up and headed out.  Only to be surprised that the the terminal does not open until 7am.  So I had a cup of coffee and hung out for another 30 min.    Over all it is an excellent option  when international flights arrive too late for your domestic connection.  We usually buy our domestic separately, as it ends up being much cheaper.   I would give it 4 stars out of 5.  For what it is, its great. My big issue was the 7pm open times.  Seems just way too late to me.

We do talk about him a fair bit when we catch up.

For context, when we meet up it’s just her and I. She was a mother at a school I used to work at and I was her son’s teacher.

We have done activities out of work and always get coffee and lunch together.

I realized a little bit ago that the only reason why I was still in the group was because of my friends. Through networking and such I was strongly encouraged to apply for a position in another group, it is a lateral move. I got offered said position and I accepted it earlier today.

My manager is aware and some of the people that I networked with too. But I haven’t told my friends yet. I am not expecting any backlash, but my heart is breaking at not being with them every in office day. I will still probably get coffee and lunch with them because most of my new group is in a different location.

My initial instinct was to text them after work, but then I didn’t want to hijack their nights. And now I am wondering if I should just video call them tomorrow, but I feel like I may cry and I don’t want to cry. I also can be awkward and stumble over my words when I have serious or difficult news and I hate it when that happens.

Does anyone have some advice for this?

1qd7mjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1qd7mjf/i_keep_hearing_my_daughter_call_for_me_at_night/,"I keep hearing my daughter call for me at night, but she’s never awake.","
It’s been a long week.
My wife took a trip upstate to visit her parents, and I stayed behind for work. It wasn’t supposed to be a big deal, just a few quiet nights at home with our daughter.

She caught something two days after her mom left. Just a little fever at first, nothing serious. Kids get bugs all the time, right? I told my wife not to worry. I had it under control.

The thing is, the fever never really went away.
 
It’ll break for a few hours, she’ll seem fine, and then it comes back even hotter. She’s been too tired to get out of bed for more than a few minutes at a time. I’ve been camped out on the couch with the baby monitor next to me so I can hear if she wakes up in the middle of the night.

The monitor’s old, one of those bulky ones. The speaker hums from the white noise machine we keep in her room. I keep it on even when I don’t need to, maybe because the sound makes the house feel less empty.

The first time I heard her whisper, I thought she was calling for water.
It was past midnight. I remember the way her voice crackled through the speaker, tired.

“Daddy…”

I went to her room, but she was fast asleep.
Her lips were dry. Her hair was stuck to her forehead.
I almost woke her to check her temperature, but she looked peaceful for once. So I just stood there, watching her sleep for a moment, and went back to the couch.

I told myself I imagined it. Probably the monitor catching some old feedback, or maybe just my mind replaying her voice from earlier. It has been an exhausting few days for the both of us so that wasn’t out of the question.

That night continued without anymore interruptions.

The next night is when things took a turn for the worse. 

I had put her down to sleep around 8:00 pm. She was run down and exhausted. Body aches, fever, and a headache. I had been giving her medicine throughout the day and it seemed to only have a slight impact on her. In my mind the only thing that was going to help was rest and lots of it. 

She was asleep not 5 minutes after I put her in the crib. My nightly routine didn’t change. I grabbed the pillows and blankets from my bed and headed to the couch to be closer to her room in case she needed me. I plugged the baby monitor in and began to drift off to sleep.

I shot up. My daughter was yelling for me.

“Daddy! Come get me!”

“I’m coming baby!” I yelled loud enough for her to hear.

I made my way down the hallway to her bedroom. I swung the door open. Only to find her sleeping. Motionless. I stood there confused. I couldn’t have imagined this again. I stepped into the room. Only the sound of her soft breathing and the white noise machine. I stepped closer to her crib. There she was sleeping, not moving, not coughing, nothing. I didn’t want to wake her but I was shaken. This was weird, scary if I’m being honest. I heard her calling me. I know I did. This wasn’t exhaustion.

I returned to the living room, confused and worried. Was she talking in her sleep? Was she just seeing if I was nearby? I wasn’t sure of what was going on but I was starting to get worried. I felt fine but maybe I was getting sick. I did feel a little warm but had no other symptoms. 

I swear just as I was drifting off to sleep. 

“Daddy, I don’t feel good.”

I didn’t answer, I just ran, straight to her room. Nearly ripping the door off the hinges as I opened it.

Sleeping. She was sleeping. I couldn’t believe it. She had to be talking in her sleep. Maybe her fever had gotten worse. I stepped closer, this time determined to figure out what was going on. I reached into her crib to feel her forehead.

I recoiled the moment my hand touched her. Intense heat radiated from her forehead. My hand hurt. In awe I looked at my palm. A burn mark. 

My daughter was producing enough heat to burn my hand.

Part 2

My daughter needed to go to the hospital. She needed help, more than I can provide.

I grabbed a few towels and rushed back to her room. I scooped her up and brought her to the car. I drove faster than I should but I needed to get her there.

I ran through the emergency room doors and straight to the check in counter.

“Help me please! My daughter she’s burning up!” 

I explained the situation the best I could. The worry on my face mixed with the details of the situation must have struck a chord with the nurses because they escorted us to a room right away. I placed my daughter on the bed. Through all of this chaos she was still asleep. After asking a few more questions and connecting an IV the nurse left and told me the doctor would be in as soon as possible.

I grabbed a chair and sat right next to her bed. She began to move and stir awake. 

A scream louder than I ever heard erupted from my daughter. Her back arched and vocal cords began to fry. 

I jumped to my feet. My ears were ringing from the volume of the scream. I could have sworn they began to bleed.

“BABY! BABY! WHATS HAPPENING! TELL DADDY!”

The scream continued.

I ran into the hallway searching for a doctor, a nurse, anyone that could help. No one nearby. I rounded the corner and saw a nurse behind a desk.

“HELP ME PLEASE! MY DAUGHTER, SHES SCREAMING! SOMETHING IS WRONG!”

The nurse paged for a doctor to my daughter’s room and followed me back.

When we walked in there was my daughter. 

Asleep.

The nurse walked to her bedside. And felt her forehead. She said she was warm to the touch but not extraordinarily hot.

My daughter’s eyes began to flutter open.

“Daddy? Where are we?”

Tears began to well in my eyes. “We are at the hospital honey. Something is wrong and these nice nurses and doctors are going to help us.”

The doctor came in about fifteen minutes later, clipboard in hand and calm in that practiced, detached way that only doctors can manage.
He asked questions, ran through the motions. Bloodwork, vitals, a scan.

When it was all done, he smiled.
“Good news. Everything looks perfectly normal.”

I stared at him. “Normal? Her temperature was through the roof. She was screaming, you didn’t hear it?”

He shook his head. “She’s stable now. Fevers can spike and drop rapidly in children, especially if they’re fighting something off.”

I wanted to believe him, but the words didn’t make sense. I held up my hand.
“Then how do you explain this?”

He leaned in.
There was nothing there.

No redness. No blister. No mark at all.

My voice cracked. “It burned me. I swear to God.”
He gave me that polite, cautious look. The kind that says we’ve seen this before.

I felt weak. My legs began to shake. I was going to pass out. The doctor grabbed a chair and told me to have a seat. They brought me water and did their best to calm me. It didn’t work at first but eventually I regained the little strength I had left.

They discharged us a few hours later.

The drive home was silent except for the hum of the tires on wet pavement.
Every so often, I glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was asleep again, face calm, breathing soft.
I wanted to feel relief.
Instead, all I felt was dread.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was almost dawn.

I carried her inside, tucked her into bed, and turned to find my wife standing in the doorway.

Her eyes were red. Not from crying, but from exhaustion. Like she hadn’t slept in days.

She kissed our daughter on the head and I brought her to her room. I grabbed the baby monitor and headed back to my wife.

We hugged for what felt like forever.

Then she stepped back.

“Sit down,” she said quietly.
“We need to talk.”

Part 3


I sat on the couch, still in the same clothes I’d driven to the hospital in. My hands were trembling. Not from fear, at least not exactly. From confusion. Exhaustion.

My wife sat across from me, elbows on her knees, staring at the floor. The house was quiet. Even the hum of the fridge seemed to fade.

She didn’t look angry. She looked… defeated.

“Before I say anything,” she started, “you need to know I believe you.”

That should have helped, but it didn’t. It only made my stomach drop.

“I saw it” I said. “She was burning. And then the screaming”

She nodded slowly. “I know.”

“What do you mean, you know?”

She lifted her eyes to mine. There was no hesitation in her voice, no confusion. Just a terrible kind of calm.

“It happened to me too.”

The words didn’t make sense at first. She must have seen that on my face, because she went on.

“When I was little. Three, maybe four. My mom said I had a fever that wouldn’t break. They took me to the hospital just like you did with her. Ran every test they could think of. Everything came back fine. The next day, I was perfectly healthy.”

She let out a shaky breath. “My mom told me later… I wasn’t the first.”

I frowned. “What do you mean?”

“It happened once before. To my grandmother’s baby sister.” She swallowed hard. “Her mother, my great grandmother was desperate. The doctors couldn’t help. So she went to see someone. An old woman on the edge of town who promised she could save the child.”

My wife’s voice trembled. “There was a ritual. A promise. The fever stopped that night… but something came with it.”

My chest tightened. “Something?”

“My mom always said it was meant to protect us. A spirit that guards the bloodline. But it doesn’t feel like protection.” She looked away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “It feels like it’s waiting for something.”

The room felt colder.

“Waiting for what?” I asked.

She hesitated. When she finally spoke, her voice cracked.

“For the next one.”

Her words hung in the air. I waited for her to explain, but she didn’t. She just stared past me, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there.

“The next what?” I asked. My throat felt tight.

I frowned. “You mean this thing, this… spirit, it’s going after her?”

She didn’t answer.

“I need you to tell me the truth” I said, leaning forward. “Is she in danger?”

That got her attention. She blinked, looked at me, and finally said, “She’s not in danger. Not yet.”

“Not yet?”

“My mom used to say the spirit watches the bloodline. It doesn’t hurt the ones it chooses, it marks them. The fever is how it starts.”

I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. “Marks them for what?”

She shook her head. “I don’t know. My mother didn’t either. She said her grandmother refused to talk about it. All she ever said was that the child always survives but something else doesn’t.”

The room felt smaller. Heavy.

“What do you mean something else doesn’t?”

She looked down at her hands. Her fingers were trembling. “There’s always a cost. My great-grandmother’s baby survived… but her husband didn’t. … I survived. My father passed not long after.”

The silence that followed was unbearable.

“She said it was protecting the bloodline” I murmured, more to myself than her. “So why does it feel like it’s punishing us?”

My wife didn’t answer. She just stared at the baby monitor on the coffee table. The faint static hummed through the speaker.

Then, from somewhere deep in the white noise, came a soft, broken whisper.

“Daddy…”

But this time, it wasn’t our daughter’s voice.

My wife’s head snapped toward the sound. Her face went white.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

She nodded, but didn’t move. Her eyes glistened like she was remembering something she didn’t want to.

Neither of us wanted to believe it.

The voice came again, faint and broken.
“Daddy come in here”

She stood, but not out of curiosity. Out of fear. Her movements were slow, hesitant.

“Don’t” I said.

But she was already walking down the hallway.

She stopped at the doorway to our daughter’s room.

The light from the night light spilled out into the hall. Our daughter lay still, her breathing calm.

My wife whispered, “She’s going to be fine…”

Her voice cracked on the last word, like she was trying to convince herself of it.

I stepped beside her. 

We both just stared at the crib. The monitor in her hand hissed softly.

Then, through the speaker, so faint I almost missed it, came a voice.

Not my daughter’s.
Not my wife’s.

A whisper, cold and close:
“She is.”

The monitor went silent.

For a long moment, neither of us moved.

My wife’s hand found mine, trembling. Her eyes never left the screen.

And then, barely louder than a breath, she said,
“It’s already chosen.”

Something in me just… snapped. Instinct. Panic. Love. I don’t know.

I rushed past her and scooped our daughter into my arms. Her skin was burning again. Hotter than before. Her head rolled back and a hoarse scream tore from her throat.

“Help me!” I yelled. “Do something!”

But my wife just shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “You can’t stop it.”

My daughter convulsed. Her hands clawed at my shirt, her little fingers digging into my wrist.
That’s when it happened.

The pain.

It was like fire under my skin. It started where she grabbed me and crawled up my arm, slow and deliberate. I tried to pull away, but she held on tight, impossibly strong for someone so small.

Her eyes snapped open.

For one horrible moment, they weren’t her eyes at all. They were black, deep and endless, reflecting nothing.

Then she gasped.

“Daddy?”

Her voice was small again. Familiar.

The burning stopped.

She blinked, dazed, then looked toward the doorway. “Mommy? You’re home!” she said softly, a smile spreading across her face. “I missed you.”

My wife dropped to her knees, sobbing, clutching her to her chest.

“She’s okay” she kept whispering. “She’s okay.”

But she wasn’t looking at me.

I stumbled backward, clutching my wrist. The skin was blistered and red, the veins beneath it glowing faintly, pulsing like they were alive.

Every heartbeat felt wrong. Slower. Hotter.

Something was moving inside me.



My daughter is sleeping soundly again.

My wife is sitting beside her, humming the same lullaby she used to sing when she was a baby. There’s relief in her eyes, but she won’t look at me.

Maybe she already knows.

My hand won’t stop shaking. The burn has spread up my arm, moving towards my chest. Every pulse feels heavier, slower, like my heart’s fighting something it can’t win against.

It doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s the worst part. The pain’s gone but the warmth stayed.

Something’s alive inside me. Breathing. Waiting.

Our daughter is fine now. Her fever’s gone.
Mine’s just beginning.

Whatever saved our daughter didn’t leave.

It just found a new place to live.

Banks flag transfers from crypto wallets, apps like Revolut throttle high-volume moves during market swings, and exchanges pile on fees or delays that make daily life feel impossible. As an Eastern European freelancer who's been paid in USDT and ETH from web3 projects for the past six months, I've tested various flows to make crypto income behave like a standard bank account—with reliable SEPA transfers and a virtual card—while dodging endless compliance checks.​

The real hurdle lies in converting irregular crypto payments into usable EUR that works seamlessly with European vendors, landlords, or utility providers. Services like Wise can take two to five days for transfers and often pause larger amounts over €5,000 weekly for reviews. Revolut handles smaller transactions fine but restricts bigger ones and sometimes locks accounts tied to crypto sources. Options such as Wirex or Trastra provide partial crypto integration, yet their SEPA processing times and IBAN consistency break down with consistent use. My working routine now involves swapping incoming USDT directly into an EUR balance, which supports a personal IBAN for near-instant SEPA transfers—typically under a minute to any EU bank—and a virtual card for routine expenses from coffee to groceries. Keytom joined this process after trying alternatives, offering consistent performance with total fees around 0.7 percent and monthly limits starting at €20k that match my needs. It manages the transition without fiat custody concerns, turning weekly client payments into something as straightforward as direct deposit.

Now I handle rent in one city and shopping in another without friction, backed by clean transaction records for any oversight. No more app-switching or justifying sources to wary support.

At my routine 32 week appointment this morning, doctor was concerned about how LO's heart sounded on the doppler so had me monitored for the next hour in office. She initially said ""it almost sounds like a kind of arrhythmia"" - his HR was like switching rhythms every 30 seconds or so, hanging out in the 160s-180s for a little bit then would sort of skip a beat and drop suddenly to 80s-90s for a similar amount of time, then switch back. Constantly, for a full hour. *(Important to note my initial appointment was first thing in the morning - I'd only had water to drink, no caffeine! Though I have been indulging daily in coffee and/or diet coke, probably not past 200mg very often).* She consulted with another doctor, then another, then they called MFM, and then they sent me to the hospital for monitoring and ultrasound. At the hospital, the ultrasound really just ruled out hydrops (PHEW). He's measuring ahead, more like 34 weeks in terms of size, and his biophysical profile score was 8/8 and he was moving a ton, so they said he seemed well-oxygenated and happy, not acting like he's in distress, but his heart kept doing this weird pattern the whole time. I was having mild contractions - I couldn't even feel them, but apparently there was some correlation between when I'd contract and when his heart rate would dip. 

Hospital ended up sending me home after a few hours, but I'm booked for a fetal echocardiogram tomorrow with a pediatric cardiologist and then will need to meet with MFM. That's about all we have established so far re: ""next steps"" and I'm kind of struggling with how little it seems like we know. I'm just supposed to do kick counts and make sure he keeps moving, and I'm nervous to be separated from the monitors since his weird heart thing didn't resolve and is presumably just continuing to jump up and down :( My father in law is an OBGYN and I called him, and he too was totally stumped. At my 20 and 28 week ultrasounds with MFM (I had a low lying placenta) his heart structures looked functionally fine, so it seems unlikely there's a physical defect. Obviously would be great news to confirm that, but I'm also anxious anticipating it's going to be another appointment where we're just ruling something out but still don't know what's actually going on. If it were SVT his heart rate would be jumping higher than 180 (probably 200-220 as far as I understand it).
