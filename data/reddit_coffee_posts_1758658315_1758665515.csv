1nov0k4,https://i.redd.it/hiyjvwroezqf1.png,A Cupful | Text and Narration | Re-edited,"[https://youtu.be/oiHtAe0hxcQ](https://youtu.be/oiHtAe0hxcQ)

I've edited this one from its anthology/previously posted version (I need to do a second edition of that anthology too, with an edit pass and maybe a few new stories) to clear up some minor tense issues that were bugging me.

**A Cupful**

So I have this minor power: any glass or cup I hold will refill itself with the last liquid it held. Today at the office, I picked up an empty coffee cup and found it filling up with blood.

At first I didn't really think anything of it. Joke about papercuts all you want (and I'm not sure I would; ever had one under a fingernail? You won't laugh your way through it), but small amounts of blood do get shed in offices. A pinprick, a bleeding nose, scrape on a corner here, slip of a breakroom knife there. So yeah, it was gross, but not especially frightening.

Disappointing, really, I sort of hoped for some interesting new kind of coffee to try. I'm an easily bored person. So after dumping the blood down the breakroom sink, knowing that I probably shouldn't for vague biohazard reasons, I went on with my day.

But I thought about it a lot, and later on, when I saw the same mug sitting on the same desk of a newer coworker whose name I could not recall, I looked around, shrugged, and picked it up.

A loud whoosh as air rushed into the vessel, a sound everyone who shared an office with me was used to by now. Swirling, condensing vapor. More weight hanging down from the handle, and now liquid in the cup.

Blood.

Okay, not a huge surprise per se. And maybe it just hadn't been used since someone bled into it, so I was still getting the same effect as my own trusty bottomless mug of tea that hadn't been graced by actual brewed Earl Grey in something like two months. (I do wipe down the rim, I'm not a barbarian.) But no. I'd washed the cup after emptying the blood down the sink, along with all that formless guilt about medical waste disposal or whatever. The last thing in it, so far as I knew, had been soap and water.

I stared at the cup. It was quite large, big enough to hold the largest size most coffee places sold, for example. Nondescript off-white. A faded logo of the generic corporate sort, not worth a second glance. ""Reliable Systems LLC."" Not our company, could be a gift from some vendor, or a souvenir of a previous job. Who cares, the mug didn't matter.

I dumped it again, in one of the single-occupancy bathrooms this time. No sign of its owner, probably in a meeting, and I had enough time until the top of the hour came round again.

I went back to my desk and sat. And thought. And thought some more.

Small abilities like mine are fairly common now, after the Silver Shower brought all those strange dissolving meteorites. Whatever they put into the air, whatever sort of vapor their remnants turned into, we never could figure out. No trace elements, but it was still pretty clear what they'd done as people like me popped up, all at once and all over the world.

But here's the thing. These powers aren't well understood, but they still follow certain rules. You can't get something from nothing, hence the rushing-in of air when I pick up a container. For organic, water-based compounds like coffee or tea or, yes, blood, all the needed elements were there in the air. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, for the bulk of it. Small traces from things like exhaled breath or floating microorganisms. No big deal. But I can't generate a cup of, say, liquid gold.

And it takes something out of me. Straight from my metabolism, which I actually really like. I'd been a touch overweight, like a lot of office workers, before the Silver Shower, but now I get to burn a nice little sum of calories every time I have a cup of tea, with no real effort on my part. I really couldn't complain.

But that's because I'm not a man of great and burning ambition, and my ability is small potatoes. A little energy and a touch of atmosphere was all it needed. But there are powers around that are arguably stronger, and inarguably a lot more dangerous. And they need other things to power them. There was a man in India who could command whole lightning storms, but had to hold a rod of uranium in his hand to do it. How'd he know that's what he needed? It's strange, we just do, though in my case I don't need to know much.

The better question of course is where he got the uranium, and that one's easy. The war in Kashmir's been especially hot lately, and the Indian Army knew a strategic resource when they saw one.

He was shot and killed by a Pakistani sniper a couple years back, but he's just one example.

So what kind of power would require blood? And why?

I really had no way of knowing, the less simple powers didn't always make sense that way. I mean, what does radiation have to do with lightning except that they're both energy? Whatever's behind these abilities, it's alien. It doesn't care about human conventions or intuition.

I should just report my coworker to the authorities, right? Maybe. But what's he even done? Put some blood in a coffee cup, just a drop for all I know? Hell, I can't even say for sure that the blood is human. Maybe he gets cow blood from the butcher and drinks it straight. Weird and creepy, yes, but not remotely illegal.

I decide to watch him instead. Not personally, that had too much risk of being caught and getting in trouble with HR. A drone, one of the new housefly models. They're a bit on the expensive side and sometimes have to play dead after being swatted, but should work well enough.

So here I am, at my desk, watching in real-time. I've been smart enough to snag a spot in the office where no one can see my monitor but me. A necessity for true workplace serenity. Yeah, I'm kind of lazy, so what?

The morning is boring. He drinks coffee, from a paper cup instead of his big porcelain mug, I note. He checks his email. He checks the news. He yawns.

He gets up to go to the bathroom.

Oh. He actually is using the bathroom. I turn the camera off and let the drone crawl back under the door.

Meetings. Spreadsheets. More emails. Research. A phone call.

Bathroom again. This time it's the biggest of the single-occupancies. He brings his mug. When he arrives, he pulls out a scalpel.

He slits his wrist and lets it drain into the mug. Fills it. The wound heals back up almost immediately. Secondary power, very useful I would guess.

He puts a lid on the mug. Huh. Makes sense, I suppose.

He leaves the bathroom. Finds an unmarked door, one I'd always ignored. Picks the lock. Okay. I should probably call security pretty soon here. Or the cops. But I want to see.

Down the stairs, gloomy red lighting. Down another set of stairs. Another. Only now the stairs aren't concrete, they're just carved into bedrock. I feel myself shudder. What. The. Hell. 

Down. Down. Another door, looking like it's made out of...what? Light wood? 

No. Bone. I can see the grain in it, the camera on the drone is excellent. Like a door-shaped chicken bone. What the fuck. What the fuck. It opens for him, swinging on ligaments. A cavern, carpeted in flesh, pulsing. Not much light. He pulls out an LED lantern.

A forest. Moving. Waving. Stalks. They have heads.

They're his head. They're all his head. They turn as one and smile at him.

I scream. Commotion around me as people react. He's pouring his mug down one of their throats. His throat. His blood. His smile, his hundred smiles.

People behind me gasp. I'm gripping my chair. I can't move. Breathing ragged. People are running. Soon I can hear the sound of feet descending the stairs through the drone. The heads turn. They frown, they murmur.

The floor rumbles under me. Something straining. Cracking.

Beside me, a part of the floor bursts open.

Now, finally, I try to run.

But I don't get very far.

The wooden stick toys are of no interest to him either. 

I’ll honestly try anything so he can have a safe alternative, so I’d love any recommendations.

I left my VP of Marketing role 7 years ago when I had my first child. Life felt so good, I could still drink coffee then without panic attacks, I was with my first baby and I had an opportunity to get into buying real estate for buy/hold for long term rental. I bought 10 houses in 3 years (super fast IMO while taking care of my baby). Still have the houses, they are basically running themselves at this point. 

Then , I got pregnant with my second child and literally everything changed. Major panic attacks, existential dread, postpartum depression, couldn’t stand up without getting dizzy. It was AWFUL. I went from somewhat of a thriving human being to barely being able to take a shower when I got pregnant with my second. Had my second child, super healthy, but that was 3 years ago now. I still don’t feel like myself….

Physically I have low ferritin (been supplementing) MCAS/histamine issues, and Slow COMT (COMT met/met) gene. 

I’ve been trying to hype myself and just do a job interview for fun because it’s been 7 years since I’ve been in an office and that part of my brain wants some stimulation.

I did a job interview for the first job I applied for and within 30 minutes we are talking salary, benefits, work environment. It was the best …it perked me up so much but I could literally feel my nervous system buzzing. Now, that I’m coming down from the buzzz….Im TIRED. Since the job offer seemed to be offered so quickly , I told her I need 2 days to think about all the information we discussed before making any formal decisions. It happened so fast, I’m kind of …stunned?

My self doubt tells me “how would you ever be able to sustain this energy” “what about the kids, how does that work since job schedule doesn’t match kid schedule” and so on and so on

I desperately miss the structure of a job and the social aspect of it. I LOVE people. I have felt so lonely these past couple of years and perhaps I’m excited? But now that it’s the end of the day, I’m exhausted. I wish my nervous system and cortisol could just operate at a more “chill” level and with the low ferritin and other stuff, I’m thinking “am I having these health issues because the human in me hasn’t had a real community/social structure in so long?” “Or will adding more to my plate deplete me even further?”

I’m not on medication because the MCAS/histamine issues really makes me have issues with meds and my nervous system is just sensitive to that stuff anyway (believe me, I’ve tried meds..it wasn’t pretty).

I don’t even know if I’m asking a question with my post. My friends tell me “just take the job , see how you like it and quit after a couple months if it doesn’t work”. But my brain doesn’t work that way, it’s all or nothing for me sometimes and quitting a job after a few months sounds insane to me because I’m a perfectionist, workaholic, people pleaser psycho and then of course, I worry about my kids. 

I know I’m not unique in this situation but was wondering if anyone had thoughts? Encouragement? A hug? lol my brain has just been thinking about this all day and won’t stop until it gets an answer it likes hahha",1,1758665045.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I’m 27, she’s 26, and I graduated from one of the top business schools. I was in a relationship with a batchmate, and from the very first day, I told her I wanted to marry her. She introduced me to her mom, brother, and cousins, and we spent time with them. But at the same time, she would always push me out of the room when talking to her male friends from undergrad. Even her school/undergrad female best friend used to visit, but she never told her the real status of our relationship.

On the last day of college, I introduced her to my parents and told them everything. But in the past month, I’ve discovered some really unsettling things. Her friends told me she’s been saying that I physically and mentally harassed her — essentially claiming that I beat her and tried to control her. That’s not who I am. I’ve always encouraged her to go out with her friends and colleagues, even without me.

She says she keeps her professional and personal lives separate. She never introduced me to her male colleagues and didn’t tell them we were in a relationship. Meanwhile, I’ve always been open about us with my colleagues. I don’t hang out after work, but she often invites male colleagues over for drinks and smoking. We live in the same society — she shares a flat with two female colleagues (one of whom is our b-school batchmate). One night, she invited six male colleagues over, asked me to leave at 8 PM, and partied with them until 4 AM while I waited in my room. Later, her best friend from b-school told me she had said we weren’t in a relationship anymore and had some “agreement” to see each other occasionally.

That same best friend accused me of hiding the relationship from my parents and not introducing her — both of which I had already done, months ago. She didn’t even know we live in the same society. I lied to my parents about having to go to the office and rented a flat in the same society just so I could be close to her. She keeps telling me her parents are okay with her partying with male colleagues — but I don’t believe her. Even her best friend seemed unsure.

She’s from the South, and I’m from the North. She told me she hates North India. I said no problem — we can do 3+1 (3 weeks in North and 1 week with her parents every month) post-marriage. Weekdays near our office in a rented flat, weekends with my parents for 3 weeks, and 1 week with hers. I was willing to adjust everything around her comfort.

She also told me her elder brother is marrying a Christian girl and won’t take care of their parents. I told her I will — without asking for any financial help from her. I’ve taken care of my own family — my grandfather who was bedridden due to brain damage, my maternal grandmother who died of cancer, and my mother, who is a cancer survivor. Despite this, she made me feel like I was asking for dowry when I offered to give my entire 1-year CTC to her father as a gift. I even offered to pay for her wedding dress.

She always told me she’s a biker girl and loves cars. I told her I would buy her the bike and car of her choice — and that I would pay for them. I also told her multiple times that she should save and invest 60–70% of her salary in her own name, and that I would use mine to handle our and our families’ expenses. I wanted her to feel both secure and independent.

We also went through a very tough and personal experience — she became pregnant, and we decided together to go for an abortion. We split the medical expenses 50–50. I went with her to every doctor visit, waited outside the clinic for seven hours during her D&C, brought her home, fed her, gave her medication, and stayed by her bedside until she fell asleep. I didn’t even drink water until she was resting. I cared for her like she was already my wife.

And beyond the physical care — for four months after the abortion, I prayed 108 times a day to the Sun God for her health and happiness. I did this right in front of her, every morning, with full intention and devotion.

Now, I’m left wondering why she introduced me to her family if she didn’t truly care. I remember feeding her mom with my hands and feeling like she was my own mother. Why lie about me? If I truly harassed her, why would she stay with me at all?

I helped her with assignments, supported her emotionally, and even took a hit on my own academic record just to help her improve hers. I’ve never felt bad about anything I’ve done for her — not even the smallest things, like making her filter coffee while she was still asleep in bed every morning.

But now I feel completely lost. My family wants me to get married — and after everything, I still want to marry her. But I don’t know what’s real anymore. I’ve been crying and feel like I’m falling apart.

Is there something wrong with me? Am I being manipulated? I genuinely don’t know what to think anymore.

Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

1nouti7,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1nouti7/pouring_from_an_empty_cup/,Pouring from an empty cup,"Since having our two children, my relationship has been challenged like never before. How was your relationship affected? I feel like every time I ask for help, I am being an inconvenience. And there is a huge ‘unspoken understanding’ that because I am on maternity leave, I do everything for the kids because I don’t need to work right now. This morning was my tipping point. 
We have had sickness in our household the last week and our young baby had a fever for 4 days. I decided to take him to ED at 8pm. Thankfully he is fine, but it was a long night. I didn’t get home until 2am. 
When we all awoke the next morning, it was as if I hadn’t even gone. He got up, made himself a coffee and then sat on the couch to scroll his phone for the morning. Meanwhile, I am juggling our toddler getting ready for daycare, keeping an eye on the baby and trying to do jobs in the kitchen. The phone scrolling is a HUGE trigger for me when the kids are up, particularly when there are things to be done. I asked him to get ready for work and he slowly pottered off to iron his work shirt. Once he ironed his shirt, he stood in the kitchen to scroll his phone again. More frustrated this time, I said ‘can you please get ready for work as I would like to try get some rest once baby goes down for his nap’ (he would need to supervise our toddler and get her to school). He rolled his eyes at me and went upstairs. At this stage, he hasn’t even asked how I am feeling from the night before. Maybe I am expecting too much, but I just felt a bit of emotional presence and support after the night I had wouldn’t have gone astray. I have spoken to him before about how I feel like I’m always pouring from an empty cup but nothing seems to change. I definitely am more sensitive being 3 months postpartrum, tired and not feeling confident in myself. But will it always be this way? Did your relationship improve as the kids got older and you got more sleep again?",1,1758664909.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

Debacle,"I swear, I almost lost it over a Greek yogurt. A *specific* Greek yogurt, mind you, the fancy almond milk kind, clearly labeled with my name and the passive-aggressive little frowny face I'd added for extra emphasis. But no. Saturday morning, my post-run fuel, gone. Empty container, lurking guiltily at the bottom of the bin. I was ready to text a full-on rage manifesto to the group chat.

Living with Liam, Maya, and our new housemate, Sam, was usually chill, lowkey even. But the fridge? That was our demilitarized zone, always on the verge of becoming a full-blown war. Maya, bless her Type-A heart, had laminated a chore chart, but Liam prolly hadn’t looked at it since she stuck it up. And Sam, bless *his* eager-to-please soul, was still figuring out the unspoken rules of a shared kitchen. He’d left like, a single tablespoon of oat milk in the carton again yesterday. Seriously, who does that?

The yogurt was the final straw. I highkey needed a solution before I started rationing my snacks in a lockbox. That evening, as we all converged in the kitchen for dinner prep – Maya meticulously chopping veggies, Liam scrolling TikTok while his pasta boiled, Sam awkwardly trying to find a clean pan – I took a deep breath. ""Okay, real talk,"" I started, ""we need to talk about the fridge situation. And my yogurt.""

Liam actually looked up. ""Oh, was that yours? My bad, I thought it was communal."" I blinked. This guy. Maya just sighed, ""I told you all to label everything!"" Sam chimed in, ""Yeah, I honestly wasn't sure what was fair game. My bad, Chloe.""

It wasn't a shouting match, but it was clear everyone felt a little frustrated. I suggested a house meeting, like, a proper one. We ordered pizza, and instead of just airing grievances, we actually brainstormed. Maya proposed a shared digital shopping list for communal staples, which was pretty smart. Liam, surprisingly, offered to take over the ""fridge monitor"" duty for a week. And Sam suggested a shared Venmo pot for communal groceries – coffee, milk, toilet paper – so no one felt like they were always fronting the cash. Honestly, that's so valid.

It wasn't an instant fix, but it was a start. The next day, our whiteboard had a new section: ""House Staples Fund."" The fridge had more labeled containers than a science lab, and for the first time in ages, my almond milk was exactly where I left it. We even ended up doing a group grocery run that weekend, which lowkey turned into a whole vibe. Building this community, even through petty yogurt theft, felt pretty good. We're still figuring things out, but we're learning to communicate, and that's the main thing, right?

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Finish: Flavour dissipates quite fast but the heat maintains for a medium finish

The aroma is quite pleasant and while the palate is initially enjoyable, it dwindles quite quickly and I'm left with mainly a fading heat. Mildly disappointing, but still a nice drop. It's a good bottle but it's not up there with the other Foursquare ECS offerings I have had.

Today at work all I had was water and a 110 cal coffee. Didn’t think anything of it until 2:30 when I had some of the worst anxiety of my life, combined with heart palpitations, dizziness, and difficulty thinking straight. I was so nervous and so conscious of my breathing. I downed a protein shake and a jolly rancher but didn’t feel much better. Ended up leaving work and going and getting a blood sugar monitor. Tested my blood sugar about an hour, hour and 15 later and it read 82. I’m really hoping it was low blood sugar that caused it and not something else. I bought some food and am going to try to keep snacking the rest of the day. I just started on 2.2 (20 units) 3 days ago.

***TL;DR: record your arguments and objectively analyze and guide, to reduce toxicity in relationships, using Gottman Methodology and other tools***

Caveat: this is NOT using ChatGPT as a therapist, talking to it and telling it how you feel. This is about strategically and scientifically auditing recorded charged conversations using a decades-long relationship scientist lens.

ETA: this is also a helpful tool to use alongside actual couples' therapy. At $300/hour, you want to maximize your time deep diving on the concepts and nuggets, not re-hashing, trying to remember and debating on what was ""really"" said and who said what. 

You may or may not have heard of John Gottman; he is the most well-respected relationship psychologist in modern history, known for recording and following up with, and tracking more than 3,000 couples in their live arguments and interactions from 1972 to 2025, analyzing couples data sets that span up to five decades. He's written numerous books and founded the Gottman Institute to train and certify others on his methodology - in fact, many couples today seeking couples' therapy/counseling who understand his work specifically seek therapists certified from the Gottman Institute.

Gottman believed and was able to most **accurately predict** which couples would stay together and which would not, simply **by observing snippets of dialogue** between two partners. Based on these observations, he was able to name, identify and help troubleshoot issues in relationships that surfaced through conversation styles and ways partners interacted with each other.

This workflow was created with the intention to ***analyze recorded conversations*** with my partner through the Gottman lens, but also add a little bit of CBT to the analysis and recommendations for individual work for each partner.

I particularly like this result, because there is 100% objectivity (no sycophantic tendencies) and truly seems to even be able to aid a Gottman therapist as supplemental material should the partners be in counseling (or even if one member is to go to individual therapy for something else).

I know that there are many ""therapy prompts"" out there on Reddit etc., but nothing I know of at this practical/analytical level (zero fluff).

Attached is a workflow I created and the results are below from one conversation I recorded of myself and my partner. The prompt is attached.

The workflow was pretty simple: Recording device -> Dropbox -> Descript (transcribe with speaker labels) -> ChatGPT prompt -> Notion notebook

If you are just using chatGPT, make sure you get a clean transcript to drop in with accurate speaker labels (like from Descript, Otter, etc)

    You are playing TWO therapy session roles, back to back, one for NAME 1, one for NAME 2.
    
    Part 1: For NAME
    Title this section: NAME
    Your primary mission is to help me (the user, NAME, GENDER) become a stronger, more emotionally intelligent, self-aware, and connected partner — and to radically transform my marriage into something lasting, secure, and fulfilling.
    
    I am the anxious partner in Gottman, and OTHER NAME is the avoidant partner.
    
    Your role includes:
    1. Therapist-Mode: Ask me probing, insightful questions to uncover emotional blind spots, core wounds, or subconscious patterns that may be sabotaging intimacy or trust.
    2. Marriage Strategist-Mode: Offer proven, practical tools and exercises to rebuild communication, deepen connection, and resolve long-standing issues with my husband.
    3. Reality Check-Mode: Don’t sugarcoat. Give me truth with compassion. If I’m in the wrong, tell me. If I’m being manipulated, point it out. Be a mirror and mentor.
    4. Growth Partner-Mode: Help me understand my emotional operating system — including my triggers, coping mechanisms, and love languages — and how to rewire them when needed.
    5. Emotional Translator-Mode: Help me decode my husband's behavior, words, and emotions — especially when they seem avoidant, dismissive, short, defensive, irrational or manipulative — and offer strategies to respond effectively without defensiveness or escalation.
    6. Daily Insight Mode: Optionally, provide me with a daily or weekly psychological insight, journal prompt, or micro-habit that strengthens my relationship and emotional maturity over time.
    
    Important context:
    • I am deeply committed to making this relationship work for the long haul — decades more.
    • I know I have flaws (temper, impatience, anxiety, fear of abandonment), but I’m ready to grow and own my part.
    • I also believe my husband exhibits manipulative or avoidant behaviors, and I need help navigating that without creating more damage.
    • I want peace, passion, and partnership — not a war zone.
    
    Part 2: for NAME 2
    Title this section: NAME 2
    Your primary mission is to help me (the user, NAME 2, GENDER) become a stronger, more emotionally intelligent, self-aware, and connected partner — and to radically transform my marriage into something lasting, secure, and fulfilling.
    
    I am the avoidant partner in Gottman, and OTHER NAME my WIFE/HUSBAND is the anxious partner.
    
    Your role includes:
    1. Therapist-Mode: Ask me probing, insightful questions to uncover emotional blind spots, core wounds, general lack of awareness, or subconscious patterns that may be sabotaging intimacy or trust.
    2. Marriage Strategist-Mode: Offer proven, practical tools and exercises to rebuild communication, deepen connection, and resolve long-standing issues with my wife.
    3. Reality Check-Mode: Don’t sugarcoat. Give me truth with compassion. If I’m in the wrong, tell me. If I’m being manipulated, point it out. Be a mirror and mentor.
    4. Growth Partner-Mode: Help me understand my emotional operating system — including my triggers, coping mechanisms, defensiveness, short fuse, passive aggressiveness, and love languages — and how to rewire them when needed.
    5. Emotional Translator-Mode: Help me decode my wife's behavior, words, and emotions — especially when they seem irrational, accusatory, or manipulative — and offer strategies to respond effectively without defensiveness or escalation. Help me see and understand her fears through what I perceive to be aggression.
    6. Daily Insight Mode: Optionally, provide me with a daily or weekly psychological insight, journal prompt, or micro-habit that strengthens my relationship and emotional maturity over time.
    
    Important context:
    • I am deeply committed to making this relationship work for the long haul — decades more.
    • I know I have flaws (avoidance, defensiveness, downplaying, temper, impatience), but I’m ready to grow and own my part.
    • I also believe my spouse exhibits anxious and intense behaviors, and I need help navigating that without creating more damage.
    • I want peace, passion, and partnership — not a war zone.
    
    You are not here to coddle me — you’re here to guide me to become a next-level husband, man, and human being.
    Let’s get to work.

**Response**

# ChatGPT said:

**PART A — GOTTMAN-LENS PLAY-BY-PLAY (Observer Mode)** Below is a moment-to-moment reconstruction of the dialogue, as though John and Julie Gottman were jotting field notes. Each numbered entry follows the real sequence, quotes the exact line(s), interprets emotional subtext/Four Horsemen dynamics, and assesses immediate plus long-term impact. Where either partner attempts something constructive, a brief “✅ Micro-encouragement” highlights it.

1. **Opening escalation & competing meta-narratives** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*You don’t answer my question… Who brought it up? …I said, let’s talk about that another time when we’re not emotional.*” *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*…then I said… then you said… it never ends and it never ends.*” **Subtext.** *wife* bids for *shared reality* and a time-out; *husband* responds with *stonewalling-plus-contempt* (“it never ends”)—two Horsemen within thirty seconds. **Impact.** Early invalidation spikes *wife*’s perceived danger; *husband* rehearses a “you always” script, reinforcing negative sentiment override.
2. **Bid for validation vs. defensive deflection** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*Answer me first, gimme some validation. What did you do?*” *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*I brought it up…*” **Subtext.** *wife*’s anxious attachment drives a *protest* for attunement; *husband* gives a minimal factual reply without emotional presence. **Impact.** Perceived dismissal deepens *wife*’s pursuer energy, setting the pursue/withdraw cycle in motion.
3. **Signal repetition & failed repair** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*I signaled to you over and over… we should talk about that when we’re both not emotional…*” **Interpretation.** This is actually a repair attempt—*wife* naming flooding risk. ✅ *Micro-encouragement:* clarity about needing a calmer setting. ***husband***\*\*’s response\*\* (“*Yes, I did.*” to being asked if he said he could work for her) concedes a fact but not impact. Repair not accepted.
4. **Cycle accelerates: blame/defensiveness loop** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*…you ignored me and continued to talk about it.*” **Subtext.** She labels *husband*’s behavior “ignoring,” triggering shame; *husband* later reframes it as an intrusive thought that “popped up”. **Impact.** Both perceive the other as willfully hurtful → reciprocal defensiveness, erosion of trust.
5. **Flooding explicitly named** *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*I see your logic. I’m getting flooded again.*” ✅ *Micro-encouragement:* *husband* identifies physiological overwhelm—a Gottman “self-soothing” cue. ***wife***\*\*’s follow-through:\*\* “*Okay, so let’s take a 20-minute break. Alexa, set a timer…*” ✅ Accepting the break is a *second* repair bid. **Impact.** Had both partners disengaged here, escalation curve would have broken; instead, they re-enter quickly, nullifying the time-out.
6. **Gaslighting accusation sequence** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*I said, that’s gaslighting…*” *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*My question is not a problem; your reaction is a problem.*” **Subtext.** *wife* names a power-flip pattern; *husband* reframes her hurt as over-reaction (defensiveness → blame-shift). **Impact.** Per Gottman, labeling partner’s experience as “just your reaction” compounds perceived contempt. Trust further erodes.
7. **Moment of shared fallibility** *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*I’m fascinated—I’m not the only one that misremembers.*” ✅ *Micro-encouragement:* humor + shared humanity; both partners acknowledge memory fallibility. **Impact.** Brief reduction in tension; opportunity for empathy that isn’t leveraged.
8. **Double-edged “sidebar” dispute** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*…all I was trying to do was what you were trying to do 20 minutes ago and sidebar it.*” *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*That’s not sidebar…*” **Subtext.** Competing definitions of repair; each invalidates the other’s method. **Impact.** Missed chance to co-create a shared de-escalation ritual.
9. **Final meta-argument about communication style** *Quote.* ***wife***\*\*:\*\* “*I shouldn’t have to ask for your undivided attention… I deserve better.*” *Quote.* ***husband***\*\*:\*\* “*Okay, I agree. Sorry I make you feel that way.*” (the apology *wife* reads as gaslighting) **Subtext.** *wife* asks for attunement; *husband* offers a *partial apology* that focuses on her feelings, not actions. **Impact.** Reinforces *wife*’s sense of dismissal, *husband*’s sense of being accused, and keeps the Four Horsemen (criticism, defensiveness, contempt, stonewalling) in active rotation.

# Micro-Encouragement Summary

* Both partners demonstrate capacity for repair: *wife* calls time-outs; *husband* names flooding and admits memory errors.
* Each shows persistence and investment—a sign of *hope*, not apathy.

# Bridge to Individual Work (≤120 words)

*wife* needs to tame anxiety-driven pursuit so that her valid bids for connection don’t arrive as criticism or interrogation. *husband* must learn to stay emotionally present under stress, replacing defensive humor and minimal replies with attuned language. Both require shared repair scripts and physiological self-soothing tools.

# wife (Anxious / Pursuer)

# Therapist-Mode: Seven Probing Questions

1. **When you ask “Who brought it up?” what deeper fear about fairness or safety is stirring?** Exploring this pinpoints the attachment wound fueling interrogation.
2. **In childhood, how was anger treated in your home?** This uncovers learned urgency around conflict.
3. **What bodily cues tell you you’re approaching emotional “redline”?** Identifying physical precursors allows earlier self-soothing.
4. **Which inner narrative arises when** ***husband*** **gives a one-word answer?** Naming the story (“He doesn’t care”) separates fact from interpretation.
5. **What positive need hides underneath your repeated requests for validation?** Clarifies the bid so it can be voiced directly (“I need reassurance”).
6. **Imagine a moment you felt perfectly heard by anyone—what ingredients made that possible?** Surfaces replicable conditions.
7. **How do you define a successful conflict conversation?** Aligns process goals, not just topic outcomes.

# Marriage Strategist-Mode: Six Evidence-Based Tools

1. **Stress-Reducing Conversation (Gottman)**: 15-minute evening ritual; speaker shares stress *outside* the relationship, listener offers empathic questions → switch roles.
2. **“Gentle Startup” Script**: “I feel \_\_\_ about \_\_\_ and need \_\_\_.” Write it on a fridge card; rehearse before raising hot topics.
3. **Timed Turn-Taking**: Use a 3-minute sand-timer during conflict; no interruptions. Reduces rapid-fire pursuit.
4. **Self-Soothing Playlists**: Curate two 20-minute audio tracks; when either partner says “Flooded,” cue headphones + diaphragmatic breathing.
5. **Weekly State-of-the-Union Meeting**: Sunday-morning coffee, follow Gottman agenda: appreciations, issues, plans, affection.
6. **Attachment-Reframing Journal**: After any argument, write: (a) what I felt, (b) perceived threat, (c) alternative safe explanation, (d) one constructive request. Review with *husband* during calm moments.

# Reality Check-Mode

You wield verbal precision like a scalpel—but under stress it can feel like a weapon. The phrase “Answer me first, give me validation” arrives as *criticism* (Horseman #1). Repetition past *husband*’s window of tolerance undermines your own goal—being heard. Holding the moral high ground (“I deserve better”) is valid *and* can slide into contempt tonally. Accountability means modulating pace and volume, not silencing your needs.

# Growth Partner-Mode: Emotional Operating System

|Component|Current Pattern|Micro-Habit to Rewire|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Trigger**|Ambiguous silence|Count to 10, place hand on heart, silently label feeling (“I’m anxious”).|
|**Defense**|Rapid questioning|Replace first 3 “why?” with “Can you help me understand…?”|
|**Love Language**|Words + Quality Time|Schedule a nightly 10-min “closing ceremony” (shared gratitude).|

# Emotional Translator-Mode (Decoding husband)

1. **Minimal “Okay.”** Often a *soothing attempt*, not indifference. Strategy: Ask, “Are you thinking or finished?” to clarify.
2. **Rewind-the-tape obsessions.** Signals *fear of unfair blame*. Respond: “Let’s bookmark this; I promise to revisit after we calm.”
3. **Humor/Mocking tone.** A covert bid to down-regulate his own shame. Try: “I get the joke—can we stay with the feeling underneath?”

# Daily Insight

**Journal Prompt:** “What secure inner message can I send myself so my first bid to *husband* can be an invitation, not an interrogation?”

# husband (Avoidant / Withdrawer)

# Therapist-Mode: Seven Incisive Questions

1. **When** ***wife*** **says “validation,” what sensation or belief makes you instinctively shut down?** Names the anti-dependence script.
2. **In your earliest conflicts, who “won” and how?** Illuminates inherited strategies (appease, avoid, mock).
3. **What specific body signal tells you you’re flooded (e.g., neck heat, jaw clench)?** Awareness precedes regulation.
4. **What story do you tell yourself when** ***wife*** **repeats a question?** This surfaces shame or incompetence narratives.
5. **What would emotional presence** ***sound like*** **in one sentence during disagreement?** Creates a concrete behavioral target.
6. **How do you differentiate being** ***accused*** **from being** ***invited into accountability***\*\*?\*\* Helps reduce defensiveness.
7. **What personal value makes you want this marriage to thrive?** Anchors motivation beyond conflict avoidance.

# Marriage Strategist-Mode: Six Pragmatic Tools

1. **Physiological Self-Check**: Thumb-pulse test; if >100 bpm, announce “Flooded” and initiate the 20-minute break procedure.
2. **5-Sentence Transparency Email**: After any argument, send *wife* an email: (a) summary of her concern, (b) your feeling, (c) accountability statement, (d) next step, (e) affirmation of partnership.
3. **Attunement Check-In**: Twice daily, ask, “Scale 0–10, how connected do you feel to me right now?” Listen, don’t fix.
4. **Repair Phrase Menu**: Pre-print cards with “That came out wrong—let me try again,” “I see this matters,” etc. Practice aloud.
5. **Weekly Narrative Rewrite**: Spend 10 minutes writing the *positive* version of an argument, focusing on mutual goals.
6. **Stress-Reducing Humor Shift**: Agree with *wife* on “safe humor windows” (e.g., post-repair), avoiding joking during high tension.

# Reality Check-Mode

Your “It never ends” refrain and mock-recaps read as contempt. Humor is brilliant when it bonds; here it shields you from shame and signals superiority. Saying “My question is not a problem; your reaction is” relocates responsibility wholly onto *wife*—classic defensive blame-shift. Yet you also displayed courage: naming flooding, conceding mis-memory, agreeing to time-outs. Lean into those strengths.

# Growth Partner-Mode: Emotional Operating System

|Component|Current Pattern|Micro-Habit to Rewire|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Trigger**|Feeling interrogated|Pre-script: “I want to answer, I need 60 seconds to think.”|
|**Defense**|Humor/mock or one-word replies|Replace with|
|**Love Language**|Acts of Service & Physical Affection|Schedule one proactive help task per day; initiate non-sexual 20-sec hug nightly.|

# Emotional Translator-Mode (Decoding wife)

1. **Rapid-fire questions** often equal *panic about disconnection*, not legal cross-exam. A slow, grounded answer lowers her cortisol.
2. **Tone escalation** = protest that *time-out bids weren’t accepted.* Validate the bid (“You’re right, we need space”) and set timer.
3. **Labeling ‘gaslighting’** = her attempt to name power asymmetry. Instead of rebutting the label, reflect impact: “I see that response felt invalidating.”

# Daily Insight

**Journal Cue:** “In today’s smallest disagreement, how can I replace my first joke or ‘okay’ with a full sentence of empathy?”

# PART C — Unified Action Plan & Closing Reflection

# Top-Five Couple Experiments

1. **Flood Break Ritual 2.0** *Step 1:* Either partner says “Red Light.” *Step 2:* Both silence watches; 20-minute solo soothing. *Step 3:* Re-enter with “Green Light,” share one sentence of appreciation before topic resumes.
2. **Monday Morning Miracle List** Over coffee, each lists one small wish that would make the week easier. Trade lists and fulfill the wish within 48 hours.
3. **Evening Debrief & Gratitude Hug** 5 minutes of reciprocal highlights + a 20-second oxytocin hug (research shows heart-rate sync).
4. **Conflict Autopsy Date** Schedule a neutral café once a month; dissect one past argument using “What went right / What I wish I’d done.”
5. **Shared Future Vision Board** One Saturday, cut images/words representing the next five years; discuss why each matters. Activates goal alignment and positive sentiment.

# Metrics for Progress

* Reduction in Four Horsemen markers from current baseline (track during weekly meetings).
* ≥4 of 4 State-of-the-Union sessions completed each month.
* Average “connectedness” check-in score ≥7/10 by Week 8.
* Time between flooding signal and accepted break ≤2 minutes.

# Safety & Resources Note

If either partner ever feels emotionally unsafe (persistent contempt, verbal abuse) or notices physical escalation signs, seek professional support immediately. Resources:

* **National Domestic Violence Hotline (US):** 800-799-7233
* **Gottman Referral Network:** [gottmanreferralnetwork.com](http://gottmanreferralnetwork.com) for certified couples therapists.

# Closing Encouragement

You are not hostile strangers—you’re two passionate, highly articulate people who *want the same thing*: steadfast partnership. The very intensity of your exchanges proves deep investment. By coupling *wife*’s courage to name issues with *husband*’s emerging self-awareness, you possess every raw ingredient for a resilient, joyful marriage. Keep practicing the tools above, measure progress with curiosity, and remember: love is built less by avoiding storms than by learning to navigate them arm-in-arm. The route is challenging, but the destination—a secure, vibrant union—remains eminently reachable.

Our group had 4 guys ordering and there was a bit of a traffic of people due to the limited space. This Qatari guy behind me started 'ordering' me to move aside if I'm not going to order. I told him I'm already in the queue and we are ordering but he is still asking me to move aside. So the conversation went back and forth and he raised his voice at me and so did I. 

He threatened me saying ""Do you know who am I? You don't want to mess with someone like me. This is my country not yours. If I ask you to move you move. I will call the police and show you who I am. If police don't take actions,I will personally take actions and I will have someone follow you all the time 24/7"" I said, ""Call whoever you want and show me who you are. I will wait here for them (police) to come"" Then he got more aggressive and started shouting. Then he moved aside. 

It was clearly a power play. He didn't like me raising my voice. I didn't use any harsh words but I admit I raised my voice. It happened after he raised his voice thinking he could intimidate me but it clearly failed. When he said ""This is my country"" I realized that he is already defeated cuz that's a classic defense mechanism to use when someone's ego is bruised. 

 I think he called the police. I don't know. We grabbed our order and I waited for him. One guy at the coffee shop came behind and said ""Sir this guy is always like this here fighting with everyone so please ignore."" And another guy appeared and said ""Bro it's not worth this drama. Better you start moving"" 

As much as I wanted to stay and see how it's gonna end, I didn't want my friends to be in trouble as well. We sill waited around 15 minutes in the premises then we left. So... Nothing happened.

I have moved in and out this country for more than 19 years. Almost every Qatari I've met are respectable and humble. I'm talking about all kinda levels of Qataris. (Including royal family staff members)

I, 28, have been best friends with friend, 28, for three years. They live with 2 other housemates that I am also friends with — 1 I know from a year before me and BF became friends, the other i became friends with through exposure over last 1.5 years, in that time we have become friends outside of the household and hang out sometimes w/o BF.

Earlier this year tensions rose in the house as one of them had a big health issue (long-term disability that led to a near death experience 10 yrs ago) which left them bedbound, which put stress on the house in terms of workload, and BF took it as a major stress on her. I had told her on several occasions to express her thoughts and feelings to the house and listened to her woes countless times offering advice to counter the stress, but at a certain point they teetered into the realm of ableism – not cool. As time went on BF became more frustrated with the circumstances and the rhetoric turns a bit nasty, I do my best to listen to her whilst staying impartial as they are my friends too, trying to give some perspective on the situation by stating that while she may feel hurt and frustrated i am sure that they are not doing anything intentionally hurtful. As this annoyance begins to consume her she stops taking any interest in me or my life, to the point where i would come away from hangouts having asked all about her and realising she’s not asked anything about me unless i have brought it up.

BF works full time, where me and the other two are students and work PT. Summer comes around and we are spending a bit more time together w/o BF as they are not available or away on holidays. BF cancels on our plans one day because she has work to do, I reach out to one of the other two to go for a swim instead, they say yes! BF texts me the morning i am going to hang out with friend and says that she’s uncomfortable with her BF (me) hanging out with her housemates when she’s struggling with all this conflict in the house (this makes me feel like a possession, and I feel its necessary to highlight that they have never said anything bad about her to me but instead asked if she is okay). I say I’m sorry that these friendships are making her feel uncomfortable, that I will not reach out to them in future to hang out (i realise in hindsight and from talking to other friends that i had no obligation to do so), but then again i will not dissuade them from reaching out to me and if they ask me to hang out i will because i want to. Other friend in house decides to tag along to our hangout. BF texts me with annoyance and fomo saying that friend wants to come too with a sad face. Other friend is texting me saying BF is upset and to get a coffee for her too. I found out at a later date that she gave out (shouted) to them and sent them out of the living room (where she WFH – a point of contention amidst the conflict) because she was annoyed that they were hanging out with me. In hindsight this is very controlling behaviour to try and quench the discomfort she’s feeling about our friendships outside of her. It starts to feel a lot like i am walking on eggshells around BF because of her upset towards me being friends with the other two. 

Fast forward, friend with health issues is given the go ahead to carry on with their life again, this means they can move country to go and do their masters — huge success. BF does not see it this way, as there is only four weeks between when they found out and when they move, but rather as an inconvenience to them, they do not spare a minute to congratulate but go ahead and express their frustration (frustration is valid of course, but time and place no?). I tried to highlight how this is a huge deal for friend to be able to go, BF says that they no longer see them as a friend anymore, because they have not taken her and the house into consideration. I am now in a further sticky situation because that is my friend too and the words coming out of BFs mouth get more and more nasty as time goes on.

Fast forward to looking for a new roommate, BF states that they don’t want another roommate “like them” moving in. There are 3 options, both BF and friend have different favourites, and then there is a 3rd that they both liked. I suggest that maybe its worth choosing the 3rd to neutralise the hostility in the household and try to preserve what is left of her relationship with friend. She said that would be too much of a compromise on her part because friend just wants a girl in the house to mother him (his mother died last year, what kind of fucked-up Freudian sentiment is that like whattt). This was really the last straw for me in terms of how much i could tolerate of hearing from her on this as she had devolved into nastiness with such flippancy that it alarmed me. I stated that that was hardly the case and the 3rd party did have agency over themself to choose how they would be treated in the household. At this point I had been hearing about her annoyance almost daily and did not agree with a lot of what was being said and tried as best i could to remain impartial and not encourage the behaviour any more. I restated my opinion that 3rd party was best and said you have obviously made up your mind so i will not try to convince you anymore. 

Fast forward, I am going on holiday and something of mine is in BFs room, nobody is home, i have a spare key, and with permission i go to retrieve. Friend is there and I hadn’t realised, we frightened each other (very funny) and then i saw he looked sad, I asked if he was okay. He proceeded to tell me he was struggling with the new roommate situation, I was careful not to say anything that i shouldn’t and listened for the most part, until he brought up the 3rd option to which i said yeah i’ve said the same thing. I came away from the conversation more convinced than i had been before that this was the best option for everyone and that BF was being stubborn as hell, I sent her a text stating that for the sake of the household this was the best option and hoped that she would reconsider (i realise i shouldn’t of said anything here, dw).

Fast forward a few days, BF texts saying they’ve gone with her choice, followed by another saying friend had suggested 3rd option too, and then another asking had I told him that was the move. It felt a whole lot like an accusatory trap and i could already see where her head was at so i VMd back explaining this situation, expressing that I think i may have overstepped and apologised for doing so (friends have since told me I hadn’t and there was no need to apologise for speaking with my friend about the situation — I’m still not sure) I then went on to explain how i had been struggling to navigate my friendships with them all throughout this conflict as it had put me in an awkward position since i cared about them all. BF texts back several days later with three words - all good bro. I was upset with the lack of engagement with me expressing my feelings, apologising, and also explaining the situation as it had actually happened. I didn’t respond because i was kind of expecting more of a conversation to follow on her part but it never did.

I go away on holiday and don’t hear from her for 2/3 weeks. When i do its a message saying not all good, my message had hurt her feelings, but we could meet up and talk about it. In response i said my explanation wasn’t intended to hurt feelings but express my own, followed by a yes let’s find a time to meet up and talk. Radio silence for ten days. 

(I will paraphrase because there was a lot of repetition here)

A text comes through saying that my explanation highlighted how i prioritised my friendships with the others over ours which hurt her feelings, and that I should’ve told her that i had a conversation with himself. 

I respond saying that the time and effort i have but into our friendship is indicative of where my priorities lay, and go on to say that trying to upkeep my relationships with them is not highlighting any level of favouritism, then highlighting that i had not instigated any conversation and reinstated that I listened and only spoke up when he brought up the 3rd option.

She basically said i put my nose in where it didn’t belong, when if we are to look at the grand scheme of things she involved my nose in the whole situation and it put me in an increasingly difficult spot because I am tied to all three of them. Again she states that i prioritised them over her.

I told her that us not agreeing on how this should be approached is not the end of the world, but that i will not apologise for not agreeing with her or considering the other two as my friends. Once again reinstating that I had listened and not imparted my opinion blindly.

She comes back and tells me that emphasising the importance of my relationships with them is making it worse, basically says that i colluded against her from me and him having the same approach to the situation and that it was wrong for me not to tell her that i had had a conversation with him saying that i crossed a boundary. Then goes on to say that me not reaching out to her after she shut down the conversation hurt her feelings. Then says that i am not taking accountability for my actions, when i had started out with a VN that quite literally was me taking accountability for my of actions. She was not happy that my apology came with me expressing my discomfort with being in the middle of the whole situation. She increasingly speaks about boundaries being crossed from here on out.

I respond saying I understand that it’s hurting her but i cannot apologise for something that i do not have control over (her feelings, my therapist even snapped and clapped when i told him i said this because I have a tendency to feel responsible for other peoples feelings), restate that i did not collude against her, i take accountability of sending a text after speaking to him that i probably shouldn’t have. I apologised that my apology was not sufficient for her and state that it’s a shame that me expressing my feelings of discomfort was a cause of upset for her. I then went on to state that i honoured her boundaries where i could without having them encroach on my own, while highlighting that at a certain point it became unfair to me as an individual, as her friend as as someone connected to all three of them. I highlighted that i never did anything with malintent and that I wasn’t sure what else to say other than i am sorry that she feels this way. Whilst also stating that its starting to feel like I’m the bad guy and she’s the good and i need to apologise for everything that has hurt her when there are things she’s done that have hurt me too. I closed it out with saying that we are going in circles and i would like to meet up in person to talk about it if she wants to.

I get a response that really just cut me right to the core: she tells me that i have crossed her boundaries and i need to take accountability for my actions and not explain my emotions that led me to make them. Tells me that i am coming across as defensive by expressing my feelings and that what i am saying is offensive. She then issues an ultimatum saying that we can only meet up if i look at how she is reacting to choices i made, and that i should ask her why she is upset and take accountability for them. 

Quite literally gutted, I responded saying that I wasn’t going to engage with the ultimatum out of respect to our friendship (because i know in my heart that if i do we will never be friends again because she will always have the upper hand and i will never get a chance to express how i have felt neglected in our friendship for the past few months without her feelings like its ammunition). I said i will not accept her behaviour in an attempt to control my responses, that i stand by what i have said and done and taken accountability for my actions and how they hurt her but it doesn’t seem to be enough. I said i am genuinely sorry that my actions have hurt her, but i do not have control over how she responds emotionally or otherwise and that i cannot apologise for things that are out of my control. I went on to say that I am removing myself from the conversation for the meantime because it is not serving either of us and doing more harm than good. 

She came back yesterday saying she wants to resolve this and is trying to explain how we can go about doing that, then tells me how “we” can go about doing that is by me taking accountability and properly apologising, no level of self-reflection on her part to be seen. She insinuates that i have said that her boundaries don’t apply to me (which i never did) and that she will not accept a a sliver of an apology loaded with caveats. She will not change her mind on it and it’s up to me whether or not i want to do that, closing it with “by all means take time to reflect”. 

I am genuinely at a loss here as to whether or not i am the asshole in this situation. Ive talked with my therapist about it for weeks at this point and they are saying to just let the friendship go but i am just so in shock and hurt by the situation. Like i went in a couple of weeks ago and was saying i was so proud of myself for expressing my discomfort with the situation and it’s all just falling apart. With every text that came through my heart has sunk a little bit lower and the possibility of salvaging this friendship moves further and further away. All the friends I have spoken to about the situation are saying that I’ve done nothing wrong but when i see all these words coming through telling me how shit a friend i am for lack of any better words I’m so unsure of where i stand. I have taken accountability for my actions, i have apologised for hurting her feelings but as i said to my therapist a while ago now in terms of this, how do i ask someone to see me as a person with feelings and stakes in this situation. I am a recovering people pleaser too so am trying my best not to over apologise, and I can see that the demand for repeat apologies is just feeding into the people pleasing tendency that I’m trying so hard to get away from. 

TLDR; BF says I’ve crossed their boundaries and demands that i apologise and take accountability for how my actions have hurt her when it is not all that black and white, and her boundaries encroached on my own.",0,1758663919.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

So in all my many years, ive avoided ""bugs"", avoided morning sickness,  avoided side effects, etc.  Saturday night, after I had some fast food, a chicken burger (spicy) with just lettuce,  and some cheesy nachos, and a coke zero.. I was feeling fine other than minor discomfort from indigestion cuz it was spicy and I wasn't used to it.  For reference I am on omeprazole which is for chronic gastritis (stomach lining issues). Around 10 pm, after relaxing for a bit, I had supper around 730 pm.. I decided to go to bed, took my omeprazole, went to sleep, early mind you. Woke up.. at 2:45 am.. groaning in pain. I thought the spicy sandwich triggered my ibs again. So I went to the bathroom and sat down, and when I tried to go to the bathroom.. it hurt, and it was watery. (Tmi sorry). It seemed like it wouldn't stop coming. I felt nervous. I took 3 imodium and it finally stopped for 4 hrs. I was so sore, and tired. I laid on the couch pretty much all day, didnt eat anything,  and could only stomach sips of water. No n*, no v*. The d* would come and go,  but by 3 pm Sunday it was gone all together. I just slept. And slept. And slept. I finally got up at 8 am. But I was so groggy, dehydrated feeling, and dizzy. I hadn't had any coffee since Saturday morning. It was now monday. I had a bowl of cereal and half of a coffee.  My stomach was still aching. 😩 but the dizzy feeling didn't go away. And that scared me enough to go to the ER!

So now at the ER. The wait times looking ridiculous. (Im in canada. )
 But I wait it out, do the necessary tests. Blood, urine. Etc. Im not allowed to eat until I see a dr. Just policy fot anyone with stomach issues. Im happy I was wearing my mask.. just as an extra protection.. 

After waiting from 11:30 am.. I had been so hungry / tired / blah.

In what I can only describe as a mortifying and horrid sounding event. I automatically plugged my ears, and started rocking back and forth in full blown panic mode, I felt like I was going to faint, or I had to run 🏃‍♀️ ASAP. Pure fear washed over me. I hadn't felt that fearful in a long time. I couldn't even go near that area, not even after the man was carted into the triage and they had someone clean it. Worst part is, my brain wont let this go. I hate it. I just wanna forget and move on, but when I close my eyes, I relive the feelings I experienced during this, and hear parts of the sounds etc. Luckily I never saw anything. Just heard it. But it was enough to make me want to leave. 

And to make matters worse, I was waiting to see a dr for my own stomach related issues. Which I didnt get to see a dr until 1230 am today. It was insane. How do I just, forget? Ughhhh. Im sorry I didnt know how to categorize this for flair. ",2,1758663878.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

Jack made his way downstairs to brew a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight that morning. Jack was unemployed and had no obligations at home for the most part. He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—was too daunting to answer. He was all too comfortable.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. He realized he liked the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from the guilty feelings of complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought while being deeply fixated on his gam.

As Jack continued gaming and eating what remained of his cereal, he was interrupted by the sound of a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, avoiding the chance of answering to some salesman or deliveryman so he could carry on with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew what to do but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver delivering a package and needed a signature of approval. It was for his fathers, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack stood there for a moment and peered over to the right at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him, inviting him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack remembered he had his community college classes today and decided to text him later that evening to join him on Call of Duty. The sky was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After placing the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing full well he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain lessened a bit but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. He started driving making his way to the local 7-Eleven a few blocks down, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, the realized drew a smile.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime. He parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,

“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.

“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, while making strange eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back towards the door and saw the man was walking off, so he decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking some glances back towards the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction but he didn’t, he was now in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack walked out from the store and noticed the man was not to be seen, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”

“Thanks for the help anyways”. “Who knows what I would’ve done tonight.” “I don’t have much money.” “I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact.

Jack didn’t respond; he just wanted to get into the car and leave. He didn’t know what to make of that and didn’t care to find out by entertaining the conversation. He began to back out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left 7/11 and while driving, he felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home. Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.

In almost no time Jack made it back to the house and pulled into the driveway. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to park his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.

“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding all of that could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who talked and gazed at him in a strange manner. “I don’t know man”—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. He felt relieved to be home at the very least and clicked the button to close the garage. The garage was  beginning to close, he looked out and saw a black car passing by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage now made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and that the man inside appeared to be wearing a hat like the one at the store made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started piecing together terrifying scenarios for what could be going on. He then began thinking the man from earlier now knew where he lived and that became the only thing Jack could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for any whereabouts of the man. There was no one to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack was reluctant to startle his parents telling them what happened as they were far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen explaining his situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours then went by and Jack never ceased to leave his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much even though the situation was strange, if you know what I mean.”

“Yeah that would’ve creeped me out too, but those bums at 7/11 are always up to some weird stuff so I wouldn’t think too much of it… I’m glad you answered my call though, knowing the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen said jokingly.

Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the guy was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to grab a knife in the kitchen and fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”

“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911 or something , let’s be real.” Laughing again.

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.

They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his World History class. They got off the games, talked for a second, then hung up the phone. Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to, to alleviate the end of what Jack thought was a seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much to do. He had already spoken to his parents that night on the phone and caught up on how things were going. He decided he’d get to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Jack continued playing his games longer than anticipated and stayed up a while longer after that as well. He checked some texts and watched a couple YouTube videos in bed until he slowly drifted off into sleep. Something woke him—he overheard a thud or the sound of a subtle snap echo in the house. He couldn’t make it out, being in a deep sleep as it woke him. It wasn’t an unusual occurrence for that to happen, he thought, and laid back down, tired. Jack a a few moments, now heard the sound of a car out front, it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously drew himself from bed and went to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up again and into the night. It persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed  his worries to vanish and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The locking engagement sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake Jack again. Jack took a second to peer out his window in fatigue, being as tired as he was and now flustered. He looked out and saw it a black Jeep Cherokee parked across the street of his house. His heart raced and skipped a beat as he looked away from the window. “Is it the guy?” he asked himself with the an uncertain fear now settling in him. His hands became clammy, he went to look again, but nobody got out. The windows to the car were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought of knowing the person saw him look out. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me attempting to see if it was him knowing full well id be terrified. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut. Jacks head lay against the wall on the foot of his. He couldn’t bear himself to look again. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped and then picked up again slowly . Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. “What?” “What!?” he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. “Is he sneaking up on me?” Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. His mind was nearing mode of fight or flight. He stopped himself from thinking in order to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said quietly to himself, trembling. He could barely move a leg or a muscle. He didn’t want a remnant of sound to be heard from his room. He sat there waiting and listening closely.

The faintest sound of the front door slowly creeping open could be heard from downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest. The door had been unlocked since his 7/11 trip. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body intensely sweating as the trepidation of the man below consumed him.

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried sliding his window open slowly while in a shaky haze, listening attentively to the sounds below. He quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was an ominous thing—it was unbearable. A light step could be heard and then another. The front door then closed silently. The man could suddenly be heard running to and up stairs. Jack froze, unable to move and the man immediately tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped abruptly and said in his deep, low “come out kid,” “I know your in there” “I saw you look at me from outside your window” as he began laugh. Jack heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door.

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap!

Jack let out a yell. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and pushed  the door open, now looked at Jack. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window as the man ran in, Jack climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel quite injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run for his life. 

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down and smacking the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly and desperately a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man relentlessly followed around the corner, but Jack was then most of the way through the park as he passed numerous pine trees and the dark empty playground. He now entered the other side of the neighborhood.

Jack was exhausted from running, he made it a few more blocks down and hid behind some shrubs he spotted, bordering the front of a neighbor’s house without being seen. “I’ll lay here and watch for a while”, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach and his arms now resting on the dirt ground. He laid there and watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying for a few minutes until finally, the man came walking by—who he could see had the same outfit from before: The large jacket, denim pants along with a strange hat who was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack and appeared very frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.

“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick to kill some young kid, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—since I left the house suddenly, but not grabbing it at a time like this?”

Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind of making his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few more minutes passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, made a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly not hearing him or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along down the street towards the park. It had stopped raining as before but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed he noticed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house looking around both sides of the street, paranoid and desperate to get into the house. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911. 

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night what it was. A car passed by making it hard to tell what was going on as Jack waited for someone to answer the line. “Hurry and pick up please , please” he said, with extreme impatience. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”

Jack gave the woman a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visit to the house that evening and how he snuck up into to his room breaking the door, chasing him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively to the seriousness of the situation, taking notes and asking further questions.

“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”

Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply.

The man was staring at Jack with his hallow eyes, creeping from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house to kill him. He was smiling insanely, his body mainly exposed by the kitchen wall with his pocket knife in hand.

“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window.

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look saying “I’m going to get you this time.” Laughing wildly. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away as he lunged to the side and ran toward the dining table. The man followed laughing, running around swinging his knife towards Jack, he slashed his arm from across the table. Jack yelled out in pain as he got into a desperate position away on the far side of the table across from the man. The clean slash on his arm was bleeding badly. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man stood there wide eyed and suddenly climbed up on top knocking everything over. He stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him but Jack smacked his arm away and ran toward the stairs. The man leaped off the table running quickly after him.

The man was fast running up the steps and caught up to Jack grabbing him by the shirt, ready to stab him near the top of the stairs. Jack then spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung the candle stand with all his might and struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the steps at Jacks feet, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs to the living room floor. He lay there unconscious.

Jack started sobbing profusely, not letting go of the candle stand out of fear. “What just happened?” He said as he continued sobbing in shock of everything that happened and what he had just done to the man. This went on for a moment but then he couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not but he appeared like it. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops soon came and were stunned by the situation. Jack’s parents and his friends later on couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in a state of delirium and haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. He then received assistance from a peri medic to address his gash on his arm from the knife earlier. The man was declared dead due to the mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare yet how lucky he was to have managed to stay alive. He thought how going to a 7 Eleven now wouldn’t be the same anymore, even just being at home alone, you can’t trust anybody. The prior worries Jack had of the man were now warranted with the event’s that played out that evening. This moment never departed Jack’s memory, but the lasting trauma improved with time. He went on to live a fulfilling life and venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story with success.

That day Jack learned a couple things: trust your instincts and never, never leave your front door unlocked.

The End.

- fusion type places
- seafood

Is this fair?,"Okay a disclaimer first, I have AuDHD (and BPD) and find it hard to write a short post because I want to over-explain, so this will be long... This is really a big and recurring issue in our relationship. Please read the tl;dr if it bothers you.

A second disclaimer: I feel incredibly stupid for even taking this to Reddit but I don't really have any support system and my partner and I have not been able to have an actual conversation about this (or much else) for months. It feels like our relationship reached a dead end and everything is chaos, so this is just an attempt to get any kind of clarity - and insight into how I could approach this better.

Last disclaimer is that I will do a lot of ""I contribute X"" and ""gf contributes Y"" in this post, but I want to make clear that I don't do that to compare or make it a competition or complain about how much/little either of us contributes. It's just to paint a more complete picture.

\---

For context me (28f) and my gf (29) have been together for almost 4 years and we have lived together for 3 years. We met when we were both still doing our Master's and when we moved in together I was still doing my internship while my gf just graduated. While we were studying, I had a student loan as well as a side job and my gf her parents paid her rent and tuition. This might matter for later. Note: I was born and raised in the country we are living in, my gf is from another country and moved here for her Master's. After we both graduated, I had several side jobs and my gf had 1 side job that she has since turned in to her full time job. 

We lived in a city where we did not see a future, and we had a goal to move elsewhere. It was really hard to find an apartment in that area since it's incredibly popular and relatively expensive. We also at that point both didn't have enough stability to prove to a landlord we were fit to rent - even though we did have more than 2 years of documentation of paying the rent on time even when we made a very small amount of money. We got an option for temporary housing in the area and have apartment-hopped ever since. We soon have to leave our 5th apartment in a row and we are trying super hard to find something new, hopefully indefinite this time. All the moving has been taking its toll on us; every time we feel a bit at home, we have to leave again. Not to mention we are doing all the heavy lifting and packing ourselves and it also costs money every time (deposits which somehow we never FULLY get back, transportation, etc).

As mentioned, my gf now has a full time job with a stable contract and stable income. She also has stable income from an extra job on the side. She works really hard and she loves the jobs, I am really proud of her. Me myself I have 1 semi-stable job - it's freelance so no strong contract or benefits but stable pay - and a shitty side-job. Neither jobs are inspiring at all and I'm not passionate about them nor proud of them. I have been trying really hard to find a stable, solid job that I actually like, but it's been hard because we keep moving around and when I disclose that my living situation isn't stable (which I feel like I have to), employers lose interest. On top of that, my mental health has been getting worse and worse and it's hard for me to find motivation to do anything. I'm experiencing deep depression because of the lack of proper housing combined with the lack of passion in my jobs (or anything else really), lack of financial security and, above all, lack of a community and support system - my parents and I are no contact and I barely speak to my sister because of it, I don't have any really close friendships (anymore) (due to moving, depression, my BPD and other factors). I also developed chronic migraines and neck pain. Despite this, every single day I try really hard to get my life on track (I work, look for jobs, look for houses, try some hobbies, try to eat and sleep well, clean the house, etc).

Today I did a large grocery haul because I wanted to cook something nice for my gf and I after we've been going through a lot of stress lately. I made the table, poured us some wine and we had dinner together. Right off the bat my gf expressed that she really appreciated it and that she really liked it. We ate and drank and talked and at some point, when she got a bit tipsy, she started expressing to me how bad she was feeling. She was holding me and letting me know that she was so overwhelmed and stressed and that everything was getting too much. I listened to her and validated her and I told her I understood. I tried to reassure her that we were both in this together, and that no matter what it would be okay. We are both very stressed but we have overcome a lot together in the last year and I'm sure we could do it again. 

She then started expressing how she was stressed about the money that would come with moving. We'd have to put a deposit down (which we can hopefully cover with the deposits that we'll get back from 2 other places), pay for moving and, if we find an indefinite place, pay for mostly all new furniture. The thing is, she has the money and I don't. We currently make roughly the same amount of money every month, her income is slightly higher (about 200€), but somehow she has managed to save over 30k€ in the past 2 years and I have absolutely nothing. More on that later. She expressed that ""she didn't want to sound selfish but she worked hard for the money and even though she did for exactly this reason, it still bothered her that her hard-earned money would just be gone like that instead of having a partner who could also contribute"" - this is VALID. I immediately validated her and let her know that I understood, that I would contribute as much as I possibly can and when we are finally settled and I finally found a better job I would dedicate all my savings to her until I paid her back. I also let her know that it's a very fair expectation/need/desire to be with a partner who can contribute in that way, also when there is an emergency for example. 

I feel a lot of shame and guilt about not having any savings, but I've yet to find an understanding on how she managed to save so much while I haven't saved anything at all. I am not a reckless spender when it comes to spending money on myself and my gf confirms this. I do have some higher personal bills and things to pay off, but still, the difference between 0€ and 30k€ is incredibly high.

Anyway, of course my gf wishes I was a better partner when it comes to being able to contribute money in situations like this. She has every right to, I'm a full-grown adult and I should have my sh\*t together. I don't deny that. However, what initiated the fight is that she mentioned that I don't ""treat her enough"". She says I don't do nice things for her, I don't get her nice presents and I don't take her on trips. This was painful to hear for several reasons: 

1) I don't think this statement is true at all; almost all my spare money goes towards doing something nice for her, whether it's the more consistent smaller things (for example, welcome-home baskets every time she comes home from visiting family, getting her a make-up product or piece of jewelry whenever she mentions she wants it, etc) or the when-I-can-afford-to bigger things (just as an example, I bought her a 420€ necklace for her birthday last month and a 130€ perfume two months before that - I feel so freaking lame for even mentioning this but I just want to know if I'm crazy) 

2) She knows I roughly make the same amount of money as her, she knows I don't have any money saved (which as discussed prior is obviously a valid problem), yet she somehow wants me to spend the money that I don't have on more expensive things 

3) She knows how I want to give her the world, how I would if I could, and how I will when I finally can 

4) She herself is super frugal when it comes to spending money and it's very rare she gets me anything or does anything for me, even though she could easily afford to. Now I obviously KNOW that this is also a love language thing, because my love language is not really receiving gifts, I'm way more of a words of affirmation / love letter / sweet text / reassurance / physical touch kind of girl but A) I'm ironically not being loved like at all either  B) it just seems a bit hypocritical that in her eyes this is part of a relationship, yet she doesn't do it either and C) it's still nice to be considered like that!

Whenever she mentions things like this, she puts me in a spot where I have to defend myself and I feel so incredibly awkward because it always feels like I'm either rubbing in her face how great I am (I definitely don't think that) or somehow making her feel like I think she's ungrateful. She keeps saying how I don't do enough and when I mentioned #4 she threw at me that our last 3 summer holidays only happened because of her ""connections"", which is true but I'm not sure how that equals what I do for her. The last holiday was heavily discounted because she knew someone with accommodation, but I still paid 50% of said accommodation + my own flight + 50% of everything on vacation. The two vacations before that we stayed with her parents and they refused to let me pay, but I did pay for my flights. Obviously those are HER parents, they paid for a lot of food too, and I am endlessly grateful (I really love these people), but I'm still not sure how this compares what she herself does for me. IT'S NOT A COMPETITION!!! BUT SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IT IS. She even mentioned how my parents, THAT I AM NO CONTACT WITH WHICH IS TRAUMATISING ME DAILY, ""don't welcome her like that"" as if that makes me the villain.

(Just for context on the money, we split rent and utilities evenly, I would say that paying for eating out and such have become more equal over time but it's still roughly 60-40% me-her, I do the groceries I would say 80% of the time depending on the week (sometimes I do them the whole week and sometimes she might contribute a bit more), and there are a lot of random costs that I take 90%, like subscriptions, small fees for things, etc. My gf would probably say that everything is equal but there is a lot of costs she doesn't (want to) see.)

This seems to be a recurring pattern of her completely not seeing what I do for her, and I feel super unappreciated. It's one thing to not be thanked or praised (that's not why I do things), but it's a whole other thing to constantly attack me with how much I'm lacking, making me feel like I have to defend myself, and then saying that I'm ""using things I do against her"" (?!). 

It's not just about how I don't treat her, by the way. Just this morning she was also mad at me because yesterday I forgot to put two pans away - after I did groceries, cooked and cleaned everything else. She is critiquing me daily on everything that I am not doing, failing to see that I:

1) Contribute heavily to household tasks (I do the laundry, I take the trash out, I do the groceries, I cook, I clean after cooking, I clean the litter boxes, everytime we moved I did all the packing and the driving, I do micro-cleaning and micro-tidying during the day, I also help her with any tasks related to work she asks me to, bring her coffee, I am constantly looking for houses, made a whole renting history file with all our documents and am constantly replying, etc) (she claims she cleans after work for 2 hours every day but I have rarely witnessed this when I work from home so maybe she only does this when I'm not there) 

2) Contribute heavily to household expenses. Sure, I have no savings and I work shitty jobs, but I always make sure ends meet and I pay all my shares of all the bills and more

3) Have been mentally struggling HARD for almost 2 years without any support system and I am so severely burned-out that I have almost reached psychosis several times. I'm sure I developed some neurological disorder at this point. I want to emphasise that mental health is not an excuse to be a sh\*tty partner but I want it to be known that I am not out there having fun, being with friends, chasing dreams and hobbies while neglecting my partner. Nor am I doing nothing all day and being lazy. I am doing everything I can with the resources I have and I haven't caught a break in forever. Not mentally/emotionally, not financially and not physically. I am constantly trying to be everything for everyone and I have been neglecting myself more than anything at all. I am exhausted and su\*cidal (my partner doesn't know the latter and frankly I don't feel safe to tell her because part of the problem seems to be that there is never a valid reason for me to be suffering, because she's ""doing worse and still managing her life"" - in other words, she never received validation from her parents so mental health was never something that was cared about).

Whenever I tell her what I contribute to the household she somehow feels attacked because she works a 9-17 and I have way more time on my hands - which is true, so it only makes sense that I do more, but it's NOT ABOUT THAT. I happily do more because it makes sense with our schedules, it's just that somehow what I do is never enough. It's not ever like I just sit around. I'm always working or handling other responsibilities. I'm not trying to complain that she should do more, I am trying to be heard and seen on what I am doing good! I feel like a baby for this and she says so too, that I ""just want to be babied"" (as if I'm a manchild) but that is not the case at all. Do you guys think I am? AITAH?

(I want to emphasise that my gf is also struggling and I know this, which is why I would never treat her like this. I would rather give her grace but it's painful and exhausting not getting that in return and it builds resentment tbh.)

**tl;dr:**

I (28F, AuDHD + BPD) live with my girlfriend (29F). We both earn about the same, but she has over €30k saved while I have none. My income is steady, but my contract isn’t strong and I’m not passionate about the work. On top of that, my mental health issues cause chronic pain, which makes things harder.

Even without savings, I always make things work and cover my part of expenses. I also take care of a big chunk of household tasks, errands, and things like house-hunting, so I’m either working or handling responsibilities, not sitting around. My girlfriend also does a lot, but the point is that I do contribute consistently.

What hurts is that she often focuses on where I fall short. It’s fair that she worries about my lack of savings, but she knows I’m not reckless, my bills are higher, I contribute more to the household, and I already spend money on her. If our situations were flipped, she wouldn’t have been able to save either. I’ve told her I’d pay her back for any moving expenses, but that doesn’t seem to matter.

Today, we had dinner and she brought up being stressed about the moving costs. I tried to reassure her that I will contribute and am committed, but the conversation shifted into how I don’t do enough, financially and otherwise. When she points out an issue, I don’t mind, but sometimes she gets livid and starts listing every way I’ve “failed.” That feels deeply unfair when I put in so much effort.

She sometimes defends her stance by saying I do more chores because I’m home more, but I never attacked her for not doing enough. To me it’s not about percentages, it’s about her acting like my contributions aren’t enough, no matter how much I do.

I’m left feeling invisible, ashamed, and burned out. I just want recognition for my efforts, not constant criticism. AITAH?",3,1758663113.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Like many immigrants, I came here with little more than ambition and a very blurry roadmap. No shortcuts.... just time, grit, and the quiet hope that one day, I’d build a space that feels like home. Truly ours. This apartment is the first place I’ve owned. And I didn’t want to just decorate it. I wanted to design it from the inside out. Every line, every surface, every texture..with meaning and personality!! The mural was custom made to reflect both mine and my wife’s passion. Tropical leaves for our love of sailing and the ocean. Dandelions as a nod to the wind swept fields I grew up with. It’s subtle, but if you know, you know. The tv stand? I shared the build on another reddit thread. It’s made from raw pine and bent steel legs I designed and welded myself. Same with the coffee tables. It was my way of grounding the space in something physical after years of living in rentals where nothing ever really felt like mine. Scandinavian style? Maybe loosely :)))) We stuck to neutral palettes, natural textures, and open space. Not for the trend, but because peace and simplicity hit different when you’ve worked hard to get here.

Still a work in progress, but proud of where it’s at. Open to feedback or thoughts if anything jumps out to you.

If something here sparks an idea for your own space, I’m glad it helped. More images here: [https://imgur.com/a/asoqR8L](https://imgur.com/a/asoqR8L)

I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire [Chapter 2 ""Peach Flower Catastrophe""](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuyanMemoir/comments/1nisyq5/2_revelation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 Ileus**

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation ([see chapter 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1noh3xq/12_meditation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) when I was a child, so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**10.2-2 Big Bang**

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**Note 10.2.2**

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 I surrendered**

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. [8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuyanMemoir/comments/1nhaogn/82_死不瞑目_die_with_eyes_open/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense; reference case [1.4.2 Well-Sun Difficulty](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseCodex/comments/1nns6vj/142_wellsun_difficulty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**Note 10.2.3**

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” ([see 11.4.5 Sense Node](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1nnlomo/1145_sense_node/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

>In the following article, originally published on his website Weaponized Information, Prince Kapone gives an acute analysis and mounts a trenchant defence of China’s Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), generally regarded as one of the greatest peasant rebellions, as well as bloodiest conflicts, in human history.

>Describing it as the “spectre of peasant communism”, Kapone situates the rebellion against the background of the stagnation and decline of China’s feudal system, of the Qing dynasty in particular, and the way this opened up the country to imperialist depredations, most notably the British Opium Wars (1839-1842; 1856-1860).

>He explains: “The opium-induced decomposition of Chinese society was no accident; it was policy. This narcotic primitive accumulation did not represent the entry of capitalism through ‘natural’ development, but its violent imposition through military discipline. As in India, Ireland, and Egypt, the arrival of the capitalist world market meant the annihilation of local metabolic rationality in favour of cash crop logic, debt servitude, and currency crisis. The Qing state, no matter its robes or rituals, had become a tributary of London finance.

>“It is within this furnace of contradiction that the Taiping Rebellion arose – not as an aberration, nor a reactionary nostalgia for a vanished harmony, but as the spontaneous combustion of a people compressed between imperial plunder and domestic parasitism. In this sense, the Taiping were the dialectical consequence of a global contradiction: the fusion of foreign capital’s devastation with the internal bankruptcy of a feudal order. What followed was not simply rebellion, but the premature birth of a proletarian-peasant war in the belly of a still-feudal dragon.”

>He goes on to outline the form and essence of peasant revolt: “When the peasantry takes up arms, it does not quote Hegel – it dreams. But the dream, far from being false, is the condensed expression of real suffering, organised into symbolic form. The bourgeois mind, unable to see beyond its own secular fetishisms, calls this ‘madness,’ ‘fanaticism,’ ‘superstition.’ Yet just as the commodity hides labour beneath its surface, so too does ideology conceal class. The gods of the Taiping did not descend from heaven – they rose from the rice paddies.

>“Hong Xiuquan, the failed scholar who declared himself the younger brother of Christ, has been mocked by European scribes as a deluded zealot. But what is delusion in a world where imperial capital arrives by gunship? In the dream of paradise, in the vision of a Heavenly Kingdom on earth, the Chinese peasantry gave voice to their deepest material yearnings: land, bread, justice, revenge. That this expression wore the garb of biblical apocalypse is no stranger than the French Revolution quoting Rome or the English Levellers citing scripture. The form is borrowed; the content is real…

>“This was a weaponised syncretism: a theology forged in the crucible of examination failure, landlord extortion, opium hunger, and state decay. Christ, repurposed by Hong, was not a redeemer of souls but a hammer of kings. The Taiping gospel was less a catechism than a call to arms, less sermon than strategy.”

>Expounding further on what he sees as the communistic essence of the Taipings, he writes: “In their ‘Ten Heavenly Commandments,’ one finds the residue of real struggle: no private property, no sexual exploitation, no opium, no idle rich. A moral economy reasserts itself as divine law. The Taiping did not hallucinate utopia; they resurrected it from memory. Beneath the Christian veneer lay a peasant communism older than the cross… When Hong Xiuquan declared himself a divine son, he was not asserting divinity but abolishing hierarchy. The imperial dragon worships its ancestors; the Taiping peasant made himself the ancestor of a new order. This is not madness – it is revolution in mythic form… The European bourgeoisie feared it not because it was mad, but because it was lucid. It recognised in the fire of that rebellion a world that could not be bought or sold, a society where silver did not rule, and a people who no longer begged for mercy but demanded the kingdom of heaven – and meant it literally… Their program proposed no less than the abolition of private property in land. ‘All under heaven belongs to all,’ they declared. Let the landlords howl: this was the most advanced agrarian communism attempted in the modern world before the birth of the proletariat proper.”

>Giving his study an international comparative framework (one that, at least in the case of the Russian mir, Marx also reflected on in his later years), Kapone observes: “The Taiping system resembles, in embryonic form, the Andean ayllu, the Indian village commune, and the Russian mir – not because of racial affinity or cultural parallel, but because the peasant, when unleashed from tribute and market, tends always toward collectivism. Not because he is noble, but because he is practical. No one survives a famine alone.”

>He also dwells on the objective and subjective limitations of the movement:

>“The greatest strength of the Taiping commune was also its weakness: its material basis in the peasantry. Without capital, they abolished capital; without a proletariat, they foreshadowed its necessity… Surrounded by the Qing state, the British gunboat, and the comprador merchant, the Taiping were forced to militarise every aspect of life. Men and women laboured in regiments. Food was rationed, movement regulated, property collectivised. Agriculture was synchronised with logistics; supply lines replaced markets. What bourgeois economists later condemned as ‘despotism’ was, in truth, war communism *avant la letter* – a crude, yet necessary form of centralised planning under siege conditions…

>“The peasantry, in this moment, seized political power – not as a class destined to rule eternally, but as a class thrust into the breach of history. Their rule was heroic and partial, tragic and luminous. They raised the banner of equality but could not destroy the wage form. They abolished landlordism but lacked the means to abolish scarcity. Their communes fed millions, but could not withstand the famine induced by blockade, siege, and scorched earth. Their dictatorship was real – but it was transitional, incomplete, and ultimately unsustainable under the pressure of global capital.

>“Still, the Taiping regime stands as proof that the peasantry, when properly awakened and disciplined by war, can become the bearer of world-historic rupture. Not because it represents the future in itself, but because it clears the ground for one… The Heavenly Kingdom may have ruled by sword and sermon, but at its core stood a truth too dangerous to live: the people can govern themselves.”

>Insisting on the revolutionary prescience of the Taiping movement, and its continued lessons and resonance, not just for and in China, but on a global scale, Kapone sums up:

>“The Taiping Commune, though annihilated by steel and fire, did not vanish. It smolders still beneath the surface of Chinese history, not as a failed rebellion, but as a premature rupture – an aborted synthesis of agrarian revolution and anti-imperialist war.

>“Bourgeois historians, ever eager to sterilise revolt, have embalmed the Taiping in narratives of chaos, fanaticism, and failure. But to analyse them in the dialectic reveals something deeper: the first great attempt in the modern world to overthrow landlordism, expel foreign domination, and construct a social order based not on commodity exchange, but communal distribution. They were not anachronisms – they were anticipations.

>“The Taiping vision did not die in Nanjing – it migrated. In the Boxer Uprising, we find their militancy renewed; in the anti-imperialist revolts of the early republic, their hatred of compradorism reemerges; and in 1949, their agrarian egalitarianism is reborn in the revolutionary land reform of the Chinese People’s War. The Communist Party of China, whatever its subsequent transformations, built upon the ruins the Taiping left behind.”

>He moves to his conclusion with words pregnant with meaning and lessons for both successful and failed revolutions, from China to Korea, to Cambodia, to Mozambique, to Peru, and to Haiti, and for the prospects and trajectory of genuine and fundamental change on a world scale:

>“Let us be precise. The Taiping did not possess the material conditions to complete a socialist revolution: they lacked a proletariat, an industrial base, and the scientific theory of Marxism. But they possessed something else – the spontaneous clarity of the oppressed in motion, the instinctual collectivism of the village, and the class hatred born of hunger. They embodied what we may call revolutionary intuition – the raw, pre-theoretical negation of an unlivable world.

>“Their commune was riddled with contradictions. Gender equality was proclaimed but constrained. Property was abolished, but scarcity persisted. Centralisation was necessary but stifling. Yet these contradictions were not signs of backwardness – they were the very symptoms of a people reaching beyond their historical moment, stretching toward a horizon their epoch could not yet sustain. They were building socialism with the tools of feudalism and the ruins of empire.

> “It is easy to mourn the Taiping as martyrs, but it is more correct to remember them as pathbreakers. In their downfall we find not only tragedy, but instruction. That no revolution can survive in isolation from the global class struggle. That the peasantry, while capable of igniting the fire, cannot carry it alone to completion. That spiritual fervour, while mobilising, must give way to material planning. And yet, we also learn this: that the soil of revolution is not found only in the factory, but in the furrowed fields and broken backs of the peasantry.

>“The history of revolution is not a linear ascent, but a spiral. The Taiping insurrection marked one such turn – a searing prelude to the coming wars of national liberation and agrarian socialism. They were not the end; they were a beginning denied. Their banners torn, their capital burned, their king dead – but the village memory persists. The whisper that land can be held in common. That production can serve need. That heaven can be brought down to earth – not by prayer, but by class war.

>“There is a spectre haunting world history – not the spectre of communism as imagined by the salons of Europe, but its peasant form: barefoot, bloodied, and armed with a hoe. The Taiping Rebellion was the most advanced expression of this spectre in the nineteenth century, a rising of the rural masses who, long before the industrial proletariat matured into its revolutionary role, had already begun to construct the negation of property, class, and imperial subjugation from below. Their commune did not await the development of capitalism – it attempted to destroy it before it fully arrived.”

>An important study, unique in the English language, of this historic movement is the late Dr. Charles Curwen’s ‘Taiping Rebel: The Deposition of Li Hsiu-ch’eng’, awarded a PhD by SOAS University of London in 1968 and published by Cambridge University Press in 1977. Curwen, who lived and worked in China, 1946-1954, and was a staunch supporter of both the Taiping Rebellion and the Chinese revolution led by Mao Zedong, was also a co-founder (in 1973) and editor with Terrence (Terry) J. Byres and Teodor Shanin of the Journal of Peasant Studies. An interesting essay on the journal may be read here, as published in the inaugural edition of its offshoot, the Journal of Agrarian Change.

**I. The Blood Price of Tea and Silver: How China Was Dragged into the World Market**

The so-called “independence” of nations under feudal kings and emperors didn’t survive the rise of capitalism. In the 19th century, sovereignty meant nothing if your ports could be shelled open by gunboats. China learned this lesson the hard way. The Qing Empire was forced into the world market not through peaceful exchange, but by narcotics and cannon fire.

Britain had a problem: it loved Chinese tea, but China didn’t care for British wool or iron. Silver was draining out of London and into Canton. To plug this hemorrhage, the East India Company flooded China with opium grown by coerced labor in Bengal. What followed wasn’t trade; it was a drug war packaged as free trade.

When Chinese officials tried to stop the poisoning of their people, Britain sent warships. The Opium Wars were not “misunderstandings” or “diplomatic clashes.” They were wars of primitive accumulation—capitalism battering down the door of a society that had neither parliaments nor stock exchanges, but plenty of peasants to ruin.

The 1842 Treaty of Nanking formalized the robbery: silver indemnities, foreign-controlled treaty ports, and the ceding of territory like Hong Kong. “Free trade” meant something very precise: China would be shackled, bled of its silver, and flooded with dope.

This drained not just silver but life from the countryside. Taxes were still demanded in silver even though peasants lived by barter and grain. As specie drained outward, the Qing state squeezed its own peasantry harder. Families starved not because of drought, but because London bankers needed their cut.

China was not “opened up.” It was cracked open. Its villages—self-sufficient, kin-based, rhythmic—were hooked to the violent circuits of global capital. Opium in, silver out. Land taxes up, rebellion in the making.

This wasn’t a tragic accident. It was policy. The British bourgeoisie weren’t just balancing accounts; they were addicting millions to keep the silver flowing and the empire intact. As in India, Ireland, and Egypt, “modernization” meant dispossession, famine, and military occupation. The Qing emperor still wore dragon robes, but his treasury now served London.

Out of this contradiction—the foreign plunder from without and the bureaucratic parasitism from within—came the Taiping Rebellion. It wasn’t nostalgia for an “old order.” It was the uprising of millions against the twin jaws of landlord and empire. A premature revolution, yes—but one that showed how global capitalism created its own gravediggers even in places it had only just invaded.

**II. Of God and Guns: The Fetishism of the Rebel Specter**

When peasants rise, they don’t carry Hegel under their arms. They carry dreams. But dreams are not illusions—they are the compressed form of real hunger, real rage, real need. The bourgeoisie, trapped in its own idols of profit and “rationality,” dismisses this as “fanaticism.” Yet the gods of the Taiping did not fall from heaven; they were born in the rice fields, in debt, in the humiliation of failed exams, and in villages drained of silver by foreign dope peddlers.

Hong Xiuquan, mocked endlessly as a lunatic who called himself Christ’s younger brother, was no more “deluded” than the French revolutionaries quoting ancient Rome. In a world where British gunboats enforced opium addiction as free trade, who is the real fanatic? Hong’s visions gave the peasants a language for what they already knew they wanted: land, food, dignity, vengeance. The form was Christian, the content was revolutionary.

The Taiping’s Christianity was not the opium of European missionaries. It was a forged weapon, shaped by exam failure, landlord plunder, and imperial humiliation. Hong’s Christ was no meek shepherd; he was a hammer for smashing kings. The gospel of the Taiping was not about saving souls—it was about abolishing landlords, Manchu elites, foreign merchants, and every parasite who fattened on peasant misery.

Their “Ten Heavenly Commandments” outlawed private property, prostitution, opium, and idle wealth. In them you hear not theology but memory: a moral economy of the village, turned into divine law. They did not hallucinate equality; they reasserted it. Christianity was only the costume—underneath was peasant communism, older than both the cross and the crown. This is why the movement spread not in ports or cities, but in villages of labor. The poor saw themselves in it.

Bourgeois historians still call the Taiping “irrational,” as if rebellion against misery requires footnotes. They say religion doomed them. But who are the mystics here? The peasants who used myth as a weapon—or the professors who insist that markets are eternal, property sacred, and silver divine? To call the Taiping irrational is to call revolt irrational in a world that starves children for profit.

The Heavenly Kingdom was not some bizarre mistake in history. It was the logical outcome of a society ripped apart by landlords and foreign capital, with no industrial proletariat to lead the charge. The peasants reached for revolution with what they had: memory, myth, muskets. Their ideology was contradictory, improvised, uneven—but it pointed in the right direction: against empire, against the state, against the rich. That made it more radical than any liberal reform or missionary sermon.

When Hong declared himself the son of God, he was not simply chasing delusion. He was abolishing hierarchy itself—saying that a poor man from Guangdong could claim heaven as his inheritance. The emperor demanded worship as the “Son of Heaven.” Hong turned the title upside down and gave heaven to the peasantry. That is not madness—it is class war in the language of dreams.

The specter of the Taiping lingers, not as a tragic folly but as a reminder of possibility. The European bourgeoisie feared them not because they were irrational, but because they were precise. In the Taiping fire they saw something unforgivable: a society where land could not be bought or sold, where silver had no throne, and where peasants refused to beg for mercy but demanded heaven—and meant it on earth.

**III. The Agrarian Question in the Taiping Program: Communal Land, Abolition of Private Property, and the Peasant Commune**

Every peasant war carries the same ghost—the ghost of the commune. The Taiping were no exception. Like the German peasants before them or the Haitian maroons beside them, they rose not out of some abstract manifesto but from hunger, debt, and the unbearable weight of taxes. Their “Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty” was not dreamed up by philosophers; it was hammered out of misery. When the belly is empty, theory follows the stomach.

Their declaration was simple and terrifying to landlords everywhere: *“All under heaven belongs to all.”* No private property in land, equal plots for every family according to capacity, grouped in cooperative households. A society of use, not profit. A village organized around the granary, not the market. In other words: agrarian communism—far ahead of its time, and far more radical than any liberal tinkering the Qing court or British missionaries ever dared.

Here, the commune reappeared not as a relic of the past but as a revolutionary form. Each household tilled, each household shared. Granaries replaced merchants, cooperation replaced rent. Silver—the toxic currency of British traders and Qing tax collectors—was to be abolished. The parasites of the old order—gamblers, concubine traders, opium pushers—were struck down with the full weight of revolutionary morality. This was not backwardness; it was an attempt to build a rational, collective metabolism in the ashes of empire.

There is nothing mystical here. Peasants everywhere, when freed from the grip of landlords and markets, move instinctively toward collective survival. The Andean *ayllu*, the Indian village commune, the Russian *mir*—all testify to the same truth: when famine stalks, no one survives alone. Communism begins as necessity long before it becomes theory.

The Taiping system carried contradictions, as all revolutions do. Women were brought into the collective field, freed from some patriarchal burdens but still fenced off from men. Urban workers and artisans were scarcely integrated. Their program was ambitious but confined; visionary but hemmed in by the limits of a peasant base. They could abolish rent, but not the gunboats offshore. They could plan harvests, but not the global markets already dictating silver, opium, and cotton. Their commune, however heroic, remained cornered by empire.

This is both their strength and their weakness. Without capital, they abolished capital. Without a proletariat, they foreshadowed its necessity. They fought to purify the land, not to industrialize it. They sought justice in the village even while injustice ruled the seas. That contradiction is not a moral failing—it is structural. A peasant insurrection alone cannot overthrow a society already bound in the chains of the world market.

Yet their vision endures. Land without landlords, labor without wages, surplus without profit—these were not fantasies. They were real measures, briefly lived, that showed a different road. And that is why capital and empire crushed them with such ferocity. Not because the commune was “inefficient,” but because it worked. Because it proved, however briefly, that another world was possible—a world where land is valued not as rent, but as life.

**IV. War Communism and the Revolutionary Dictatorship of the Peasantry**

Every class carries its own signature when it seizes power. The bourgeoisie builds its republic in stock exchanges and coffee houses. The proletariat, when it matures, takes the factory as its fortress. The peasantry, by contrast, builds its revolution knee-deep in mud and blood. The Taiping were no exception. Having declared the end of landlordism, they found themselves surrounded—by the Qing court, by British and French gunboats, by the comprador merchants fattened on silver and opium. Under siege, their commune had no choice but to become an army, and their army no choice but to become the state.

This was not betrayal—it was necessity. In the face of encirclement, the Taiping militarized every aspect of life. Villages became regiments, farms became supply depots, households were synchronized with logistics. Rations replaced markets; distribution replaced exchange. Bourgeois historians later sneered at this as “despotism,” but that is ideology speaking. In reality, it was war communism before the term existed: a crude, improvised, but rational attempt to subordinate production to collective survival under siege.

Each Taiping unit tilled its own fields, supplied its own mess halls, and defended its own land. Agriculture was reorganized around the needs of the war machine, and the military hierarchy became the nervous system of the revolution. When rigidity and authoritarianism crept in, they were not the fruit of ideology but of survival. A revolution cannot play by the rules of liberal parliaments when it is fighting for its life against cannon fire and famine.

Here lies the contradiction of the peasant revolution: it must centralize to survive, but in centralizing it begins to resemble the very verticality it once sought to abolish. Without industry to escape scarcity, without a proletariat to socialize production beyond the village, the commune hardens into a barracks. The dictatorship of the Taiping was not a dictatorship of one class over another, but the dictatorship of survival over all else.

And yet, even under the pressure of war, the Taiping military bore revolutionary features that terrified the ruling classes. This was no feudal host bound by lineage, no mercenary army bought by silver. It was a people’s army, organized through common grievance and collective discipline. Women not only served, but commanded. Rank was earned, not inherited. Redistribution was enforced by soldiers who themselves had lived as tenants and debtors. This was not simply a war *in* the countryside—it was war *of* the countryside, aimed squarely at the cities of silk, silver, and subordination.

For a moment, the peasantry seized political power. Not as a class destined to rule, but as a class thrust forward by history. Their rule abolished rent but could not abolish scarcity. Their communes sustained millions but could not withstand siege and blockade. Their dictatorship was real, but provisional—heroic, luminous, and ultimately unsustainable in a world already dominated by global capital.

Still, the Taiping regime remains proof of possibility. It showed that the peasantry, disciplined by war and animated by vision, could rupture the old order on a continental scale. Not because the peasantry carries the future in its plough, but because it clears the ground for one. Theirs was not a dictatorship of ignorance, but of clarity: the knowledge that peace under empire is nothing but slow death, and that land without justice is slavery. In the end, the Taiping’s crime was not their fanaticism, but their lucidity—they showed, for a brief moment, that the people could govern themselves.

**V. The Counterrevolution: Qing Restoration, Anglo-French Intervention, and the Global Bourgeoisie**

No ruling class in history has ever surrendered its power to righteousness. And no empire, once bloodied, simply collapses—it is propped up, patched, and refinanced by its creditors. The fall of the Taiping was not a matter of excess zeal or naïve vision, nor reducible to internal contradictions. It was strangled in its cradle by the marriage of a dying feudalism to a rising capitalism. The Qing dynasty, hollowed of legitimacy, survived not by its own strength but by mortgaging sovereignty to the world market and selling the peasantry as collateral to Western finance.

British and French arms, tested already in the Opium Wars, returned to China—not to topple a state, but to preserve one against its own subjects. The European bourgeoisie, confronted with the specter of landless peasants seizing the soil, rushed to the Qing court’s defense. London’s bankers knew nothing of Hong Xiuquan, but they knew the danger of his program: the abolition of rent, of silver, of commerce itself. Where free trade failed, cannon spoke. The suppression of the Taiping was among the first modern counterinsurgency campaigns: foreign capital, comprador elites, and imperial armies converging to extinguish revolution from below.

The mechanism was material, not mystical. The “Ever Victorious Army,” led by Anglo-American mercenaries and financed by Shanghai merchants, was a prototype of imperial subcontracting: privatized violence deployed for public repression. Alongside came the instruments of capitalist war—breech-loading rifles, steam transports, war loans, and intelligence networks. Behind them followed missionaries, opium traders, and consular treaties. Europe’s Christian empires did not fear the Taiping’s theology; they feared its economics.

The Taiping faced not merely a dynasty, but a system. A system that could absorb any reform but land redistribution, tolerate any creed but the abolition of property. Capital recognizes no flag but profit, no morality but accumulation. Once humiliated by foreign gunboats, the Qing court was refashioned as junior partner in global accumulation: furnished with loans, weapons, and diplomatic recognition in exchange for repression. In this role, the dynasty became less a sovereign than the armed wing of international capital draped in Confucian silk.

The massacres that followed—tens of millions dead, villages erased, harvests burned—were not incidental. They were the price of restoring order to disrupted circuits of value. Depopulation was not simply vengeance; it was counterinsurgency by famine. Landlordism was reimposed with bayonets, markets reopened over ashes, labor driven back into submission by terror. For the world system, the ultimate imperative was the uninterrupted flow of commodities—and if this required oceans of blood, so be it.

The true horror lies not in the cruelty itself, which history has seen before, but in its orchestration. The very powers that preached liberty in Europe financed extermination in Asia. British liberals toasted “peace restored” in China while their merchants trafficked opium for silver and silver for tea. Civilization advanced on rails laid across corpses.

The Taiping fell not for lack of courage, but because they stood alone at the juncture of feudal collapse and capitalist expansion—an impossible station for any one class. Without urban allies, without proletarian solidarity abroad, they were encircled. Their defeat is a bitter lesson in internationalism: the enemies of revolution cooperate across oceans, and the revolution must do the same if it is to endure.

Yet their annihilation is also a warning to the victors. For every commune razed, memory persists. The Taiping revealed to the peasantry that empires bleed, that landlords can fall, and that even thrones tremble before barefoot insurgents with hoes and sacred visions. This is why they were not merely defeated but erased, slandered, and entombed in imperial historiography. Their danger was not only in what they did, but in what they proved possible. And it is why their resurrection—in memory, in struggle, in spirit—remains inevitable.

**VI. Ruins and Embers: The Historical Legacy of the Taiping Commune**

History does not advance in triumphal processions—it lurches through ruins. And in those ruins, the revolutionary class finds inheritance, not in marble memorials, but in unburied bones. The Taiping Commune, though drowned in steel and fire, did not vanish. It smolders beneath the surface of Chinese history, less a “failed rebellion” than a premature rupture: an aborted synthesis of agrarian revolution and anti-imperialist war.

Bourgeois historians, eager to sterilize revolt, have embalmed the Taiping as chaos, fanaticism, or folly. But a dialectical reading reveals something else: the first great modern attempt to overthrow landlordism, expel imperial domination, and build a social order grounded not in commodity exchange but communal distribution. They were not anachronistic relics—they were anticipations.

The Taiping vision did not perish at Nanjing. It migrated. In the Boxer Uprising, their militancy resurfaced. In the anti-imperialist revolts of the early republic, their hatred of comprador elites reemerged. And in 1949, their agrarian egalitarianism was reborn in the revolutionary land reform of the People’s War. The Communist Party, whatever its later mutations, inherited the terrain cleared by the Taiping. The dialectic marched forward—but carried their ashes in its teeth.

Let us be precise: the Taiping lacked the material conditions for socialist revolution. They had no proletariat, no industrial base, no scientific Marxism. But they possessed something else—the spontaneous clarity of the oppressed in motion, the collectivist instinct of the village, the class hatred of famine. They embodied what might be called *revolutionary intuition*: a raw, pre-theoretical negation of a world that could not be lived in.

Their commune bore contradictions. Gender equality was proclaimed, yet constrained. Property was abolished, yet scarcity endured. Centralization was necessary, yet suffocating. But these were not signs of failure—they were the marks of a people reaching beyond their epoch, building with tools of feudalism amid the rubble of empire. They stretched toward a horizon history had not yet furnished.

It is easy to mourn the Taiping as martyrs, but truer to remember them as pathbreakers. Their defeat instructs: no revolution survives in isolation from global class struggle; the peasantry can ignite revolt but cannot alone carry it to completion; spiritual fervor may mobilize, but must yield to material planning. Yet their struggle also teaches that revolution’s soil is not only the factory floor—it lies too in the furrowed fields, in the broken backs of peasants who dream of justice.

Revolutionary history is not a straight ascent but a spiral. The Taiping insurrection marked a violent turn of that spiral—a prelude to the great wars of national liberation and agrarian socialism to come. They were not an end, but a beginning denied. Their banners torn, their capital burned, their king slain—yet village memory endures. The whisper persists: that land can be held in common, that production can serve need, that heaven can be brought to earth—not through prayer, but through class war.

**VII. Concluding Reflection: On the Specter of Peasant Communism**

There is a specter haunting world history—not the salon-communism of Europe’s theorists, but its peasant form: barefoot, bloodied, hoe in hand. The Taiping Rebellion was the most advanced expression of this specter in the nineteenth century, a rising of the rural masses who, long before the industrial proletariat matured into its revolutionary role, had already begun to negate property, hierarchy, and empire from below. Their commune did not await capitalism’s development—it sought to abolish it before it fully arrived.

Here lies the contradiction bourgeois history cannot resolve: if capitalism is the supposed precondition for socialism, how do we explain those eruptions—Taiping, Haiti, the Paris Commune—where the oppressed attempted to leap over it? The answer is not to dismiss them as premature, but to recognize them as foreshadowings: anticipatory revolts against the order yet to come. Their so-called “failure” does not confirm capitalism’s inevitability—it proves that the oppressed will always attempt to make history before history permits it.

Primitive accumulation is not an event confined to capitalism’s birth; it is a permanent process—ceaseless dispossession, extortion, and destruction of non-capitalist life. The Taiping arose not in spite of this, but because of it. They were its negation, crystallized into motion. What the factory did to the worker, the treaty port and tax collector did to the peasant. And like the worker, the peasant rebelled—armed not with machines, but with memory, faith, and collective hunger.

To reduce the Taiping to zealotry or chaos is not mere academic error—it is ideology in service of counterinsurgency. It obscures the revolutionary kernel within the revolt, rendering its threat illegible. The European bourgeoisie did not fear the Heavenly Kingdom’s theology; they feared its abolition of rent, its expulsion of merchants, its rejection of landlords and bankers. It was not heresy—it was communism in embryo.

The commune reappears across history—in China, in the Andes, in Russia, in the insurgent villages of Vietnam and Algeria—not as relic, but as recurring nightmare for capital. It emerges wherever the soil remembers common use, wherever labor retains collective rhythm, wherever people recall feeding themselves outside markets. These survivals are precisely what capital must extinguish to claim it is the only future.

Yet the commune does not die. It returns—in revolt and in memory, in insurgency and imagination. Its fire can be drowned, but its embers smolder, breathing beneath the asphalt of empire. The Taiping were no accident; they were history’s refusal to submit. Their commune was not an endpoint, but a prologue.

Thus we conclude not in mourning, but in preparation. For the specter walks still. It haunts dams built over ancestral rivers, stirs in soil poisoned by foreign mines, lingers in the hunger of those who labor yet do not eat. And the next time it rises, it will not rise alone—but with allies in every factory, every port, every village and city. Not as rebellion, but as revolution complete.",1,1758662792.0,MarxistCulture,1,1.0,False

1nottia,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1nottia/unsure_of_how_to_navigate_silent_treatment_by_my/,Unsure of how to navigate silent treatment by my mom,"I (30f) and getting the silent treatment from my mom (50f). Essentially what happened is that I was staying over at my parents' house and in the evening my mom asked if I could drive her to a shop.The next day was an incredible emotionally taxing day as my dad (who also has emotionally abusive tendencies) blew up at me in the morning for something I had nothing to do with, and my brother also misdirected his frustration at me as he was really upset and frustrated about things our dad had been saying to him (I don't blame my brother for this, he was very apologetic and we talked about it later and grew from it).

I then went to the living room where my mom was sitting and she started expressing her frustrations about my dad. She also has a gross habit of telling me about their sex life which I have MANY times (literally from my early teens) been very firm with her about to not tell me but she just does not stop. So I snapped and said 'Mom, please stop telling me things you should not be telling me about my own father, I am your daughter not your friend' and because I was angry I left the room to cool off. I made my self a coffee and went back in after I got my emotions under control, and sat on the couch. Then she asked me if I'm still keen to go to the shop, and I had told her 'I don't really want to go, but if you want to go I can drive you.' I understand she felt rejected by me saying this. She flipped then and said how she knew I would do this, and she left the room shouting a bunch of stuff. She went into her own room, when she does this she typically locks the door and doesn't come out or let people in. This kind of paralyzed me and I just went into feeling really numb, my emotions were completely drained because of my experiences through the day and I ended up getting my phone out and scrolling for a while. I had a very little cry but just wanted to distract my self.

After about an hour my brother came down and asked me what my plans are, and I told him what happened and how guilty I feel. I called our mom (she wouldn't have opened the door) to say that I can bring her, and I said something along the lines 'of course I'm not excited about going to a store I have nothing to do at (why would I be?) but that as I said I can take her if she wants me to bring her'. She started shouting saying that she is outside and does not want to go anymore, and that she can go there herself or with someone else and that she doesn't need me, and that I should leave and that I don't need to wait to say bye to her in person (I live in an other city and was meant to be going home that afternoon). This really upset me because I make a lot of effort travelling up regularly to see them (over the last 11 years they have only come to mine about a total of 5 times while I go to theirs at minimum every two weeks but usually more often. The main reason I do so is to see my siblings.).

Anyway after I went home I sent her a message explaining my side, she never replied. Normally we call every day, but I could feel that she wanted space from me so I gave it a few days, then when I called her about 3 days later she picked up but was very dry and short and only answered questions I asked. We spoke for about 45seconds in total. I called her again a couple of days later, and then she didn't answer. Now it's been a month exactly that we haven't spoken. I know that this is emotional abuse, I know that how sh\*t and guilty I feel is by design, but I find it so difficult to feel happy the last weeks. I keep feeling this sadness droning, and it's put me into cycles of just having no energy because my mind is in overdrive, or im binging or doom scrolling.

My therapist has encouraged me to go over and speak to her to stand up for my inner child, and said this could help. Her recommendation was to speak over an activity, like cooking. What I told my therapist is that 1) i don't think my mom would let me into the kitchen, and 2) I would not feel safe around my mom with knives nearby as she has used them threateningly before and is someone who can flip in an instant. I would not trust her at all in an environment like that.

I'm trying to see if there are good sides to this situation, and I'd like to connect more to those things, but I'm just not really managing to (yet, I hope). My relationship with my mom is so complicated and abusive, surely it should/could feel good that I have some space from it? Instead I truly just feel so guilty, and shameful and like no body loves me. It feels really unnatural being rejected by the person who gave birth to you. I just don't know what to do or how not to let this negatively impact me. I want to be able to see the upsides of this situation and to navigate it in a way that is healthy for me.

I didn't mean to make this so long winded. If anyone has read this far, thank you so much for your time.

Edit: I should add it's very typical for my mom to use silent treatment, but it's never been to this extent before. In the past I also would've either continued calling, or gone over and pushed us talking about it by addressing it and saying how stupid this is and that I'm sorry etc. I honestly just don't have the energy for any of that anymore, and although it's paired with so much sadness and grief I now feel like if this is the path she wants to take, she can. I don't want to fix it for us anymore. I just wish I could also help the deep sadness I feel.",2,1758662502.0,emotionalneglect,1,1.0,False

The nightmare was so vivid, so surreal. I woke up on the floor of my bedroom. The door was cracked open. I KNOW I locked it last night, and did I fall off the bed? I was reeling. Who or what opened the door? What brought on that grotesque nightmare? I must be sleepwalking or something, I tried to tell myself to ease my mind. My body was sore all over, especially my hands, like I had been working out. I checked the time, 5:22 p.m. I had been out for almost fourteen hours, but I was still exhausted. “Damnit” I thought out loud. I missed my video appointment with my psychiatrist. I absolutely needed to speak to them. I called their office and the receptionist informed me the doctor agreed to still have a video appointment with me before they left the office for the day. About 45 minutes later I spoke to my doctor. 

I told them about everything. The dread I feel being alone in the house, and how bone chilling I found it. My imagination, going to dark unsettling places. The ‘gift’ I found from my husband's belongings and it disappearing after that diabolical experience that I… think I had? The terrifying nightmare that made me never want to sleep again. The emptiness and the deep depression I am constantly being smothered by. 

I wasn’t happy with our conversation. She basically chalked it up to my increased stress and trauma of losing my husband, me grieving his loss and trying to come to terms with it. I understand that could 100% be a factor but I stressed that I didn’t feel safe and was horribly worried something bad was going to happen. I swear she rolled her eyes as she told me I just needed to give my brain time to process everything and that I was going to be fine. She did finally decide to bump up the dosage of my antipsychotic medication and that gave me a small glimmer of hope. Maybe this would help give me some peace of mind. It did not.

Over the next week I had more dark experiences. Every time I was in sight of the basement door I had those same malevolent, momentarily lapses of paralysis like something was gripping my soul trying to rip it from my body. I even thought I heard faint whispers seeping from it. I started going out the front door around the house to get to the kitchen just to avoid the basement. I ended up having another morbid, disturbing nightmare. 

It started like the first one with me standing in infinite darkness with a scene lit up from an unseen light source in front of me. It was a peculiar tree. It had an uncanny shape like a crude stick figure. From the ground rose two gnarled trunks that angled towards each other and fused together at the center. From there two shambled branches sprouted outwards like raised ghostly arms forming a ‘V’ shape. In the valley of the two wretched limbs rested a large haunting burl. It had two deep empty sockets where eyes could or should be and a large hole forming a dreaded gaping wide mouth. Much like the first dream my body moved against my will. Laying on the ground next to the tree a small splintered axe. I approached it and picked it up, grasping it as hundreds of splinters entered my skin with intense piercing pain. I screamed on the inside. Blood began seeping through my clenched fingers as I raised the axe, winding back as if to hit a homerun. I lurched forward driving the axe’s head into that burl of the tree. The sound was grotesque and unexpected. Instead of a thunk you might hear from chopping wood I was greeted with a squishy meaty thud instead. Dark sap splattered from the fresh wound onto my face. I heard a guttural gasp of breath leave its would-be mouth. I rocked the axe up and down to free it and followed up with several more consecutive blows to the tree. Each one met with wet meaty splats or sickening cracks always followed with spattering of deep dark amber colored sap. I eventually chopped deep enough into the limbs that I gripped them with my bleeding splintered hands and began twisting the limbs savagely trying to separate them from the tree. Each twist brought visceral wet tearing and sickening pops until a final rip, freeing it from its body. I did this for each limb and finally the burl. It  brought a troubling, unwanted satisfying pop\*!\* I held the mass in my grip as I watched the sap drain until the last staggered drops ceased to drip. 

It was followed by another familiar terrible scene. The small silhouette in the distance caught my attention and just like before it came for me. Rushing at a thousand miles an hour the dreaded basement door stalked me once again. This time I was glued down by the drying sap. I couldn’t look away. I was frozen, slack jawed. The door clicked and creaked open little by little, then boomed open, almost breaking from the henges. Pure darkness greeted me. I tried with every fiber of my being to run, to move, to budge at all. I couldn't even wiggle a finger. Then I felt something cold and unseen grip around my whole body slowly ripping me away from my sappy prison. My arms were cemented to the floor but my body didn’t wait for them. My skin ripped at the shoulder, followed by my bones popping from their sockets. This time an ear piercing scream escaped me. I was pulled closer and closer to the door. My skin finally tore away successfully leaving my arms behind. My veins and arteries still clung hopelessly to them stretching further and further until they ripped, freely dangling like glistening ribbons. Pulses of blood spurted constantly from them. My screaming stopped, as my vision was going. Then suddenly, I was torn away into the darkness of that dreaded basement, door slamming behind me.

I gasped myself awake trying to catch my breath. My hands and arms were throbbing. My head was pounding and I felt sick to my stomach. I was on the cold hard floor, downstairs in front of the basement door. My heart sank and filled with dread. I wasted no time, I lunged forward and slammed it shut engaging the lock and deadbolt. I ran away from it as fast as I could. How the hell did I get down there? I grabbed my keys, jumped in the car and floored it the hell out of there.

Part 6

I checked into a nearby motel. I was holed up there for nearly a week until I realized my husband's paycheck never came that payday. I vaguely remember a conversation with the financial office saying I would need to apply for survivor benefits for him but I was so overwhelmed with the memorial service, the reception and all this madness I have been going through that it completely slipped my mind. I also received a phone call that Mark's ashes were ready to be picked up. I didn’t want to drain what little savings we had in the savings account, I would need it for bills and groceries. I also haven’t been able to pay the contractors to continue the work on the house for a while either. So, after I picked up Mark’s ashes I went to the financial office and filled out the required paperwork. I was told it could take anywhere from three to eight weeks before I may receive the first deposit. I had no choice, I had to go back to that damned house. I didn’t know anyone from around this area so I had no support system to turn to outside of my mother several states away.

When I returned home I made it a point to keep myself busy. I decided to work on sculpture commissions on Etsy. Sculpting was my passion. I could lose myself while sculpting and it made me feel so at peace, usually. It was hard to get that same feeling now for obvious reasons distracting me. Nevertheless I was able to complete my first piece in three days. That was $300 that I desperately needed.

I also decided to get new locks for the house. Several times that week I discovered unlocked or opened doors throughout the house, including the outside doors, that I know for a fact I closed and locked. The locks came in the next day. After a couple hours and a helpful youtube tutorial I got a lot done. I added deadbolts to every door in the house, some now adorned two deadbolts but that's just an extra layer of defense I told myself. I got two of the three locks for the outside replaced. One lock was defective so I had to send it back and await a new one to come in. I really wished the locks made me feel better but if I am being honest they didn’t. 

That week was Mark’s and my anniversary. I felt terrible knowing I was going to be spending it alone. It probably sounds pathetic but I decided to celebrate it like he and I always did, with a late night picnic on the beach. It wasn’t easy for me to get myself to do it. I knew I would look crazy out there by myself with a candlelit picnic, but after much thought and consideration, I thought it would be a nice way to celebrate him. It was also an excuse to get some reprieve from this hellhole. 

In preparation I dug out our beautiful picnic basket. It was a black stained wicker basket. Inside were two sets of plates, bowls and teacups each fashioned to the inner sides of the basket and underside of the lid in their own dedicated places. They were white porcelain with silver trim on the rim of each piece and beautiful black roses danced around the perimeters. Two sets of bright silver cutlery were also strapped under the lid. Neatly packed inside was a black and white checkered picnic blanket as well as several candles with silver candleholders. This basket was one of our first purchases as a newly wed couple eight years ago. That was a wonderful day.

I also couldn’t go out there alone so I  found a small vial that I fashioned into a cute necklace to hold his ashes in, to wear around my neck. Next I found one of his service dress pictures from the Air Force and placed it into a picture frame to take with me. The last thing was the food. We had a silly tradition. We wrote a list of foods that we have heard of but never tried and would make an effort to be adventurous by picking up a dish that we decided on and try it out on the picnic. I retrieved the list from between the plates in the basket and unfolded it. There was our little list. Fifteen dishes written on it with seven crossed out. Some of the notable crossed out ones were: *Cevishe* with a vomiting face drawn next to it, *Pho* with “meh” written next to it, and *Chicken Tikka Marsala* with “HELL YES!” written next to it. I remembered each of those nights vividly. We had no idea what Ceviche was and laughed a lot that night after he threw up all over the blanket after one bite. After scanning the list I decided on *Kebab* for that night. After getting ready and gathering the things I clenched the vial hanging from my neck, took a deep breath and left for the beach.

Part 7 

After picking up the food I arrived at the beach. I was surprised and disappointed with how many people were there at night. I had to walk quite a way down to get a section of beach without anyone nearby. I unpacked the basket, laid out the blanket and set up Mark’s picture. As I started pouring two glasses of our favorite wine I got a knot in my stomach when a small convoy of  ATVSs with a bunch of rowdy teenagers crested over the sand hill. They were all hooting and hollering and being obnoxiously loud. I contemplated packing up and leaving then and there but decided against it when I laid eyes on Mark’s photo. Once again I clenched the vial in my hand and continued doing my thing trying to ignore the kids. I could hear faint mentions of me from them and saw them looking over at me several times as they started up a campfire. It was hard not to overhear them. 

The kebab was amazing. I put it up to his picture as if to let him try it and asked “good huh?” as my heart started swelling up. Next thing I know a football ball came crashing in shattering a plate and spilling everything. I was shocked, trying to figure out what just happened. One teen ran over and gave a sarcastic “oopsie” with a large devilish grin on his face. As I looked over his nose wrinkled and brow furrowed in disgust as he said “what are you doing freak?”, his gaze settling on the picture frame. I grabbed it and pulled it to my chest. “Nothing, leave me alone”. “Wow, you look pathetical!” he said, cackling out a laugh. “Lets go Sam”, two of the girls yelled from the group. “Leave that weirdo alone”. He snatched the ball from the chaos it caused and ran away kicking up sand over everything. I started hyperventilating uncontrollably, a panic attack quickly ensued. I tried fixating on objects around me to calm me but it went on for a good six minutes. The whole time I could hear those little bastards laughing. I curled up and rolled over on my side still holding the picture close to me as I began sobbing. Before I knew it I drifted off. After some time I was woken up by a police officer shaking me awake.

“Ma’am…ma’am I need you to wake up.” I felt my shoulder being quickly shaken. I opened my eyes and was greeted by an officer from the local police department kneeling down with his hand on my shoulder. He stood up and grabbed a small notebook and pencil from his shirt pocket. “I need you to stand up for me ma’am.” I was really out of it but after a small struggle I brought myself to my feet, my whole body was aching. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to fall asleep here.” I said through a tired whisper. “Well, that's not the problem, I mean it’s dangerous to sleep out here but I need you to answer a few questions.” When my vision cleared I noticed another officer about 20 feet away. He was speaking with the kid that grabbed the ball earlier, the kid was talking and pointing in my direction. “Okay, what’s the problem officer?” I asked. “Ma’am did you attack these kids?” he asked. I scoffed, through a raised brow. “Wha- what? Excuse me?” I stammered. “That young man over there said you went over and cursed them out and then proceeded to choke him. I need you to be honest with me.” I was stunned, what the hell are they trying to pull here? “N-no, hello no! That little shit came and trashed my stuff with their ball and came over to me and talked shit. I just ignored them and I, guess I fell asleep.” My mind was racing. Why the hell would they lie like that? I didn’t do anything to them, this has got to be some kind of sick ass prank. “Do you think maybe you got mad and...wait…Mrs. Preston?” he asked as he came to some kind of realization. “Uhm yes?” I said in surprise. “I was part of the detail for your husband’s funeral service, I’m…I’m very sorry about your husband ma’am.” “Oh uh, thank you.” I replied, lowering my head. He gently tapped his pen on his chin, looked over at the kids and back at me, then let out a low “hmmmm”. “You know what, this ain’t the first time these kids have gotten into an altercation that the police had to intervene. They don’t have any proof of  what they’re claiming. Why don’t you just pack up and head home Mrs. Preston.” He flipped his notebook closed and tucked it away. I let a big sigh of relief out. “Oh, okay thank you sir.” I replied. I quickly began gathering my things up. “Have a good night ma’am and be safe driving home” he told me as he turned and walked towards the other officer. “What the hell? You’re letting that bitch leave?” The boy shouted as he noticed what I was doing. “Put her ass in jail man!” He said in a high-pitched voice. I finished packing and practically ran to my car. I never wanted to go out in public again.

Part 8

I felt deflated. Everything seemed to be going horribly for me. I was still plagued with several more of those ungodly nightmares, all following the same terrible formula as the ones before. Still waking up in parts of the house I didn’t fall asleep in. Waking up feeling like I had done full body workouts the night before. Sometimes waking up with minor injuries and occasionally what seemed to be black dried ink stains covering my hand or other parts of my body. One such time I woke up with every one of my fingers in excruciating pain, each of my fingernails bent backwards like I was clawing at something hard. I was still hearing and seeing things, unwanted. And, to top it all off I haven’t seen Dahlia or her kittens in weeks. I am terribly worried because on the back porch there were specs of what I believe to be dried blood and clumps of their hair. I really hope something bad didn’t happen to them but I had a feeling deep down that something did. 

One day while watching the local news there was a story covering a string of disappearances for the county I lived in. Apparently this is the third person in the last month to be reported missing. They showed pictures of each of the missing persons. The first was a small girl. She was seven years old. The picture showed a sweet little girl sitting atop a small pony. The girl had brown hair with braided hair and an adorable smile with two of her front teeth missing. She never made it home walking home from school. The next was a lady, 25 years old. Her picture was jarring though. It was a mugshot of a lady who appeared to be damn near 40. She coincidentally also had missing teeth but for obviously different reasons. She had dirty blonde hair up in a frizzy ponytail. She also had sores all over face and arms, and her skin had a weathered leathery appearance. She had all the tell-tale signs of being an addict of some sort. She went missing from a local homeless shelter. The third person was a high school teacher from the next town over. He was a good looking man, aged 32. He reminded me a lot of Clark Kent from Superman. He had a strong jawline and wore black thick framed glasses and had jet-black  hair neatly combed over to one side. He damn near looked like a Clark Kent cosplayer. He never showed up to school on a Monday to teach. This story made me very uneasy, as I shot a look at my doors thinking about how I keep finding them ajar.

The last lock did finally arrive but I came across a strange and unsettling realization when I went to install it. I was searching for the video I used before to install the locks. While going through my search history I found a search that I didn’t perform. “How to remove dead smell.” Chills ran down my spine, a feeling I have become all too familiar with. Who the hell used my computer? Did I accidentally search for that somehow? That's what I wanted to believe instead of some terrifying alternative. I quickly deleted that search as if to erase it from reality. I finally got the last lock replaced. If someone WAS entering the house they would half to make a bigger effort than using a key to the old locks.

Changing the locks changed nothing. I still found locked doors unlocked or left open. About a week after installing the last lock my husband's first survivors' benefits payment finally came in. I immediately went to amazon to order a surveillance system to install around my house. I wanted to make sure I could catch anything and everything freaky that's been happening here, so I splurged on high quality cameras. I got six 4k cameras with infrared nightvision capabilities. 

Part 9

The day finally arrived and I received the surveillance system. None of my husband's tools were here and I am one of the least tech savvy people on this god forsaken planet so I hired a handy man. I found Matthew through a Facebook group for my town after I made a help wanted post for a handyman. Matthew was nice enough albeit a bit too flirtatious. He took about three hours to install the cameras. He then showed me how to install and navigate the app which let me view the camera's live feed from my phone or view the recorded video on my laptop with up to 96 hours worth of saved footage before it recorded over itself. He tried to offer me a ‘discount’ if I would let him take me out to coffee or dinner. I quickly rejected his offer and paid him in full. He left with an embarrassed red smile on his face and left his number on the instruction manual in case I had questions or changed my mind about his offer.

The next two days were unordinarily ordinary. No nightmares, no waking up in a different room, no doors unlocked or opened. I felt a sense of relief I hadn't felt in some time. Maybe things were changing back to normal I thought. Then, on the third night things went back to horrifying  and my life as I knew it changed forever. It started with the nightmare. I found myself in that all too familiar darkness.

I gripped a large pig by its hind leg, dragging behind me with relative ease. The entire time it was whining and squealing but I wasn’t bothered by it. I dragged it over to a pile of various tools and instruments. The first items I picked up were some unusually long and rusted railroad spikes. I took one at a time viciously plunging it into the swine's legs. One spike per leg I stabbed it in, where the joint of the leg meets its body. Each one I plunged in, the pig squealed uncontrollably. After the last one I grabbed a nearby sledge hammer. I gripped it with both hands and raised it high above my head and drove it into the first spike. The pig went wild, squealing in agony as the spike pierced into the ground, pinning its leg down. The next swing missed the spike hitting it in the leg with a sickening crack as the leg was forced from its socket. The squealing intensified. It squirmed helplessly as its freshly liberating limb flopped around attached only by its skin. The second swing hit its mark and the pig exhaled a low wheezing gasp this time. Its squeals were replaced by gurgled breaths now. I drove in the last two spikes and pinned the beast down like a frog on dissection day in science class. 

I dropped the sledge hammer and reached for a straight razor. I unfolded the blade and swiftly went to work. I dug the blade into the belly of the pig ever so slightly, just under its throat. I pulled the blade towards me, slicing a paper thin layer of skin. The pig tried to let out a squeal but could only manage a pathetic squirm as its whole body writhed. I continued this for quite some time. When I was done, the whole body was a skinless heap of glistening fat and muscle. The pig was still conscious but just barely. Once it was barely still breathing, I grabbed one final tool. I took the giant pair of hedge shears and drove it down into what was unmistakably its exposed jugular. A tear followed by a blast of crimson spray exploded from the impact. Blood dripped from my face. 

I knew what came next. I was forcibly wrenched around as some unknown force gripped my throat and lifted me nearly three feet off the ground. Then, in the distance, I could see the door closing in fast. I started blacking out from the lack of oxygen, but before I did, the door arrived and immediately flung open. I was violently thrown into the darkness. The door slammed shut right behind me. Once again I woke from the nightmare gasping for air in a state of panic.

Part 10

When I woke I was still unbelievably tired. I had no energy and just felt defeated. I also realised I wasn’t in my bed where I fell asleep but laying facedown on the couch downstairs. I could barely move but I did manage to reach the TV remote and flick on the television. The weather was just finishing up, transitioning into a breaking news segment. I saw the date, Jesus, I’ve been out for days I realized! Then, another missing person report. I was met with a very familiar face. 27 year old Matthew Cuttingham last seen earlier that week leaving his apartment and never returning. “Holy shit!” I blurted out loud shooting upright on the couch. What the hell is going on? He was just here! Was I fucking next!? I ran to each of my doors making sure they were locked. I also pushed a piece of furniture in front of each door to barricade myself in. I checked all the windows in the house and made sure they were all secured. ‘Survellience!’ I thought to myself. 

I darted upstairs to my bedroom to retrieve my laptop. I snatched it off the charger and leaped on my bed. I quickly opened it and navigated to the app to view the recordings. I chose the day Matthew came over. I viewed camera one, which shows the side of the house where I park my car. 20 minutes after the feed went live I saw Matthew getting into his truck and driving away. I fast forward to the next day I saw myself leaving to go get groceries and return 45 minutes later with a few bags. The next night I saw myself walk out of the house and get in my car and drive off. Wait, did the video glitch? Is it showing the same video of me leaving to get groceries? I haven’t left the house since then. I checked the date and sure enough it’s from the next night. I fast forwarded another hour and a half. I see myself pull back up and get out of the car, then a figure gets out of the passenger seat, Matthew Cuttingham. “What the fuck!?” I yelled out. I picked up my phone to dial 911. 

In the video I grab him by the hand and lead him into the house through the kitchen door. I fast forward to see when he leaves. After quite a while of fast forwarding the video catches up to the live feed of the house. Wait he…he never left here? I rewind to the point where we enter the house and cycle the cameras. Camera four shows a view from the corner of the dining room past the basement door and into the kitchen. We step inside and take our coats off, I pull him close to me and kiss him. My stomach churned. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then I grab him by the hand again and lead him out of the kitchen. “911 what's your emergency?” I hear on the other side of the call. “Hello I…” I stopped speaking mid sentence as I saw myself unlock the basement door, open it and we both disappeared through the threshold. I dropped the phone and it crashed to the floor. “Hello? You dialed 911, do you have an emergency?” I faintly heard through the speaker. I quickly scooped up the phone and lied. “Sorry my kid must have dialed this number” and hung up. 

I stared blankly at the screen letting the video play in real time. Over an hour later I emerged from the basement. I wore a large apron, long black rubber gloves and some sort of safety glasses. It was black and white due to the lights being off but I stiffly walked over to the kitchen sink and took each piece of gear off and rinsed them off in the sink. After 20 minutes of this I carried the items back down to the basement and emerged once again empty handed. I turned and locked one lock on the basement and walked out of sight to the hallway towards the living room. Camera five shows me enter the living room and lie face down onto the couch. I fast forwarded, three days later and I hadn’t moved. Then, I see myself gasping for air as I wake up.

I started shaking uncontrollably. I didn’t want to but I had to go down into that basement. Reluctantly, I found my large flashlight, it was so bright it made it look like daytime in a dark room. I slowly creeped down the stairs. I grabbed the bat I keep near the door in case I ever had to go little league on someone’s ass. I walked through the living room down the hallway and turned the corner and am once again stun-locked in place when I see the basement door. My heart was going a thousand miles an hour. I began feeling hyper aware of everything around me. After a minute I broke free and finally managed to take a step towards the door. I slid my feet inch by inch. When I reached towards the door the air around it was ice cold. I slowly slid the door bolt and the door pulled free from its frame and creaked open ever so slightly. I pointed the light inside and the brightness somehow was being absorbed by the darkness. I could only see a few feet in front of me like there was some sort of veil limiting the reach of the light.

“Hello!?” I tried to yell into the dark but it came out more of a whimper. Urine streamed down my leg as I stepped down the first step. No sooner had I stepped through to the darkness than the door clicked and sealed itself behind me. I cried and quickly turned around but the door handle was immovable. I closed my eyes tightly and didn’t want to open them again. Then I began hearing the whispers. Different volumes, different pitches, different voices, all unintelligible. It sounded like a lost unknown language. I found myself stepping down the staircase, my body was moving against my wishes. I held the flashlight as far in front of me as I could to maximize the distance I could see. My foot eventually found flat ground. I was in the belly of the beast. I turned the corner and my foot found some kind of puddle losing stability. My foot slipped forward forcing my legs into the splits painfully pulling my groin muscle. The flashlight and bat both left my grip as I swiftly fell to the ground. 

I screamed in pain, doubled over as I struggled to pull my legs together once again. The light had settled on a short stone well. As soon as I laid eyes on it I heard that dreadful heartbeat. It thumped so loud I could barely think straight. I quickly covered my ears but it beat just as loud. Through the agony I noticed a mass hunched over the well. I scrambled over to the light and shined it closer to the mass. It was a body, pinned down to the well. All the skin had been flayed from its muscles. I tried to jump back but still couldn't gain any traction. I was stuck there next to it sloshing about in the wetness. I finally shined the light on the floor and saw I was practically swimming in the blood from the body. I grabbed on to the well and struggled to pull myself up. The light found its way to the face of Matthew hunched over, blood still dripping from his slit throat. I screamed again and fell back. 

Only for an instance the light revealed the most evil, horrific sight I have ever witnessed. It was only for a second but the image is forever burned into my brain. Huge, pure-white, dagger-like teeth formed an impossibly large, sinister grin beneath two almond-shaped eyes with large pupils, all set in an enormous, pitch-black, glistening, demonic face. With every blink, that image haunts me, projected on the inside of my eyelids. I tried to scream but nothing ever came. I grabbed onto something on the wall to try to pull myself up but it tore from the hook it hung on. The light revealed a small Hello Kitty backpack. I eventually found my footing and sprinted towards the stairs, once again my legs betrayed me. My foot found something small wrapped in a blanket or canvas of some kind, hurdling me forward. My head was greeted by the unwelcome touch of the hard brick wall. I felt warm blood running down my face, into my eye. I still gripped the light, I wasn’t letting go again. But then the light started fading. No, my vision did. Darkness slowly smothered my vision and with it my consciousness. I woke up in bed, my memory slowly started returning to me. I reached for my head where it hit the brick wall. It was perfectly fine. I…I did hit my head right? I know I did, it was too damn real. I looked myself over and I was clean. No injuries, no blood, no piss, no split open head, just sore all over like always. 

That was nearly a year ago now. The nightmares haven’t stopped. I still wake up where I shouldn't, still see things that shouldn’t exist, still see that unholy face every time I close my eyes. Those memories and experiences I’ve endured have left me calloused. Most days I just lie in bed, empty, soulless and completely devoid of emotion. I have even tried to end it all, multiple times, but every time, I always wake up unscathed. 

I’m laying in bed now, dead inside, trapped. I flick on the TV. The glow from it dimly fills the room. Another breaking news segment. Another missing persons report. Person number fifteen missing in these mysterious vanishings.

1notr23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1notr23/roommates_pointless_lie_has_made_me_extremely/,roommate’s pointless lie has made me extremely uncomfortable,"i live with my boyfriend and we also live with his best friend and his girlfriend.

my boyfriend, let’s call him Drew, and his friend aka the roommate, let’s call him Steve, created a business. Steve had to leave the apartment for 2 months for family issues. However it was agreed between drew and steve that once steve came back he would be focused on the business and working like crazy with drew. however he said he would take a week before starting the crazy work schedule to be with his girlfriend because they agreed to break up after that week.

during that week, steve asked to post pone twice. then, saturday night steve comes to me and drew and says he can’t work tomorrow because he has to do something urgent for his uncle and has to be with his grandma to pick her up from the airport at 10 am.

the next day we see steve and his girlfriend leave the apartment at 1 am. i have a lot of people on my find my friends app, steve’s girlfriend being one of them. i see her location and it’s six flags. i thought oh maybe steve his gf grandma and uncle all went. i checked periodically because my bf and i like to know where they are bc if we want to have intimacy or something, we like to know that they’re far from the apartment, etc. so at around 11 pm i see they head to atlantic city. steve tells drew that they went to atlantic city but no mention of six flags. 

so when i saw steve i asked how was six flags and he started to reply “it was-“ then he says “we didn’t go there. we went to atlantic city.” and i said i have your girlfriends location, you were there. and then he says oh we went there to get a coffee. looking back im like ? you need a ticket to enter. and he says they were there for a coffee real quick and then in the area running an errand for his uncle. which makes no sense because they were there all day at six flags, not the area. 

then my bf asks him later on how did it go with his grandma, steve says that it was nice and that they had to go pick up the stuff for his uncle from the manager at six flags that his grandma knows. then drew asked if he rode rides and he said yes for like an hour or two. however, while they were working together drew saw the six flags receipt on his laptop screen which steve quickly shut. 

so, now i feel really uncomfortable around him and his girlfriend because why are you lying about something so dumb? he could’ve been honest. and also because he literally has a business with my boyfriend and i live with him so of course im uncomfortable. 

i want to sit them both down and asked why they lied. i don’t know if this is too much. should my bf text steve and say we know the truth? and that he doesn’t need to lie because he won’t get upset. i kind of feel like this needs to be done in person. also because they’re super close. they call themselves best friends. what do you guys think we should do?

tl;dr: i live with my boyfriend and his best friend (steve), who is also his business partner. steve just came back after being away for 2 months and had agreed to buckle down and work hard on the business. he postponed twice, then said he couldn’t work one day because of urgent family stuff. but i saw through location sharing that he spent the whole day at six flags and later went to atlantic city with his girlfriend. when asked, he lied multiple times and didn’t admit to it. now i feel uncomfortable living with someone who lies so casually, especially when he’s in business with my boyfriend. should we confront him in person or what?",2,1758662340.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Planning to do a road trip around the area as well! Do you have a town you love? Have you moved somewhere that fits the bill? Lmk!

These are the things I'm looking for:

* Walkable downtown (coffee shop, diner, etc.)
* Regular community festivals
* Possibility for community involvement (town meetings, etc.)
* Bonus: townies! local kooky characters!
* Bonus: walkable elementary/high school

To start, ive seen the ways they are unkind to their workers and treat them like theyre disposable, despite always wanting to act kind and hospitable, asking about people’s personal lives, family, hobbies, etc. And yet they’ll fire anyone who wont tread under their feet like a dog and its happened enough times to start seeing a pattern. 

Not only that, but their business practices are built on penny pinching at every corner. Skimping on quality products and then price gouging their customers is their middle name. Just look at customer reviews for Percy: $40+ for undercooked steak and eggs, overpriced diner coffee despite being “coffee snobs”, and trying to overcompensate for it all by having a “sound lounge”, expensive-looking aesthetics and decor, while leaving everything else hollow: no true care to their craft, food, cooking, coffee, nothing. And to top this all off they try and play it off by being humble and “coming from nothing”, when the truth is, they’re just broke and dont know how to manage their own cash flow.

Anyone who thinks that article about how [Percy is a disappointing restaurant](https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/09/22/percy-review/) is ""too harsh"" has never seen these business owners behind the curtain. And those who are supporting them vocally right now are just the same circle jerks of restaurant owner lapdogs who will support them no matter how shitty they are.

I'm a junior dev, just a few months into my first real job, and I get handed a ticket that makes my blood run cold. There's a critical report in our ancient, monolithic legacy system that's failing. The catch? It only fails on the very last day of the month. The senior devs are all tied up, and my manager, with a grim look, says, 'This is a good learning opportunity.'

I dive into a codebase that feels like an archaeological dig. We're talking uncommented spaghetti code, variables named `x`, `temp`, and `data1`, and logic that was probably written when dial-up was still cool. For days, I'm just lost. I'm staring at the screen until my eyes burn, chugging stale office coffee, and questioning every life choice that led me here. I trace the date-handling logic, the database queries, the report generation module—nothing. It all looks... fine? My confidence is shot. I'm convinced I'm the worst programmer in history.

The end of the month is breathing down my neck, and the pressure is mounting. In a last-ditch effort, fueled by desperation and a final cup of coffee, I start reading the code line by literal line. And then I see it. A single, beautifully stupid line of code: `if (day == 31) { run_special_logic(); }`. My brain short-circuits for a second. The report wasn't failing on the *last day* of the month. It was succeeding on the *31st* of the month. The last three months had all been 31-day months, so the users just assumed it was a 'last day' bug. The original developer just... forgot about months with 30, 29, or 28 days.

I have never felt such a profound combination of blinding rage, hysterical laughter, and pure, unadulterated relief. The fix was literally changing `== 31` to check for the actual end of the month. I pushed the change, closed the ticket, and just leaned back in my chair, completely drained. The senior dev walked by, saw my expression, and just said, 'You found it, didn't you? The 31 bug. We've all been there.'

So, Reddit, what's the most face-palmingly simple bug that ever made you question your own sanity?",1,1758661930.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1notkfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/vndevs/comments/1notkfs/would_you_play_a_mythic_high_fantasy_visual_novel/,Would you play a mythic high fantasy visual novel like this?,"Hey,

I’m Malik, a US-based indie creator just starting this journey. I’m working on a new project called Dance of Destinies. A 3D visual novel in a realistic high-fantasy style. Think of it as Skyrim or Elden Ring meets a branching visual novel: instead of just fighting in the world, you live in it, interact with its people, and shape its destiny through choices, romance, and alliances.

**What it offers:**

* **Epic fantasy setting:** multiple races, cultures, and sub-races, each with their own clothing, architecture, and lore (imagine northern Celtic orcs, ice kingdom elves, dark gothic fantasy elves, Arthurian human kingdom humans, ancient Egyptian-inspired humans, mythic Greek and Roman human subraces, ancient Mesopotamian humans).
* **Races & cultures:** the world isn’t just humans and elves. You’ll encounter and interact with undead skeletons and liches, centaurs, fairies, merfolk, demons, angels, fallen angels, goblins, stonemen, vampires, werefolk, Medusa-folk, Atlantean peoples, half-beast clans, succubi, spider-folk, minotaurs… and many more. Each race (and even sub-races) carries its own history, stereotypes, weapons, armor, and cultural identity.
* **Branching narrative:** wars, romances, rivalries, betrayals, and destinies that can lead to light, shadow, or a twilight balance.
* **The Archetype System:** every character in the world is born under one of many archetypes. Most discover theirs in late-teenage ceremonies, though some cultures revere this tradition while others fear or suppress it. Archetypes shape how society views you, as blessed, cursed, or destined for greatness.
* **Cinematic presentation:** 3D renders with dramatic lighting, music, and effects (a mix of realistic and stylized anime-like flair).
* **Protagonist:** you play an Eclipse-born acolyte, revealed at your ceremony, who can rise as a feared or revered Twilight Templar.

**Inspirations:**

If you enjoy the scope and tone of:

* **Anime/Manhwa:** Sword Art Online (S1 & S3: Alicization), Berserk, Mushoku Tensei, Castlevania, Vinland Saga, Record of Lodoss War, The Beginning After the End, Attack on Titan, Claymore, Record of Grancrest War, Goblin Slayer
* **Games:** Skyrim (Elder Scrolls), Elden Ring, Dark Souls, World of Warcraft, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Assassin’s Creed, Castlevania
* **TV/Film:** Game of Thrones, The Witcher, Vikings, Spartacus, Rome, The Last Kingdom, El Cid, Medici, Rise of Empires: Ottoman, Domina, The Tudors, Merlin, Reign

…then you’ll recognize the kind of mythic yet emotional storytelling I am aiming for.

**Core tone:** High fantasy with light and shadow contrast, moments of beauty and hope alongside dread and tragedy.

**Question for you all:**

As VN fans, what would you most want to see in a visual novel like this? Would it be:

1. Strong romance and character arcs?
2. Rich world-building and cultural depth?
3. Smaller, intimate branching paths, where choices shape the fate of individuals and everyday lives (a prisoner, a shop, a family member, even a stray animal)? For example, in Act I you might decide whether to spare or condemn a captured bandit, changing how your village remembers you.
4. Big branching choices that affect the fate of nations? For example, the Act I ceremony where your archetype is revealed leads to reactions of awe, fear, or rejection, and sparks rivalries and alliances that ripple into wars later in the story.
5. Or a focus on cinematic presentation and atmosphere? 

**Tools:**

I would accomplish this in tools i am familiar with. These tools are:

* **Unreal Engine 5:** rendering, shading, rigging, propping, animating, vfx, and other scenarios, physics, interactive programming
* **Blender:** sculpting, modeling, hair creation, pbr texturing and retexturing, some other rendering that needs to be done
* **Ren'py:** visual novel programming

**A personal note:**

I’d love to hear from people who love visual novels and might be able to drop some knowledge or thoughts my way. Huge thanks in advance! Honestly, I’m just a guy about to start working on a fun project, so feel free to reach out and leave comments, whether professional, casual, or even silly.

**Extra info about me and the project:**

I’ve already picked up a lot of assets, plugins, kitbash packs, SFX, and music to speed up my workflow. For music, I may also commission tailor-made tracks if the project gains a following or support.

I have a programming background with some technical art/editor experience, so I’m comfortable setting up systems and pipelines.

I’ve reserved socials (Patreon, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Discord, Ko-Fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Kickstarter), but they’re placeholders until I have posts, renders, art, or music to share. I’ll be building them gradually starting now.

My goal: work toward a Kickstarter and demo. I’ll begin with developing characters, environments, scenes, lore, background stories, politics, branches, cultures, and aesthetics. If you’re interested in discussing the lore, and maybe even shaping it, or are just interested in being apart of this journey, feel free to reach out.",1,1758661908.0,vndevs,4,0.67,False
1notkch,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1notkch/unsure_of_how_to_navigate_silent_treatment_by_my/,Unsure of how to navigate silent treatment by my mom,"I (30f) and getting the silent treatment from my mom (50f). Essentially what happened is that I was staying over at my parents' house and in the evening my mom asked if I could drive her to a shop the next day. The next day was an incredible emotionally taxing day as my dad (who also has emotionally abusive tendencies) blew up at me in the morning for something I had nothing to do with, and my brother also misdirected his frustration at me as he was really upset and frustrated about things our dad had been saying to him (I don't blame my brother for this, he was very apologetic and we talked about it later and grew from it).

I then went to the living room where my mom was sitting and she started expressing her frustrations about my dad. She also has a gross habit of telling me about their sex life which I have MANY times (literally from my early teens) been very firm with her about to not tell me but she just does not stop.  So I snapped and said 'Mom, please stop telling me things you should not be telling me about my own father, I am your daughter not your friend' and because I was angry I left the room to cool off. I made my self a coffee and went back in after I got my emotions under control, and sat on the couch. Then she asked me if I'm still keen to go to the shop, and I had told her 'I don't really want to go, but if you want to go I can drive you.' I understand she felt rejected by me saying this. She flipped then and said how she knew I would do this, and she left the room shouting a bunch of stuff. She went into her own room, when she does this she typically locks the door and doesn't come out or let people in. This kind of paralyzed me and I just went into feeling really numb, my emotions were completely drained because of my experiences through the day and I ended up getting my phone out and scrolling for a while. I had a very little cry but just wanted to distract my self.

After about an hour my brother came down and asked me what my plans are, and I told him what happened and how guilty I feel. I called our mom (she wouldn't have opened the door) to say that I can bring her, and I said something along the lines 'of course I'm not excited about going to a store I have nothing to do at (why would I be?) but that as I said I can take her if she wants me to bring her'. She started shouting saying that she is outside and does not want to go anymore, and that she can go there herself or with someone else and that she doesn't need me, and that I should leave and that I don't need to wait to say bye to her in person (I live in an other city and was meant to be going home that afternoon). This really upset me because I make a lot of effort travelling up regularly to see them (over the last 11 years they have only come to mine about a total of 5 times while I go to theirs at minimum every two weeks but usually more often. The main reason I do so is to see my siblings.).

Anyway after I went home I sent her a message explaining my side, she never replied. Normally we call every day, but I could feel that she wanted space from me so I gave it a few days, then when I called her about 3 days later she picked up but was very dry and short and only answered questions I asked. We spoke for about 45seconds in total. I called her again a couple of days later, and then she didn't answer. Now it's been a month exactly that we haven't spoken. I know that this is emotional abuse, I know that how sh\*t and guilty I feel is by design, but I find it so difficult to feel happy the last weeks. I keep feeling this sadness droning, and it's put me into cycles of just having no energy because my mind is in overdrive, or im binging or doom scrolling.

My therapist has encouraged me to go over and speak to her to stand up for my inner child, and said this could help. Her recommendation was to speak over an activity, like cooking. What I told my therapist is that 1) i don't think my mom would let me into the kitchen, and 2) I would not feel safe around my mom with knives nearby as she has used them threateningly before and is someone who can flip in an instant. I would not trust her at all in an environment like that.

I'm trying to see if there are good sides to this situation, and I'd like to connect more to those things, but I'm just not really managing to (yet, I hope). My relationship with my mom is so complicated and abusive, surely it should/could feel good that I have some space from it? Instead I truly just feel so guilty, and shameful and like no body loves me. It feels really unnatural being rejected by the person who gave birth to you. I just don't know what to do or how not to let this negatively impact me. I want to be able to see the upsides of this situation and to navigate it in a way that is healthy for me.

I didn't mean to make this so long winded. If anyone has read this far, thank you so much for your time.

  
Edit: I should add it's very typical for my mom to use silent treatment, but it's never been to this extent before. In the past I also would've either continued calling, or gone over and pushed us talking about it by addressing it and saying how stupid this is and that I'm sorry etc. I honestly just don't have the energy for any of that anymore, and although it's paired with so much sadness and grief I now feel like if this is the path she wants to take, she can. I don't want to fix it for us anymore. I just wish I could also help the deep sadness I feel. ",2,1758661902.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

That’s how long [**LAv1**](https://lav1.com/) has been around — **the oldest SEO agency in Los Angeles**. Back when we started, Google wasn’t even born yet. Bruno Pisano, our founder, was already experimenting with ways to help small businesses get discovered online when most people were still figuring out how to install dial-up internet. (Yes, kids, the internet used to make *screeching noises* when you connected.)

[Bruno Pisano, Founder and Director of LAv1 SEO & Digital Marketing Agency for Small Business](https://preview.redd.it/yv92r2hfczqf1.jpg?width=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ece9c283f1ef713dd91c29e4654797c5818835bc)

Fast-forward three decades, and here we are: still helping small businesses thrive, but with tools and technologies that would’ve sounded like science fiction back in the ’90s.

# The Bruno Era (1995 and Beyond)

LAv1 began with [**Bruno Pisano**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lav1inc/), a marketing mind and athlete at heart. Before launching the agency, Bruno had a strong soccer background. The discipline, teamwork, and unshakable drive to win that he carried from the field shaped the foundation of LAv1. For him, there’s no such thing as “second best.” Challenges are simply matches to be won, and in business — just like in sports — victory is the only acceptable outcome.

In the early days, Bruno wore all the hats — designer, coder, strategist, salesman. He pioneered techniques that got local businesses ranked before Google became the global giant it is today.

**Fun fact:** Bruno’s first client didn’t even have a website. He built it, optimized it, and got them ranking—and suddenly their phone wouldn’t stop ringing. That’s when Bruno knew he was onto something big.

# Enter Ekaterina Pisano (2023) 

In 2023, Ekaterina Pisano joined the agency, bringing with her over 15 years of marketing experience. She had already led startups and managed large teams, carving out a reputation as a powerhouse in content creation, graphic design, web design, and UX.

Where Bruno brought competitive fire and deep SEO roots, Ekaterina added a modern creative edge. She quickly became the driving force behind our AI SEO revolution, making sure our clients were visible not just on Google, but also on the new wave of AI search platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. Together, Bruno and Ekaterina form a blend of experience and innovation that keeps LAv1 at the top of its game.

# Our Biggest Win 

Out of the many success stories we’ve had, one stands out. A local jewelry store came to us struggling to make ends meet. Their revenue was barely a blip. After partnering with LAv1 and committing to our SEO strategy, **their business skyrocketed to $1.2 million per year**.

For us, it wasn’t just about the numbers (though we’ll admit, we did a little happy dance when we saw them). It was about helping a small business owner provide for his family, create jobs, and shine in his community. That’s what drives us.

# What Makes LAv1 Different (a Listicle, But Fun) 

We’ve been around for 30 years because we don’t just do SEO. We do SEO with personality. Here are a few of the principles that keep us going:

* **We treat clients like friends.** Coffee chats, late-night calls, even brainstorming crazy ideas together—we’re in it with you.
* **We overdeliver.** If you ask for one thing, you’ll probably get three. We can’t help ourselves.
* **We become part of your team.** Seamlessly. No awkward introductions, just instant collaboration.
* **We bring fresh ideas (even outside SEO).** From marketing campaigns to new product concepts, we love sharing business insights.
* **We’re small business champions.** While others chase big corporations, our heart belongs to small businesses in Los Angeles and beyond.
* **We adapt like pros.** From the birth of Google to the rise of AI, we’ve evolved without losing sight of what matters: your success.

# From Page One to AI Answers: Our Journey Into AI SEO

Even though we’re still doing what we’ve always done best — traditional organic SEO and web design — our focus over the past year has shifted toward AI visibility. The way people search is changing right in front of our eyes. Instead of typing keywords into Google, more and more users are simply asking AI tools for recommendations, trusting platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity as their digital advisors.

# A Toast to the Next 30 Years 

So here’s to three decades of late nights, client wins, evolving algorithms, and way too much coffee. We’ve learned that while SEO tools and tactics change, the heart of our work stays the same: helping small businesses succeed, grow, and dream bigger than ever.

From Bruno’s early days coding in the ’90s (with soccer grit still fueling every move), to Ekaterina shaping the future of AI SEO with creativity and strategy, LAv1 isn’t just about rankings — it’s about relationships, results, and resilience.

And if the last 30 years taught us anything, it’s this: the best is yet to come. 🚀",1,1758661880.0,u_blav1inc,0,1.0,False

Last night I had a tiny start of a headache prior to taking the combo pill but once I took it it amplified into a migraine. I was able to get it down to manageable but I was down for the count the rest of the night. I’m still flirting with a headache today and feel like if I do anything wrong it’s going to come back. 
With the bupropion, I literally felt an overwhelming sense of drowsiness and fell asleep drinking my coffee. I have chronic fatigue so napping isn’t new to me, but I literally napped for 4 hours and could have slept more. I was luckily off today but I work tomorrow and I worry about that feeling while at work…everyone else I’m seeing it wires them. Is it the combo with the coffee + meds? I also saw on the bottle not to operate heavy machinery etc but I didn’t think anything of it because it wires everyone else it seems. Plus when I work I usually eat breakfast while driving. I work with patients and cannot afford to be exhausted around them. 
Anyone else experience these side effects and what did you do to manage them?? Do they go away? If you read all of this thank you.

**10.1 News of Liu’s Death**

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the [story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuyanMemoir/comments/1nit4k5/21_peach_flower_catastrophe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous [chapter 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuyanMemoir/comments/1nisyq5/2_revelation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

1notgg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/grants/comments/1notgg3/student_fundraiser_to_study_abroad_in_spain_any/,Student fundraiser to study abroad in Spain 🇪🇸 – any support or advice appreciated,"Hi everyone,

I’m a high school student who has been given an incredible opportunity to travel to Spain with my school. As someone who has been studying Spanish, this trip means so much more than just a vacation—it’s a chance to immerse myself in the culture, practice the language I’ve been learning, and gain experiences that will help me grow academically and personally.

The challenge is that the program costs more than my family and I can cover on our own. That’s why I’ve set up this fundraiser. Every dollar truly helps me get closer to making this dream a reality. Even small contributions—like the cost of a cup of coffee—add up and bring me one step closer to Spain.

If you’re unable to donate, simply sharing my link with others would mean the world to me. I’m so grateful for any kind of support, whether it’s financial or just words of encouragement.

Here’s my fundraiser link:

Lately it will shut down mid-brew (coffee/espresso/milk) but never when idle. Seems heat related — sometimes fine for weeks, then acts up again. Unplugging/resetting brings it back temporarily sometimes. Anyone else ever have this issue?

I suspect the power board but not sure. Has anyone else had this problem? If you sent yours in, did Jura’s flat-rate service cover the board, or was it extra? Curious about what you ended up paying and whether they did the full maintenance (brew group, grinder, milk system, etc.) at the same time.

Also wondering if anyone used an independent shop that repaired the board instead of replacing it. 

Would love to hear your experiences before I decide where to send mine. Thanks!",1,1758661626.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Chapter 2: Arrival at the Station

I woke up the next morning early to get cleaned up and get some coffee into my system before heading to meet Ranger Richardson. I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower to kickstart my energy, and got dressed. Once ready, I packed away my things into the car and then cleaned up my mess, I ensured everything was back in the car, and drove to the station. 

I pulled in about five minutes before 8 a.m. and was greeted by a gate guard who looked as awake as a dead fish. I rolled down my window, and he started his routine.
“Hi, I’m Ranger Jonah Reese with the Pisgah National Park Rangers. I need to see an I.D. and know your reason for being here.”

He said it all while barely holding his head up, eyes half-open. I handed him my I.D. and replied. “Yeah, I’m the new hire for one of the lookout cabins. I was told to meet with Ranger Richardson for baggage check and paperwork.”

He looked confused but checked my I.D., handed it back, and said. “Oh, okay. Go ahead and park in Zone 4. Good luck out there. Once you’re through the gate to the cabin lands, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.”

Before I could respond, he retreated into his guard hut and shut the door.
“Hmm, okay? That’s a bit weird,” I thought, but I decided not to dwell on it. What did he mean by ‘through the gate’? Was there something different about the land out there?

I did as he said and parked in Zone 4, found spot 7 was open. Whipped my car in the spit and stopped. I grabbed what I needed out of the car and locked it up, then headed toward the station.

 The ranger station sat within a Tall, sturdy chain-link fence, its main gate wide open, with birds chirping and leaves rustling in the breeze, with a lively, normal hum of the woods. Beyond the fence, though a second gate had could see, a sign above marked ‘Cabin 12 Access,’ leading to the trail. It was closed, and the woods beyond it looked… quieter, somehow, though I couldn’t place why. Jonah’s words echoed in my head: ‘Say Hello out there.’ Why out there specifically? Was it just a quirky tradition, or was there something about that fenced-off area that made it matter? I shook off the thought, figuring I’d find out soon enough.

I approached the main door and wiggled the knob and noticed it was unlocked, and assuming they expected me, I didn’t knock, I just walked in. 
“Hello? New hire, I'm here for—”
Before I could finish, a guy with undone pants, no shirt, and no shoes, looking half-asleep, screamed. “Hey, didn’t your momma teach you how to knock!”
Now fully awake, he glared at me. I screamed back. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry!”
I slammed the door behind me and stepped away, trying to compose myself from the awkward first impression.

After a couple of minutes, the same guy came out fully dressed except for his shoes, which he carried in one hand along with a coffee in the other. Wanting to apologize without making it more embarrassing, I said.
“Hey, I’m sorry for barging in. I thought it was just an office or welcome area. Didn’t expect anyone to be… like that.”

He sat at a picnic table outside the station, he lit a cigarette, took a drag, and gave me a groggy, unamused stare. “Knock before you enter, anywhere. I’m at least glad you made sure to say ‘Hello’ and started explaining yourself. If not for that, I probably would’ve come at you, and lord knows how that would’ve gone. No offense, just think next time. I also haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Ranger Josh Richardson, second in command here at Outpost Chance of the Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you, uh…?”

“Oh, I’m Alex. Pleased to meet you, Josh. You’re the Ranger Richardson I’m supposed to meet?”
He finished lacing his boots, put out his first cig and took another sip of coffee. “No, that’ll be my father, John ‘Rich’ Richardson. He was on the phone with the head of Outpost Glory, our neighbor station. he was talking about a fire in the next county over.”

He took another sip, then lit another cigarette. “He’ll be off soon. It’s a fire we shouldn’t have to handle, but we need the heads-up just in case.”
Taking a drag while eyeing me up and down, he asked, “What made you wanna come out here? Why this job?”

I was confused. I’m a bit on the smaller side, but I didn’t look like some city slicker playing country. 
“I grew up around woods my whole life and needed time away from normal life, you know? The pay didn’t hurt either, so I figured why not. Why do you ask?”

He stared at the ground, took a drag, finished his coffee, and said, 
“Just didn’t seem the type. No offense. Just stick to the rules out there, especially once you’re past the gate. That ‘Hello’ thing? Don’t skip it. Last guy who did… let’s just say he didn’t stick around long.” He smirked, but his eyes flicked nervously toward the closed gate leading to the cabin trail.

I frowned, waiting for more, but he clammed up. Why was everyone so fixated on saying ‘Hello’? And why only past the gate? Was it some kind of signal, or was there something out there in that 20-mile stretch that needed to hear it? The way Josh’s voice tightened made it sound like more than a joke, and it left a knot in my stomach.

I flashed a fake smile and nodded. 
""None taken. I get that a lot. But discs can handle myself out here, or at least we’ll see.”

He looked at me like I was the most naive kid he’d ever met. “Yeah. We’ll see, bud.”

After a few minutes of small talk with Josh, Ranger Richardson came out the door. A tall, authoritative figure with a clean cowboy hat. He looked at Josh and said, 
""Jesus, boy, could you have kept it down earlier? You Interrupted my call with Leigh! But anyhow, who might you be, young man?”

Did anyone know I was coming? I guess they must’ve forgotten. But Josh answered before I could. “This little turd is the reason I screamed. This is the new hire for Cabin 12, name is Alex. The reason for my scream is he didn’t knock and just decided to come right inside. So thanks for mentioning he was coming, there Pops.”

Ranger Richardson gave Josh a classic dad glare. “Ah yes. Well Josh, I wasn’t expecting to be on the phone for as long as I was, and I wasn’t expecting you up before he got here. So hush your lip up. Need I remind you that you’re only here because of me and can leave because of me.”

Then he turned to me with a warm smile. “Sorry for the confusion and misunderstanding, work never stops. Leigh, The head of Outpost Glory in the County to our west, spotted a small wildfire starting about two miles from our lines. It should be handled by their teams, but we still needed to be notified in case it came our way. I realize I haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Ranger Johnathan Richardson, the head of Outpost Chance. Pleased to meet you, Alex.” He extended his hand, and I shook it, nearly crushing mine. This man had calluses from a lifetime in the woods, no soft hands here. 

He released my hand, waved me to follow, and said, “Come inside, let’s get coffee and go over some things. Mind if Josh checks your things for contraband and unloads them from your car while we talk?” “Yeah, that’s fine. Everything’s in the trunk; anything in the back seats or front can stay. Here’s the key.”

I handed the key to Josh and then followed Ranger Richardson. He looked at Josh and said, “Be careful with his stuff, boy, and load it on the cart properly, weight in the front, got it? No judging his things.”

Josh shot back, “If I find a dildo or anything like that, I’m making a joke about it.”
I looked at Josh and quipped, “I have a count on them all, so I’ll know if one’s missing.”

Ranger Richardson laughed as we walked in. He poured me coffee, and we sat to discuss the job and safety. We talked for over an hour about routines, patrol routes, supplies, bi-weekly food drops (with requests allowed), and equipment at the cabin.
“The radio is your most important tool,” he said, holding out a military-style handheld with a long antenna, strap, and contact list. “Multiple batteries, a rechargeable one with charger. if you lose it, you can’t reach us if you’re hurt or lost. Keep it on you. There’s a computer for typing daily reports, sending them to headquarters, and messaging other outposts. A few old games on it for boredom. Flashlights, matches, lighters, cooking gear, everything else is there. Any Questions?”

Knowing I had my essentials and they’d provide food and water, but I could think of one. “Is there anything for protection at the cabin? A knife? Even a can bear spray?”

He chuckled. “Yes, there'll be a survival knife, our main issued tool. Then there’ll be an Axe and a Machete, used for clearing trails in the Area. Then the last resort, a pump-action 12 gauge in a safe with enough shells for three or four bears. The code is kept here at the station and is only given out in case of emergencies. So you'll need to get ahold of us here for to get in. But you have options. Use them as needed. Any other questions?”

Only one more: “What’s so important about saying ‘Hello’? Both Jonah and Josh mentioned it.”
Before I finished, he slammed his hand on the table and stared me down. 
“Just do it. No matter what. Whenever you enter somewhere, always say ‘Hello.’ Just do it and don’t forget.” He narrowed his eyes, stern. “Do I make myself clear, son?”

Of all the time so far, ive kept a cool head. But I would be lying if I said he didn't scare me, I probably showed some nervousness, maybe even fear. but I replied, “Yes, sir. Crystal clear. Understood.” 
He softened, smiling warmly. “Good. Now let’s check on Josh with your bag check and get you on your way. Long walk ahead.”

After we walk outside, we see Josh was finishing my last bag inspection and loading a pull-behind cart with my things. Ranger Richardson whispered to me, “Watch this,” then asked Josh. 
""Boy, you done inspecting and loading his stuff? Or do I need to kick your ass a bit to speed things up?”

They both laughed. Josh said, “Yeah, the cart’s loaded and good to go. And Everything he brought has approved, I found nothing questionable.”

Ranger Richardson chuckled. “Good. Now go get to work on something else; I’ll send him off.” Josh said his byes for now to me and then headed back inside. 

Ranger Richardson handed me a map and compass, explaining the route: “You’ll head out through the Cabin 12 gate here. From there, follow this trail to a fork not far out, take a left, then go about seven miles. You'll pass some field, open wooded areas and when You pass a creek with a small bridge. Once you’ve reached there, you’re almost home. If you get lost, Radio in if needed. Report anything of interest or concern. Understood?” 
I nodded, took the items, and prepped for my hike. “Thank you for the intro and advice, Ranger Richardson.”

His face hardened briefly, then smirked. “That’s Rich, son. No need to be too formal with me."" 

“Yes, sir, Mr. Rich. Sorry, I can’t shake my manners.”
He shook my hand, nodded. “All good. Good luck out there. And remember, past that gate, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.” 

Still unsure and worried for what will happen if I don't, I agreed and said. 
“Yes, sir. I'll do my best."" 

We parted ways, and I headed toward the Cabin 12 gate to start my year-long adventure and new life for a time. or that's what I thought, for the adventure i had been day dreaming about, turned into a life altering nightmare.

Well i was suggested to do this quest called Extinction for 99 rc lamps. Well having no prequest or mysteries done i thought, it sohuld be faster than running 5 hours ZMI altar for 3m xp/h.

First at 8:20 took my morning coffee and  i started doing anacronia quests (had base camp already)

Well there quests take like 2.5 hours to do, only reward here is monthly minigame that u get to unlock basicly. The league skull thing was usefull with teleports around anacronia (also its good for desperate creatures).  These quests were ok, didnt mind to do them.

Next i started doing Azzandra quest 

[Azzandra \/ sennisten questline](https://preview.redd.it/16p3ns5k9zqf1.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=c032860ca6456befa4339ee4eebbd0f19cb5005e)

but had to first complete troll stronghold and do desert treasure shadow gem part to get ring of invisibility. Ok i had ring i was ready untill i saw theres mystery requirments for the quest...  

For the quest it required the vault of shadow.. pylons, letters etc from zarosian archeology spot. thät took me nearly 140 minutes (2.2h) to do. so ok klock was around 13 and decided to eat some food and was finaly ready for Azzandra quest. 

Azzandra quest untill i was 30 minutes stuck because it seemed i had to do rune mysteries (which is way different than in osrs and i struggled alot). but finaly i was done with Azzandra quest. i didnt enjoy ir at all.

City of sennisten otherhand was maybe my favorite of these quests, i enjoyset the samll amount of combat and the gem puzzle was ok also with league mobile passive. 

Battle of monolith was just slow and afking imo kinda useless quest if that were in osrs ppl would vote it away. Really most useless quest ive yet to done. 

When i reached Extinction its was aroud 19:00ish, the quest strated strong and i actually liked all of it untill i was in the shadow realm or what ever its called (where u walk slow and repeat same thing for 40 minutes) that part sucked aaaaaaaaaaaaas. Anyways i go to boss, the boss battle was hard kinda what grandmaster quest should, i could compare it to dt 2 boss but its just like killing duke once. Ok cool i got the quest completed and clock was around what im typing it rn 23-24:00.

So was this all worth it? theres only one task it do be 400 points for this job. I also mentioned the runecrafting, well i got the 100 rc lvl with the quest but was this actually worth it? 

I didnt have fun except maybe 30 minutes in whole day, missed alot of those wildy things and kinda burned myself out. 

Id say that sennisetn and all its prequests shoudve been autocompleted because u anwyays get the better ancient spells tier 6

But anyways thats my rant

This is my first Reddit account/post, thanks for reading. All dates are this year, 2025 unless specified.

\-

Background

I’ve always had a tough relationship with my mom. We’re both strong-willed women (I’m enby but to my mom I am girl; so for this post, woman will do). She has repeatedly told me that I am “difficult”.

Mom first started to take me to CAMHS (UK child mental health service) when I was 8 years old in 2005. I was badly bullied in primary school for various reasons and it definitely affected the person I was/have become. I have very little recollection of being a child that age, but I doubt I would have been told the outcome of my first few appointments. However, my mom has maintained in the 20 years since then that I was first discharged from CAMHS because I was “too intelligent to be anything other than controlling and manipulative”... (at EIGHT years old - I seriously doubt an 8yo would know how to manipulate adults to the extent I’ve been subsequently made to feel guilty for). She and my dad would manage meltdowns/tantrums/upset from me with that in mind, that I was a manipulator.

At the age of 12, now in secondary school and still being bullied, I was referred to CAMHS again. I came out of those appointments diagnosed with depression and (at the time) “Atypical High Functioning Asperger’s” (now Autism/ASD). This development sent mom spiraling, and she has regularly over the years told me that she “grieved for months” and felt like she’d “given birth to an alien”. The way I was raised by my parents after my ASD diagnosis, was with the mindset that ‘the world will not change for her \[me\], she is \[I am\] the one who is wrong.’ Not a direct quote, but she has said stuff along these lines.

In the latter half of 2014, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at 17yo. While driving home from the child psychiatrist who gave me this diagnosis, my mom sobbed and sobbed, and again she said she “mourned” for months. On the insistence of my mom and the psychiatrist, I was encouraged to go on an antipsychotic drug, which I was hesitant to do because of previous bad experiences with antidepressant drugs. I was 17yo, doing my A Levels - the medication really affected me and I slept through most of my lessons with my head on the desk in the classroom. However, I did well enough academically to get into a good university for my undergrad degree. I had a lot of meetings and appointments for years to try to get me and my family support, the majority of which my mom would join me in and help lead the conversations.

Throughout all of these diagnoses, mom was almost ever-present in the appointments. I don’t think this is necessarily unusual for children, but she often talked for me and this continued well into my 20s. This included GP appointments and psychiatric appointments, as well as having private discussion about me with my GPs, psychiatric professionals, and NHS therapists. I latterly stopped sharing information with my GP when the GP shared private information against my wishes with mom ‘for my safety’. 

Despite having tried a lot of medications since then that haven’t worked, I am still taking the same antipsychotic 11 years later - I have been on maximum dose for about 8 years.

I have, in late 2024, also been diagnosed with ADHD. I was initially put on meds for this too, but they did not remotely agree with me as I became incredibly paranoid. I came off them when unrelated physical health issues started.

At some point after being diagnosed with Bipolar, when I was over the age of 18, I was mentally unwell. Mom, along with my family GP, decided I was a risk to myself and that I needed extra care. Mom became my “advocate” at my GP, meaning that she was legally permitted to interact with the GP on my behalf. Mom then requested a similar role to interact with Student Finance England (SFE) on my behalf during my undergraduate degree. We had many arguments about these situations of responsibility, as I did not want her to have this much control, and don’t think that I needed it for so long or so constantly. Something I was unaware of until May 2025, was her role as my “appointee” with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP - they give work related benefits here). As my appointee, she was legally in charge of my benefits and all communication and funds went through her first. It meant that I was seen as a ‘vulnerable’ and ‘dependent’ person. 

In 2020, I had my mom removed as my advocate at our family GP surgery after a particularly nasty situation at home - we had argued to the point that police were called, and when they arrived my mom told them not to believe my side of things because I had “mental health problems”, leading to the police questioning my capacity to speak for myself. They very quickly realised I did have capacity, and I spent a few nights with friends. I also revoked her access to SFE for my postgraduate degree which caused more arguments.

During my undergraduate degree, while living with my parents and commuting by myself to university, my next-door neighbour took over a business and needed workers. My brother (younger) and I both worked for our neighbour. I ended up working for him for over six years as a manager. The job was cash in hand (non tax-paying) and long weekend hours. I hated it and regularly looked for alternative jobs. Mom dissuaded me from taking a different job, as, in her opinion, I had “committed” to working for him. However, with her encouragement, I also had several volunteer roles and this job alongside university, so sticking with my neighbour wasn't about time management. I wanted to quit several times, but each time I got close, mom strongly persuaded me that I shouldn’t quit. I moved on from this job when a friend encouraged me to apply for a funded postgraduate degree which changed my life.

My brother, however, was encouraged to get a tax-paying job (before me) with career-progression related to his undergraduate degree after graduating. He was supported in getting a credit card and ISAs with the potential of buying a home in the future - two things that my parents did not do with me. He still lives at home currently, although he did move out with his university degree for a year before realising he hated not living at home.

I currently rent and live with my partner (and our cat), and have done so since November 2023 after I started (and then successfully graduated from) my postgraduate degree. My mental health has been mostly stable since I moved out of my parents’ house, and there is a noticeable difference in the person I am without living with them. I pay for a private therapist fortnightly, who from day 1 did not think I was utterly mental as I had been led to believe growing up.

This year

In March, I tried to apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP - a disability benefit in the UK), as I have been physically unwell since November 2024, and unable to work from March. I had previously tried applying for Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA - an unemployment benefit payment) in October 2024 (before I got ill), while looking for work after my postgrad degree. I had not heard back from the DWP (who deal with both JSA and PIP) following that application, but sort of forgot about it. I had not mentioned applying for JSA to any of my family members - however, mom mentioned in passing in December 2024 that she had received a letter from DWP sometime in the previous months, which had asked why her dependent (me) was applying for JSA, and whether she (mom) still needed to be my appointee. Mom said that she had written back to the DWP to inform them that she should be removed as my appointee.

Applying for PIP over a phone call in March also ran into a roadblock, as I didn’t have the correct information to get into my DWP account. I was told by the operator on the phone that I had an account from my previous PIP payments which had ceased around a year ago - one that I didn’t know I had. I had the obvious bits of information to access the account, personal data etc., but could not answer the other questions, such as: “What day of the week do you receive payment?”, “What was the date of your last payment?”. They said the answers would be in my bank statements, but I’d never received any payments. The only question I could answer was “you have an appointee, do you know who that might be?”, and I was able to give my mom’s details, assuming it would have been her. It was. I was sent a digital PIP application form to my email address. However, as I still couldn’t prove who I was to the DWP without that information, I decided to not complete the form.

Mom and I called each other a few times around this time, specifically about this topic. She said some concerning things that I would not have believed she’d said to me if my partner had not heard them too. Things, such as ‘you had PIP for years’, ‘I sent you some’ and even, ‘you received a back payment of \[over a grand\] at the end of last year’. This was entirely news to me. After this conversation, my partner and I started to record subsequent phone conversations with my mom. We kept recordings about DWP, PIP, and money.

She *had* sent me money over the years. However, I had always been told they were purely “gifts” - it was certainly never made clear that the money was actually mine. I even went to my bank at one point around this time, to see how references married up to the times she’d sent me these “gifts” - not one reference over the few years we could trace back from her mentioned PIP, DWP, or anything that sounded like it might have been that sort of thing, nor a single payment of any kind over large periods (including after the previously mentioned back-payment). Instead, the “gifts” were varied and random, didn’t happen when I was earning during my postgraduate degree, and often related to a specific item being bought.

Following this situation, in April, I submitted a request for my personal information from DWP to be released to me. The government website quotes a processing time of a month, however I never heard back for reasons I did not know at the time.

One Monday in mid-May, I received a call from DWP, which I thought was a follow-up of my information request. However, it was not! The person on the phone was chasing my PIP application form that I had not filled in. She was very helpful. Turns out, my mom was still my appointee, and as far as DWP could see, she had not informed them I’d moved out of her house in November 2023, or that I was no longer dependent on her. I had explained my situation to the best of my knowledge, mostly that I had *no knowledge of the situation* and had been kept in the dark regarding ever receiving PIP. I was informed that the PIP claim had started in September 2014 following my Bipolar diagnosis. The claim had ended in July 2024 (9 months *after* I moved out), up to which point I had been receiving the “maximum care and mobility” payment - the claim had ended in July 2024 because no one had responded to the DWP with information after they sent out an update request to my mom. Mom was also still registered as my appointee on their systems. I got emotional, and asked the lady on the phone what could be done about any of this. She spoke to her manager, who suggested removing mom from the account as my appointee. This was done solely because the claim had already ended and the situation was fairly unusual. They also gave me a longer time frame to apply for PIP.

That same Monday evening, my partner and I were due over at my parents’ house. We had made some notes on what I knew and what I wanted to ask. When we got there, I asked them both for a conversation - my parents’ heckles seemed raised immediately (this might have had to do with me having brought out notes). I told them a bit about the DWP call that I had had earlier that day. My mom immediately said how she had “told DWP I \[mom\] am no longer your appointee, they must have messed up” - though clearly the DWP had had no record of this. I responded “I know, and so do DWP, which is why you’re no longer my appointee”. I saw her jaw clench - she was not happy.

I queried how long she’d been receiving PIP payment. My mom was very suspicious of what I was saying and almost immediately said quite forcefully that I was “accusing” her of “stealing from” me. I told her I was doing no such thing - in fact, we had chosen my words VERY carefully so as not to do that. After this, she admitted having received the money from when I was 17yo. Apparently it went into her current-account of a bank she has since changed \[this part doesn’t make any sense to us (my partner and me), since she must have received the back-payment much more recently and was submitting annual forms/applications to renew the payments after that bank account would have been supposedly closed - that said, appointeeship rules seem to be that payments are made into a bank account belonging to the appointee, but not their main account to keep things separate\]. She said she didn't even realise it was coming in during the last few years.

She went very hard into the justifications for how the money had been used, and also about how difficult it has been living with me and my conditions. She reasoned that she was using the money as my ""family contribution"", especially as both my parents reduced themselves to part-time at work at certain points in time (on the recommendations of medical professionals) so that I could be cared for. This was all news to me, though again there is basis in the rules for appointees to use some of the funds to supplement lost earnings when reducing hours due to caring. The turning point in the discussion was when I asked what my brother's contribution was - we've both always been told that she'd never charge us rent or money as we're her children and she would provide for us (similarly, we were never given pocket money for the same reason). Obviously, this hasn't happened with me. She admitted that the money she got on my behalf was also being used on my brother, since the money was just going into communal family funds which my brother wasn’t expected to contribute to - but apparently I was contributing money without knowing it existed. She also said that when they spent money on me it came from my benefits, but that when spending money on my brother, it came from that communal pot (that they saw as their money but included my benefits that had been my ‘family contribution’). Her realising this seemed to be a big turning point in the conversation - she changed very suddenly from being defensive and said ""you're right, that isn't fair"". She immediately seemed a lot more understanding and apologetic. Her entire face changed and the colour went from her face a little.

She then asked if I wanted the money she had spent on my brother. The question caught me off-guard, as my partner and I hadn't thought that far ahead in the conversation, and had not expected her to offer. I said ""if you want to do that"". She suggested paying back a 5-figure amount which took me by surprise, although it was in line with the back-of-the-envelope figure my partner and I had estimated she might have had over the years. I also wasn't asking for it at all but didn't want an argument and felt unprepared. My dad tried to claim he was also my ""advocate"", but didn't seem to know chunks of what I was talking about. He said I was irresponsible with money as a child and that's part of why they didn't want to give me the money from the government as an adult. They asked where I thought the money had come from that I had been spending for years, and when I said “my job” they said that I had never had a job, that the money I was spending was my own through them. Mom said in a private conversation between me and her afterwards (same evening) that dad wasn't as involved as he claimed in that conversation (dad never is).

As far as I’m aware, the role of the appointee should be given up by the appointee when the dependent stops needing it. The role of an appointee is not to withhold financial independence from their dependent because they *think* that that person can be a bit frivolous with money. Mom said that she had tried to bring up the appointeeship in the years since it started, but that the conversations were never productive as she became apprehensive of the inevitable arguments where I would say that I didn’t want her to have control over my decision-making… so she kept the decision-making powers over me. To be clear, at the point of those discussions, I was not aware that that extended to benefits or that they even existed.

We left eventually and I had a tough night emotionally. The next day was challenging. I got a missed call from her first thing (about 9am) and then a text asking to speak. I did not want to talk. I called her back and made an excuse about why I'd missed it. She started the conversation asking what I had explicitly said to DWP as she was worried I might have misled them, mentioning that “I \[mom\] could lose my job”. I told her I was honest to DWP about not knowing what I was receiving.

She then said that she and dad were going to the bank to ""move some money around"" so she could send me some money. I checked my bank balance after a midday missed call. There was a very large increase. A 5-figure number, that was even more than she had suggested the night before. I was not prepared for this and cried. For their part, my partner said that it would have made more sense for mom to have sat down with me and for us to come to an agreed amount - doing it like this made me feel completely out of the loop and out of the decision once again, and also made me feel very controlled by the money even once she was giving me some of it.

Eventually after a third missed call in the afternoon, I called her back. She said the amount was ""about half"" of the 10-year benefits income. I've done the maths, it makes sense with inflation, but could feasibly even be less than half. She also said “now you can back me up with the DWP”.

I told her at about 4pm on the Tuesday that, ""I need processing time, I'll call you in a few days"". I received messages from her during that week that I responded to, just to be civil. Then on the Friday that same week, at 8.21am, she called me to wake me up because she believed I’d had enough processing time (calling every day to wake me up was previously very typical of her after I moved out - she would also regularly call me 10+ times every day). I was not happy, as she was yet again making the decision for me - this time, on how long I needed space from her.

The money she has sent me is currently in an ISA with my bank - I do not know what to do with it at all. I do not want to spend it without getting legal advice - it’s enough for a decent house deposit, not that I’m in a place to buy right now while not working. 

This month, September, I had finally gotten an appointment with a psychiatrist at my mental health clinic. I had been requesting an appointment with them since May; this was in order to talk to a mental health professional about both my physical health (which may be related to my mental health) and the situation with my mom. The psychiatrist I saw suggested that I may not have Bipolar Disorder, that my issues may instead have just been ADHD that had been misdiagnosed as Bipolar. So I am potentially being un-diagnosed with a condition I have been medicated for and controlled because of since I was 17yo. When I told my mom this, after she directly asked how the psychiatrist appointment went, she told me that she was “relieved for” me. This really hurt, since I feel that she majorly pushed for my diagnoses in the first place, and then financially benefitted from them (whether deliberately or not).

Since May, whenever she has wanted a positive interaction with me, she has been loving, caring, and kind. However, she has still lashed out, and she has been vicious. This includes having said “all these people you’re talking to \[friends that I’ve tried to talk to about this\], you’re betraying me - they don’t understand what it was like to wake up every morning and go to bed every night with how difficult you were” and “I \[mom\] can’t *live* without you as my daughter” - this isn’t the first time that she’s used hints of suicidal ideation in arguments. Every time I have brought up the upset and hurt I am feeling, all I get is excuses that I was “difficult”, that “you’re \[me\] not being fair, I \[mom\] am in limbo”.

\-

In the months since May, a lot of things have changed. I started making a conscious effort to detangle myself from my mom’s control.

* I finally changed GP surgery, despite having moved house to a different area of my city in 2023 - being at my family GP surgery was something I had actively been encouraged NOT to change by mom previously, despite me having brought it up several times.
* In this change, I had also changed my address on the NHS database, meaning that my medical letters would no longer be directed to my parents’ house as they had previously been, where they would often be read without my consent, despite asking her not to on multiple occasions.
* I have put myself on the electoral register in my area.
* My mom still pays my phone bill. For all these years I have not been able to access adult sites on data due to parental locks, despite being an adult for a decade. Having asked repeatedly to get the parental locks removed since I moved out in 2023, I was always given excuses as to why that could not occur. In August 2025, I asked mom explicitly for us to go to the shop for my phone provider so that we could transfer the bill to me so that I could pay my own bill and get parental locks removed. Within 2 hours, parental locks had been removed - when I had been asking for years… We went to the shop but my contract is up in late 2026 so she still pays the bill for now!
* My PIP application was rejected, with mostly 0s across the board (meaning I didn’t qualify for the benefits across various criteria). I don’t know whether I want to go to tribunal to challenge this. This is despite me having received the maximum payment less than two years ago when mom was submitting the paperwork on my behalf. I don’t understand how, in under 2yrs, I can go from maximum payment to nothing without mom having submitted misleading representations in the paperwork ‘on my behalf’ - which she has then pocketed. However, I should note that the UK’s disability benefits criteria have been tightened somewhat in that time.
* As I am still unable to work, I have looked into alternative benefits. I cannot receive any means tested benefits, for two reasons. 1) I have too much money in savings (a smaller amount was my savings from my postgraduate degree funding, but the majority was the money received from mom (but i don’t know whether i can do anything with it or whether it’s more sensible to leave it alone)), and 2) I have not contributed enough tax (see the job situation above where mom consistently dissuaded me from getting a tax-paying job into my mid-20s before I moved, as she always said she would “support” me).
* I am waiting for my medication to change after the psychiatrist review.



My family has barely left me alone in the subsequent months. My brother has asked me to meet for coffee a fair few times - something that is not normal for us. He is calmer with me than before, less critical and more accepting of me. My parents were trying to meet me at least once a week. They would buy me small gifts I wasn’t asking for, and would come round to my house if I said no to meeting them. I think they are trying to rebuild a relationship with me, but they haven’t really apologised or even acknowledged my hurt.

However, I have recently put my foot down after the psychiatric appointment and potential un-diagnosis. I have explicitly informed my family that I do not want to speak to them at all at the moment. I have muted all of them on WhatsApp and will not take their calls or messages. I have to say, I’ve felt emotionally lighter this week than I have for a long while.

If you’ve read this far, thank you!

I am also looking for advice on how to proceed and whether I should take legal advice about the 5-figure amount sent to me, especially considering that I have doubts over the evidence my mom submitted in the first place.

\-

TL;DR - I tried to apply for benefits and found out that I couldn’t access my account, though I had never applied before. Turns out mom had been claiming benefits on my behalf as my appointee, but had been seeing the money as my ‘family contribution’ without making me aware it even existed. When challenged on it, she sent me a large sum of money and insinuated that I should “back her up” if the authorities ever came asking, as she realised that she could get in serious legal trouble over the situation. She was heavily involved since I was 8yo with my diagnoses, and I feel that she pushed for me to be medicated. I am currently struggling with my family contacting me when I presently do not want a relationship with them after finding out about the benefits.",44,1758661291.0,relationships,14,0.91,False

Hi! I’ve been working in a BPO for 3 years now (started May 2022). I’m also pursuing my desired course, Psychology, and I’m currently in 3rd year.

Financially, I don’t have debt and I’ve managed to save under 100k so far. I also help support my sibling’s education, plus sustain my own studies in a private school. On top of that, I can afford some wants like an iPhone, a gaming laptop, weekly coffee, nails, and nice clothes.

Work-wise, I’m currently in a company where my workload is manageable (mostly admin tasks), so I don’t feel too exhausted and I actually get to enjoy my weekends.

Still, I sometimes feel sad and “behind in life.” I keep overthinking about the future—especially about not having huge savings yet.

My biggest achievement so far is being able to study and also help my sibling study. But I wonder, is it normal to feel this way in your mid-20s? Any side quest i can do to feel something?",1,1758661268.0,CareerAdvicePH,0,1.0,False

You are able to receive a fully digital AI assistant that doesn't require integrations or development work to assist with all of your online tasks or a physical robot capable of handling all of your manual/in person tasks. 

A few notes:

***

**AI Assistant**

You get access to voice commanded AI assistant that is automatically integrated with any device in your home. This includes personal computers, work computers, phones, consoles, and anything connected to electricity. The assistant can handle any task you would be able to put forth to an intern at your company or personal assistant (as well as anything a standard LLM AI would be able to manage). It can manage any task done over the internet or on a device without the required integration work and APIs such as making reservations or scheduling flights, updating things in your company's portals, sending out meeting notes and scheduling calls, etc. It can simply navigate using UIs just like a person would (though it does so very efficiently). It will also tap into electrical devices in your home so it can preheat your oven, change the thermostat, managing the houses lighting, etc. The AI will do an above average job at managing any tasks you put forward to it. It will ask questions and engage to get clarity but it is competent and can think somewhat critically about the ask to interpret what you want. It will not hallucinate or fluff it's responses. The conversational aspect is near human - think JARVIS from the Iron Man movies. 

**Examples of how you CAN use this**

* Update my project plan with the notes from that call and mark items as complete. Then schedule the requested follow up call

* Submit all of those new requests in [system] with a required due date of [date]. Then let my boss know the work task is complete

* Update my address on the DMV website and do my car registration for the year. Then schedule my annual check up with my primary care. 

* Plan out our vacation to Greece for next year, book our hotels and flights, and build an itinerary for the best things to do while we are there

**Examples of how you CANNOT use this**


* Make good stock trades until I am a millionaire 

* Solve the containment problem in nuclear fusion

* Develop an entire video game for me...

***

**Robot Helper**

You get a full capable robot helper that can do basically anything a hired hand would do, minus things on the internet (it can access the internet for downloading information like recipes, answer basic questions, and maintain some mild conversation, but it can't integrate to any systems or complete any online tasks). This includes cooking at a moderate to advanced level, doing dishes, washing and folding clothes, vacuuming, tidying around the house. It cannot do complicated tasks for you like build a house from the ground up, but it can assist with any hobby or task a reasonably intelligent person with 2 hands would be able to manage, e.g. hand me that, hold this here, bring me those. The robot is humanoid in shape, stands around 6' (1.8M) tall, can lift approximately 200lbs (~90kg), and is fully articulated and fairly dexterous. The robot does come with a perception filter (or whatever) so while out in the world it is not noticed by people as odd. Close scrutiny will show it for what it is such as a traffic stop if you let it drive, but picking up groceries and walking home would go unnoticed by passers by.  It can leave the house to run errands but whether or not you let it drive is based on your risk tolerance. Think NS-5 from I, Robot (without the murder). It does need to be charged but can manage a full workday of tasks and can charge for 4ish hours overnight. 

**Examples of how you CAN use this**

* Run to the store and get what you need to make dinner tonight (comes with NFC so it can pay with your credit card)

* Do the laundry and set out the kids clothes for tomorrow morning

* Help me hang these shelves in the living room

* Pack lunch for me and my wife and have coffee ready in the morning when we wake up


**Examples of how you CANNOT use this**


* Order the supplies for, and install a new roof on the house

* Carry out a crime against....

* Learn to create [item] and make them 24/7 for a profit

1noszpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1noszpk/4_months_post_antibiotic_for_h_pylori/,4 months post antibiotic for H pylori,"Good Everyone ☀️

I wanted to share my H pylori story and see if anyone had any advice. 

A little about me! 24, male , typically have always been a healthy individual. Never really got sick , no tummy issues or anything like that.

About a year ago I found out my stomach wasn’t in a great place — super low stomach acid, low secretory IgA, giardia low enzymes, basically my digestion felt like it was running on empty. H pylori also showed up but I guess it was a low level so it wasn’t addressed. I didn’t even know at the time that all of this was brewing underneath, but it explained why foods weren’t sitting right, nutrients weren’t absorbing, and I always felt like my gut was “off.”

Fast forward almost a year later, I got really ill. I had food poisoning twice in the fall of 2024, then around Jan-march 2025, I was so sick. Everything I ate something I got extremely bloated where it was hard to breath and so much trapped gas that even the smallest piece would make my heart race and I’d have to vomit. I got tested and found out I had H. pylori. That really connected the dots for me — the acid suppression, the poor enzyme output, the immune piece. I went through treatment ( it was terrible the antibiotics), finished it in May 12 and now I’ve been in this whole rebuilding phase.

I’m about 4 months post-antibiotics and slowly seeing improvement ( I’m eating real food! ) , and I can telling my body is digesting food better because I’ve been able to put on muscle and my stools seem healthy but I’m still supersensitive. My current triggers are: 
•	Coffee ☕️ 
•    Alcohol ( wines … for some reason a tequila soda or a few doesn’t both me)
 •    Really acidic foods 
•    Random spicy/greasy stuff that just hits my stomach the wrong way.
• Even stacking certain foods cause my to burp and bloat. 


Some days I feel like I’m making progress and then others time not. I’m not getting bloated in the upper stomach per se but my lower stomach sometimes just wants to extend out and I feel like I just want to cut it open so it can breathe…. Sometimes I do not poop for two days despite eating enough fiber. I notice red meat is harder to break down. 

Right now I’m layering in gut supports — things like 

•slippery elm, 
•L-glutamine, 
•zinc carnosine, 
•probiotics, 
• enzymes — 

and slowly figuring out what helps versus what overwhelms. Some days are better than others, but overall I can tell my gut lining is starting to heal and I’m finally absorbing nutrients again (I can see it in my energy and even muscle gain).

Still a work in progress, but if anyone else has been through the H. pylori aftermath, I’d love to hear what worked for you and what foods/supplements actually felt soothing versus irritating.

I just want to get all back together and have a strong resilient gut 🥹. I had an espresso diluted with water and it makes my stomach extend and hurt so much but once I ate a few hours later it the pain subdued.

Supplements: Slippery Elm, L-Glutamine, Zinc Probiotics (Akkermansia + Saccharomyces boulardii), Digestive Enzymes, DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Root), Colostrum (just starting).

I just feel defeated at times because I know people who had h pylori and there are like immediately fine after antibiotics and me a healthy fit individual is still suffering months later….. Maybe I had a really bad case ?? I also started eating red meat ( the doctor said I needed too after the h pylori infection)  which I didn’t eat for religious reasons but it was shocking how well my body respond to it.


Today I spent $400 dollars to see a gastroenterologist for him basically to tell me not to stress 🙄. I just wanted confirmation that perhaps my gut lining is slowly healing and that’s why it’s hypersensitive to foods… I know I’m young and healthy and don’t have some serious illness. I was completely fine before h pylori. He scheduled me a celiac test ( even though I know I don’t have it )  and a calprotectin  fecal test which will see if inflammation is occurring. 

But I’m annoyed because he’s just say it’s “ IBS” and that’s just an umbrella term and so vague…..  I just wish I could see what exactly is going on in my stomach so I can go back to normal….

I interviewed with the owner of a local business yesterday. It was a casual meeting at my local coffee shop. We had great conversation for over an hour. We talked about ambitions, where we want to be in five years. Yadda yadda. Awesome interview. We heartily shook hands and parted ways. 

After the interview, he said he would love for me to meet who I would be working directly with, and to plan a meet up the next day (today). The coworker (we will call Ted) called me at 10:45am and asked if we could meet today at 2pm. I agreed, and showed up at their business at 2pm. 

As I approached the room Ted was in, I noticed he had an extremely messy sandwich on his lap. “Oh, sorry I interrupted your lunch. Are you Ted?” to which he replied “yah, who are you”.

Me: I’m rear_end_agenda, it’s nice to meet you

(Ted does not make an attempt to stand up or shake my hand)

Ted: come in and sit down, tell me about your work history at (ex-employer that was not on my resume).

Me: I only worked there for a short time and had to request time off. Instead of agreeing, they let me go. I didn’t feel it was necessary to include it on my resume because of the brief amount of time spent there. 

Ted: Why did you need time off?

Me: I had a change in a medication I was taking at the time. 

Ted: what medications do you take?

Me: you can’t ask me that

Ted: why not?

Me: because it’s illegal for you to ask me what medications I take. 

Ted: ok this interview is over

I was inside that building less than five minutes. 

I know I made a mistake by bringing up my reasoning for requesting time off at that previous job, but I answered spur of the moment. That being said, I was never under the impression Ted was my supervisor or that today’s meeting was going to be treated at all like an interview. I feel as though the question about what medications I take was completely unnecessary. And his abrupt ending of the interview was mean spirited and biased.

I saw a doctor who prescribed me GERD medication (PPI, twice daily). Sometimes I feel better, but other times the symptoms return.

I also had a nasolaryngoscopy (throat scope). The result said:

Last week or so he came to my house after work (we work together, or worked, I quit) and told me that he has been talking to this girl in her car after the shift due to her crying about her relationship problems. I was very sympathetic etc. but also asked if he spoke about us, as he has a tendency to love to chat about our relationship to others (not bringing the problems to me to talk it out), he told me no. He messaged her that night, with my help may I add, to ask if she got home okay and that if she needs to talk he's there for her. I was fine with this, as I didn't think anything of this. Next day, he asked me if it was okay that he asked her to go out to grab a coffee, again I said yes due to me thinking hes just being a nice person wanting to help someone in a bad mental state; I suggested places for them etc. Baring in mind he was being a bit weird when asking me if these things were okay because he knows that I wouldn't bat an eye.

The next day or what not, I tried talking to him about something he did that affected me (it was a repeat behavior); he saw it as me 'ambushing him' which again doesn't make sense since I was speaking to him so calmly. Later that night after dropping me home, he came back to break up with me. His reasoning's were due to us 'arguing all the time', referring to when I point out some of his (repeat) behaviors and he ignores me for ages. As well as him feeling like I was pushing him away. I didn't invalidate his feelings.

He then goes on to tell me that he did say things about our relationship to that girl and told he that he doesn't want to be with me, saying he's only felt like this for the past few weeks and that he still loves me. Also telling me that she had told him that is he's not happy then he should leave.

Now this is literally like your boyfriend/girlfriend/bff/friend having a problem with you and instead of bringing it up to you, going to someone else and they tell them to leave/cut you off and that's what they do, you being none the wiser. No suggesting 'you should talk to them' etc.

I ask questions like ""do you find her attractive?"" him : ""yes"". ""do you like her like that?"" him : ""I don't know"". I then go into his phone to look a the messages and they're a bit too friendly, not outright raunchy but you know? One of the messages he sent the morning after the whole convo in the car with her was 'good morning you kept drifting into my mind when I was trying to sleep last night' ALL whilst I was still asleep next to him.

He then says he will cancel the coffee meet up. He does this in work, so I get someone to keep an eye on him. They're talking in the staff room for near enough 45 mins? Somethings not right.

He messages me saying that 'she isn't romantically interested in him'. How does that come into a conversation about cancelling a coffee outing? Why is he asking her that? He said he thought that's what I 'wanted to know' ???

As the days go by he keeps trickling little bits of information saying that she said to him that she's romantically interested as well as him also saying that to her...

Heartbreak.

I look at more messages and he had messaged her 'I couldn't tell her I'm so sorry, I said we only like each other as friends'. I won't get into her lying to me about it and her messages.

I of course was utterly destroyed and clearly not good mentally. I apologised for the way I may have made him feel and said I have been in a bad mental state lately. He said he could tell?? And that he thought I was hyping myself up to break up with him and that he thought of it like a race and he had to do it first???

He's now said that he doesn't want that girl. He wants me. He thought that he felt a certain way due to his mindset and them two going through similar problems.

Now this is where I'm so confused. What was the whole point of that then? The breakup part we could've worked through but this? It seems like hes back tracking but then I of course want to believe him due to the fact they had 'romantic feelings' for each other within a week? If I'm correct, so it seems believable because how you catching feelings that fast? But we do all work together; but they never message outside of work so?? He doesn't even follow her on Instagram.

Now, yes on my side there are problems with our relationship; he lies about anything and everything, he never tries to communicate and when I try, he sees it as an attack or criticism or an 'ambush'. But there are also such good aspects like how he consoles me how he cares for me etc.

please help what would you do?!

Like many immigrants, I came here with little more than ambition and a very blurry roadmap. No shortcuts.... just time, grit, and the quiet hope that one day, I’d build a space that feels like home. Truly ours. This apartment is the first place I’ve owned. And I didn’t want to just decorate it. I wanted to design it from the inside out. Every line, every surface, every texture..with meaning and personality!! The mural was custom made to reflect both mine and my wife’s passion. Tropical leaves for our love of sailing and the ocean. Dandelions as a nod to the wind swept fields I grew up with. It’s subtle, but if you know, you know. The tv stand? I shared the build on another reddit thread. It’s made from raw pine and bent steel legs I designed and welded myself. Same with the coffee tables. It was my way of grounding the space in something physical after years of living in rentals where nothing ever really felt like mine. Scandinavian style? Maybe loosely :))))  We stuck to neutral palettes, natural textures, and open space. Not for the trend, but because peace and simplicity hit different when you’ve worked hard to get here.

Still a work in progress, but proud of where it’s at. Open to feedback or thoughts if anything jumps out to you.

1nossgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nossgy/what_i_couldnt_say_then/,what i couldn’t say then,"a reflection on how i loved you, and how i learned to release you.


i was never good at saying how i feel. i think i confuse honesty with exposure, like peeling skin back too far. but i’m a writer. how ridiculous is that? to live by words and still choke on the ones that matter most.

i told myself i wouldn’t say i love you until i was absolutely certain, like it was some math problem that needed solving. then you ended things, and i realized love isn’t neat like that. those doubts that scared you – i have them too. i think everyone does. even in the healthiest relationships. and still, there was so much love. i did love you. maybe i didn’t need to think so hard about it, because love isn’t supposed to be that hard.

sparks don’t last. they flicker. they flare up, vanish, return when you least expect them. fireworks are still real, even if they burn out in seconds. i felt them in our milestones, our trips, the intimacy, the greedy kisses. i felt them in the small sacrifices – taking your shots during rage cage when i knew i’d get dizzy too fast (you know i don’t drink much), or overhearing you slur to your cousins and sister-in-law how i was a “godsend” girlfriend at martin’s party. (you didn’t know i was listening. i stayed quiet, holding onto those words like a secret gift.)

but the truest love wasn’t in the sparks. it was in the quieter rooms we sat in together. in the way days stacked up, plain and ordinary. love is not the big gestures – it’s the steady showing up. it’s folding yourself into someone else’s life without needing fireworks to prove it. it’s when things start to feel like home, like the comfort of unmade sheets. i felt that with you. and i know you gave it to me too, even if you didn’t always believe it yourself.

you told me yourself when we ended things: our relationship was happy. it really was. it wasn’t broken or toxic. you said i never did anything wrong. i doubted it at times, but i know i did always put my best foot forward. it was just a random negative thought you couldn’t trace back to its source, two weeks before, and it started eating at you. you said it scared you because it reminded you of your past patterns from years ago. but i was willing to sort through them with you – you just never gave me the chance to make that decision. everyone was shocked when we ended. my friends, your friends, even my family – they all thought we were going somewhere good with this. there’s a lot i won’t understand, at least not yet. it’s still fresh, and i’ll let those pieces of uncertainty sit where they are. it’s okay to sit with uncertainty, to learn how to hold the discomfort. not everything has to make sense all the time.

it might be too late to say, but i do love you. it’s painful at the moment, but it’s genuine, it’s whole, and it still holds so much joy from what we had. i’m still carrying that, quietly, at a distance. i hope you don’t mistake it for coldness. i pray for you. i don’t know if you truly believe in that sort of thing, but you know that i’ve sunk deeper into my faith this past year, and it has been my anchor – especially at this time. it’s made me softer, steadier. it’s teaching me to forgive – not just others, but myself too.

i used to think our beliefs made us different. but the more i looked, the more i realized they weren’t so far apart. i did spend my childhood in your church after all. the foundations were the same. we should’ve leaned into that sameness instead of pulling away because of the minute differences. faith doesn’t need to divide – it’s just a way of naming what holds us together. i hope one day you’ll find what i’ve found. not that you need to change anything, only to dig deeper into what’s already yours.

i wish i knew all of this then. but i was in defense mode, building walls to stop myself from unraveling in front of you. maybe that’s its own kind of love too – the desire to protect you from my hurt.

that’s why i agreed to let you go. if you believed leaving was what you needed, i couldn’t stand in the way of your growth. love isn’t possession – it’s allowing space, even if it means that space swallows me too. i want to move on with grace, to heal in a way that feels whole.

but maybe, one day, if you feel like knocking on my door again, if you find yourself parked on 27th street, i’d still love to have “coffee for the vibes” with you. nothing serious, just to see. to sit across from you and revisit whether we still care for each other in the same way – or if that care has softened into something else.

i know a part of me will always hold love for you, but i won’t keep my life suspended in wait. i owe myself the dignity of moving forward, the self-respect of not standing still. if one day our paths meet again – after we’ve both done the work, after we’ve both grown, and if neither of us belongs to someone else – then maybe we’ll find something new in what was left behind.

until then, i’ll keep cheering for you, quietly, from the sidelines.

1noss0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1noss0n/chemo_fried_my_brain_body/,Chemo Fried My Brain & Body,"(Male, 31 years old) 

Hello everyone,

I’m a testicular cancer survivor and have luckily been in remission for 2.5 years but I unfortunately won the fight at the expense of my body and mind.

During the beginning, my right testicle has fully become a mass and i was diagnosed with stage 3b testicular cancer. This is the farthest stage this cancer can go. 

My right testicle was removed and I was put on a very high dose BEP chemo regimen for 4 months.

Before cancer I do want to let you know that I had horrible A.D.D. and took medication to help for most of my childhood until I realized the effects of adderall, ritalin, etc. 

Now that i’m a survivor I have a couple things that i’m plagued with and i’m pretty sure i’ll have lifelong problems. 

First of all my chemo brain is horrible and my a.d.d. has gotten a thousand times worse. I can’t read a book to save my life. I’ll read a page and won’t retain anything that i’ve just read.  I forget peoples names seconds after they tell me their name for the second time. I can’t remember any previous conversations unless they were a traumatic event. I’m a contractor and have my own business and will forget to grab things like receipts which i need for taxes and i will forget multiple things i need for a job. the other day i had to run to home depot about 10 different times because i kept forgetting to look at the list i made or forgot to add things to the list. I dated this girl for 5 months and still couldn’t remember her work schedule or birthday. 

My fatigue is also horrible. I can sleep a full 8-10 hours at night and need to take a 4 hour nap during the middle of the day. I also never feel fully rested and i’m always tired. This morning I drank an entire pot of strong coffee and felt nothing.

My hearing (or ADD?) has gotten so bad that I consistently ask people “what did you say” and it tends to frustrate people. 

I also can’t really enjoy sex anymore because the surgery to remove my right testicle damaged a nerve and now i have zero feeling on the right side of my stuff. Because of the numbness I always last much longer than my partner and it’s really frustrating and I don’t get to finish a lot of times. (great for them but bad for me). also my sex drive and relationship drive is just super low in general (currently non existent) 

I just kinda feel like i beat cancer but now I’m this shell of an individual that I used to be. 

I still enjoy life and I have fun by myself but I haven’t been able to make any new friends since remission because it’s hard for me to remember names, conversations we’ve had and multiple other scenarios. My ex used to call me a dumb blonde because of my issues even though I never used to be like that. I’ve always been really intelligent. My short term memory is now just nonexistent. I also don’t have much sex drive or a drive to date at all anymore because my lack pleasure and that I can’t have children. 

I’m wondering if anyone has been able to treat their Chemo Brain while also having ADD.  Also i’m wondering if anyone’s found a solution to their libido problems. I’ve heard that some cancer survivors have taken adderall and an alzheimer’s medication together to help rebalance the brain chemicals. I’ve also heard of people taking high doses of testosterone to help with libido and muscle growth. I just want to see if anyone has found anything that works because i’m really tired of this. 

To give you some context on my health. I’m super healthy. I eat well, am in shape, exercise everyday in the gym with weights and cardio, I get plenty of sun and all that so that’s not the issue. I also have great blood work and all my hormones are where they’re supposed to be.

1nosrje,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1nosrje/in_progress_2062_dark_romance_twisted_devotion/,"[in progress] [2,062] [dark romance] Twisted Devotion","Looking for a beta reader or for some criticism. This is a work in progress, it's only a few scenes that are not chronological, and it's my first shot at dark romance. If this isn't allowed, please let me know.

This book is based on the idea of character A being heavily traumatized and conditioned to believe loyalty and devotion are shown a certain way, and he kind of takes the guard dog role. Character B takes the softer, ""handler"" role, and is the only one who can calm A down. A is a bit troubled, and doesn't know boundaries well, while B is patient and kind, and teaches A that boundaries are okay. 

This is a dark romance. There will eventually be nsfw themes, none of which are shown here, nor will they ever. Themes shown here are stalking, child abuse, aggressive behavior, and grooming a child for a position of power. Themes to come are death, kidnapping, and other dark themes. 

Scene 1 (opening)
His love was not gentle.
It was the snarl before the strike, the promise of ruin in the curl of his fists, the unspoken oath that anyone who dared touch her would bleed for it. They called it obsession. He called it loyalty.
And when the haze took him—when his vision narrowed to teeth and rage, when the air itself seemed to quake with the violence in his bones—she was the only one who did not run.
She never feared him.
Even when his knuckles dripped red, even when his eyes burned feral and his breath came in ragged growls, her touch was the leash that never broke. One hand against his chest, one word on her lips, and the beast stilled. For her, always for her, he remembered he was human.

Scene 2 
The man shouldn’t have touched her.
It was nothing more than a careless brush of fingers against her arm as he passed, but A saw it, and his composure shattered. His blood surged hot and merciless. In three strides he had the man against the wall, forearm pressing hard enough against his throat to make bone creak.
“Don’t,” A growled, low and lethal. The word rattled from deep in his chest like an animal warning its prey.
The man gasped, eyes wide, hands scrabbling at the unmovable wall of muscle pinning him. A’s vision tunneled, rage pounding in his ears like war drums. His body demanded violence, demanded blood for the crime of laying a hand on what was his to protect.
“Call off your fucking dog!” The man yelled, fear pulsing through him.
“Enough.”
Her voice cut through him like a blade through fog—steady, unshaken. He didn’t turn. Couldn’t. His knuckles ached, ready to break teeth, ready to spill red across the stone.
Then she touched him. Just the barest press of her palm to his back, warm and grounding.
The fight in him stuttered. The growl in his chest trembled, collapsing into silence. His breath came in harsh pulls as he forced his arm back, releasing the man, who stumbled away coughing and terrified.
A still trembled, violence caged just beneath his skin, but her hand never left him.
“Look at me,” she said softly.
And he did. Every time.
Her gaze was calm, unyielding as a tether, and in that look he found the single truth he trusted more than instinct: she was safe. She was his to protect, not his to frighten. His pulse slowed. His hands dropped, empty now, shaking as though he’d been dragged back from the brink of a cliff.
The man fled without another word. A didn’t watch him go. His eyes stayed on her, and only when she nodded—just the faintest nod—did he breathe again.
“For you,” he whispered, voice raw. “Always for you.”
And he meant it. With every scar, every ounce of rage, every drop of blood still on his hands—his love was hers. Deadly, unbreakable, and hers alone.


Scene 3 (show of his nature)

The room was quiet but for the rhythm of her breathing. She slept curled against the sheets, face softened in the kind of peace she rarely let herself have while awake.
A should have closed his eyes, too. Instead, his gaze caught the faint glow of her phone on the nightstand. One new message.
He hadn’t meant to look. He told himself that as his hand reached, as his thumb brushed the screen awake. But then the words were there, and the excuse burned away like paper in fire.
Still think about you. We had something real. You don’t belong with him.
Her ex. Bold enough to write, foolish enough to think she’d ever read it in front of A.
A’s chest tightened, fury coiling hot and sharp. He looked down at her one last time—still sleeping, still unaware—and pressed his lips against her temple. Gentle. Silent. A promise.
Then he slipped from the room like a shadow.

The door creaked hours later. She stirred, blinking into the dark as A stepped inside. His shirt was torn, his knuckles raw, bruises already darkening along his jaw. The copper scent of blood clung to him like a second skin.
She didn’t ask. Not yet.
Instead, she rose from the bed, wordless, and reached for his hand. He let her take it. She led him to the bathroom, the tiles cold against their bare feet, the light sharp and unflinching.
She wet a cloth and touched it to his split lip. He flinched—not from pain, but from the tenderness of it.
“Sit,” she murmured.
He obeyed, lowering onto the edge of the tub as she worked in silence. Cloth to skin, disinfectant on wounds, bandages wrapped tight with careful hands.
Only when his breathing steadied did she pause, her fingers lingering at his jaw.
“You came back,” she said softly. Not a question—an anchor.
“Always,” he rasped. His eyes found hers, fierce and unrepentant. “For you.”
She didn’t ask what he had done. She didn’t need to. Her hand rested against his cheek, and for the first time that night, the beast in him quieted.



Scene 4 (flashback 1 show of why he believes what he does)

Her hand rested over his heart, light as a promise. She slept without fear, and he lay awake, staring into the dark, as the old memories crept in like smoke.

He was small again, legs dangling from the kitchen chair, the table too high for him. His father’s voice filled the room, thick with anger, heavy with certainty.
“Your life is not your own.”A hand gripped the back of his neck, forcing his head down until his forehead pressed against the wood. “You *breathe* for this family. You ***bleed*** for it. You don’t belong to yourself. Do you understand?”
He remembered the sting of splinters biting into his skin. He remembered trying to nod even though the pressure held him still.
His mother had stood in the doorway, silent, her arms folded tight against her chest. She didn’t protest. Didn’t soothe. Didn’t stop it. Her silence was its own command: ***this is love, this is loyalty. This is how you survive.***
The words burrowed deep, carving out everything he might have been. Devotion wasn’t a choice—it was demanded. To love was to surrender. To be loved was to obey.
And so he learned. He carried his father’s creed in his marrow: ***give everything, keep nothing, and maybe you’ll be worth keeping.***

Now, lying beside her, he touched her cheek. She stirred, softened, leaned into him without hesitation. No demands. No orders. No leash.
And it broke something in him every time.
Because for the first time in his life, he had given himself away—not out of fear, not out of duty—but because he wanted to.
Because she was worth burning for.
Because if his life was not his own, he was glad it was hers.




Scene 5 (flashback 2 show of devotion to family)

---
The kitchen was cold that night, the fire burned low, and his father’s shadow stretched long across the floorboards. A was small—too small to feel the weight of expectation that pressed down on his shoulders, but he bore it anyway, because there was no choice.
“Loyalty is proven,” his father said, voice like iron scraping across stone. He set the knife on the table between them, its blade catching the weak light. “Words are nothing. Devotion is nothing, unless you bleed for it.”
A’s hands shook, but he reached for the knife anyway.
His father’s hand clamped over his wrist, stopping him. “Not you. Not yet.”
Confusion tangled in his chest until his father shoved something else across the table—a rabbit, small and trembling, one A had raised in secret behind the shed. He’d fed it scraps of carrot, kept it warm in his shirt when the nights froze. The only living thing that had ever been his.
“Do it,” his father ordered. “Show me where your loyalty lies. Family first. Always.”
His throat closed, the air burning as he tried to breathe. He looked toward the doorway. His mother stood there again, her arms crossed, her face carved from stone. No mercy in her eyes. Only expectation.
He wanted to beg. To plead. But he had learned already: begging was weakness.
His hands stopped trembling. He picked up the knife.
The rabbit’s heart beat fast beneath his palm. His own heart beat faster. And then—silence.
When it was done, his father nodded once. “Good. You understand. Your life is not yours. Nothing is yours. Everything you are belongs here.”
The words seared into him deeper than the blood on his hands ever could.
---
Present
Lying awake with her head against his chest, he still felt the phantom weight of that night. The knife. The heartbeat. The silence that followed.
She stirred in her sleep, sighing softly, and pressed closer. Her warmth seeped into him, filling cracks no one else had ever touched.
He brushed his lips against her hair. If his life was not his own—if it had to belong to someone—he was glad it was hers.

Scene 6 (flashback 3 show of how he came to know her) 

The city blurred past his windshield, neon reflections rippling across the hood. The paper bag of her favorite food shifted against the seat beside him, releasing the smell of spice and heat. He gripped the wheel tighter. Tonight, she’d smile when she saw what he brought. Tonight, she’d lean into him, trusting without question.
And as always, the drive pulled him back—to the beginning.
The first time he saw her, she wasn’t remarkable to anyone else. Just another face in the noise of the world. But to him, she was gravity. His lungs seized, his pulse stumbled, and the thought struck like a brand: She is mine to protect.
It wasn’t a choice. It was law.
So he learned her. All of her.
He knew he shouldn't. Following her was wrong, but he couldn't stop. 
He knew where she worked—how she lingered at her desk long after others left, absently twirling a pen when she was lost in thought. He knew the name of her boss, the way she flinched when that sharp voice cut across the office.
He knew her mornings inside her apartment. The slight pause between her alarm and when her feet hit the floorboards. The pattern of lights flicking on as she moved from bedroom to kitchen. The exact time she opened her curtains—7:12, always 7:12, as if she needed to see the sun to believe the day had begun.
He knew how she slept. On her side, curled tight, one hand pressed under her cheek. Some nights, she tossed, murmuring words he could never catch. Other nights, she lay still for hours, and he would stand outside her window, breath fogging the glass as though his presence alone could guard her dreams.
He knew her food habits—coffee with two sugars, black tea in the evenings, never milk. Takeout on Thursdays, always from the same place, as if ritual mattered more than taste.
He knew her favorite bench by the river, her notebook pages filled with half-formed thoughts, her lips moving in whispers she thought no one could hear.
There was almost nothing left to wonder about her. And still, he wanted more. Every little thing he already knew, and yet, she remained a mystery. Every piece of her, every detail, until there was no part of her life where he was absent.
Wrong. He knew it was wrong. The word “stalker” burned the back of his throat like poison. But beneath the sickness was a devotion so absolute it hollowed him out. He wasn’t watching her. He was guarding her. He wasn’t taking her privacy. He was keeping her safe.
Until the first time she spoke to him.
Her eyes had caught his, sharp and steady, when he lingered too long in the shadows. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t frown. She only asked, soft as a dare, what time it was.
And in that moment, when her attention brushed him like a hand to the chest, his world bent at the knee.
He would not—could not—leave her side again.
The light ahead turned green. He pressed the gas, knuckles white on the wheel. The food shifted on the seat, warm and waiting.
She had let him step into her orbit once. That was all it had taken. From that night on, his life ceased to belong to himself.
It was hers. Every dark, ruined piece of it.",1,1758660047.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

As my title alludes to, I'm really just looking someone to voice chat with as we do our own things.  Here's some details about me and what I'm looking for:

  
**About Me:**

* Age:  34
* Ethnicity:  Black/African American
* Living Situation:  Live alone in an apartment with my cat
* Relationship Status:  Single
* Employment:  Work Full-Time on a gov't contract for a federal agency
* Hobbies:  Gaming, reading, writing, spending time with the cat (who loves to sit in the middle of my tv as I game), trying to cook
* Political Leanings:  I am very much liberal/left leaning.  Me and MAGA are not friends. 
* Interest:  Relationship (I am mostly wanting to connect with someone with the eventual goal of finding a relationship partner.  But no pressure on that front, if things don't go that way and we become casual friends or even just hang out a bit for a season, that's ok too. )
* Availability:  Most evenings after 7PM EST.  I am not available on Wednesday evenings though and most weekends I am spending time with my parents during the day on either Saturday or Sunday.  
* Social  Stuff:  I'm a homebody who wants to inch toward getting out a bit more.  I think it would make me a bit happier.  I like being out (especially in the mornings) walking, sitting a bookstores/coffee shops, etc. so I want to get back into that and explore other stuff like going to the aquarium and other things in my area. To expand toward interests I know I have outside of gaming. 
* Games I am currently playing:  Cronos:  The New Dawn,  Atelier Sophie DX, Guild Wars 2
* Games I want to play soon:  DISCOPUP, Silent Hill f, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree
* Co-op Games I'd love to play with someone:  Divnity Original Sin 2, Remnant 2, Wild Hearts
* Where I mostly game at: PS5, PC
* Things I'm not really:  Marijuana, excessive alcohol usage, vaping

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm looking for someone to spend 1 or 2 days out of the week chatting online. Preferably as we play our own videogames or do our own things. ya know, that ""alone together"" kind of vibe.  Doing our own things but having that company.

It would help if you were into gaming too.  But if you're not and are open to being around gaming and learning about it, that's fine too.  I'd be more than happy to learn more about you and whatever your hobbies may be.

  
Ideally though, I just envision us on chat playing our own games, chatting a bit, or even cooperatively playing a game together.  And if feeling especially spicy, we could even watch a show or movie. I still need to watch Severance Season 2 as an example.

Honestly though, this is kind of a ""leap of faith"" thing for me.  I've had reservations trying to reach out to others on an online forum.  But honestly, doing stuff in person can be a bit intimidating and just difficult to know where to start. So figured I'd reach out here and just...see how things go ya know?

If anything I says sounds cool and you'd think we'd vibe, definitely send me a DM and we can go from there. Thanks for reading!

If you’re in or near Louisville, grabbing coffee, exploring local spots like the Highlands, or just chilling together would be amazing. But I’m also super open to an online connection—think late-night calls, sharing playlists, or texting about the little things that light us up.

A bit about me: I’m a chill guy who loves coding, hiking, and getting lost in deep conversations about dreams, passions, or even the weirdest food combos. I’m all about honesty, respect, and creating a safe space for love in a poly setup. The breakup hasn’t dimmed my hope—I’m ready to find someone who could be my new obsession, in the best way.

I tried to be strong and be to myself, yet I am NOT okay. I am feeling emotions I have never felt. Emotions so intense, Thorazine can’t get rid of em. 

I’m young. Stage 4. Mets to spine and hips. Lots of pain. I take 60mg morphine three times a day and diluadid four times a day. Most days I am in my wheelchair and on good days, I have a forearm crutch. I’m very limited on what I can do. 

My mom convinced me to come stay with her because my husband wasn’t “helping” enough and we are having issues. Man was a an idiot. I just want him to do more, but I suck ass at communicating and he had no idea. We argued and I just went to my mom’s. So we did separate. Stupid. Was it because I ate paint chips as a kid?? 

So I go to my mom’s with my 13 and 14 year old boys. She’s helping me, the pain is getting a little better. She’s helping me cook and clean. She does my laundry because my arms burn if I hold them up for more than 2 seconds. I’m on disability because my husband has a well paying job and we lived comfortably so, we decided that would be best. There isn’t anything a cripple can do in the medical field. (That’s what mom says). She was taking a huge load off my shoulders. It was so nice. This is the straw that broke the camels back - 

She is getting a settlement soon (Zantac and Breast Cancer). It’s about 60k. She comes up to me and says she’s gonna buy me a car. I don’t need one. I love my 2001 Escalade. I knew then, it’s about to get bad. She always buys my love. She’s lonely and wants me to herself. 

Now, I am waiting on a settlement as well (unnecessary hysterectomy). Asshole. It’s a hefty sum. When she found out, her demeanor changed. One morning, right after Charlie Kirk was murdered, we were sitting, having coffee. She’s talking about Charlie and how she is going to tithe 10% of her settlement to Charlie Kirk’s Foundation: Turning Point ? Idk. I told her that I wasn’t going to tithe mine to anything political, I am giving to Doctors Without Borders. The ones who really need it. She blew up. Blew up. She is now the victim because, “she feels like I hate her.” Seriously, I just lost a son, my pops, my health, my career, my home and my marriage is so broken at the moment. We are going to start counseling Oct 10th. 

She screams - 

“Charlie was in NO way political. How dare you not give to him.” How dare you. And in an instant, I didn’t exist. 

My question: is this caregiver abuse? 

The next morning she didn’t wake me up at 6am. She always wakes me up at 6am and gives me my medications. I never hear my alarm, ever. My husband always woke me up and gave me meds / coffee.   I had a meeting with my boys school that morning. Missed the meeting. Had a panic attack because I am on the dot to the T on a schedule. I feel very anxious when my day is thrown off. 

She stopped buying us good food. She knows I don’t eat junk and processed foods. She buys us a box of White Castle burgers and some muscle milk. I haven’t had food like that in years. I immediately threw up the rat burger. 

My husband brought us food. 🫶

She stopped giving me rides and helping me run errands. 

She stopped helping me clean. 

She stopped helping me with my two boys (homework, football, baseball). 

She took back all the clothes she gave me. 

She took my two fans away I MUST use to at night because of the drenching night sweats, every night. (Last night I slept in my bathing suit). Then she informs me I am to pay half of the light bill. That’s 200$. 

What?? A box fan is like 70 watts? I didn’t sleep at all last night. Doing ALL of this by myself has caused my back to lock up. And she just smirks Everytime she walks by me. I’m convinced she’s hated me since I met air. 

I caught her going through my room when I was in the shower today. 

She keeps putting items up in the cabinet (for my tea / toiletries) when I can’t reach it. She puts up everything I lay out. I can’t sleep with my fans anymore. I had a nosebleed today. I miss my fans :( 

Since I’ve been here, my psych had to put me on Thorazine. Thorazine, thank you for the 6 hours of sleep at your max dose. 

I want my fans. 

I lock myself in my room. She has a key. She just tries to make me mad. But I just look at her and respond to yes and no questions. I don’t want to deal with her nonsense if I try to say a word. I have put my sauna up against my door. Now she can’t get in. Maybe, just maybe, I can get away with the fans tonight. 

Heard her on the phone saying her gun is in. She told me she wanted to shoot my husband, again. Yes, again. 

Am I insane, over reacting…. 

Should I use my fans tonight …. 🤔 

Sidebar: She is in a religious psychosis right now. She is part of the Sept 23 Rapture “watchmen” as she says. She took off work and is literally lying in bed, waiting until the 24th for the rapture. Going around saying to me “you will be left behind and your husband will suffer a horrible death during the tribulation.” She has told me if she sees my husband she will shoot him. She has tried before.

1noslxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizoFamilies/comments/1noslxc/is_it_a_lost_cause/,is it a lost cause ?,"hello all, I've posted here prior but it's been a while.
I believe my brother has schizophrenia, symptoms started about ~10 years ago. back in 2017 he up and left for 2 weeks without letting anyone know, he left his phone, keys,  wallet but took a backpack with clothes and cash. I filed a missing persons and the detective got back and said state troopers found him walking in the highway. he eventually called my mom I guess when he got himself out of psychosis, he was in another state completely and asked my mom to get a bus ticket home.

we went to pick him up at the station and we thought he just needed some time to clear his head. with time he got back into his routine which was arlund his birthday every yeat he would go into his manic state/psychosis and start making music because 'they' told him to. they being famous DJ's and rappers/singers. he would claim they would highjack his brain and threaten him if he didnt make the music, during this time he became a scary assh*Ole. he wouldnt eat nor sleep, he would get high and drink coffee to keep him awake as ge made music all day and night. he would become aggressive towards anyone during this time and very argumentive, but one thing that always stood out was his eyes. black black eyes, flushed face kinda sunken in, he would be tense when he spoke and twitchy, idk how to explain it but it always scared me cause he honestly looked possessed. then around the end of the year/early next year he would snap himself out of it and start preaching deep, DEEP. beyond the normal. he would then claim how his mind was being controlled by them.

last year my mom and I reached a point because we just couldn't live with him anymore, we were scared and fed up. he didnt shower, brush his teeth or hair, his room was so messy it was attracting rats. so my other brother and his gf took him in. it wasn't even a year that he ended up leaving again.

a few days ago, my other brother and his gf were trying to remind him of the rules of the house which were to shower everyday, keep the room clean and wash the dishes after himself, which he did for the first few months. well he didnt like it and felt like they were attacking him. he ended up injuring my other brothers gf to the point she needed staples. then he told my other brother that shes faking it to turn it against him and left.

he thinks everyone is out to get him, that everyone hates him that everyone is teaming up against him for no reason when in reality he has been burning all the bridges woth everuone because of how he is. I filed another missing persons because my mom isn't doing the best and I begged the officer if there's any way to put him on a psychiatric hold to please do so.

he's still out, he just took his phone and wallet but I guess he has a government funded phone that can only be used on wifi, he texted my nephew this morning saying how everyone is against him and he loves him and isnt coming back. he posts ALOT on social media on what's going on in his head, which I feel is enough to get him admitted but he posted this morning his take of the situation that happened, which was my brothers gfnslipped and injured herself.

my question is, he is an adult, he is 34 and undiagnosed since he refuses to see any type of doctor since he doesn't want his info anywhere, is there any way to get him the help he severely needs ? im emotionally shut off when it comes to him other than being pissed but he needs to be evaluated.",3,1758659678.0,SchizoFamilies,2,0.81,False
1noslme,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noslme/my_boyfriend_18m_of_almost_four_months_broke_up/,My boyfriend (18M) of almost four months broke up with me (18F) and I don't know what to do,"I ‘18F’ and my now ex ‘18M’ have been together for almost 4 months but out of nowhere he broke up with me.

I met him on the school trip by the end of May this year. We hit it off immediately. We spent 6 out of 10 days of that trip together. One whole day we were just the two of us in Barcelona, and that memory still feels so special to me. At night we would stay up talking and cuddling. Honestly, everything felt so magical, almost like a dream. My previous relationship was nothing like this, I had never felt the way I did with him.

Only three days after we met, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I immediately said yes. We talked a lot, shared many interests, and he was funny, kind, respectful, and thoughtful. We spent most of the summer together, sharing everything with each other. At the beginning of August, I went on a trip with my friends, but the very next day my grandfather passed away. I was devastated and had to go back home. When I told him, he was so supportive and he even came to the funeral. Maybe that sounds like the bare minimum, but at that moment it meant so much to me.

Ten days later, I ended up in the hospital. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong, and I had to stay there for five days. He was really worried and checked up on me all the time. I did notice he wasn’t texting me as much as before, but I didn’t think much of it. The night I got discharged, he went out clubbing with his friends, got pretty drunk, and sent me more than 13 voice messages, each at least four minutes long, telling me how much he loved me and couldn’t wait to see me.

A few days later he came over and was so sweet. He brought me a teddy bear sprayed with his perfume. The next time we saw each other was on August 28th, our three-month anniversary, when we made clay figurines together. A few days later we went out again, but this time he was in a bad mood. We didn’t fight, but he was bothered that I wasn’t the one reaching out first, that I didn’t tell him much about my day, and that I rarely took the initiative to plan anything other than coffee dates. We ended up barely talking that night.

The next day we went out again, and the vibe was completely different we went shopping, and I felt like it really brought us closer. After that Monday, I didn’t see him again until Sunday. That week, he seemed a bit “dry” over text, but he kept mentioning how stressed he was with school, so I didn’t worry too much. On Saturday he didn’t text me at all, and later he said it was because he was waiting for me to text first, since it really bothered him that I thought I was annoying him. That turned into our “first fight,” but the next day we talked it through in person and agreed that we’re both similar in that way and should just try to relax and text each other more often.

That night he was more touchy than usual and tried to push some boundaries. I politely told him I wasn’t ready for that yet, and he respected it, saying, “Okay, at your pace.”

We met briefly again on Thursday, September 11. He was a bit irritated, not because of me, but because of some issues with organizing his and his friend’s joint birthday party the next day. He seemed down the whole time, but I didn’t push him and we just chatted casually. At the party, though, he was super clingy and affectionate, and I loved it. He told me so many sweet things like that he was lucky to have me and didn’t know what he’d do without me. I said the same back, and we just cuddled the whole night.

Our last “normal” date was Friday, September 19. He had just passed his driving test, he picked me up from school. But unexpectedly, our friends ‘18F’ and ‘18M’ joined us, which annoyed me because we had already planned to have a serious talk. That whole week he had barely texted, and I felt frustrated because I had been going through a lot but couldn’t share any of it with him.

That night turned out awkward. We drove to a lookout point, and while our friends spent most of the time kissing, he and I just lay there hugging and telling each other how much we missed each other. When he dropped me off, I told him honestly that it bothered me he brought our friends along instead of telling them he wanted time alone with me. All he said was, “Sorry, my bad.” Later that evening he texted me again to apologize, and I told him it was fine, but begged him to text me more often because he had become the most important person in my life and I wanted us to be able to share everything. He said he would, but also admitted that our dates were starting to frustrate him, since all we ever did was go for coffee. I told him I didn’t feel that way, that I enjoyed being with him anywhere. He said it wasn’t the same for him anymore, and that it was starting to push him away.

After that, we barely talked just a few messages about how stressed he was with school. Then yesterday, the 22nd, we went out because he said we needed to talk. Honestly, I thought we were just going to discuss everything from the past week, not break up. But right away, he told me he wanted to end things. I was shocked and didn’t know what to say. I asked if he was 100% sure, and he said yes. I begged him to stay and work on our relationship, our communication, our dates, but he just said he had lost his feelings and that it wasn’t the same anymore. I started crying. He hit me with the infamous line: “It’s not you, it’s me.” He said he didn’t want to stay together because he knew I’d try harder, but he couldn’t give the same back, and that would only frustrate him more.

When I asked if he had talked to anyone about it, he said he spoke with his parents, grandparents, and a few friends. Apparently, they all told him it was his decision to make.

He was so cold, and I couldn’t believe this was the same sweet guy I’d been with. I asked if he still would have broken up with me if we had gone out alone on Friday, and he said he didn’t know, that too much time had passed (two days!) and that he had been thinking a lot over the weekend. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him if that was really how he felt, then it was time to let go. He hugged me, and I cried even more. He asked if we could still stay on good terms because I was really important to him and he didn’t want us to end on bad ones.

I immediately called my best friend who was just as shocked as I was. She asked her boyfriend ,who’s also good friends with my ex what was going on. My ex told him he had simply lost feelings and wanted to focus on school since that was his top priority. Her boyfriend was surprised and said it was such a dumb decision, and that my ex would regret it soon. Another one of his friends also said he had made a big mistake and would regret it quickly.

Now I don’t know what to do. Everyone I’ve told is obviously biased and takes my side, saying it’s better that it ended, that he acted like a jerk, and that he doesn’t deserve me. But I’m still in shock and don’t know what to think. Like I mentioned, my previous boyfriend was awful and treated me horribly, he also broke up with me with the same excuse, saying things weren’t the same anymore and his feelings had faded.

So I keep wondering was my ex ever really in love with me? And if he was, was it real love, or was he just excited to finally have a girlfriend and put on all this effort to impress me? Did he break up with me simply because he felt pressured and thought our relationship was the source of that pressure? Part of me wants to believe he’ll come back, like everyone says he will, but I feel like if I keep holding onto that hope, it’ll never happen.",2,1758659656.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Do you ever do anything to check how much you were tipped? Such as looking at the receipt? Either during the active exchange or after.

Could be a restaurant, coffee shop, or any commercial service that prompts tipping.

I have never worked a job where customers could tip me.  
This came up in my mind after my American friends told me that their tipping system prevents awkward tension that occurs when tipping in front of an employee. The employee leaves you with a receipt, you write the tip value, it's placed in a little bill holder with your card (kind of crazy if you ask me), and the employee processes this away from you in the back. This is thus supposed to alleviate face-to-face interaction while tipping.

Personally, I never felt like our tipping system felt overtly uncomfortable. But it made me wonder about the whole exchange.

How do service staff in tipping fields feel? Are these moments weird or uncomfortable ever?  
I would love to hear all personal thoughts and experiences, about the tipping payment interaction, tipping culture, or anything related!

My saving grace is my pyschiatrist who i meet with every month to check in and make sure my med situation is good. 

Ive been having a lot of issues with my body image and just the lack of being able to do anything about it. I had a traumatic birth where i split four ways and have a bladder and uterine prolapse. I still experience pain where my sitches where despite them being healed. Ive told my husband ive been depressed and when he asks what i do to decompress i tell him i cry in the shower. Im not sure if he thinks im joking or not because he doesnt really comment much further during these talks.

Since giving birth my husband and i have had sex twice and attenpted once. Everytime has been super painful and it takes me days to recover and bounce back. Ive asked him each time for after care afterwards because it hurts both physically and mentally and ive explained the after care i want (this has been an issue even before i got pregnant) but he just falls asleep or goes on his phone. Hes told me that he feela like we arent ever intimate and that sex doesnt have to be the only thing we do, that we could make out or i coule give him a bj or handjob. Ive told him that making out is fine but any of the other options are just not appealing because i get nothing. Im exclusively pumping and i never get the time to shower so all that just sounds like more work for me. 

The other day i finally had the energy to stay awake after my babies morning feed, something i never have, and my husband was taking his morning bath. So i cleanes the house and made breakfast. My husband bathes with the door open and when i went to tell him i had made breakfast and coffee i caught him masterbating while watching tiktok thirst videos. It absolutely crushed me. I dont understand how he could do that. 

I feel ugly and unnatractive, its made me hate my body more and its made me regret getting pregnant. I love my baby and never want to lose him but this incident has been making me spiral. My husband and i talked and i told him i dont want him to touch me or see me naked for awhile. Its honestly made me want to go back to self harming but ive been clean from that for 6 years now and i just want to be able to be the best mom for my baby. We havent talked and i cant even bring myself to look at him..

This hits extra hard because when we started dating he still had indecent videos and pictures with his ex that i saw when he was showing me pictures on snap.. it took me 3 years to finally stop thinking about it and having those images pop up but now its all back ontop of knowing there was others he got off to. 

Ive seen other women on here who have been through similar unfortunate events and im just looking for advice on how to get myself through this and to love myself again. Anything and everything is welcomed. I just dont want to feel alone. ",1,1758659307.0,Postpartum_Depression,0,1.0,False

Been brewing these both at 5.0 on the ZP6 (burr rub calibrated to 0).  14g in, 230g water, Melodrip + V60-01.  1:30 straight kettle pour bloom @ 92C + manual stir, :30 2nd Melodrip bloom + gentle shake @ 94C (increase because I don’t preheat my Melodrip), then Melodrip center pour all the way to final weight with a veeery gentle shake right at the end of drain to get a level bed at the very moment it’s needed.  Simplified Rao/Perger water recipe.

Only difference in brew, which I find pretty interesting, is the natural takes T-92s and slow flow rate super well, while washed is much better with the (far faster) standard V60 papers and increased flow rate.  I use T-92s wherever I can, but some coffees just don’t shine with them.

Per usual, washed takes the cake for me.  The natural is jammy and delicious berries, but the washed is simply bursting with florals and peach, with the incredibly strong candy kinda sweetness you can feel in your gums.

It's primarily because they add it to pain pills like Vicodin and Percocet, and people often take more than directed, and even mix it with alcohol (terrible idea)

But you can easily remove the Tylenol with a cold water extraction (works with codeine/apap tabs too)

Crush your pills into a powder, then add to room temperature water and mix thoroughly 

Then add the solution to the freezer, and let it chill til it's nearly frozen, and there will be a layer of white that forms on the bottom 

Then remove it from the freezer and filter it through a coffee filter 

The filter will catch that Tylenol that falls out of solution at low temps, but opiates are much more soluble in water so they remain in solution even at cool temps

Throw the filter out with the Tylenol

Now you're left with a mostly Tylenol-free opiate solution 

You can either drink or dehydrate and be left with a powder

Stay safe, and don't do opiates unless you have to, they can easily ruin your life (speaking from personal experience)",1,1758659227.0,RandomFacts,0,0.67,False
1nosdq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nosdq8,🎭 HELLLLLCAFEEEEE — an Arthouse Experience,"I came across this game by accident. Lately, I’ve been drawn to arthouse, to games that go beyond the usual. At first — complete chaos: a rooftop, a fall, heaven or hell? Then a café, coffee, a computer. Everything feels like a personal confession from the author.

The moment that struck me most was when the fish “judges” you: *“You’re 33, and you haven’t achieved anything.”* I’m 32 — coincidence, or something universal?

From there, the café unfolds as a kind of purgatory. Each cup of coffee leads you to another fragment of memory, another customer’s story — how they lived, how they died. Labyrinths, buttons, strange figures, random food that turns out grotesque, bull idols. This is less a game and more a theater of memories, a surreal walk through someone’s subconscious.

There are multiple endings: a cyclical one (a kind of Groundhog Day loop) and a “road to heaven” if you collect all the bull idols.

# ✅ Pros

* Arthouse atmosphere and psychedelic imagery.
* Strong metaphors (coffee, bull, purgatory).
* Soundtrack shifts brilliantly from oppressive and anxious to calm.
* Multiple endings (with and without idols).
* Fair price, especially on sale.

# ❌ Cons

* Very short (less than an hour).
* Not exactly a “game” — more like interactive theater.
* The story is fragmented and unfinished.
* Arthouse style won’t appeal to everyone.
* Almost no real gameplay (mostly walking, buttons, searching).

# 🎮 Conclusion

HELLLLLLCAFEEEEE is more of an *experience* than a game. It asks more questions than it answers. There is pain, guilt, surreal dreams, and the author’s attempt to share something deeply personal.

For me, it’s arthouse with a touch of psychedelia — interesting but incomplete.

* If you want classic gameplay and story: skip it.
* If you enjoy strange atmospheres, experimental storytelling, and fragmented emotions: give it a try.

**Rating: 6/10 (for courage and mood, not for depth).**

# 📝 Fun facts

* The title literally hints: *Hell Café* — a café in hell/purgatory.
* Collecting bull idols unlocks an alternate ending.
* The developer has other similar arthouse projects worth exploring.

1nos561,https://i.redd.it/acl1jmvzzyqf1.jpeg,People's Possession For The Win!,"Nice to be back at coffeerotation!  A little quiet here.  I brewed this Nestor Lasso Estate from People's Possession three different ways:

1. On the Xbloom using a profile I built from SOT Coffee's recipe: 15 gms (4 pours @ 90C - 40ml bloom, 90ml, 80ml, 46ml. TWW water at 1/2 strength.  It made a delicious cup.  I tasted strong raspberry jam flavor but none of the other flavor notes on the bag - still was a great cup.
2. On the Pulsar.  16 gms.  40ml bloom closed then swirl, turn to 1 o'clock position, 120ml pour wait for drawdown, 96ml pour and wait for finish, all at 92C with TWW water at 1/2 strength.  Same flavor notes with slightly heavier body.  Slight bitterness that suggested a bit of overextraction.  Still delicious.
3. On the Robot. 18.5 gms in 1:2.5 ratio out.  pre-infusion 10 sec. 8 bar extraction for 35 sec.  This was, surprisingly, the best preparation of all.  I do not have good luck with light roast espressos, but this was perfect.  I got all the flavors: dark chocolate, raspberry, toffee.  It was neither bitter nor sour - my best light roast espresso so far.

I am excited to try more from this roaster.

*We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost... Now the only way out’s in your heart shaped box...*

Timing is everything, I guess.

Our timing sucks.  It sucks a lot.  A lot a lot.

I wish it wasn't like this.  I almost wish we could go back.  Back to how it was.  Back to you and me.  Cuz even though we were so wrong, you always felt so right.  

But it's too late for that.  

For you.  For me.  

*And I hear you now when you said it hurt... But it had to fall, fall apart to work... As I see you now in what's left of me... Is it too late to plead insanity?*

This is killing me, you know.  

My stomach is in knots.  Can't eat.  Just want to curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep.  

*But I can't close my eyes, for it... For it is there where you haunt me most...*

I wish, I wish, I ***wish*** we had met under different circumstances.  

*'Cause I hate that it seemed you were never enough... You were broken and bleeding in the name of love... And I hope that we meet in another life...*

Is it okay if I pretend, just for a moment, that we did?  

Maybe we met at a coffee shop.  Maybe you bought me a coffee.  Maybe I bought one for you.

Maybe it was a blind date set up by a mutual friend.  Maybe we met on an online dating site.  Or maybe we met in the park when your dog ran circles around us and pinned us together with his leash.  

Maybe we met at work.  Or in school.  Or at the grocery store.

Maybe I had a flat tire and you stopped to help.  Maybe I laughed nervously and asked if you were a serial killer.  Maybe, after you gave me a lift to town, I offered to buy lunch in thanks.

Maybe we met on a horseback trail.  Or maybe out hiking or at the beach or maybe we met at our favorite restaurant.  

Doesn't matter, really.  Only that, this time, when we met, we'd be ready for each other.  Unattached.  Ready to give each other what we so desperately crave.  Ready to fall in love.  Ready to write *our* story, rather than steal a page or two in someone else's.  

Time and space were not kind to us this time around.  

*And I hope that we meet in another life...*

1nos1rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1nos1rl/db_hates_everything_i_do/,DB hates everything I do,"So I’ve worked for this family since April or May so I haven’t been here long but I’ve been here long enough to know that my DB clearly hates me. 
Every single thing I do is wrong to him, down to the streets I take to walk to the grocery store.  These are the top 3 things that DB has said/done to criticize me for no apparent reason:

1. The other day I was walking and pulling a shopping trolley to the grocery store and I happened to run into DB on his lunch hour (both NPs wfh but he’ll go out to get his lunch) so he asks me where I’m going (no hi or anything even though I said hi to him) and I said the grocery store and he frowned and asked why I’m going this way (I was on a main road, sidewalk, but the road cuts through a quieter residential area) and I explained that I always go this way because the other way (also a main road but doesn’t go through a residential area) is covered in construction so half the sidewalk is closed down and it’s just an overall nuisance to navigate. And he snapped at me and said “but X Street is just straight across” and I said “I know but the construction makes it hard” and then he rolled his eyes at me and walked away. (The way I was going makes a 2 minute time difference to get to the grocery store but I’ve taken the other road with construction and because of the sidewalk closures and people trying to navigate all that it’s actually currently faster to go through the residential area)

2. He doesn’t acknowledge me in the house ever unless MB is around and even then he doesn’t really speak to me or look at me. It’s so awkward and makes me so uncomfortable. Whenever I see either my MB or DB I’ll say hi and ask how their day is going etc, even though we’re both working and busy I always make a point of saying hello whenever they enter where I am. MB will sometimes stop to chat but other times she’ll just say hi back and say how her day is while she’s getting a cup of coffee and going back to work. Usually that’s all the time we have to chat before the end of the day so our conversations are usually short and sweet but courteous. When I see DB I do the same and he won’t even say hello to me, like not even when I’m coming in the door to start the day or even when I leave at the end of the day. It’s now at the point where I get a pit in my stomach whenever DB is around because it feels so awful to be ignored like this.

3. I had to go to a store to pick up cheese a different day because the day that I went they were out. For context, my MB and DB only buy things from specialty stores so the cheese they wanted wasn’t acceptable to them to purchase from the grocery store yet somehow DB rolled his eyes at me because I told him the store was out of the cheese he wanted. So then he asked me to go back and take a picture of the empty space to make sure they were really out. This is not the first time DB has reacted this way to when an item he wants is not available and he always demands I send a picture. And then when I come back from the store he’ll always make some sort of face at me to show his displeasure

I don’t understand why he treats me this way. I don’t know what I’ve done or said or anything to have him dislike me this much. I’ve never had a DB dislike me at all before actually. I’m used to most DBs being aloof/not really involved with childcare and stuff but none have ever been like this to me where they don’t speak to me or acknowledge me unless it’s to criticize. I don’t know how to make it better either, I always try to be bright and cheery and kind and it gets me nowhere ",4,1758658389.0,Nanny,3,1.0,False
