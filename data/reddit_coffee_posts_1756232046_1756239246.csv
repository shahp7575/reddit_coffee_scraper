I just recently got diagnosed and have start bladder instillations. Things seems to be improving but I'm also heavily avoiding any triggers or possible triggers since my diagnosis. My last flare was from a pineapple popsicle and I was curled up in my bed wishing I could claw my bladder out. 

But I miss my daily lattes and caffiene so much. I'm trying sips of caffinated teas here and there hoping for a tiny boost of energy with little side effects. I've actually been avoiding coffee for months now. I believe caffiene is a trigger not just acid. 

Just wanted to vent and see if anyone is in the same boat or is maybe brave and decides to suffer for some espresso every once in a while. ü•≤",1,1756239036.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

1n0wbxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1n0wbxg/25_months_in/,2.5 Months in!,"So, a *little* background:

I left my parents' house in **2009 weighing 88Kg (194 lbs) for 1m85 (6'1)** (I was 21 years old).

I never bought a scale for my apartment (HUGE mistake!) and never paid attention to calories/nutrients/fat, etc. (these were abstract concepts to me).

I ate a lot of ready meals and junk food. And when I say ready meals, I'm not talking about 300g portions, I often bought the 1kg family-sized ones and ate them in one sitting.

I also started drinking beer regularly in 2015.

I think I was slowly gaining weight since then, but no scale so I only started to realize it in 2018.

Now here's the problem: all my life I've heard people saying that losing weight is very hard, that you have to exercise (I hate exercising), that you have to be hungry all the time...  
When I was a kid, I saw my mother try many diets that never worked for her.

So I told myself that I was fat and that there was nothing I could do about it. That in life there are fat people and thin people, and I was one of the fat ones.

I kept overeating and drinking and gained even more weight.

I think I really started to see myself as ugly and fat in the mirror around 2021, which depressed me and made me lose a lot of self-confidence (I didn't have much to begin with). But I still didn't have the courage to change that.

**June 2025 (I'm now 36):** I don't know what triggered it, but one day I finally decided to buy a scale and give it a try: **121.5Kg (268 lbs)**.

That same day, I stopped buying junk food and started eating salads, chicken breast, Skyr, bananas and switched to a less caloric beer (I plan to stop drinking beer later).  
A few days later, I ran out of sugar for my coffee and forgot to buy more, so I shrugged it off and just started drinking sugar-free coffee.

And damn, it feels easy!

**2.5 months and I've already lost 12Kg (26.4 lbs).**

I'm not hungry, I don't feel like I'm making an effort, and I already feel better.

I sweat less, standing up from a sitting position is easier, and if I take the stairs instead of the elevator to get home (6 floors) I don't feel like I'm dying when I reach the top.  
My legs and arms are much thinner and my face is a bit less chubby.   
Sadly, it's not visible on my chest and belly yet (I read that those are the last to go).

I wish I bought a scale in 2009 and knew about CICO earlier...

So now I plan to keep going all the way back to my 2009 weight.",1,1756238765.0,loseit,0,1.0,False
1n0wb38,https://i.redd.it/oe90mc5d7flf1.jpeg,Latitude 71,"(As always, pinned on my profile is my entire library with an off site link for easier reading than a Reddit caption.

Or, again, go to my profile for the reader friendly link under my library. Deuces!)

Somewhere near the Arctic Circle at about latitude 66, the sun rises high in the summer, and, alternatively, stows away for winter, creating a contrast of extremes in a forgotten landscape. The further north that one travels, the greater those extremes of endless light or crushing darkness grow, with the true poles being six months in either spectrum. Nuiqsut, perching near latitude 71, sees 35 days of polar night and polar day, respectively. The sun sets some time before Christmas one final time that year before briefly reappearing on the horizon over a month later in the new year, and by June it is a domineering presence until it dwindles once again, repeating the cycle.

Nui (new-ee), as locals and workers often called it, supported roughly 500 souls along the rich Colsville River Delta, harvesting fish and whales in a fairly traditional lifestyle, and guarding the pristine arctic expanse in cohabitation with the oil industry of Alpine, roughly 10 miles north. It was a holy land, but there was still lucrative money to to be made by letting oil tycoons explore and drill where spirits lurked. Besides, at the end of the day, the tribe called the shots and enforced regulations to keep the rigs treading lightly. Spill even a cup of coffee and the tribal reps were breathing down your neck. Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork‚Ä¶ all due to a careless misstep and a shitty cup of Folgers. ‚ÄúThe best part of waking up,‚Äù my ass.

Alpine operations were year round, but exploration was seasonal. The man camp tended established pumps, both on the marshy land of the arctic itself and offshore in the nearby sea. Crews came and went on rotation, living in the industrial walls for the duration of their hitch. It was one gargantuan, mechanical hive full of busy ants. The buildings spewed steam at any given day from stilted structures and at times, when the hive‚Äôs refinery process called for it, the stacks would churn red hot flames 50‚Äô or more into the sky like a furious dragon guarding its keep. Black gold for a greedy beast.

The oil fields themselves were just below the surface of the tundra, a quick drill to find the lucrative sludge. Pipes connected pumps to permanent structures like Alpine, but to check new drilling prospects, contrary to what one would think, it was easiest to do so in the winter months when the marshes were firm, the wildlife scarce, and the mosquitoes absent. So as the sun waned, the temperature followed but the prospects of fortune grew.

30F, cold for a snow bird.

0F, a humbling number.

-20F, it hurt to breathe. 

-70F‚Ä¶ that temperature tested life‚Äôs ability to remain alive. And in the darkness, that temperature wasn‚Äôt unheard of.

Far above zero, most life migrated and what remained hid itself in burrows to avoid the cruelty of the world outside or scavenged on carcasses while the tundra itself slept in frigid darkness. The ice thickened with each short day, and when it was thick enough, the engineers built the ice roads, connecting Nuiqsut and Alpine to the rest of the continent via road for a few short months each year. One could only fly in otherwise, weather permitting.


With the ice road completed, a caravan hauled 7 tuckers, lumbering machines, west for Ice Check: the initial fleet to perform the final check in the proposed field of some near 100 square miles of endless tundra. A few days behind them followed more rigs with more equipment and personnel to set up the Sleigh Camp on the ice pad, and when that was assembled, we would drag the camp through the tundra and spend the next 3 months in the field collecting seismic data. The Ice Check crew would confirm the route before the full project deployed, and this crew was composed of a rag tag group of geologists, operators, one medic, and the project overhead.

I hopped in an orange tucker with Will, a round faced, kind man that ran machines for the company for many years. In the few days we knew each other, we swapped nondescript small talk. He told me he had a fianc√©, two dogs named Ringo and Binx, and rented a house in a small town down south. That he played the acoustic guitar and was already looking forward to breakfast at the Goose with his four year old nephew when he got back home. He told me that the tucker he grabbed today was the fastest in the fleet and traveled a whopping 10 miles per hour. I smirked and told him that the medic‚Äôs tucker was allegedly the fastest at 12. 

‚ÄúWhat would you know about the medic tucker, geologist?‚Äù Will poked.

‚ÄúAllegedly,‚Äù I poked back with a light smile.

My purpose on the journey was to interpret the data sent from the field and to scope geologically significant areas to protect sensitive habitat. Normally, I‚Äôd sit inside a shitty, heated conex in the Sleigh Camp reviewing the previous day‚Äôs data, but this early access allowed me a chance to see the landscape, both for the opportunity of self indulgence and for a greater understanding of the land as a whole. 

On our lonely commute, we passed by a derelict pump. In its obsoletion, it was protected from the elements and wrapped in thick, black plastic, bound like a giant body concealed for nefarious purposes. It was the only visual that broke the horizon, and we felt it to be terribly ominous. We called it the Totem. Slowly, it fell below the horizon as we traversed the uneven landscape each day, but it was a marker when we could see it.

Will picked a careful line over a bank to approach a frozen lake. Behind his tucker, he dragged a metal crate with a small device that emitted a signal and collected data. He lined up his route and the tucker crawled effortlessly, despite the slope being much steeper than it looked. Soon we leveled out onto the lake, and it was an eery feeling knowing that, although incredibly thick and secure, only ice separated our giant machine from a frigid demise. The device scattered gray and white lines as it interpreted what passed beneath it and displayed it across a small monitor inside the tucker. It vaguely resembled a flat, horizontal ultrasound and showed irregularities in the earth below.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt end,‚Äù I spoke with a touch of worry in my voice, thinking back to the Totem.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Will asked.

‚ÄúThe tundra, I mean. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ an endless expanse.‚Äù I gestured to the seemingly eternal horizon.

‚ÄúWell, about 20 miles that way is the Arctic Ocean. It‚Äôs frozen this time of year. So it‚Äôll look the same, but it does end over there,‚Äù Will nudged his face to the north as he spoke. He paused before he donned his gloves and hopped out of the tucker to stretch and do a routine walk around so he could check for small problems before they became big ones.

I glanced first at the monitor. The previously chaotic image now stood still with the machine. I glanced next at the thermometer to see -33F, donned my gloves, and stepped outside to serve my curiosity as well.

The sun was setting after making an appearance for less than an hour, and we found ourselves shrouded in cool purple with a warm, golden knife‚Äôs edge on the horizon. Shutting the door behind me, I hissed to feel the cold. It was 45F in Georgia when I left for this gig, nearly 100 degrees warmer than here. I carefully crawled down the tracks to disembark from the machine and stepped a few paces further. A light and steady breeze bit at my face as I stared at the last seconds of sun for the day. 

‚ÄúMarie!‚Äù Concern graced Will‚Äôs tone.

The wind drowned his voice much more readily than one would expect, and I whipped around to hear his alarm.

‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt get near that thing! Rabies!‚Äù He yelled, pointing to my left.

I wouldn‚Äôt have seen it, but it was approaching fast. It was a haggard arctic fox with a mortal wound on its left ribs, trotting erratically towards me. Prior to arrival we all had to attend a three day course on safety, a large portion of which discussed wildlife. Arctic foxes were one of the few year round residents and rabies plagued them, sometimes taking more than half of the population on bad years. But all that training and logic escaped me in the moment. 

It stopped and panted, staggering a stone‚Äôs throw away from me. It shook its head and beared its gums, throwing thick tendrils of infected saliva as it gagged and shivered with its ears pinned flat. Suddenly, it lifted its face and snarled, running towards me at an angle as if it fought the sway and imbalance of an off kilter boat. My eyes grew wide.

Will charged up and punted the animal square in the side, catching both myself and the animal off guard as the diseased mongrel yelped.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get in the tucker before it gets back on its feet,‚Äù he said, shoving me gently towards our haven and scraping his foot on the ice.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I froze,‚Äù I whimpered, safely stowed inside. ‚ÄúIt just didn‚Äôt look like a real animal‚Ä¶ a toy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre pretty cute when they‚Äôre not rabid, hardly a threat. They just want snacks.‚Äù

‚ÄúRabies would be a hell of a way to go up here, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell of a way to go anywhere,‚Äù he retorted. We paused.

‚ÄúDid you see its side? What do you think happened to it?‚Äù

‚ÄúProlly scrapped with wolves,‚Äù he answered.

I grunted in acknowledgement and paused again. ‚ÄúWho is the rep traveling with today?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rep? Oh that weird guy? Patrick? I think Corey has the pleasure of him today.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll report it.‚Äù I shifted focus to the radio, ‚Äúhey Corey,‚Äù I stuttered, unaccustomed to the communication device. He responded unenthusiastically. ‚ÄúTell Patrick we got a rabid fox. We‚Äôre at that big lake on the northeast area of the project.‚Äù 

There wasn‚Äôt an immediate response, but to my disdain, Patrick‚Äôs unmistakable dialect replied. He spoke in garbled gibberish, slurred through mangled teeth and a crooked jaw. His bastardized accent was worsened by his inbred Appalachian roots and obscured further when he moved himself to the middle of nowhere and married into the tribe. Rumor had it that he had been beaten senseless for whatever creepy antics he had previously performed, leaving him deformed, disliked, an indiscernible.

‚ÄúWut lake?‚Äù Patrick sneered through the radio‚Äôs buzz.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have a name on the map. We‚Äôre on the northeast corner, right on the project border. I‚Äôll get you GPS coordinates, give me a sec.‚Äù

‚ÄúIssit it bythe Fssh Crik flts huntin grnds?‚Äù

Will laughed as he watched me pinch the bridge of my nose in frustration. Patrick had a habit of not only speaking completely unintelligibly but also of using terms and locations only locals knew.

I smirked, ‚Äúactually, Patrick, it‚Äôs just south of a big lake called ‚ÄòLake D-‚Äò‚Äù I paused, feigning confusion on pronunciation, ‚Äúdesnuts? Deeznuts? Not sure how you pronounce it.‚Äù

Patrick mumbled something that neither Will nor myself cared to understand. We were already sick of that asymmetrically-faced freak and had only worked with him for a week. Instead, we ignored him, finished the mapping for the day, and followed a different route home to grab a final set of data. Without the sun, the temperature had dropped to -41F.

‚ÄúDid you hear how Patrick shit himself a couple days ago and tried to blame it on our guys?‚Äù I blurted after prolonged silence.

‚ÄúWho didn‚Äôt hear about it,‚Äù Will laughed.

‚ÄúYeah, but did you hear how after he tracked his liquid shit all over the tundra, he went to the medic, snuck up on her, sniffed her hair, and shit himself again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, she told me yesterday. She says she told Jason that unless he was dying she wanted nothing to do with him. Jason had to give him a ride back to Alpine cause she declared him ‚Äúunfit for duty‚Äù that day, gave him a Gatorade and a stern ‚Äúfuck off.‚Äù Can you imagine? An hour on the road with a man actively shitting himself?‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúAnd the medic, that poor girl, he‚Äôs a creep-‚Äù

Before I could finish the thought, Will brought the machine to an abrupt halt. Even at 10mph, it jerked forwards. We barely noticed the eye shine in the halogen bulbs and I caught a glimpse of its familiar mangled flank from my vantage when it darted straight under the track of the tucker. 

‚ÄúShit, that‚Äôs going to be a mess of paperwork,‚Äù Will groaned.

‚ÄúThat was the same fox that attacked us on the lake, it had the same wound.‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúI mean, at least we can document that it was rabid and that it got hit cause it wasn‚Äôt in its right mind.‚Äù

Will pulled the tucker forward before fully parking it. We opened our doors and I grimaced to see fur and blood stuck on the track where I stepped out.

‚ÄúWell, you didn‚Äôt miss it, part of it is stuck to the track right here.‚Äù I winced, noting a peculiar patch of long, dark fur woven into the hard plastic tucker track.

‚ÄúHey, turn on the rear floods and tell Corey, I‚Äôll grab some photos for the report.‚Äù

I clicked the radio to speak, ‚ÄúCorey,‚Äù I paused.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Corey was curt, likely fed up with Patrick.

‚ÄúTell Patrick that rabid fox came back and ran under the machine. It‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

Patrick responded with more unintelligible nonsense. 

‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt understand that, Patrick says you can show him tomorrow in person. He says his stomach is feeling much better.‚Äù

I could hear the smirk on Corey‚Äôs face through the radio.

I broke the news to Will when he returned, and we both cursed tomorrow‚Äôs journey. 

‚ÄúListen, we‚Äôre moving all the survival equipment to the seat behind me so he can‚Äôt sit there. I know I‚Äôm not much of a looker, but I ain‚Äôt giving that creep a single chance to sniff my hair.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know he‚Äôs married too?‚Äù Will interrupted.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most disgusting thing I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù


I sipped my coffee while I waited for the morning briefing to start. It would be our last morning in Alpine as the Sleigh Camp was ready for personnel to occupy it. Crews would drag it into the field tomorrow while we finished the last of our data and we‚Äôd meet them at the first camp. I relished the last semblance of civilization I‚Äôd see for my immediate future. 

I was entertained to watch an operator flirt with the medic across the Alpine mess hall. She was a busty, stoic woman with silky blonde hair, a wicked scowl, and a west coast swagger, but even she laughed when the operator feigned sniffing her hair. Make light of the horrors, I guess.

But my silent laughter was cut short as Patrick shuffled up beside me, grumbling in some redneck tongue spoken only by him. His skin was thick like leather, worn by nicotine and pocked with scars, and his patchy, shoulder length hair was a dingy gray-blonde. Will followed shorty after, passing a frown at the haggard man and a gentle smile to me.	

‚ÄúI hear you two had a fatal collision yesterday,‚Äù the medic suddenly chirped on approach, licking her lips after a gulp of mediocre coffee. She greeted Will and I but refused to acknowledge Patrick‚Äôs presence.

‚ÄúThere were no survivors,‚Äù I joked, frowning, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Alyssa, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Ally, Alyssa, same difference. Hey, I haven‚Äôt been out your way yet, comms are bad out that way, yeah?‚Äù

I looked to Will, who thankfully was eager to answer. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, in the Fish Creek area,‚Äù he spoke politely to the medic, like a young man at church conversing with an elder. ‚ÄúYou drop down into a perfect pocket that messes with radio signal. It‚Äôs a quick pass though, but it‚Äôs easy to get stuck out there. Lots of snow drifts and drops, and the light is always flat out there. It opens up again on either side, just be careful if you leave the rig and plan your approach if there isn‚Äôt a trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy, just thinking logistics, not that I expect anything to happen. But who knows, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a biological hazmat threat the other day‚Äù Ally sneered, passing a wicked glance at Patrick. The briefing started shortly after, with the project manager, Jason, assigning us back to the northeastern perimeter to finish our area and document the fox incident with the rep.

Although we only saw the sun above the horizon for a short period, there was plenty of time prior to its appearance where the sky simply glowed in lavender or gray hues. But today was one of those days where the light was painfully flat and freezing fog settled across the land. There was hardly a glow, only an ongoing, dull haze.

We sat in silence, streaming music until the music stopped, indicating that reception was lost.

‚ÄúWhen the light is like this,‚Äù Will started slowly, uncomfortable in the quiet, ‚Äúyou gotta be extra careful to follow the known trail. There could be a 10‚Äô drop from a drift right in front of you and you won‚Äôt see it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but we‚Äôre headed where we don‚Äôt have a known trail,‚Äù I quipped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they send us out first, we are the experts.‚Äù Will smirked.

As if on cue, the tucker lurched forward and my end swayed upright, skewing my gaze towards the sky, not that it was distinguishable from the ground in that frigid mist.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shitting me. Did we fall? Did we fall through the ice???‚Äù Panic briefly poured from me as the irrational fear of falling through a frozen tundra lake crossed my mind.

‚ÄúYes- I mean no- I mean, yes we fell, but not through ice.‚Äù Will haphazardly reassured as he threw on his arctic gear and hopped out.

Patrick babbled some eccentricities kitty corner of me, and I stared, stunned, at the thermometer: -50F, and it would be colder with the moisture of the fog outside. I threw my gear on and fought against gravity to open the door.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù I could hear Will curse as I stumbled off the cockeyed and crippled machine.

Behind us, the rear driver‚Äôs side track had sheered clear from the machine. Despite a meticulous daily check, the track had simply catastrophically failed, severed at some major point without warning. The cold likely caused the metal to become brittle and opportunity simply struck it. Will grabbed the duck pond from the hood of the tucker and threw it under the axel to catch as much of the spurting transmission fluid as he could, but there was already a mess of pink, oily fluid scattered about the machine like bubblegum syrup on shaved ice. More paperwork. Worse still: we were stranded.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he cursed again.

Will reached into his door and pawed for the radio. To our dismay, the radio buzzed a low pitched tone, the sound it made when it wasn‚Äôt transmitting: the sound of no signal. I grew suddenly aware that I hadn‚Äôt zipped my jacket shut, and the bitter cold of the arctic had already settled itself into my chest, burrowing into my core like a parasite. I shivered.

Will grabbed his phone to see if he had cell reception revealing no better result, and I checked mine too, just to be sure. I grimaced at Will in response. 

‚ÄúI doubt numbnuts is any better off.‚Äù Will loathed. ‚ÄúListen, it‚Äôll only be about half a mile back to get cell reception, where we lost the music. I‚Äôm going to have to walk back there but I‚Äôll have to leave you alone with him.‚Äù Will held me by my shoulders, eyes full of concern. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pry bar behind my seat-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not leaving me alone with that freak show,‚Äù I interjected. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with you.‚Äù 

Will rolled his eyes and winced, but he could read the stubbornness on my face well enough to know he wasn‚Äôt going to convince me otherwise.

‚ÄúFine. Gear up, miss.‚Äù He stated.

I waddled back to the crippled tucker, crawling up to the passenger side while I  emotionally prepared myself for the upcoming trek. Patrick grumbled questions and I ignored him, but Will eventually explained the plan to him in minimal detail. 

Patrick protested through his misaligned teeth, ‚Äúyou dunt know ths land, Im goin.‚Äù

Will sighed. He couldn‚Äôt argue. He knew enough of arctic survival, but even if this troglodyte only married into the tribe he still knew the land better than Will or I. Mid-zip with an added fleece chest layer, I stopped to stare nervously at Will. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not wrong.‚Äù He spoke quietly and guiltily to me.

My face expressed my obvious disdain, but it was true. However, Will would be with me, I‚Äôd be safe with Will. If I stuck close to him, there‚Äôd be no threat other than the cold. A thirty minute hike, a quick phone call, and we‚Äôd return to the tucker to wait for rescue. 

I took a moment to plot the GPS point of the tucker on my phone. I may not have had reception, but the mapping app I used worked regardless and GPS could track my location well enough to lead us back to the tucker if we got lost in the flat light and coming darkness. Our only threat, truly, was the cold.

I shoved a headlamp into my pocket and pulled the thick balaclava over my face, leaving only my eyes exposed. With a deep breath I pushed the door open and uphill once again and slid down the track to follow Will into the gray abyss.


We quickly lost sight of the tucker as we plodded north. Partially because of the topography with rolling snow drifts and jagged willow chokes, and partially due to the nature of the thick, freezing inversion that clung to the land like a film of choking smog over a city. Despite being far below freezing, the fog of the inversion left the air moist, and the moisture pulled at heat regardless of any attempts to keep it out. It seemed nearly conscious and predatory in its efforts to freeze. I was confident, however, that I felt prepared for the cold as I marched through the crinkling snow. At least my body did. My eyes hurt, and I blinked rapidly to feel the cold pry at my delicate tear ducts. Frost quickly formed at the corners of my eyes and on my eyelashes, biting further. 

I checked my phone frequently, watching for signal to reappear, but I hadn‚Äôt accounted for the fact that the cold drained its battery quickly. I‚Äôd retract it into my sleeve to try to keep it warm; nonetheless, it dropped faster than I was comfortable watching. But, to my relief, at the top of one whipped knoll, a single bar appeared in the corner of the screen. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I squawked. ‚ÄúI have a bar!‚Äù My voice was muffled through my gear.

‚ÄúCan you make a call?‚Äù Will asked, briefly releasing his hunched and protected stance to engage me hopefully.

‚ÄúProbably not a call, but maybe a text. Let‚Äôs go a littler further- two bars!‚Äù I exclaimed as the second appeared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll get a call.‚Äù

I pulled my glove from my hand to dial Jason, and I flinched immediately to feel the bitter air pierce into my digits. Relief washed over me as the phone made the connection.

‚ÄúJason? Goddamn am I happy you answered. The tucker is broke, we‚Äôre stranded. No reception.‚Äù I yelled through fabric. ‚ÄúWe need someone to pick us up, here‚Äôs our coordinates: seven zero dot two six four five five-‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you cold?‚Äù Jason‚Äôs diluted southern accent interrupted. 

‚ÄúWhat? No, not really, we‚Äôre not far from the tucker-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will be.‚Äù His voice was mechanical and as cold as the landscape, and, abruptly, the line disconnected and signal was lost. Will could see the confusion on my face.

‚ÄúWhat happened, miss? Did you get disconnected?‚Äù Will asked, concerned.

‚ÄúYeah, but,‚Äù I paused, unsure how to explain the sense of dread that overcame me, ‚Äúhe was acting weird.‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúHe- he asked if we were cold.‚Äù I stuttered realizing how dumb it sounded, ‚Äúbut‚Ä¶ it felt threatening.‚Äù

Will‚Äôs face was still shrouded in his mask, but his eyes adequately spoke his concern to my words. His scowl quickly morphed to confusion as he looked beyond me, ‚Äúwhat is that?‚Äù

There was a pause, but Patrick mumbled, ‚Äúmuskox.‚Äù

I had forgotten that Patrick traveled with us, but my concern now focused on the lumbering shape behind me. The dark silhouette loomed in the fog, still and observant. 

The frost on my eyelashes was thick now, and I carefully pulled a chunk off to better focus on the animal to no avail. The muted world beneath my balaclava was warm and secure but simultaneously smothering and painful through the narrow exposure of the mask‚Äôs face hole. I squinted and pulled more frost from my eyes, when, suddenly, the animal stood on its hind legs. Its formerly thick coat of fur untangled to a length of coarse hair, spilling over its massive shoulders like a cape. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an ox,‚Äù I whispered fearfully, afraid to speak too loudly.

The animal clacked its bony fingers and sniffed the air. Without warning, it broke into a clumsy, bipedal sprint with a roar. We stumbled across the sugar snow, crisp and sand-like as it displaced beneath our feet. The animal‚Äôs haphazard shape didn‚Äôt slow it and it was faster than us. It overtook us, swallowing Will in a flurry of black hair while he howled in agony and curses. Crimson splashed across the virgin snow. I mournfully thanked the fog solely because it obscured whatever fate ultimately befell Will, and I fled further north from the massacre to save myself. But the fog didn‚Äôt hide his pleas for help.

I fell down a small bank and scrambled to right myself on impact. My eyes wildly scanned from my mask to the top of the ravine for any sign of the threat. I pulled the mask from my face so that I could better see the world around me, and immediately, my breath hurt. I could feel the fragile tissue in my nose tense and sting in the air. Puffs of cold smoke churned from my open mouth with each breath and my cheeks flushed red with the flash of cold. No longer dampened by bristly wool, I could only hear the chatter of ice as it scattered across the battered landscape in the breeze. No scream of pain nor cry for help. Above me, there were only sleeping willows. Beyond me, there was only rapidly darkening fog. 

I aggressively patted my arm pocket, hoping I hadn‚Äôt lost my phone during the altercation, and to my relief, I felt the familiar shape through the layers of arctic survival gear. Since leaving the tucker, it had dropped to 38% battery life. The map chewed for a moment, flashing, ‚Äúwaiting for GPS,‚Äù before the blue arrow finally displayed my whereabouts and direction. The tucker was less than a mile away.

I secured the phone once again and moved cautiously up the bank. As I advanced, I checked sparingly, staying the course each time I confirmed the route. But after some time, I pulled out the phone and the arrow that represented me spun wildly in place. 

I had forgotten to cover my head and face from earlier, and by now my ears ached so badly that the pain of frostnip throbbed deep into my skull. Yet I forgot all about the sensation after seeing the icon whirl, and I frantically looked around me. I held my breath. No longer hyperventilating in panic, my breath was silent. Warm air was trapped in my stilled lungs. I realized that I could hear the drone of the tucker‚Äôs engine nearby. I was blind without the GPS, but I could still navigate by sound if the arctic wind would not betray my bearings. I marched toward the distant engine.

I jerked my head to my left when I saw a darker shape. It stuck out more than the willows had, but perhaps it was only my paranoia. My fleeting optimism shattered as the mass moved in response to my acknowledgment, standing upright again and throwing its head forward with a snarl. Its hair looked stiff, frozen in rigid locks with Will‚Äôs blood.

I ran.

I ran and stumbled up a small hill, nearly falling over willows and sliding in loosely drifted snow. And at the top of the knob, I could see the warm glow of the tucker‚Äôs headlights below me. Emboldened with renewed hope I ran faster, lungs burning with each inhale of frigid air and eyes blinding with accumulating ice crystals. I could hear the shuffling beast roar behind me, closing the gap between us as I stumbled to move quickly in cumbersome gear. I pulled the lower side door of the tucker, rolling around it as it swung freely open. The monster‚Äôs footsteps were directly behind me, and I fought the door and launched myself inside, groping for the handle to safely stow myself inside. 

I screamed when I heard Patrick mumble some incoherency above me from the higher passenger seat. Of course, he had survived. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Will?‚Äù I asked, panting and indifferent to Patrick‚Äôs well being. He was silent. ‚ÄúPatrick, where is Will???‚Äù

‚ÄúTundra gottim.‚Äù Patrick snorted.

‚ÄúThe Tundra? Please, what kind of bullshit is that?‚Äù I scrambled to crawl on top of the survival gear behind Patrick, away from the door I had entered and hoped if it planned to break in that it would eat Patrick first.

‚ÄúTurn off the lights,‚Äù I demanded.

Patrick obeyed, but he moved slowly and stiffly, whimpering slightly. It was then that I noticed the glistening blackness on his gear: blood.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs blood is that? Is it yours?‚Äù My bedside manner was curt, I didn‚Äôt really care if he was hurt, it was just that my brain clung to the reality that, despite seeing the monster first hand, Patrick was a more believable threat than a beast.

Patrick groaned in agreement, repositioning himself to reveal tattered layers and a flash of bloodied, meaty tissue below. We sat in silence in the dark.

We didn‚Äôt see the monster again. Perhaps it was hiding under the tucker, waiting for one of us to nervously step outside falsely thinking the coast was clear.

Patrick‚Äôs breathed with some labor. It was clear he had taken some blow in the fight to escape. Then again, if the rest of his anatomy matched his lopsided face, it was possible that what I heard was his normal respiratory pattern and I simply hadn‚Äôt noticed until now. Carefully, he removed his layers and prodded at his wounds. The machine filled with the smell of idled oil and coagulating iron. I rummaged through the survival gear, finding the first aid kit, and passed it to him in silence. 

‚ÄúHey, Patrick, turn on the lights so you can see what you‚Äôre doing. That thing has to know we‚Äôre here. The lights won‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù I spoke flatly.

He grumbled in what sounded like an agreeable tone and I flinched as the cab filled with light. I nervously stared at my reflection in the glass, no longer able to see outside. In the new illumination, Patrick exposed a much greater injury than I had expected. A deep laceration carved below his collarbone to halfway down his bicep, and blood still oozed from it, finally beginning to clot now that he had started to warm up again. A white patch flashed next to the rippled, pale fat, his clavicle. He tugged at a length of black hair that seemingly ingrained itself into his flayed tissue, and threw the matted mess to the floor when he freed it. He staunched the blood with a combination of gauze and spare wool socks. I eyed him keenly.

‚ÄúPatrick,‚Äù I started cautiously, ‚Äúthe tundra didn‚Äôt attack Will. What was that?‚Äù

Patrick was quiet, squeezing his bloodied sock tightly to no avail, but eventually he spoke, ‚Äúspirit.‚Äù He winced. ‚ÄúThey dunt like to be bothered.‚Äù

I wanted to be angry at his enduring cryptic answers, but pity overtook me watching steady trickles of dark blood slowly pool on the floor beneath him and drip down the angled floor of the machine.

‚ÄúWhat does it want?‚Äù I asked, rummaging through my pack for more layers to staunch his bleeding.

1n0w2jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n0w2jd/42f_cannabis_allergy_severe_seeking_options/,"42F, Cannabis allergy - severe - seeking options","I'll have two main questions at the end in a tldr; the history is lengthy and I'm unsure what might be relevant or not

I'm 42F, 5'3, 158 lbs. 
Asthma, migraines, ADHD (and likely also ASD)
Allergies to:
- Penillin (anaphylaxis)
- sulfa drugs (hives, swelling), 
- biaxin (swelling), 
- shellfish (swelling, vomiting, rash), 
- dairy - casein and whey (both non-IgE - mostly gastro, asthma, and eczema), 
- peanuts (hives, and a sudden, phobia-level, aversion to it but never anaphylaxis), 
- most hair dyes (rash, burning, eczema, sores)
- Cannabis 
- potentially also an ingredient in guacamole

The timeline:

When I was 18, I first noticed that second hand exposure to marijuana being smoked caused a sudden severe headache and asthma attack, and sometimes a sore throat. 

Into my mid-20s, I started noticing the same symptoms from third hand smoked marijuana and places where dried marijuana was or marijuana plants were growing. (My late and former father in law had a prescription for medical use before it was legalized)

Into my 30s, when legalization (Canada) happened, exposures became more frequent and my symptoms worsened.  I started having minor swelling in my hands and face when exposed to the plant, product, or smoke. This progressed to include swelling of my lips and tongue, and eventually my throat. 

I then started reacting more strongly to things like second hand clothing from friends who smoke it indoors (it doesn't seem to matter how many times I wash an article of clothing from them, I still get hives and had to stop accepting these gifts). 

After waking up one morning 2 years ago after my benadryl had worn off, with a swollen face and swelling throat, I wear an n95 when I'm outdoors, which helps to prevent accidental exposures from triggering a serious reaction. 

It was at that point that I saw an allergist who told me that there was no test for cannabis allergy, but if I purchased some and brought it with me, he could make a slurry to test with but there's no standard for the accuracy of that. I told him that I could not do that, as I would need antihistamines to transport cannabis products, and he advised me to avoid exposure and carry my epipen and liquid benadryl. 

It has now reached the point of being even worse, however.

I've had a reaction that started out bad on the weekend and has gotten less intense with time, but it comes and goes. It's likely that I'm reacting to my own car after driving a neighbour to the ER on Friday when she believed she was having a stroke (but was just really high, paranoid, and couldn't feel her face). 

I already had reactine in my system and kept the windows down for the 2 minute drive to the hospital. I took another reactine the next morning, then spent a total of 2¬Ω hours in my car that afternoon/ evening. By late evening, my asthma was bad enough that I needed my ventolin and I noticed some swelling under my eyes so I took benadryl. 

When I woke up Sunday morning, I had surface level swelling (I looked like a raisin) on my face, hands,  neck, and chest and I was wheezing (asthmatic wheeze, not the sound of anaphylaxis). I made sure my epipen was readily available and took benadryl, reactine, ventolin, and had a coffee. 20 minutes later I was back to myself. That afternoon, the swelling and asthma returned, and I again had benadryl and ventolin. I also requested allergen information about the guacamole I ate Saturday afternoon at this point (no known allergens, and I started worrying about the possibility I may now be allergic to avocado)

I took more benadryl, ventolin, and reactine before bed and set an alarm for through the night to take more. 

Monday I was okay with just the reactine. 

Today (Tuesday), I had some swelling again, which worsened after I drove my car. 

This happened once before, where after a friend who smokes a lot of weed needed a drive somewhere. I had minor swelling in my face every time I drove for 6 days after, but no breathing difficulties. 

TLDR and the questions

I had an allergic reaction, to either guacamole (which would be a new allergen) or third hand cannabis (which would be an escalation of a known allergen). Some symptoms are ongoing, 100 hours after initial cannabis exposure, with ongoing exposure and 72 hours after guacamole was eaten. 

My questions are:

1. Is it likely enough that it's avocado that I should avoid it and request a referral to an allergist? 

2. What can be done to confirm and treat cannabis allergies? My understanding is that there are a few possible allergens in cannabis. Moving to a place where it's not legal is not plausible, as I have 4 children that I can't leave the country with.

We hardly fight, we discuss our thoughts and feelings, and we both try to remain intimate. I say try because it's difficult to be intimate with 2 kids under the age of 3. But she is and always will be my one and only.

Now, onto the problem. Me and my wife are part of a couples bible study at our church. It's not about relationship stuff, it's just a general bible study, just for adult couples. Recently, another couple joined our group. I'll call them Jane (f29) and John (m29). Their toddler is about the same age as our oldest, so they kinda know us from daycare, but I've never really talked to them before they joined (My wife talked to Jane before). Me and John talked some, but I never reallt talked to Jane.

After small group, my wife got a message from Jane, who said that she liked meeting me, and said that I reminded her of her husband since we both have similar social mannerisms. I thought ""Okay?"" She doesn't have my number, and I don't have a snapchat, so me and Jane don't ever communicate.

Then came last Sunday. Church service started and while the worship music started, I decided to get more coffee from the meeting hall. On the way back, Jane was walking towards the doors behind me. I gave her a friendly smile hello since the music was playing... and she smiled and winked at me. We haven't seen or talked to each other since. But we still have other bible studies to go with them, and my wife and I are suppose to go to their house for dinner in a couple of weeks.

And now my brain has been racking the possibilities of what that wink means. Like, was she being friendly? Was that implictating an interest? And the big doozy of a question is 'Should I tell my wife about this?' Because there's no other interaction we've had, so I could be overthinking it. But at the same time, I don't want anyone or anything possibly coming between me and my wife.

**The hardest Things to cut out**

My Morning Coffee: I used to load it with flavored creamer, which is basically just sugar syrup. The first few days of black coffee were rough.

* The Swap: Now I use a splash of unsweetened almond milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. It‚Äôs creamy, tastes amazing, and has zero sugar.


""Healthy"" Snacks: My go-to was granola bars. I was shocked when I read the label and saw how much sugar was packed in there.

* The Swap: A handful of almonds and an apple. It gives me actual energy instead of a sugar spike and crash.


Late-Night Cravings: My biggest weakness was a bowl of ice cream before bed.

* The Swap: A bowl of Greek yogurt with some fresh berries. It satisfies the craving for something creamy and sweet without derailing my progress.


And I can't forget my Meditation. When a craving hits, taking just a few minutes to breathe helps me realize I'm probably just stressed or bored, not actually hungry.

First thing, Ive had chronic eczema my entire life. So that's why I have rashes

Ive done mostly compound freeweight movements. My bench went from 50kg to 85kg. Squat from 80kg to 120kg. Deadlift from 100kg to 150kg. I spam pull ups and rows for back. Bench and dips for chest. Because im a binman I do a lot of overhead pressing in the job so when I do it in training i get strains so i stick to lateral raises for side delts and incline presses for front delts. Ive trained amywhere from 3-6x per week for the past 6 years never taking more than 2 weeks off regardless of illness or death in the family or too broke to buy food, i still trained. I went from 57kg to 67kg so about 22lbs of pure muscle in around 1.5 years, ive been struggling to gain for the 6 months that followed.

I also dont mind advice or critiques. My legs are my strong point but I do have weak adductors and glutes. I have been maining SLDLs and Hipthursts these days trying to get my deadlift up since everything has stalled. I do not eat pork or beef but I eat any poultry, fish, eggs. My protein shake of choice is Huel because im lactose intolerant (eczema). I train at 3am before starting work at 6am where I clear 30k steps avg daily at work and im basically doing a slow job or fast walk the whole 4-6 hours im there. I eat fruits before training and drink coffee for pre. When I finish work around midday I eat 2 heavy meals before bed trying to get 30g of protein per meal and then just trying stuff the rest. When I tracked calories consistently I avg around 2700-3000 kCal and I get about 5-7 hours of sleep.

I will be answering any questions and taking in any advice.",1,1756237815.0,workouts,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve opened the machine up, loosened the OPV valve slightly and no difference. I‚Äôve ran multiple shots and have loosened it further with the bar reading at around 11-12 now.

I‚Äôve gotten to the point of loosening it so much to lower pressure that when I run a shot, I‚Äôll see a droplet of water leak out of the OPV screw.

At first, it felt simple and innocent. But as time passed, things got complicated.

We once had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism according to her  and our conversations were often one-sided.

We planned to meet at the park but canceled because she said she had hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she mentioned the autism. She opened up about her past: an ex who abandoned her, another guy who replaced her‚Ä¶ I felt bad for her, so I tried to be there.

One day, I got robbed and almost lost her number. She barely reacted  cold, almost indifferent. She even said she wouldn‚Äôt text me if I stopped texting her. She‚Äôd talk a lot about her cats and her nephews, who also had autism.

There was this time her cousin said she used to drink with her ex  she got extremely angry about it. Later, I invited her to the movies since she once said we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed‚Ä¶ only to tell me the next day:
""Maybe we should just be friends?""

Despite that, we still went to the movies, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. But she never let me see her phone, avoided giving me her Instagram (she only gave it to me after we broke up), and was always distant.

Another day, we went to the mall  she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was too shy to turn the lights on. I reassured her, but suddenly her mood flipped completely. She became reactive, distant, almost cold again.

She also didn‚Äôt want me meeting her family. Even when I walked her home once, she seemed uncomfortable about it. There was another time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I joked about her being ‚Äútoo picky‚Äù about going out. She got furious.

We argued about small things  once, we played a game, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing altogether. Still, she‚Äôd bring me chocolates, we‚Äôd spend time together, and then suddenly, she‚Äôd talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party but kept changing her mind: first she wanted me there, then she didn‚Äôt, then she did again. I asked if she didn‚Äôt want me to go, and she insisted I arrive only after 6 PM. I got there a bit earlier, her sister saw me, and I ended up at a friend‚Äôs party with her.

She introduced me as her boyfriend, but out of nowhere, she suddenly joked:
""Let‚Äôs download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. Eventually, I called her and ended things she cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her to therapy and ‚Äúruining her happiness.‚Äù Then, out of nowhere, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected.

I gave in. We started talking again‚Ä¶ until I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to ‚Äúgo find someone else‚Äù and claimed she was looking for a friend‚Äôs ex there.

I still told her I loved her. She said she went somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom even called me asking if I loved her daughter and invited me over for coffee.

We tried talking again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I got upset and vented online, and she found out. That‚Äôs when she accused me of using her, of tricking her, and said she only acted this way because she was insecure and autistic. She told me she prayed for me every day‚Ä¶ and then she blocked me.

And just like that‚Ä¶ she disappeared.

What did I do wrong?


TL;DR: . From the start, We had moments of affection movies, kisses, chocolates, even a motel but she‚Äôd switch from loving to cold in seconds. She introduced me as her boyfriend, yet joked about me finding ‚Äúa hot girl,‚Äù invited me to parties but changed her mind, cried when I broke up, blocked me, came back saying she missed me, and then I caught her on a dating app she denied it, told me to ‚Äúfind someone else,‚Äù but kept pulling me back. Her mom liked me and even invited me for coffee, but then she said her dad was angry at me, leading to more fights, accusations, and guilt trips. In the end, she said her behavior came from insecurity and autism, claimed she prayed for me daily, blocked me again‚Ä¶ and disappeared.

how quickly and irreversibly transactions confirm.

Bitcoin :
Confirmations are *probabilistic*. Each block adds security, but it's not instant. 

For high confidence (say, 6 confirmations to avoid double-spends), you're looking at ~1 hour on average (blocks every ~10 mins). It's secure but slow, not ideal for quick coffee buys.

Reversals are possible in theory via chain reorgs, though rare in bitcoin but happening now in Other PoW chains 

Nano

*deterministic* finality. Using a block-lattice and Open Representative Voting (ORV), transactions confirm under 1 second! 

Once voted on by reps, it's irreversible. No mining, no fees, feeless and eco-friendly. Perfect for microtransactions or daily use.

My girlfriend (27F) and I (28M) have been together for 4 years.

Back in 2021, when we‚Äôd been dating about a year, she told me she was going to hang out with a childhood friend she‚Äôd ‚Äúslept with once‚Äù in high school. I didn‚Äôt love it, but I accepted it because she was upfront and framed it as a one-time, dumb thing years ago.

Later I found out that wasn‚Äôt true. It wasn‚Äôt once ‚Äì it was multiple times over several years, and at one point she even wanted a relationship with him. He didn‚Äôt want that, and that‚Äôs when it ended. I didn‚Äôt hear this from her, I found out on my own.

When I confronted her, she denied lying and said things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you felt that way‚Äù instead of admitting she hadn‚Äôt been honest. That felt like a big trust issue to me. Eventually, we agreed it would be fine for her to see him in group settings (parties, birthdays, etc.), but not one-on-one or in smaller hangouts.

I also found out she had spoken to him on the phone a couple of times while we lived together. Once I came home and she hung up immediately after talking to him for 40 minutes.

Now, almost a year later, she told me this guy texted her and another female friend asking if they wanted to grab coffee. She said, ‚ÄúJust so you know‚Äù and asked what I thought. I reminded her I‚Äôve been clear about where my boundary is. She replied, ‚ÄúIf I say no, I make it into a thing.‚Äù To me, it already became a thing when she wasn‚Äôt honest about their history.

I told her she can do what she wants, but she knows where I stand. She didn‚Äôt say whether she‚Äôll go or not, and now I‚Äôm left wondering.

I don‚Äôt want constant fights, but I also don‚Äôt want to ignore my own boundaries. Am I overreacting, or is this a valid concern?

When people hear this term, they usually imagine a creature straight out of a horror movie üëπ. In reality, it‚Äôs not one single germ but rather a group of dangerous pathogens. Two of the main culprits are:

* **Vibrio vulnificus** ‚Üí A bacteria that thrives in **warm, salty waters** and can be hidden in raw shellfish.
* **New World screwworm parasite** ‚Üí Yes, you read that right: a parasite that can cause severe infections if untreated.

# How Was the First Case Detected?

On **August 4**, U.S. health officials and the CDC confirmed the infection. Fortunately, the patient **fully recovered** üôå, and no secondary cases were reported. Still, experts caution: **rare doesn‚Äôt mean impossible.**

# Who‚Äôs at Higher Risk?

Some groups face a higher risk of infection, including:

* People with **weakened immune systems**
* Adults **65 and older**
* Those with **liver disease** or **diabetes**
* Anyone with **cuts, wounds, or new tattoos** exposed to seawater üåä
* People who enjoy **raw oysters** ü¶™ (yes, they‚Äôre tasty‚Ä¶ but risky)

# Climate Change Connection üåç

Here‚Äôs the troubling part: warming seas are pushing **Vibrio bacteria further north**. This means infections could become more common in regions that previously never dealt with them. The **May to October** window carries the highest risk.

# Prevention Tips

* **Avoid swimming** if you have open wounds
* If you must swim, use **waterproof bandages**
* **Don‚Äôt eat raw or undercooked shellfish** (sorry oyster fans üòÖ)
* Wash hands and skin thoroughly after handling seafood
* If symptoms appear ‚Üí **seek medical help immediately**

# Why It Matters

Cases like this are uncommon, but when they occur, they can be **life-threatening**. It‚Äôs one of those scenarios where **awareness = protection**.

1n0vllr,https://www.reddit.com/r/jacksonville/comments/1n0vllr/riverside_is_underrated/,Riverside is underrated,"I don‚Äôt get why people are always clowning on Jacksonville like there‚Äôs nothing here. Yeah, it‚Äôs a sprawling city, but when I walk around Riverside/Five Points it honestly feels like the best ‚Äúbohemian‚Äù neighborhood in Florida. You‚Äôve got people out and about all the time, coffee shops, vintage stores, live shows, art markets, and they actually live here. It‚Äôs not some tourist zone like Wynwood in Miami or Ybor in Tampa.

What makes it work is that it‚Äôs still affordable and not pretentious. In Miami or St. Pete you feel like you‚Äôre in some curated district full of elites and transplants. In Riverside it‚Äôs still working class people mixed in with artists and younger crowds. That‚Äôs always the recipe for a real neighborhood, people who are creative but also normal and approachable. It‚Äôs social, it‚Äôs not stuck up, and it just keeps getting better.

And I‚Äôll go as far as to say this: Riverside is the best arts/bohemian district in Florida. Sure, it can‚Äôt really compete with college towns like Gainesville or Tallahassee that have built-in youth scenes. But if you‚Äôre looking for a big city with an awesome neighborhood right in its core, look no further than Riverside.

I honestly think it‚Äôs one of the most underrated places in the Southeast.

Full Review,"The Keurig 3-Month Brewer Maintenance Kit, also model number B07V3946XL, is the sort of product I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I started using it. If you‚Äôre like me and stumble out of bed craving that perfect cup of coffee, then you probably know how vital it is to keep your trusty brewer in tip-top shape. Throughout my obsessive morning and mid-afternoon coffee routines, this kit became my go-to savior for ensuring that every cup tasted like it came straight out of a barista‚Äôs hand. Spoiler alert: My caffeine addiction was thoroughly supported by this maintenance kit, but let me dive deeper.  

**All-In-One Maintenance Solution**  
The brilliance of this kit lies in its comprehensive approach. It includes everything you need to boost your coffee game: four rinse pods, two water filter cartridge refills, and a descaling solution. It feels like they genuinely thought of everything for a well-rounded cleaning process. Over the past few months, I‚Äôve found that the rinse pods quickly removed any leftover residue or oil buildup from my coffee maker. The descaling solution was another game-changer; it tackled hard water mineral deposits with ease. My coffee didn‚Äôt just taste better ‚Äì it felt fresher somehow, like my brewer achieved a new lease on life.  

[Check Keurig 3-Month Brewer Maintenance Kit price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07v3946xl/)  

**Ease of Use and Simplicity**  
If there‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt want in my life, it‚Äôs complicated maintenance rituals ‚Äì I prefer focusing my attention on what really matters: my coffee. Thankfully, the kit‚Äôs design is incredibly intuitive. Anybody can perform the tasks without needing to look at an instruction manual for an hour. I simply popped the rinse pods into my Keurig like I would a regular K-Cup pod, and the results spoke for themselves. The descaling solution and water filter installation process were equally straightforward. From start to finish, I spent maybe 10 minutes before smugly sipping my extra-clean brew.  

**Advantages**  
- Easy integration with any Keurig model, even the 1.0 and 2.0 brewers.  
- The gentle, odorless formula doesn‚Äôt leave behind any weird taste or chemical residue.  
- Keeps coffee delicious by minimizing mineral buildup inside the machine.  
- Optimized for effortless setup ‚Äì rinse, soak, and install in no time.  

**Weaknesses**  
- The disposable pods feel a bit wasteful for an environmentally-conscious individual.  
- You‚Äôll need to stay consistent with using the kit, especially if you‚Äôre in a hard water area.  
- The kit doesn‚Äôt include a reusable cleaning pod option, which could have been ideal for frequent use.  

**Alternatives in the Market**  
For curious coffee enthusiasts, there are competing solutions worth looking into. One popular rival is the Full Circle Coffee Maker Cleaning Kit, which markets itself as an eco-friendlier cleaning option. While it‚Äôs great for those avoiding single-use pods, I found its effectiveness lagged behind my Keurig-branded kit, especially in hardcore descaling. Another competitor is the Urnex Cleaning Kit, which is highly professional but comes with a learning curve (and a higher price tag to match). For me, the simplicity and compatibility of this Keurig kit make it a more reliable choice for casual or dedicated coffee drinkers alike.  

**Value for Money**  
In terms of cost efficiency, the Keurig 3-Month Brewer Maintenance Kit holds up admirably. The price reflects the level of convenience it adds to your life ‚Äì something I greatly appreciate when juggling work deadlines and coffee breaks. While cheaper non-branded alternatives exist, the long-term reliability of Keurig‚Äôs solution likely makes it worth the investment for loyal users like myself. Every sip of coffee tastes cleaner, richer, and purer post-cleanup, which makes it feel like indulgence at a fair deal.

F22 M 22,"From the very beginning, when I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. At first, it felt simple and innocent. But as time passed, things got complicated.

We once had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism according to her  and our conversations were often one-sided.

We planned to meet at the park but canceled because she said she had hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she mentioned the autism. She opened up about her past: an ex who abandoned her, another guy who replaced her‚Ä¶ I felt bad for her, so I tried to be there.

One day, I got robbed and almost lost her number. She barely reacted  cold, almost indifferent. She even said she wouldn‚Äôt text me if I stopped texting her. She‚Äôd talk a lot about her cats and her nephews, who also had autism.

There was this time her cousin said she used to drink with her ex  she got extremely angry about it. Later, I invited her to the movies since she once said we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed‚Ä¶ only to tell me the next day:
""Maybe we should just be friends?""

Despite that, we still went to the movies, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. But she never let me see her phone, avoided giving me her Instagram (she only gave it to me after we broke up), and was always distant.

Another day, we went to the mall  she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was too shy to turn the lights on. I reassured her, but suddenly her mood flipped completely. She became reactive, distant, almost cold again.

She also didn‚Äôt want me meeting her family. Even when I walked her home once, she seemed uncomfortable about it. There was another time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I joked about her being ‚Äútoo picky‚Äù about going out. She got furious.

We argued about small things  once, we played a game, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing altogether. Still, she‚Äôd bring me chocolates, we‚Äôd spend time together, and then suddenly, she‚Äôd talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party but kept changing her mind: first she wanted me there, then she didn‚Äôt, then she did again. I asked if she didn‚Äôt want me to go, and she insisted I arrive only after 6 PM. I got there a bit earlier, her sister saw me, and I ended up at a friend‚Äôs party with her.

She introduced me as her boyfriend, but out of nowhere, she suddenly joked:
""Let‚Äôs download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. Eventually, I called her and ended things she cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her to therapy and ‚Äúruining her happiness.‚Äù Then, out of nowhere, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected.

I gave in. We started talking again‚Ä¶ until I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to ‚Äúgo find someone else‚Äù and claimed she was looking for a friend‚Äôs ex there.

I still told her I loved her. She said she went somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom even called me asking if I loved her daughter and invited me over for coffee.

We tried talking again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I got upset and vented online, and she found out. That‚Äôs when she accused me of using her, of tricking her, and said she only acted this way because she was insecure and autistic. She told me she prayed for me every day‚Ä¶ and then she blocked me.

And just like that‚Ä¶ she disappeared.

What did I do?


TL;DR: From the start, We had moments of affection movies, kisses, chocolates, even a motel but she‚Äôd switch from loving to cold in seconds. She introduced me as her boyfriend, yet joked about me finding ‚Äúa hot girl,‚Äù invited me to parties but changed her mind, cried when I broke up, blocked me, came back saying she missed me, and then I caught her on a dating app she denied it, told me to ‚Äúfind someone else,‚Äù but kept pulling me back. Her mom liked me and even invited me for coffee, but then she said her dad was angry at me, leading to more fights, accusations, and guilt trips. In the end, she said her behavior came from insecurity and autism, claimed she prayed for me daily, blocked me again‚Ä¶ and disappeared. I tried, I forgave, I gave everything, but I was left questioning if any of it was real and what I did .

1n0vcih,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1n0vcih/partner_is_pulling_away_and_not_admitting_it/,Partner is pulling away and not admitting it,"I need some advice and wanna know if I‚Äôm overreacting or not thinking straight. 

This is crazy long, so here is a TLDR: 
I have a 6 month relationship with Ron but almost no contact within the last 6 weeks because Ron‚Äôs partner Linda came back from abroad. He denies that anything has changed. 

And here is the very long version: 

Backstory: I have been dating Ron for 6 months now. Ron also has another partner, Linda, who was abroad during most of the 6 months and has been dating other people more casually. Ron has always been more upfront about his intentions of having a full-on romantic/loving relationship with me. He told me things like I am his number one emotional support person since Linda was abroad and he told me he loved me. I have initially been a bit more reserved/cautious because I have experienced a lot of heartbreak in my life and additionally he is in an almost mono/poly relationship with Linda who doesn‚Äôt date anyone else. I expressed my concern about this relationship situation and asked a lot of questions. He was understanding and very open and we talked a lot. Eventually I felt like I really understood it and that there was nothing fishy going on. So gradually I really started to open up much more to Ron and told him I loved him too, which I felt was true. I started introducing him to some of my friends and other partners and even to my kid, although that was more of a coincidence, but I felt very ok with it. I felt like I could trust him and he always seemed very honest and open about everything. 

Here comes the twist: 6 weeks ago Linda came back. Since she is back, Ron and I have only had 2 x 2 hour coffee dates and one outing together with Linda and other people. Before that we used to have at least one sleepover per week, not because it was an agreement but just because it happened. I was also away for 2 of the 6 weeks, but apart from that it was because he essentially never has time anymore. According to him it‚Äôs always due to some vague reasons unrelated to the new situation. From the little things he tells me when we finally get to talk I understand that the true reason is that he has essentially spent every free minute with Linda since she‚Äôs back and that she has essentially moved in with him now, which wasn‚Äôt planned. Initially, in the first month I also told him that I understand that they need time to reconnect after such a long time, and that also felt truly fine for me. But he doesn‚Äôt admit that anything has changed even though I explicitly asked him. I had even asked him how things would change before she came back, but he completely dismissed that idea. 

Then Ron had his birthday a week ago and I had told him before that he should let me know when and how he ‚Äúwants me‚Äù around his birthday. I was already assuming that he would spend his actual birthday with Linda because she‚Äôs also friends with some other important people. But I was assuming that he would want to see me maybe the next day or something. I told him that I kept his birthday weekend free and that I‚Äôm available. I even told my other partner that I couldn‚Äôt come join him to visit his family because of Ron‚Äôs birthday. I didn‚Äôt tell Ron about that because I didn‚Äôt want to create a competition situation between my partners. 
Well‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt hear anything from Ron until almost a week after his birthday. He just completely ignored me. That was really disappointing. On the other hand I feel stupid because it was his birthday and he can do whatever he wants of course. Side note: Two months ago I spent the actual day of my birthday with Ron alone because my NP was abroad. 

Then a couple of days ago we went to a party, Ron, Linda, some friends and me. Ron told me beforehand that it was not ok for Linda if he and I got physical with each other. I understand that and I have also had similar situations before. Typically however, I have experienced it in a way that then nobody gets to be physical with anyone. However, I am generally fine with watching a partner be physical with someone else and Ron knows that. So I already assumed that the same limitations won‚Äôt apply to Linda and him, but it only occurred to me later that it would have been nice to ask at least. Until this point I was still more or less ok. However, I suggested that we might wanna consider not going to the party together because it might be too challenging for everyone involved. I guess he really wanted Linda and me to meet though, so we still agreed to do it. I went to his place before the party. I told him when I was on my way. When I arrived he wasn‚Äôt there because he was taking a shower with Linda and I was left alone at his place with his friend who I don‚Äôt know for what felt like forever. This was the point where I started to feel really bummed. It was really nice to meet Linda, she‚Äôs a lovely person, but at the party I distanced myself from them because it felt really painful that with their actions they made it so clear that it is the two of them and the rest of us. I felt really lonely and upset. I don‚Äôt even know exactly why it felt so painful, I have been in similar situations before, two of my other partners were married and with them there was also a clear hierarchy and I never had the slightest problem with that. One random person at the party asked me whether I am here with friends or a partner and it was in this moment that it clicked and I realised that I absolutely cannot call him a partner anymore. I then texted Ron that I‚Äôm going home and that he should call me if he wants to talk. 

The next day he didn‚Äôt call but texted me that the party was a bit of a rollercoaster for him but that he was happy that I was happy. This message made me so upset that I didn‚Äôt even reply. I was not happy at all and he didn‚Äôt ask. Then the day after he texted me that he‚Äôs worried that something is wrong with me and whether I want to talk. I said yes talking would be good. Then he completely freaked out over text, as if he had really assumed everything was perfectly fine before I said that. To be honest that is also what I suspect, I suspect that he really didn‚Äôt notice all of this shit happening. The way he is acting recently really seems completely out of his norm. I only know him for 6 months but I really think he‚Äôs a good person who really doesn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. It somehow feels like he kind of forgot about me.  

So we‚Äôre meeting tomorrow and I need to figure out what to tell him. Thank you to everyone who read this monstrosity, I‚Äôm happy about any advice on how to proceed. Also I really wanna know if I‚Äôm possibly missing something or overreacting. ",2,1756236508.0,polyamory,10,0.75,False

¬† Seven months later  
  
¬† A familiar male voice yanked Brock Hudson from a fitful doze. ""The she-beast has risen. The she-beast has risen.""  
  
¬† Why would his friend Jude call anyone a--  
  
¬† Realization hit like a lightning bolt. A recording. Only a recording. A personal ringtone Jude had made for Brock's mother. Which meant his mother--the she-beast who'd found it amusing to give him a name close to a 60s movie star--wished to speak with him.  
  
¬† He blinked open tired, burning eyes. Not that it did him any good. His vision was as muddled as his mind, a hangover in full effect.  
  
¬† His entire body had become a war zone.  
  
¬† As wakefulness crept through him, inch by agonizing inch, a thousand land mines were detonated. Sharp pains stabbed his temples. Nausea churned in his stomach, the urge to vomit ramping up with every second that passed. He tasted bile and moaned.  
  
¬† ""The she-beast has risen. The she-beast has risen.""  
  
¬† What did his mother want, anyway? She hated his guts and never called unless she had found a new way to torment him, wanted belittle him, or needed something.  
  
¬† ""Ugh! Make it stop."" With a huff of indignation, the woman at Brock's side bolted upright, shaking the bed. ""Pleeeease make it stop.""  
  
¬† The motion magnified every awful sensation inside his body, and he croaked, ""Still. Quiet."" Blindly he reached out, slapping his phone until blissful silence reigned.  
  
¬† He would call his mother later. Or never. Yeah, never sounded good.  
  
¬† The mattress dipped, movement once again antagonizing an already raging hangover. Never drinking again. Until tomorrow. Footsteps pitter-pattered, a blurry form disappearing around a corner. Hinges squeaked as a door closed.  
  
¬† Brock rubbed the sleep from his eyes, his vision gradually clearing. He scanned his surroundings with mounting dread. A bedroom that wasn't his. Way too cutesy with pale yellow walls, and a white vanity scattered with a thousand different products.  
  
¬† The room's owner--what was her name? He remembered meeting her last night at the Scratching Post. The bar catered to three small towns in Oklahoma: Blueberry Hill, Grapevine, and Strawberry Valley, where he lived. Only a ten-minute drive from the cabin Brock and Jude rented--  
  
¬† Wrong. He no longer lived with Jude. A few months ago, his friend had up and married Ryanne Wade. Well, Ryanne Laurent now. The happy couple lived above the bar with their clowder of cats. They were also expecting their first child. (The couple, not the cats.) And, whether they knew it or not, they were leaving Brock in the dust.  
  
¬† His brother-like friendship with Jude was evolving, and rightly so. For Jude, Ryanne came first. And okay, okay, Brock knew Jude would never give him the stinky boot. They would always be a part of each other's lives. But come on! Change sucked.  
  
¬† Part of Brock wanted to lock himself inside his cabin, shut all the blinds, pull all the curtains, and go on a full male brood. How messed up was that? Selfish to the max. A pity party, invitation one.  
  
¬† Well, why not? Brock had two friends, only two: Jude Laurent and Daniel Porter. They'd served together as Army Rangers and later advanced to a special ops unit known as the Ten. Most often they'd played offense. Sometimes, though, they'd played defense, going before the front line, sneaking through enemy territory to pave the way for other soldiers.  
  
¬† They'd endured hardships that might have broken lesser men; they'd bled for and with each other, watched countless good soldiers die, and killed whatever targets they were assigned.  
  
¬† At the end of their last tour of duty, Jude lost the lower half of his left leg in an IED explosion.  
  
¬† The things Brock had seen...the things he'd done... Savage. Brutal. Cruel. He'd become a monster to fight other monsters.  
  
¬† With Jude discharged and Brock and Daniel's time up, they'd been desperate for some sort of normalcy and made the collective decision to move to Strawberry Valley, Daniel's hometown, where they started a business. LPH Protection. A security company with other vets on their payroll.  
  
¬† To be honest, Brock hadn't needed much convincing. He would rather have his skin removed with a cheese grater than return to New York to work with his parents at the Hud and Son Group.  
  
¬† Besides, Daniel had painted such a vivid, welcoming picture of Strawberry Valley. Lush fields as far as the eye could see, wild strawberries in bloom. Air saturated with an innate sweetness that never faded, making you feel as if you were living in a bowl of fruit. A sense of community, where friends and enemies alike had your back. The residents against the world, if necessary.  
  
¬† While the fields and sweet breezes had sounded nice, the sense of community had sealed the deal for Brock. He'd grown up with a mother who hated him, a father who rarely came home, and a disdainful younger brother who treated him like trash. So an entire town predisposed to like him? Yes, please. And so far so good. The entire town had rallied behind LPH Protection to show support.  
  
¬† The problem? Brock had expected to feel settled and satisfied for the first time in his life. Instead, his sense of discontent had only grown.  
  
¬† Last night--like every other night--he hadn't wanted to be alone with his toxic thoughts. Cue another trip to the Scratching Post. He'd gone home with the newest random in a very long line of randoms. A few drinks, a few laughs, and a few hours of...not pleasure, not exactly, because the alcohol had pretty much numbed him out. More of a distraction. Yeah. Distraction was the word. A search for  
oblivion he'd never been able to find.  
  
¬† If he remembered correctly, last night he'd hitched a ride with his companion. Another detail clicked. She lived in Blueberry Hill, which meant he would be doing another walk of shame in order to get home. What would this be? His fiftieth WOS since he'd moved to Oklahoma?  
  
¬† What did people buy themselves to celebrate their fiftieth? Gold?  
  
¬† When Brock's stomach settled enough for action, he stood, gathered his wrinkled clothing, and dressed.  
  
¬† Shirt--check. Underwear--check. Pants--check. Socks--only one.  
  
¬† Rather than mount a search in a stranger's home, he tossed the sock he had found in the garbage bin. He never liked to leave a soldier behind, but today it couldn't be helped.  
  
¬† Combat boots--check.  
  
¬† As he crouched to tie his shoes, hinges squeaked once again, and a new round of pitter-pattering footsteps echoed. He straightened. A second later, soft arms wrapped around him from behind, warm breath fanning over his back.  
  
¬† Stiffening, he spun and moved a few steps away until he was just out of reach. He'd been stabbed too many times--both figuratively and literally--to trust anyone but Jude or Daniel at his six.  
  
¬† Bright morning light filtered through a bay of windows, highlighting his companion's wealth of red hair. Irritation rose like a tide. Lately, whenever alcohol lowered his guard, he'd gravitated to redheads, though he'd settled for blondes and brunettes in a pinch. But no, he didn't need a shrink getting all up in his business to figure out why.  
  
¬† Since moving to Strawberry Valley, Brock had craved a specific strawberry-blonde with every fiber of his being. Beautiful beyond imagining, Lyndie ""Scottie"" Scott. She was best friends with Ryanne, Jude's wife, and Dorothea Porter, Daniel's wife. Which meant Brock and Scottie were constantly in each other's orbit.

  
They knew a lot about each other because their friends talked and shared too much, even if he and Scottie didn't. He knew when and where she got hair trimmed and if she caught a cold from the kids in her kindergarten class. He knew she had been seeing a therapist for the past few months and had recently decided to start dating. Not that she'd found a man yet. A prospect that kept Brock up at nights.  
  
¬† What would he do when she found one?  
  
¬† Brock had almost asked her out, oh, about a dozen times. But why bother? He'd never had more than a one-night stand. What did he have to offer a woman hoping for something long term? And why ruin a good thing? They were finally on comfortable terms with each other.  
  
¬† In the past few months, she'd really come out of her shell. She'd stopped sitting as far away as possible from him and started looking him in the eye when they spoke.  
  
¬† On the flip side, she had started flirting with other men. Just a little. A smile here. A glance there. Nibbling on her plump bottom lip. Saying things like ""Aren't you the cutest thing?"" And ""You are too adorable for words."" Testing the waters a bit. Preparing for her date, whenever it happened.  
  
¬† Brock's hands fisted. He'd tried flirting with her--because he couldn't not--but she'd smiled at him blankly, as if he'd spoken a foreign language she'd never learned.  
  
¬† Despite all that, he hungered for her constantly. She'd become the one and only star of his fantasies.  
  
¬† In his mind, her image claimed center stage, even now. Her waterfall of strawberry-blond hair reached her waist--perfect for winding around his fist. Golden eyes almost too big for her face complemented a delicate nose and rosebud lips the color of cherries.  
  
¬† She was sweet as pie and endearingly shy until she got to know a person. Always she was a little vulnerable. Okay, a lot vulnerable. Sometimes she reminded him of a porcelain doll: easily breakable.  
  
¬† One day he feared a strong wind would shatter her into a thousand pieces.  
  
¬† Her fragility wasn't exactly a winning attribute. Brock had to be careful with her, and careful wasn't really in his wheelhouse. Daniel often compared him to a bull in a china shop.  
  
¬† Why Brock wanted Scottie more than he wanted anything or anyone else, he wasn't sure.  
  
¬† For the first few months of their acquaintance, she'd legit feared him, which was understandable. Kind of. He didn't like being blamed for the crimes of other men. He had enough on his plate. But he had to cut her some slack. Scottie had a traumatic past. A child beaten by her father had grown into a wife beaten by her husband.  
  
¬† What she hadn't understood in the beginning? Brock would die before he hurt her. He would die to protect her.  
  
¬† She didn't need to know he would also kill to protect her.  
  
¬† Unfortunately, both the father and the ex were deceased. Brock would have liked a baseball bat and five minutes alone with each man.  
  
¬† Now the beautiful schoolteacher had trouble trusting men. The bigger the man, the greater her fear, Brock supposed. He happened to be bigger than most. At six foot four, he carried around two hundred fifty pounds of solid muscle.  
  
¬† But even if Scottie did a one-eighty and invited Brock over for a single night of debauchery, no strings attached, he'd have to say no, right? Couples could say ""no-strings-attached"" all they wanted, but it never worked. And could he really do everything he'd imagined doing in twelve hours? Twenty-four? Forty-eight?  
  
¬† No! He'd want a week, at least. Maybe a month. Problem was, at the end of that month, bonds might have formed. He'd seen it happen to both of his friends. What would happen if Brock and Scottie argued? Or grew to dislike each other? Ryanne and Dorothea would side with her, no question, and Jude and Daniel would side with their wives, as they should. Such was the way of life.  
  
¬† Brock could find himself banned from the group. A circumstance he couldn't fathom without dying inside. He needed his friends more than water to drink.  
  
¬† And what would happen if Scottie ever learned intimate details about his past, huh? How he'd been a mean little boy, always been in trouble, picking fights, stealing, and only his father's money had kept him out of juvie. How he'd joined the Army to avoid jail time for assault. How he'd become a bona fide killer in the name of war.  
  
¬† Scottie would be petrified of him all over again. Other women might be willing to overlook his past, but not her. A few times, he'd heard her say, ""Violence is violence"" when talking about fights at school.  
  
¬† So Brock used other women to play pretend. Not exactly original. Ask him if he cared.  
  
¬† Over the years, one-night stands and booze had become his crutch. He knew it, but again, he didn't care. For just a little while, he could forget the lives he'd taken on his country's behalf, forget the friends he'd lost in war zones, forget the sad little boy who'd constantly lashed out because he'd never understood why his mother despised him but adored his POS little brother.  
  
¬† Brock wasn't thriving, but he was surviving. Good enough, he supposed.  
  
¬† Last night's companion snapped her fingers in front of his face, drawing him from his thoughts. ""Earth to Brock.""  
  
¬† He blinked, shook his head. Letting himself become distracted in the presence of another? Pure foolishness.  
  
¬† ""You say something?"" he asked. What was her name, anyway? She must have told him at some point, but... He flipped through his mental files and came up blank. The usual ""honey"" it is, then.  
  
¬† ""I asked if you were hungry. I'm told I make the best pancakes in town.""  
  
¬† ""Sorry, honey,"" he said, keeping his tone gentle. ""But I've got to go.""  
  
¬† Disappointment flashed in her dark eyes. ""You left your car at the Scratching Post. I'll drive--""  
  
¬† ""No, thanks."" Never stick around, never encourage. Always leave them wanting more. That way you would become a fond memory rather than a hated regret. ""I'm sure you have better things to do.""  
  
¬† ""It's Sunday. I have the day off. Driving you won't be any trouble, honest.""  
  
¬† He had no desire to hurt her feelings, but he also had no desire to prolong their association. ""I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to walk."" Besides, at any time he could call Jude or Daniel. His friends could track him through the GPS in his cell phone.  
  
¬† Her lips pursed and her gaze darted away from him, but she nodded.  
  
¬† ""I'm sorry."" Before he caved just to make her smile again, he strode from the house.  
  
¬† Outside, cold October wind blustered, his short-sleeve cotton shirt offering little protection. He could imagine the conversation with the woman if he dared go back.  
  
¬† With her mouth, she would say: Here's your coat. With her eyes, she would say: I hope you choke on it!  
  
¬† There at the end, he'd made her feel cheap, hadn't he? She'd deserved better.  
  
¬† No two ways about it. Brock sucked as bad as change.  
  
¬† Ignoring a pang of guilt, he scanned his new surroundings. Fat gray clouds filled the sky, a storm brewing over a small trailer park some of the residents had tried to maintain while others had let go to ruin. Empty beer cans littered multiple lawns. A crumpled pack of cigarettes tumbled across a dirt road.  
  
¬† Having grown up in an affluent neighborhood in Manhattan, these small-town slices of life continued to fascinate him.  
  
¬† How had Scottie grown up? In a run-down area like this one or--  
  
¬† Stop using her nickname. A nickname he had given her and only he used; it was far too intimate. Better yet, stop thinking about her, period. If this kept up, every muscle in his body would harden.  
  
¬† Too late. Hard--as--a--rock.  
  
¬† Brock had to get over his obsession with Scott-- Lyndie. Might be best to avoid her for a little while. Besides, the less time he spent with her--or any woman--the better. The less a woman got to know the real him, the less likely she was to despise him.  
  
¬† Always leave them craving more.  
  
¬† Truth was, something about him was defective. His own mother hadn't been able to love him. How would anyone else?  
  
¬† But oh, the thought of being separated from Sc-- Lyndie again nearly drove him insane with some dark emotion he couldn't name. Which he didn't understand. He usually avoided the prim-and  
\-proper-debutante type his parents considered the Holy Grail.  
  
¬† Lyndie's typical outfit? A pair of khakis, a high-neck blouse, and a prudish cardigan sweater he wanted to unbutton with his teeth.  
  
¬† When it came to this particular debutante, his hang-ups had never really mattered. She walked into a room and he wanted her. She looked his way and he wanted her. She breathed and he wanted her.  
  
¬† If only the feeling were mutual.  
  
¬† No, no. Much better this way. If she made a play for him, he would crumble, consequences be damned.  
  
¬† Mood blackening, he walked a mile, hoping to cool off before he phoned... Daniel. Yeah. Jude worked late nights at the bar and would still be asleep.  
  
¬† His friend showed up twenty minutes later and passed him a thermos of black coffee.  
  
¬† ""Thanks, man."" Brock sipped the white-hot heavenly brew, the kick of caffeine making him feel human again. Or human-ish.  
  
¬† ""Anytime. Mean that.""  
  
¬† Daniel looked like he'd just rolled out of bed. His dark hair stuck out in spikes, his gold eyes hooded by heavy lids, and dark stubble shadowed his jaw. Wrinkles littered his shirt and jeans, and he'd stuffed his feet into mismatched slippers, one black, one brown.  
  
¬† Every single woman in Strawberry Valley had fallen in love with Daniel's good-ole-boy charm. He'd fallen in love with Dorothea, the sassy, sexy owner of the Strawberry Inn.  
  
¬† Like Ryanne, Dorothea was now pregnant. A bona fide miracle. Years ago, a terrible accident left her with so many internal scars doctors told her she had a one-in-a-million chance of ever conceiving a child. Maybe divine intervention was responsible. Maybe Daniel's little soldiers had found a way past enemy lines. Whatever the reason, the delighted couple had managed to beat the odds.  
  
¬† So of course baby fever was sweeping through town at warp speed. Brock shuddered. Babies were feeble creatures. He'd never held one, never would. His bloodstained hands had no business handling anything so innocent and sweet.  
  
¬† Once the Porter and Laurent kids were snotty teenagers, Brock would make a mighty fine Uncle B.  
  
¬† He wondered if Lyndie had been infected. If that was why she wanted to start dating. Brock pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth. The day he spotted her with some ""nice guy"" was the day he--  
  
¬† Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  
  
¬† ""Whose murder are you plotting?"" Daniel asked, his tone one hundred percent conversational.  
  
¬† ""Anyone Lyndie might be romantically interested in,"" he grumbled. The one-night-stand champion of the world had no right to feel jealous. Seriously, if you stacked Brock's lovers side by side, one on top of the other, they would block the sun.  
  
¬† ""She told Dorothea she's interested in finding someone like...me,"" his friend admitted. ""Tall, dark, and handsome.""  
  
¬† ""Check, check, and mate."" He patted his stubbled cheeks. ""I've got you beat in every department."" Hey, it wasn't bragging if it was true.  
  
¬† ""Can't blame her, really,"" Daniel continued as if Brock hadn't spoken. ""I'm pretty sure I'm the inspiration behind thousands of romance novels, and the authors simply changed my name to protect my lack of innocence.""  
  
¬† Brock snorted. He loved this man more than he'd ever loved a blood relative. Jude too. Their bond had been forged at Ranger school, had solidified on the battlefield, and had only intensified in the years since. Daniel and Jude helped Brock maintain his sanity, supported him without judgment, and genuinely liked him even though they knew him better than anyone.  
  
¬† ""The she-beast has risen."" His mother's ringtone sounded once again. ""The she-beast has risen.""  
  
¬† Twice in one day? Unprecedented. He ran his tongue over his teeth, his crap mood taking another nosedive. What did she want?  
  
¬† He finished off the coffee, the liquid turning to acid as soon as it reached his stomach.  
  
¬† Daniel reached over and patted his shoulder. ""I can pull over and get out. Give you a little privacy if you want to speak with her.""  
  
¬† ""Want? Never."" Brock sent the call to voice mail with a hard press of a button.  
  
¬† Of course, Mother Dearest refused to leave a message. As usual. However, there was no way he'd call her back until he had hours to spare and no potential witnesses. The harpy knew just how to drive him to the edge and tempt him to erupt into his worst self.  
  
¬† For years he'd wondered why she hated him, why she called him ""worthless"" and ""unlovable,"" and why she used to slap him around--why she'd loved his younger brother, Braydon, from moment one. A boy Brock had adored too, despite the sharp-edged envy that had lashed him to the bone.  
  
¬† Well, a boy he used to adore. At some point Braydon began to treat him as Miranda did.  
  
¬† Seeking answers, Brock had finally gone to his father. Brent Hudson had never been needlessly cruel, just persistently absent.  
  
¬† Dad, why does Mom hate me?  
  
¬† I wish I knew, son.  
  
¬† At least he hadn't offered a platitude: you're mistaken, she loves you.  
  
¬† Now, looking back, Brock remembered the sadness and anger that darkened his father's eyes. Brent might not have known the reason, but he'd suspected.  
  
¬† But rather than dealing with Miranda's favoritism for Braydon and hatred for Brock, Brent continued to ignore it, his wife, and his children, allowing Brock to suffer from her verbal attacks again and again.  
  
¬† Stupid boy!  
  
¬† You're a waste of breath.  
  
¬† I liked my life better without you in it.  
  
¬† Only in the past year had Brent reached out, hoping to make amends. No, thanks. Screw me over once, maybe I'll give you a second chance. Just kidding. We're done.  
  
¬† ""I didn't wake you when I called, did I?"" Brock asked Daniel, changing the subject.  
  
¬† Daniel's grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles bleaching of color. ""I've been up for hours. When I said Lyndie was interested in dating again--""  
  
¬† ""Which I already knew.""  
  
¬† ""I meant she's already started. Which you didn't. She went on a date, like, four months ago and--""  
  
¬† ""What!"" The date happened so long ago, and Brock wasn't told? ""Why was I kept in the dark?""  
  
¬† ""Why do you think? Jude and I thought it might be nice if the guy lived and you stayed out of jail.""  
  
¬† ""I would never beat a man to blood and pulp without reason.""  
  
¬† ""And do you feel you have a reason?""  
  
¬† ""Yes,"" he grumbled. Lyndie belonged to-- No one. ""Good call,"" he added, still grumbling.  
  
¬† ""Now that you know, I can give you the rest of the deets. So, while she was on this date, a cop pulled her and the guy over. The cop was a friend of her ex's and bad news. In fact, he's the one who tried to help shut down the Scratching Post.""  
  
¬† Yeah, Brock remembered him. Jim Rayburn. ""Now in prison for trying to murder Jude and Ryanne.""  
  
¬† ""Before all his legal troubles, he scared the date away and told Lyndie he would be giving her name to a crazy scumbag in Blueberry Hill. He kept his word. Now the crazy scumbag is stalking her.""  
  
¬† Dark rage seethed in Brock's chest. Protective instincts soared. At the same time, his guilt returned, and this time there was no ignoring it. When Lyndie needed him most, he'd been drinking and screwing. And she had needed him to stand between her and her monsters.  
  
¬† ""Where is she?"" he demanded.  
  
¬† ""Still at the Strawberry Inn with Dorothea.""  
  
¬† ""Take me there.""  
  
¬† Daniel opened his mouth, snapped it closed. Open, closed. Finally he sighed. ""First, you need a shower. You smell like beer, sex, and cigarettes. Second, if you go to Lyndie wearing that particular expression, she might die of a heart attack.""  
  
¬† ""She doesn't have to look at me. I'll guard her door."" Protecting her was a need. An obsession.  
  
¬† Since moving to Strawberry Valley, Brock's wartime nightmares had been replaced with scenes of Lyndie crying for help as her father or husband beat her, her bones breaking, blood flowing like a river.  
  
¬† He'd wake up feeling as if he'd been in a car accident, his body stiff and sore, his sheets covered in sweat. Even now, at the thought of Lyndie's painful past, tension turned his muscles to stone.  
  
¬† ""She's upset,"" Daniel added, turning the  
truck, entering Strawberry Valley's town square.  
  
¬† Antique lampposts lined each sidewalk, complementing historic and modern buildings alike. Everything from the sprawling brownstone with a copper awning and multiple gargoyles perched along a balcony, to the metal warehouse with a tin roof, to the whitewashed bungalow and stone chapel with stained glass windows.  
  
¬† With Halloween seven weeks away--stores were getting a jump start every year--display windows contained a surplus of decorations. Skeletons, a zombie Alice in Wonderland, pumpkins, bats, and ghosts.  
  
¬† Despite the early-morning hour, Virgil Porter--Daniel's father--sat outside Style Me Tender salon with Anthony Rodriguez, playing checkers. AKA people watching and gossiping like old cocks in a henhouse.  
  
¬† Daniel waved to his dad and said, ""Instead of going to the inn, why don't we pick up Jude and have a chat with the stalker?""  
  
¬† Brock scrubbed a hand over his jaw, fighting the urge to leap out of the truck and run to Lyndie now. Just want to be near her.  
  
¬† For her sense of well-being...or his own?  
  
¬† ""Fine,"" he grumbled. Going on a hunt wasn't his first choice. Let the prey come to me. But a hunt was an acceptable compromise.  
  
¬† His phone rang, a normal ringtone this time. He checked the screen. A tendril of foreboding coiled through him when he spotted his attorney's name. Mr. Finny rarely called. Miranda rarely called. What were the odds the two would phone on the same day for unrelated reasons? Not good.  
  
¬† Brock answered, not bothering with a greeting. ""What's wrong?""  
  
¬† Static crackled over the line before Finny heaved a heavy sigh. ""I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, Mr. Hudson, but your father...he's dead.""

¬† A week later  
  
¬† Coffee, you're on the bench. Wine, you're in the game. Bring home the victory!  
  
¬† Lyndie Scott didn't bother pouring herself a glass of her favorite red. She simply guzzled straight from the bottle. ""Win"" was ""wine"" without an ""e,"" making her a bigger winner with every swallow.  
  
¬† If only her life would read the memo.  
  
¬† She should be on cloud nine. Finally she'd gotten her head screwed on straight. At least part of the way. She'd done every ""maybe"" on her list. She'd seen a therapist, read self-help books, talked to other survivors of abuse, and realized not every man on earth was out to harm her. And okay, yes, she'd just boiled down a lot of hard work to a checklist, but the end result was a stronger, happier Lyndie. She'd even started dating. Well, she'd gone on one date with the perfect ease-her-back-in candidate. A nice guy with kind eyes.

The journal is one of the most important tools a trader can have.  
But, like everything else in trading, people love to mystify it and overcomplicate things‚Äîusually to sell you something.

If you‚Äôve been reading my posts, you already know I‚Äôm not a fan of unnecessary complication.  
‚ö° Complications are man-made.  
‚ö° Difficulties are just part of life.

So let‚Äôs keep it simple.

# ‚úÖ Step 1: Pick a Journal

Start with a free one like **StonkJournal**.  
It‚Äôs clean, easy to use, and does the job. (And if you find value in it, buy the creator a coffee ‚òï to support the project‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the few solid free journals out there.)

# ‚úÖ Step 2: Why Even Use It?

Because trading without a journal is like driving with your eyes half-closed.

Here‚Äôs what a journal helps you do:

1. **Spot cycles** ‚Üí Markets move in patterns, but you only see them if you record.
2. **Measure performance** ‚Üí Know where you‚Äôre strong, and where you‚Äôre bleeding.
3. **Catch your emotions** ‚Üí Most losses come from feelings, not charts. Writing them down makes execution systematic.

I just got back from a trip to Kampot and I am really struck by how awesome the place is.

Two years ago, I used to live in Kampot, but did not like it at all at first... I also have seen videos of YouTubers going to Kampot and saying that they did not like it. However, over time I learned to love it and now think there are so many underrated things to do there and I can't wait to go again!

With that in mind, I am posting a ranking of the best things to do in Kampot. These are just MY favorite things to do.. I am sure I am forgetting some places.

For hotels: If you are interested in eating at a lot of the expat run food restaurants, I would recommend finding a hotel in town. Otherwise, I would recommend staying at a hotel on the river a bit north of the downtown.

My ranking of things to do...

1. Tada Waterfall (go during the rainy season to swim)
2. Bokor Mountain¬†
3. Veal Pouch waterfall (go during rainy season to climb OR just pay $1 to hangout at the Green Valley Veal Pouch. There are also some  popular swimming spots on the way up the mountain).
4. Nibi Spa¬†
5. Riverside at night to see water show and sea horse
6. Sunset River Cruise
7. La Plantation (or any pepper farm)
8. River Park Water Park (there is also Daung TE¬†as a similar option)
9. Dinner on the Kampot Beach (Kah Smao)
10. Mangrove forest¬†
11. Kayak on the Green Cathedral¬†
12. Salt Fields (Salt is harvested during dry season but you can see the flats yearround)
13. VEHA Coffee Mountain View (best view of the Secret Lake)
14. Phnom Chhngok Cave Temple
15. Explore Fish Island

Example Three Day Itinerary + One Day in Kep

Day 1 --> Bokor Mountain and Riverside at night to see water show and street food for Dinner

Day 2 --> Phnom Chhngok Cave Temple, VEHA Coffee, La Plantation, see the Salt fields and then Dinner on Kah Smao

Day 3 --> Tada Waterfall and Nibi Spa (OR River Park) and Dinner on Sunset River Cruise

Day 4 --> go to Kep (Kep Beach, Crab Market, and Kampong Trach Cave)

¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre up for this? You know after everything that happened last time?‚Äù asked the blonde haired sexpot dropping me off. My best friend, one of two of my only friends, and she was not even going to let me pretend this was Ok.  
  
¬† Which was why I loved her.  
  
¬† Even if my blood pressure could not even handle this situation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúObviously not,‚Äù I snapped. I took a breath, and then another one and then counted to five in my head to calm down, or attempt to calm down. I didn‚Äôt need to apologize to Exie; she would know she wasn‚Äôt the reason for my temper. Well, at least this time. ‚ÄúBut what choice do I have? He says I have to go back to school, so she is making me go here. God, I can‚Äôt wait until I‚Äôm eighteen. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLike that will make any difference,‚Äù Sloane, the final third of our threesome remarked bitterly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFocus on the trust funds ladies, we have a plan,‚Äù I repeated our lifelong mantra softly, knowing it would soothe all of our nerves. Only two more years to go until that money became mine and I planned on taking full advantage of the dearly departed biological father I never got to meet. He stayed married long enough to my mother to knock her up, take care of my future and then give up his fight with cancer.  
  
¬† Thanks a lot Daddy Dearest.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs what made him such a phenomenal fatherly candidate. The cancer that is, and all of the money of course.  
  
¬† And it didn‚Äôt hurt, I‚Äôm sure, that before his illness had nearly finished the job of murdering him slowly and the chemicals had taken away his hair and stripped him of his dignity that he happened to be a very attractive man.  
  
¬† Or so my mother says.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve never even seen a picture of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need to get out of here,‚Äù Exie grumbled, flipping her waist length blonde hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm going to catch something. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a snob, public school is not contagious,‚Äù I laughed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure about that?‚Äù Sloane clarified, narrowing her big brown eyes on the downtown campus.  
  
¬† Since I actually wasn‚Äôt sure, I didn‚Äôt answer. It could be contagious, what did I know?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou guys better go anyway. We‚Äôre going to get mobbed if you don‚Äôt and I am really not in the mood for a pack of rabid high school boys this early in the morning. Or worse, jealous girlfriends. ‚Äù I twirled a loose auburn curl around my finger absentmindedly, trying to remain casual. I didn‚Äôt like to get worked up about things. I mean, sure I was probably a little bit feisty with my temper, but other emotions bothered the hell out of me and I preferred to avoid them all together- yep, all emotions.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you going to tell them, Ivy?‚Äù Exie asked with just the tiniest tone of sympathy. I turned to look her in the eyes, knowing both these girls hated feelings just as much as I did. I couldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs why we were best friends. Honestly, we were friends because we had no other options, but it did surprisingly bond us together in a way that didn‚Äôt make much sense.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to tell them anything. I‚Äôm going to let them believe whatever rumors they want to and just focus on getting to graduation day. ‚Äù I sighed, knowing that whatever rumors were being spread were not kind or flattering, but it was a routine I was familiar with.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you want,‚Äù Sloane sympathized. I had been down this road before, but a six month absence from school would only intensify whatever was being spread around about me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you have a better idea S, I‚Äôm all ears. But I can‚Äôt tell them the truth, the girls will hate me no matter what, and the boys will keep being boys. So it doesn‚Äôt really matter what story they believe as long as they leave me alone in the process,‚Äù I snapped again.  
  
¬† Sloane let out a very long, exaggerated sigh and nodded her head in agreement with my argument. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I sighed feeling guilty for my irritable behavior and gave her an apologetic smile. She raised a slim shoulder casually and sent me a small smile so I knew she didn‚Äôt hold it against me. We were all nervous about my return to school, all on edge. At least she understood where I was coming from.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Ivy,‚Äù a teenage boy approached confidently. Oh great here we go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh hey, um‚Ä¶. ‚Äù I gave him a little head nod and prompted him for a name.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm Chase Merrick, we had a, uh, we had chemistry together last year,‚Äù Chase‚Äôs confidence started to fade under the scrutinizing gaze my friends and I were subjecting him to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, yeah, I remember,‚Äù I lied, and forced my lips into a smile. It was almost painful. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù he smiled one of those charming smiles that popular boys reserve for their next conquest.  
  
¬† Lucky for him I was easy.  
  
¬† Ok, not easy‚Ä¶. I kept my legs together.  
  
¬† But I was looking for a boyfriend. I know that sounded trashy, but to be fair it wasn‚Äôt like I was some jungle animal on the prowl. It was just safer to be committed to someone. Plus, he was cute in that all-American way with his floppy sandy brown hair and perfect, white teeth. He even wore a letter jacket which was a major bonus for him even if he didn‚Äôt know it yet. A letter jacket meant that if I could tolerate this relationship longer than this school day he would at some point offer it to me and in turn I would wear it every day to support my awesome new boyfriend. That all led to effectively branding me as ‚Äútaken‚Äù for the whole school to see.  
  
¬† On closer examination he had dimples.  
  
¬† Another point for‚Ä¶. um‚Ä¶. Chase?  
  
¬† Yes. Chase.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre back?‚Äù he asked breaking the silence and my tally of his better qualities.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to go, Ivy, before you know, we need a prescription for this or something,‚Äù Exie interrupted in her best valley girl impersonation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlright, pick me up?‚Äù I asked, turning to receive the light hug each of them would give me. It was moments like this that we were perfect imitations of our mothers. And that annoyed the hell out of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, do you need a ride?‚Äù Sloane asked barely containing her smirk.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI could give you a ride if you need one,‚Äù Chase gallantly offered.  
  
¬† What a gentleman.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally? I don‚Äôt live far. Thank you. That would be such a life-saver,‚Äù I played up my enthusiasm but everything inside me felt dead.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure, it‚Äôs my pleasure,‚Äù Chase smiled again, popping out his identical dimples.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLadies, I‚Äôll call you later,‚Äù I told them. I turned to face them while walking backwards up the long set of stairs that led to the school building.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust breathe, Ivy,‚Äù Sloane called out knowing I needed some last minute advice. ‚ÄúTwo years, that‚Äôs all, just two years!‚Äù  
  
¬† I continued walking backwards, taking each step in stride and watched Exie and Sloane climb into Exie‚Äôs brand new, silver BMW. She gunned the engine and then cut across traffic dangerously.  
  
¬† Central High School was located exactly downtown Omaha on one of the busiest streets, Dodge, which ran almost exactly down the middle of the city. It was also the most traffic jammed street, especially at this time of the morning. Exie was lucky she didn‚Äôt nick her brand new car in the onslaught of oncoming traffic. She got off lucky with a few honking horns and a confused but angry homeless man who screamed obscenities at her from the sidewalk.  
  
¬† I cringed for her and her lack of driving ability. But then again, she probably didn‚Äôt even notice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, Chase, are you a junior or a senior?‚Äù I asked, dropping my gaze to my future boyfriend as he followed me up the stairs like a loyal puppy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA senior,‚Äù he smiled. He answered everything with a smile. His happiness was going to a problem. I really hated breaking the happy ones‚Äô heart  
s.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, exciting!‚Äù I gushed, and this time I almost meant my enthusiasm. He only had nine months left until he could write his own ticket out of here.  
  
¬† So jealous.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I guess,‚Äù he laughed, probably surprised by the sudden energy in my voice. ‚ÄúI still have to figure out where I‚Äôm going to school next year though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUndecided?‚Äù I asked and he nodded in response. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll figure it out. You seem like a smart guy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I said that generously because I seriously had to wonder why we would have been in the same chemistry class if he was such a genius. Although maybe chemistry had been one of my AP classes‚Ä¶. I couldn‚Äôt remember. Last year seemed so long ago and I really hated remembering it anyway.  
  
¬† He chuckled at my way-too-clich√© compliment and mumbled a ‚Äúthanks. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Chase actually seemed like the kind of guy to be put off by obvious flirting. He was the type of guy that could probably pick and choose his girls and didn‚Äôt need them to throw themselves at him for attention. Ugh. It just wasn‚Äôt fair that he didn‚Äôt really have a choice when it came to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like your hair this color by the way,‚Äù his smile turned shy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot a fan of the black?‚Äù I forced myself into conversation about my past. Really, seriously, truthfully‚Ä¶. I hated thinking about anything from last year.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI mean, it was pretty. You could do anything to your hair and you would still be gorgeous,‚Äù he offered thoughtfully, like I didn‚Äôt already know that. It was all part of the curse. ‚ÄúBut I like this red color; it goes better with your freckles. ‚Äù He reached up and brushed his pointer finger along the bridge of my nose to emphasize his point.  
  
¬† I crinkled my nose in reaction and blushed a deeper shade of red than I felt comfortable with. I hated my freckles. Hated them. Granted they weren‚Äôt excessive, just a smattering of light brown on the bridge of my nose, and no doubt designed to make me some kind of more beautiful than the average girl, but they drew every eye and boys were constantly making comments about them.  
  
¬† Like now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is my natural color,‚Äù I offered that piece of personal information free of charge and wildly out of character for me. It would be the only one he got. ‚ÄúAfter everything that, uh, happened last year, my mom made me dye it back. Believe me when I say I desperately miss the black. I preferred the way it washed me out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh I was wrong, he would get two pieces of personal information.  
  
¬† It must be his lucky day.  
  
¬† Except he would disappointingly not do anything with it. He may be smart, and now that I noticed the pins on his letter jacket weren‚Äôt all sports related but actually included some academic endeavors, I started to believe that maybe chemistry was an AP class last year, but he wouldn‚Äôt be smart enough for this game we were playing.  
  
¬† And that was just disappointing.  
  
¬† He laughed, thinking I was joking and I sighed, hating that I was right about him.  
  
¬† We reached the top of the stairs. Finally‚Ä¶. that was seriously a long walk from Dodge Street upwards to the entrance. ‚ÄúGrrr‚Äù to my mother and her refusal to let me get a driver‚Äôs license.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt believe in driving, if you could believe that. Like driving was some weirdo religion. Or like you could actually choose not to believe in it.  
  
¬† But she claimed that was what boys were for.  
  
¬† Yep, I just threw up in my mouth.  
  
¬† She was like the anti-feminist. She‚Äôs was sexist, but in the opposite way.  
  
¬† I was still walking backwards, you know in that flirtatious way that only really coordinated girls can pull off, giving Chase my undivided attention and choosing to believe the busy hallways of the ancient and decrepit school would simply part for me. They did, with no doubt every single eye watching my every move.  
  
¬† This was high school after all. And I was something of a legend‚Ä¶.  
  
¬† No, that wasn‚Äôt the right word.  
  
¬† Hot topic.  
  
¬† I was something of a hot topic.  
  
¬† I was like the definition of notorious; famous but with negative connotations- very negative.  
  
¬† Or at least I had been when I took my little six month sabbatical at the end of last year, over the summer and part of this year. I was banking on coming back, amping up the gossip mongers material and adding mystery to my every growing nefarious reputation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your first class, Chase?‚Äù I asked as I slowed down near the office doors.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCalculus,‚Äù he answered, slowing down with me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot slacking off in your last year? You must be undecided about good schools then,‚Äù I remarked, narrowing my eyes on him.  
  
¬† His cheeks reddened just a bit in response.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù he asked coming to a complete stop with me in front of the long set of glass windows sandwiching the glass door that led into the school office.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet,‚Äù I nodded in response to the office. The bell rang and he was officially late for class. Not that I thought he would mind. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you around. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see me later,‚Äù Chase clarified boldly. ‚ÄúRide home, remember?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, I remember,‚Äù I smiled coyly and then turned my back on him.  
  
¬† The glass door closed behind me with the tinkling of bells overhead and I visibly shivered against that interaction. Breathing deeply and counting to five again, I promised myself that the minute I graduated high school and had access to my trust fund I was so beyond out of here.  
  
¬† But the worst part, the part outside self-disgust and recrimination, outside the monotony and easy simplicity of all this was the guilt. The guilt that crept up slowly in the shadows of my heart and spread like a black sickness through my veins.  
  
¬† The only thing I knew about Chase at this point was that he was smart, good looking and way too easily impressed. Nothing about our interaction should have him enraptured by my every word, not even my looks, which were unfortunately way too pretty for my own good. It so wasn‚Äôt his fault and I felt bad for that.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt really get a say. And I got absolutely no say.  
  
¬† In the end I would leave him heartbroken and he would leave me shattered just like every single guy before him.  
  
¬† And believe me when I say there were a lot of guys before him. ¬†It was my job.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, Ms. Pierce, I wish I could say I was happy to see you,‚Äù Mrs. Tanner, the evil witch of a secretary, acknowledged me with a smug smirk that seemed to confirm the fact that yes, in case you were wondering, high school is the ninth ring of hell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Mrs. Tanner, I wish I could say the same thing,‚Äù I replied as sweetly as I could. I met her halfway with a long counter in between us.  
  
¬† She was not amused with me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt miss anymore school Ivy,‚Äù Mrs. Tanner warned and I realized it was practically painful for her to give me advice to heed. This must be coming from the principal, the male principal Mr. Costas. ‚ÄúAt least not this semester, unless you have a written note from your doctor. Mr. Costas would like to remind you that you are going to have to work hard enough to catch up this late in the quarter and that skipping, ditching or taking unnecessary sick days will not benefit you toward your goal of graduation. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell Mr. Costas, I appreciate that he‚Äôs looking out for me,‚Äù I answered in that same sickly sweet voice I used to annoy the hell out of her.  
  
¬† She ignored me. ‚ÄúHere is your class schedule. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you. ‚Äù I snatched it from her hand and turned on my heel before she offered anymore unsolicited advice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe faculty of this school would also like to ask that you not send any more of its students to the hospital,‚Äù she called out snidely to my back.  
  
¬† I tensed immediately, my back ramrod straight and my nerves shot to sudden hell. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best,‚Äù I ground out and picked up pace.  
  
¬† I just needed to get to the glass door, push it open and get to class.  
  
¬† Fifteen more seconds.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you have any extra cash on you, that canister by the door is for Sam‚Äôs recovery fund,‚Äù she finished on a high note.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I should have just bolted; and not just from the office, from school, from Omaha, from America‚Ä¶. I should have just gone.  
  
¬† But instead of listening to the sound voice of reason my inner conscience was screaming at me, I let the rotting guilt spread its ugly, vicious wings and glanced down at the canister. There he was. Sam. Smiling and happy in his senior picture that was not at all indicative of what he looked like now‚Ä¶. .  
  
¬† The canister was covered with construction paper asking for donations to help with his physical therapy and explaining that he used to be a senior at this school, that he used to be a basketball star, and that he used to be able to walk‚Ä¶. The same life he never got the chance to live before a car accident changed his world forever. The plastic cover had a slit cut out of the top so you could drop money into it, long enough for coins and wide enough for folded up dollar bills.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt do this.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt want to do this.  
  
¬† I felt my breakfast lurch in my very upset stomach. I lunged for the office door knowing even a second more spent trapped in the same room as that canister was going to send me into another breakdown.  
  
¬† Only this time there would be serious consequences to pay.  
  
¬† I threw the door open without seeing. I mean literally I couldn‚Äôt see anything. My mind had slipped into the horrific memories of the past and I was pretty sure I could make a solid plea for temporary insanity at this point.  
  
¬† So when I shoved the door with as much force as I was capable of and met shouting resistance and then found myself tripping, toppling over something on the floor, I was completely taken off guard. The situation was made worse when in the middle of my fall I was drenched with severely hot liquid and landed painfully on my back, soaking wet.  
  
¬† I lay there for several moments sprawled out awkwardly on the hard tile before the clearest, deepest gray eyes I had ever seen hovered over me. His thick brow line and hard edges to his tanned face prove he was male, definitely male. Our gazes locked together and I felt uncomfortably immobilized as the liquid I could now identify as coffee started to cool on my shirt and against my skin.  
  
¬† And then those eyes narrowed on me. My eyes flickered to a face that was completely unreadable, in that I couldn‚Äôt identify his expression except that it wasn‚Äôt good. Like‚Ä¶. he was mad at me. Like, he was pissed at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me up,‚Äù I growled, confused by his less than stellar reaction.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù he asked politely, schooling his expression and realistically sounding polite, like he hadn‚Äôt heard me correctly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me up,‚Äù I slowed my speech down, thinking he just hadn‚Äôt heard me, probably because he was so disconcerted from staring into my eyes.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not being stuck up here. That‚Äôs just usually what happened. I was speaking from experience.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo problem. ‚Äù He scooted back from me and I scrambled to my feet. He joined me seconds later with two empty coffee cups in his hand.  
  
¬† We both side stepped the spilled coffee puddled in the hallway and I thought for a second that I heard him huff an impatient sigh, but I knew that had to be wrong.  
  
¬† The halls were empty now, and we were left to stare each other down in front of the office. I prayed Mrs. Tanner had gone back to hiding in her hole of a break room; otherwise I needed to be concerned with her swooping down at any moment to haul my ass to the principal‚Äôs office. If I was lucky she would demand a detention, but more than likely she would be petitioning for a suspension. She would use this or any other thing she could find against me.  
  
¬† Like I assaulted gray eyes with his hot coffee in an attempt to end any promising future he might have. Like this would be related in some way to Sam.  
  
¬† Realizing that could be the case, I looked down at my shirt hoping to have evidence that I was actually the one assaulted. And then hope turned to irritation when I noticed that it was completely ruined, and uncomfortably sticky and cold. Not that it was a designer shirt‚Ä¶. but the tight fitting, scoop neck black long-sleeved tee looked great with my gray bubble skirt and knee high charcoal boots. And the only extra piece of clothing I even had with me was my favorite hoodie that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to wear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do now?‚Äù I bit out, while mystery man watched me from a few feet away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù he asked politely again, only this time I heard the faint tones of aggression and confusion.  
  
¬† Not possible.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou spilled coffee all over me; I don‚Äôt have a change of clothes, what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day?‚Äù I asked not at all politely.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI spilled coffee on you?‚Äù he asked slowly, his patience growing thin.  
  
¬† I stopped then, in that moment and lifted my eyes to meet his again. He wasn‚Äôt looking at me though, his arms were crossed and he was looking around the hallway as if he couldn‚Äôt actually believe what was happening and he needed someone else to clue him in. I took his distracted second to look him over.  
  
¬† He was all bad boy with thick layered dark brown hair that was clearly not styled and left messy and sexy from sleep. He had the thick kind of eye lashes that made most girls go crazy, with tanned skin completely in contrast to his silver gray eyes. His gray t-shirt that was just a little too tight, stretched over his biceps deliciously. His low slung jeans completed what might as well have been the uniform for all things wicked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you seriously going to blame me?‚Äù he asked in disbelief, drawing my attention away from the hollow of his throat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou spilled coffee on me,‚Äù I pointed out, pulling my shirt away from my skin mostly because it was so uncomfortable but also and a bit calculatingly because I knew it would expose my stomach and I was dying to see his reaction to a little skin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou came flying out of the office like a bat out of hell and ran into me,‚Äù he laughed unbelievably. And not once did his eyes fall to my exposed skin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúListen, I don‚Äôt have time for this, I‚Äôm already late for class,‚Äù I ignored his potentially valid point and waited for the part where he would shake off his disbelief and ask for my number.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seriously unbel  
ievable,‚Äù he continued to sound irritated with me and honestly it was a little disconcerting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre unbelievable!‚Äù  
  
¬† Only I really meant that. Something was wrong. Like maybe I was broken.  
  
¬† Maybe I was broken‚Ä¶. ?  
  
¬† I had to test this theory, which meant swallowing all of my pride. My entire life thus far had conditioned me to think that nothing was ever my fault and there was always someone else to blame. Usually a man. An apology would take some effort on my part.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are one snide little-‚Äú  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait a second, before you start calling names,‚Äù I interrupted him, holding my hand up before he could get any naughty words out of that beautiful mouth of his. ‚ÄúYou caught me way off guard. I may have been a little defensive,‚Äù I relented, not feeling a single word I was saying, but knowing if I wanted to get to the bottom of this I would have to play his game.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are apologizing for being defensive?‚Äù he clarified, not looking at all pacified.  
  
¬† What the hell?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, um, that and for running into you,‚Äù I mumbled in a rush.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù he stepped forward, tightening the arms that were folded across his chest. I knew he heard me‚Ä¶. cocky bastard.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI apologize for running into you, I was in a hurry,‚Äù I offered magnanimously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù he narrowed his eyes on me again and rocked back on his heels. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, I mean, you took most of the hit anyway. ‚Äù He nodded to my stained shirt and that‚Äôs when I realized he was completely dry except for the hem of his t-shirt.  
  
¬† I hesitated for a long moment, feeling irrationally vulnerable under his scrutiny. Which wasn‚Äôt fair, because I was usually the one getting to do the scrutinizing. He looked me over for all of three more seconds before seeming to come to an indifferent conclusion.  
  
¬† Which, let‚Äôs be honest, confused the hell out of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can write you a pass,‚Äù he offered out of the blue. This was it! This was him showing his true colors! But his tone of voice was not anything like the doting, fawning boys I was used to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can?‚Äù I squeaked while still feeling exposed for some strange reason.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the office aide this hour, which is why I had coffee in the first place,‚Äù he motioned to the still wet ground.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù he asked as if he didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I laughed.  
  
¬† His expression turned confused. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt write you a pass without it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. ‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt tell if he really didn‚Äôt know my name or not. He looked confused, but really I was the one that was so confused I couldn‚Äôt even make a sentence.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, your name?‚Äù he asked impatiently.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIvy Pierce,‚Äù I struggled for confidence. Who was this guy?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on Ivy, what class are you going to?‚Äù He motioned toward the office, but there was absolutely no way I was going back in there. Not to mention, the minute Mrs. Tanner figured out he was trying to help me out, she wouldn‚Äôt let him go through with it. And for some unexplainable reason I didn‚Äôt want to get in it with her in front of him.  
  
¬† Whoever he was.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, I have,‚Äù I gave my schedule a quick glance before answering, ‚ÄúMr. Taylor for creative writing. ‚Äù He motioned me to follow him so I had to call after him before the door swung shut, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just wait out here. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded his head without turning around to acknowledge me. Huh. He jumped up, so he could reach over the chest high partition and grabbed the yellow late slips before settling back down to the floor and filling it out. I watched him through the glass in kind of a state of disbelief. He hadn‚Äôt looked back at me, not even once.  
  
¬† Obviously my self-confidence was used to more petting, but I had legitimate reasons to have always thought of myself as desired. I was desired- always. And it wasn‚Äôt something I liked or ever hardly tolerated, but still it was the truth. The male species as a whole couldn‚Äôt resist me and suddenly I smashed into someone I didn‚Äôt know, get splattered with hot coffee and my mojo was gone?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIvy Pierce?‚Äù a girl‚Äôs voice made me turn my head away from watching the mysterious office aide.  
  
¬† I turned to meet Kenna Lee as she approached the office. I forced a smile that I didn‚Äôt really mean and realized how hard it was to keep my focus on her. She was nice enough, or as nice as a girl could be around me and we had known each forever, but as far as friends went‚Ä¶. she didn‚Äôt like me. At all.  
  
¬† And I didn‚Äôt blame her.  
  
¬† Plus it was hard to keep my eyes off the office aide writing me a pass. What if he turned to check me out and I missed it? Or even better, what if he never turned to check me out?  
  
¬† Kenna‚Äôs smile seemed halfway genuine though so I had to wonder if girls would also be affected by my loss of mojo. Maybe I would start making friends.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen did you get back?‚Äù she asked. She was one of the more attractive girls in our junior class. Her dad was Japanese and her mom was Italian American so she had the good fortune of beautifully mixed genes with long, silky straight black hair, and pretty tilted eyes that were a shocking shade of green.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúToday is my first day,‚Äù I answered, wondering what to make of her friendliness.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù she smiled knowingly, but friendly enough.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, thanks,‚Äù I mumbled while she left me in the hallway and entered the office.  
  
¬† Office Boy turned at the sound of the door bells tinkling and his gray eyes lit up as soon as they landed on Kenna. He stopped writing my pass to pull her into his arms and smother her in a kiss. She threw her head back in laughter and he went for her neck playfully.  
  
¬† It was kind of gross, in that sickeningly gross happy couple way that makes everyone around want to vomit. Really blissful couples always made me uncomfortable anyway and I felt the need to avert my eyes.  
  
¬† The office door opened again and a tan, long-fingered hand was thrust through the space. I followed the sinewy muscles up to a perfectly toned bicep along his shoulder, collar bone, throat and up to those clear gunmetal eyes staring at me with nothing more than complete disinterest.

1n0uxyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n0uxyz/i_received_a_terrifying_painting_from_a_jehovahs/,I Received a Terrifying Painting From a Jehovah's Witness,"	The day started like any other, I woke up. I got dressed in a comfortable outfit: some loose basketball shorts and a pop culture t-shirt of some sort. I made some coffee and drank it as usual from my blue ‚ÄúShedd Aquarium‚Äù penguin mug. I turned on the TV and watched a few episodes of this new show I was watching. Maybe The White Lotus. I looked at some paintings I was thinking about buying, as I loved art at the time, and loved buying paintings. I went out onto the porch of my house. It was a beautiful day. 



I went back inside, and hours later, the expected knock of the Jehovah‚Äôs Witness came upon the door. I walked over to the door and looked through the keyhole to see the button of a big black dress shirt staring back at me. A second knock came on the door. I open the door to find a massive figure. A male, horribly bloated face, standing at approximately eight feet six inches tall. He stands staggeringly over me and bends his knees down to see me as the top of the front door frame gets in the way of his vision. His face is incredibly similar to the face of The Moonlight Man from Stephen King‚Äôs Gerald‚Äôs Game.



‚ÄúGood Evening, Sir!‚Äù the witness says. His voice is shrill, far higher in pitch than I was expecting it to be. It‚Äôs mildly frightening with a somewhat childlike pitch to the voice. It‚Äôs like if a child spoke with the verbiage of an older woman. He looks down at me with sunken eyes.

‚ÄúHello. How can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, sir, I‚Äôm here with the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. Have you heard the good news recently?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir, I have not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, may I tell you about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, sir, I‚Äôm not religious.‚Äù

I begin to close the door, and the Witness puts his foot in the door.

‚ÄúPlease, sir, I promise it‚Äôs not a waste of your time. I can help you find Jesus.‚Äù

I groan over the offer and let him into my home.



	He lowers his head and enters my home. He‚Äôs even taller on the inside than the outside of my house. His head is near the ceiling and his steps seemingly make him taller. He walks on the balls of his feet as if he was wearing high heels. He wasn‚Äôt wearing high heels but still walked on the balls of his feet.

‚ÄúWould you care for a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, thank you, but I appreciate you greatly for your offer.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

I take a seat on my couch, pull out my phone, and start a stopwatch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got 15 minutes to state your case.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it about the world that discourages you from believing in god and giving yourself over to the lord?‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather personal and something I don't like discussing with people.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I can't help you unless I understand exactly what has halted you from letting the lord into your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it'll help, I'll tell you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, joyous. Please, do tell. I'm all ears.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, for starters, whenever I was around 8 years old, my father went to a church and was led into the basement of the church by one of the congregants. When he came out of the basement, he was more scared than I'd ever seen a person in my life. It's still one of the most frightened looks of terror I've ever witnessed to this day. He didn't speak to anyone for a while, and my mother made the bold decision to institutionalize him. We'd get visitation rights now and then, and he finally started speaking again. Not too long after he got home, he started having night terrors where he'd wake up screaming. After over a month of these constant night terrors, he became a violent person due to the lack of sleep he was getting. He beat my mom. He beat my sister. He beat me. I didn't think he liked me to begin with, so when he started beating me, and it was more violent than the other two, I just took it as the purest statement of specified hatred towards a person that I could. He'd beat me, bruise me, and batter me around without remorse. He grew even more tired and more restless with each night. He eventually turned to the bottle and would end up causing the end of my parents' marriage after a drunk driving accident that would cause severe injuries to my sister. After the divorce, he moved out, and I remembered seeing him at church on most Sundays, but he was still clearly tired. The bags that sat beneath his eyes grew heavier and heavier with each time that I saw him. Eventually, the police got a noise complaint from one of his neighbors claiming he had screamed for more than 30 minutes before eventually going silent. When the police got there, they found him dead with a noose around his neck and a note. My mother died of a tragic accident only a few years later, as one of the planes she worked on got hit by a massive bird strike, which hit the engines and sent the plane into a downward spiral into the Andes. My sister, only a few weeks ago, took her own life when she swerved off the road and into a tree. She left a note on the passenger seat that said the same thing that my father's note said more than 30 years earlier. ""I saw the face of God and it was screaming with a vile hatred for me."" She never read his note before her death. I don‚Äôt know how she knew what it said, but she did. I‚Äôm the only one left in my family now. I have nobody anymore.‚Äù



	The witness‚Äôs demeanor completely changed from a joyous giddiness to a disturbed silence. I could clearly tell that the story had bothered him.

‚ÄúGoodness‚Ä¶sir, I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Do you see why I don‚Äôt partake in religion now? Do you see why I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a god? Do you see why I don‚Äôt let the lord into my heart?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt. They just‚Ä¶had a negative experience with the lord. Maybe it was their time.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey just had a negative experience with the lord. He works-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no. The other thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it was their time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do you get off throwing around conspiracies like that? I mean Jesus Christ-‚Äù

The witness immediately rises to his feet and points directly at me.

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù with a thunderous tone, multiple octaves deeper than his normal delivery, and his voice echoes through my home. My body presses against the couch cushions with force. As if he had pushed me violently into the couch with only the strength of his voice. I‚Äôm horrified by his reaction. The witness clears his throat and sits back down, his voice going back to its normal pitch.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt take the lord's name in vain in my presence, is that understood?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt muster any words, so I just shook my head in response.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù



	He talked to me as I trembled in fear for another 11 agonizing minutes. His outburst made me afraid of saying another word. It was so loud. So violent. I was convinced it shook the objects surrounding him. At moments in the 11 minutes, I zoned out. I caught a few things now and then, ‚ÄúThen god created the garden‚Äù, ‚ÄúEve took a bite of the apple.‚Äù he practically just read me Genesis, something I had read much earlier in my life, but had forgotten how bizarre it was. I waited a few seconds after the fifteen-minute mark to interrupt his reading because of the fear that washed over me.



	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fifteen minutes,‚Äù I said cautiously in my tone.

‚ÄúOh, well, how unfortunate. I do have one more thing for you, though, and you might or might not have seen it while I was on your porch, but I have brought a gift with me for anyone who wants it!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, what is it?‚Äù

The witness stands up straight, and he towers over me once more. He opens the door to my home, leans out, grabs something, and hides it behind his back. He walks up closely to me and pulled a canvas out from behind his back. The canvas was painted black. Completely black with zero extra details included with it. Just a plain black canvas.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a painting, silly!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs nothing painted on here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure there is! You‚Äôre just not looking hard enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am looking at it with my own eyes, it‚Äôs just a black canvas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I allowed to paint on it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not! It would ruin the picture!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I just heard my brothers and sisters calling for me! Would you like the painting?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-‚Äù

‚ÄúANSWER NOW!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Yes, I would.‚Äù



I close my eyes and keep them closed for about 3 seconds. I open my eyes to find that the witness has disappeared. I look around the house. He truly was gone. I looked in my bedroom, and right in front of my bed was the painting, already hung up on the wall. I walked over to the painting and attempted to take it down, but the painting wouldn‚Äôt budge, not even an inch. It had somehow stuck to my wall. I looked at it with confusion in my eyes, then decided to go about my day. Everything else went just as normally as it typically did. Did some work, made some dinner, watched some morTVtv, then got into bed to go to sleep.



It was about 2:36 AM when I heard a groaning sound coming from the front of my bed that awoke me from my shallow sleep. I sat up straight away and looked around the room. The door was closed and locked, just as I had left it. The windows to my room were still closed. The closet door was wide open. But there was one thing that stuck out to me. The painting now had white dots on it and a gray outline of something. A figure. Maybe a person. I blinked, and the figure became more detailed. I blinked 10 times, and with each blink, the creature became even more detailed. I turned my head to test a theory. I turned my head quickly to the left and then straight back to the front. The painting was completely black again. Whatever was on the painting had now disappeared.



I lay back down and closed my eyes. Just as I had closed my eyes, there were the sounds of bones cracking coming from the front of my bed. I sprang up to see what I was hearing, but there was nothing. The sounds of bones cracking continued, and all of a sudden, a bony, grey hand pressed onto the blanket on my bed. Then another hand pressed onto the blanket. The sounds of bones cracking continued as a grey figure rose in front of my bed. Adjusting itself with all of the bones that it had, cracking with its ever-continuing ascent to its feet.



It stood up completely straight, and the cracking stopped. He leaned his head to the right and then to the left. His neck cracks with each lean. I sit back and stare in fear at this horrifying creature that stands before me. The skin that it had was directly attached to its bones. Skinnier than anything I had ever seen in my entire life. Its stomach and its back are connected. It‚Äôs as if it didn‚Äôt have any organs at all and all it had was a skeletal structure. It turns around to face me, and his bright, flashlight-like eyes meet mine. It‚Äôs the figure from the painting. Every single detail.



It stares at me for about five minutes. I can‚Äôt move. I‚Äôm paralyzed with fear. It walks along the side of my bed, and my head follows its movement. He kneels to the side of me and tilts his head. It tilts its head back up to be face to face with me. It lifts its arm with the sounds of cracking bones accompanying every movement its arm makes. It presses its hand against my face and wipes a tear away from my cheek. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was crying until this point. It‚Äôs a gentle creature. I can‚Äôt help but stare wide-eyed at the grey creature. It pulls its hand back and grabs its chin and pulls its mouth open while its mandible pops, and he continues to open his mouth. A spotlight-like light emerges from the back of its throat and shines directly into my eyes. It‚Äôs the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I saw the faces of everyone in my family. They were all smiling. My father was mouthing the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù. My mother sobs tears of joy at just the sight of me. My sister was mouthing the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt get closer‚Äù. I feel myself start crying now, but it‚Äôs not sadness, it‚Äôs tears of joy. It closes its mouth, and the light fades away. It then stands up and walks back to the front of my bed, turns to the painting, then lifts its leg and puts it into the painting. Each joint and bone pops as it climbs into the painting and becomes paint brush strokes once again. My face goes blank.



I look down to my right and see the stopwatch on my phone still going. Forty hours, twelve minutes, seven seconds, and four milliseconds. I look forward, and see the witness looking at me. I‚Äôm back on my couch, sitting directly across from the witness. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the face of God beautiful?‚Äù he asks. My blank face slowly stretches into a smile.

What Saved My GPA","I hated my first year of high school anatomy terms, write a bunch of essays, and somehow maintain a social life. The endless grind can be overwhelming, leading to burnout, procrastination, and a serious addiction to iced coffee.

I saw someone else write a post about this, which inspired me to finally write my own comprehensive guide. Because for the past year, my single biggest study tip hasn't been fancy note-taking apps or ChatGPT it's been turning my education into a game. Which is sort of related to Ali Abdaal's book Feel-Good Productivity. The core idea? Feeling good makes you more productive.

In this post, I‚Äôll break down how to gamify your learning and review three of my favorite tools to get you started.
üß† The Mindset Shift: From Grind to Game Before we dive into the tools, let's talk about the ""why."" Forcing yourself to study through sheer discipline has a limit. Negative emotions like stress and boredom might work in the short term, but they drain you.

‚úÖ The ""Feel-Good Productivity"" Philosophy:
Positive Emotions Fuel a Better Brain: When you're having fun, your brain is more creative, engaged, and better at problem-solving.
Discipline is a Finite Resource: You can't ""work harder"" forever. Sustainable productivity comes from enjoyment, not force.
Ask One Simple Question: For any task you dread, ask yourself: ""What would this look like if it were fun?"" This one question is the key to unlocking gamified learning.
Still struggling to see how your tax law class could be ""fun""? No worries. That‚Äôs where the game mechanics come in! Let‚Äôs break down how to build your game.

üéÆ How to Turn Your Study Sesh into an Epic Quest Ready to press start? Here's how to design your own learning game.

‚úÖ 1. Create Your Character According to Abdaal, we all have different ""play personalities."" Picking one makes the adventure feel more real. Are you...
The Collector: Your mission is to gather knowledge. Every flashcard memorized is a new item in your collection.
The Competitor: You're here to win. Compete against your past self (beat your last test score!) or friends.
The Creator: You build things. Your goal is to create amazing notes, projects, or mind maps.
The Explorer: You love discovering new things. Each chapter is a new world to map out and explore.
(Others include the Director, Joker, Kinesthete, and Storyteller).
Choose a persona. Suddenly you're not just ""studying for biology""‚Äîyou're an Explorer charting the unknown regions of the human cell.

‚è≥ 2. Design Your Quests Break your massive to-do list into small, winnable quests.
Instead of: ""Study for Midterm""
Try:
Main Quest: Ace the Midterm!
Side Quest 1: Read and summarize Chapter 4 (+50 XP).
Side Quest 2: Complete 20 practice problems (+75 XP).
Daily Quest: Review 30 flashcards (+10 XP).
Assigning points or ""XP"" makes every small step feel like a victory.

üìö 3. Track Your Progress Create a ""skill tree"" in a notebook or on a whiteboard.
Skill: ""Calculus""
Level 1: Derivatives
Level 2: Integrals
Level 3: Differential Equations
Every time you master a topic, you ""level up."" It's a visual way to see how far you've come.

üèÜ Top 3 ""Game Engines"" for Your Study Quest
1. Habitica ‚Äì The Full RPG Experience üöÄ Habitica turns your to-do list into a full-blown role-playing game. You create a custom avatar that levels up as you complete tasks, and you can even team up with friends to fight monsters and stay accountable.
‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Like It: It's perfect for breaking down big projects into smaller ""monsters"" to defeat. The party system adds a social motivation layer, which is great for group projects. It's genuinely fun to buy new swords or pets for my character with the Gold I earned from finishing an essay.

2. StudyXP ‚Äì Get Rewarded for Showing Your Work ‚≠ê StudyXP combines an instant camera solver with a points system that rewards you for showing your work‚Äîso you learn faster and feel motivated every step of the way. You snap a picture of your question (handwritten, textbook, whatever) and get step-by-step guidance. Then, you snap a pic of your own work to earn points, level up, and keep streaks going.

‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Like It: The camera solver is a lifesaver when I'm stuck on a math problem from a textbook. What really makes it different is that it rewards me for actually doing the work myself. I snap a picture of my solution to earn points, which feels way more satisfying than just getting the answer. It helps build good habits, especially with the streaks and daily goals.

3. Forest ‚Äì Gamified Focus & Simplicity üå≤ Struggling with phone distractions? Forest gamifies the act of staying focused. You set a timer, and during that time, a virtual tree grows. If you leave the app to scroll through social media, your tree withers and dies.
‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Like It: It‚Äôs a simple, visual, and brutally effective way for me to enforce focus blocks. When I'm tempted to check my phone, the thought of my little virtual tree dying is surprisingly powerful. Seeing a lush forest I've grown from hours of work is incredibly motivating and makes the Pomodoro technique feel like a relaxing game.

Final Thoughts: Ready to Press Start? If you're feeling burnt out from the endless study grind, try reframing it. Stop forcing yourself to work and start inviting yourself to play.
Habitica ‚Äì Best for turning your entire life into an RPG.
StudyXP ‚Äì Best for getting homework help that actually rewards you for learning.
Forest ‚Äì Best for battling distraction and gamifying pure focus.

Hi guys,

I‚Äôm 24 years old, male, 5‚Äô8, 177 lbs (BMI 26.9, slightly overweight). Sedentary lifestyle since 2020 (5 years wala talagang exercise, no sports, no stretching, puro upo lang, puyat pa lagi).

  
Goal ko ngayon: **magbawas ng timbang muna (to normal BMI), then later mag-tone/maintain**. Plan ko is **gym 3x a week**. 

  
I asked ChatGPT/Hevy app for help and eto yung program na binigay sakin- gusto ko sana marinig thoughts ninyo kung realistic at safe ba for beginners

  
Workout Plan (3 Days/Week)

**Warm-up:** 5 min treadmill or stationary bike at easy pace.

**Day A**

1. Leg Press (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 sets √ó 10 reps
2. Chest Press (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
3. Lat Pulldown (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
4. Seated Row (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
5. Crunch (Machine or floor) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó15

**Day B**

1. Leg Curl (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
2. Shoulder Press (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
3. Seated Row (Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó10
4. Triceps Pushdown (Cable) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó12
5. Bicep Curl (Dumbbell or Machine) ‚Üí 2‚Äì3√ó12

Alternating Day A / Day B every gym visit. Start with 2 sets muna first 2 weeks (light weights lang), then move to 3 sets kapag kaya na.

**Cardio:** 10‚Äì20 min brisk walk/cycling/elliptical after weights, or 20‚Äì30 min walking on rest days.

  
Nutrition Guidelines

* Calorie deficit (eat less than I burn).
* Protein every meal (chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, yogurt, beans).
* Veggies daily.
* Carbs in moderation (rice, oats, bread, potatoes).
* No liquid calories (soda, juice, alcohol). Water/tea/coffee only.

# Recovery

* Target 7 hrs sleep (still fixing sleeping schedule, but kaya yang 7 hours. Ang hirap lang talaga matulog ng gabi, laging late na kung antukin ako like 3AM earliest usually).
* Expect soreness first few weeks.

My questions for you guys:

* Ok lang ba na puro **machines** muna since sobrang beginner ako? (No barbell squat, no deadlift kasi nakakatakot, baka unsafe form.)
* As someone na mag f-first time gym, **I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING SA MACHINE**, pano kaya ang gagawin ko? Of course naisip ko naman mag ask ng assistance, pero hindi ko ma explain kung ano ba yung bumabagabag sakin at natanong ko pa vaguely kung ""pano ba gagawin ko""
* Anything you‚Äôd change sa plan?
* Tama ba to focus on calorie deficit + protein for weight loss?

[Tapos tinanong ko sya kasi parang ang vague nung sinabi nya about sa food. Ito sagot nya.](https://preview.redd.it/kfyoidkuwelf1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=22de9807209e8207817737cb79c027db70ef4f49)

  
yung parang multiplication table sabi ni GPT ay ""**3√ó10 = 3 sets of 10 reps**"" daw. **rep (repetition)** = doing the exercise **once** (e.g., push the weight forward and bring it back = 1 rep).

* **1 set** = a **group of reps** (10 reps in a row = 1 set).
* Then you **rest** (usually 1‚Äì2 minutes), and do the next set.

yan sabi nya nung tinanong ko sya kung ano ibig sabihin nun.

Additionally, what are cultural standards we should make sure to follow? I don‚Äôt think you guys have a huge tipping culture. Is it a quiet place (ie we should refrain from talking too loud)? How far do we stand from people? Is it rude to do certain things?

So, I [31F] have been here for 6 years. 2 years ago my position on base got ""reassigned"" and my whole office lost their jobs. Now I live with my parents as a single parent myself. As I make house and wait to jump into college next year, I find myself with a lot of time, and not a lot of time on random days. 

My family thinks I've spent the past 2 years in a depression. In reality I've spent them getting accustomed to my new position in life. Trying to find a new path forward, and what that means to me. I'm the kind of person that needs a role to fill, a job, a purpose, or what am I worth? Being a parent has been fulfilling in it's own way but we all know it isn't all we are. (Sorry that's heavy. Yes, I'm in therapy for anxiety.) My parents recommended I find myself some friends and ""put myself out there"". Honestly I've forgotten how.

The friends I do have are long distance back in my hometown in Texas. We do D&D every other Sat, but our adult lives stop us from bonding any more than that. I do have other hobbies but most keep me at home. I find that most clubs, and memberships around here require money which I don't have right now. If I do make friends I won't be able to pay for a coffee, or a movie, my schedule will be random, and my kid will always come first. Plus I'm about to add college to the mix. Is it even worth it right now? I can see how it would be ""good for my mental health"" but I'm not sure right now.

The premise of this story is something that a friend and I had been kicking around for years and is absurd, the content will make sense later I'm hoping that I've written enough to potentially hook the reader in to the absurdity. 

Here goes. 

On a long, empty stretch of a two-lane blacktop in Dickson Falls, New Brunswick, the sodium-orange streetlights flickered on as a late-model Ford Maverick navigated out of town. A man in his mid-thirties ‚Äì Mike Damphousse ‚Äì turned his attention to the stereo, turning the knob to 99.9 The Moose FM.

‚ÄúCathy Jane here!‚Äù the voice of the DJ boomed over the speakers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading into a Dominion Day Long Weekend! Don‚Äôt forget, folks, it‚Äôs an All-Canadian weekend. That‚Äôs right: seventy-two solid hours of Canada‚Äôs finest.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice,‚Äù Mike said with a smile and a nod.

‚ÄúIt all kicks off at midnight June thirtieth, and we‚Äôre going to play through the weekend! Don‚Äôt forget to stop by and see yours truly on Dominion Day, live from the Soap Box Derby,‚Äù Cathy Jane continued.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start things off with a little Canadian group who used to back up a wild man named Ronnie Hawkins, and another guy you might have heard of ‚Äì Bob Dylan. It‚Äôs The Band, here on CJBC The Moose.‚Äù

The iconic introduction of ‚ÄúThe Weight‚Äù by The Band hummed over the speakers of the Ford Maverick. Mike reached for the radio volume button and turned it up.

‚ÄúHell yes!‚Äù he exclaimed and tapped the steering wheel in rhythm with the music.

‚ÄúI pulled into Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead...‚Äù

A glint on the horizon caught his eye, a pulsing light.

Mike squinted. ‚ÄúThe hell is that?‚Äù

It was a figure, a man on a motorcycle.

Suddenly, as Levon Helm crescendos on the ‚ÄúNo is all he said‚Äù part of the song, a black 1986 Honda V65 Magna roared by. Mike‚Äôs eyes widened in horror as a faintly glowing purple light emitted from the tip of a rubber dildo visibly mounted to the rider‚Äôs helmet.

Gravel spat under his tires as Mike jerked the Maverick onto the shoulder, his chest pounding like Levon‚Äôs snare drum.

‚ÄúWhat. What the hell was that?‚Äù he sputtered to himself. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone?‚Äù

Mike‚Äôs phone cut him off. It was ringing on the passenger seat. He looked over. The display showed a photo of himself, a pretty young woman, and two little girls in front of a Christmas tree. The caller ID identified the caller as ‚ÄúBae.‚Äù

With shaking hands, Mike hit the Bluetooth call answer button on his aftermarket Bluetooth speaker. Breathless, he spoke, ‚ÄúHi, babe‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, baby!‚Äù the voice on the other end said. ‚ÄúOn your way back from Trevor‚Äôs, could you possibly stop by Whole Foods?‚Äù

Mike sat, staring forward out the window, still stunned at what had just happened, and sputtered quietly, ‚ÄúOf course‚Ä¶ what do we need?‚Äù

‚ÄúOat milk, organic cat food ‚Äì make sure it‚Äôs grain-free, some flaxseed, and could you grab one of the gluten-free vegan vanilla cakes for me to take with me to my folks‚Äô place?‚Äù said his wife on the other end.

Mike stared forward and repeated the request without much change in his voice. ‚ÄúOat milk, organic cat food, flaxseed, and vegan cake ‚Äì 10-4, anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs eviction night on Big Brother ‚Äì love you!‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you too,‚Äù Mike said as he hung up the phone. He reached for his vape pen, took a big pull, and exhaled as he signaled his intention to turn back onto the road, a dust cloud rising behind the Maverick.

The events of a few minutes ago continued to play over and over in his mind.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that? Why would anyone do that?‚Äù Mike said to himself as the purple light vibrated in his memory from the end of the phallic horn.

Still visibly shaken by what he thought he had seen, he flipped his signal light and pulled off the road into Flo‚Äôs Diner on the right side of the road, a greasy spoon all-night truck stop lit by a buzzing neon sign that read simply:

Flo‚Äôs.

Mike put the car in park and turned the ignition off, killing the motor and the radio mid-song as April Wine professed their love of rock. He grabbed his cell phone, wallet, and vape pen from the cupholder and shook his head. ‚ÄúI need a minute to figure this out,‚Äù he said to himself as he walked across the parking lot, reaching for the door handle.

The smell of stale cigarettes, deep fryers, and coffee hit his nostrils as he stepped inside. Dark wood-panelled walls were covered with an assortment of provincial license plates, an autographed poster of Roland Melanson that read, ‚ÄúThanks for the Pie, Flo ‚Äì Love Rollie,‚Äù a few vintage beer and cigarette tin posters, and an old crosscut saw. A giant stuffed pickerel hung above the jukebox, which was currently spitting out ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Everywhere‚Äù by Hank Snow. The crack of a break, signaling the start of a pool game, overtook the music as Hank listed off the places he‚Äôd been.

‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù Mike murmured to himself as he glanced up at the horseshoe hanging above. The door swung closed behind him.

‚ÄúHave a seat anywhere you like, hun!‚Äù said the waitress. Mike slid onto a stool at the counter.

The western-style doors from the kitchen swung open, and a middle-aged woman in standard roadside diner garb stepped out, wiping her hands on her apron. Her name glowed in neon above the door outside and clearly on her name tag above her lapel:

Flo.

‚ÄúSonny,‚Äù she smiled, ‚Äúyou look like a guy who could use a cup of coffee and a piece of Flo‚Äôs famous apple pie.‚Äù

Before Mike could respond, she was already pouring a cup and sliding a slice of pie out of the pan in the display case. With a wink, she pushed both in front of him.

‚ÄúOn the house.‚Äù

Mike‚Äôs hands trembled as he reached for the cup.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I just saw‚ÄîI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù He swallowed hard, an audible click in his throat. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I saw.‚Äù He stared down into the coffee.

‚ÄúIt was a man, but it wasn‚Äôt a man. It looked like a unicorn. It had this pulsing purple light, it looked like‚Ä¶‚Äù

Flo set her warm hands over his, steadying them. Her voice was gentle.

‚ÄúOh, hun,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou saw the Rider. You saw the Ghost Dick Rider.‚Äù

She slipped around the counter and eased onto the stool beside him, nodding with the kind of calm smile that said she‚Äôd heard it all before.

‚ÄúForty years ago, a few local kids thought it would be really funny to slap a rubber dick on some poor guy‚Äôs helmet as he rode down Route sixty-nine through town. It stuck there‚Äîreal solid‚Äîlike it was meant to be there. People say he lost control, crashed, and the rider and the bike went up in flames.

A body was never found, just a scorched patch of road, a burned-up old motorcycle, and the smell of melted latex. Ever since that day, he‚Äôs been out there‚Äîhaunting the highway, showing up here and there looking to mark people.‚Äù

Her voice lowered.

‚ÄúAnd if you see him‚Ä¶‚Äù She reached out and gave Mike‚Äôs hand a squeeze. ‚Äú‚Ä¶you could be marked as well.‚Äù

She let go and poured herself a coffee, the spoon clinking against the cup as she stirred in sugar and cream. For a moment, the diner was filled only with the jukebox and the crack of pool balls.

Mike wet his lips, staring at her. Finally, he asked, his voice tight and uncertain:

‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶ marked?‚Äù

Flo sipped her coffee and fixed her eyes on Mike.

‚ÄúHun, people who cross his path sometimes will wake up the next day‚Ä¶ changed. Different. Some report strange dreams, some report phantom burn marks, some say they‚Äôll find tire tracks scorched into their lawns.‚Äù

She leaned in closer to Mike and tapped her coffee cup with her perfectly manicured nail.

‚ÄúOne guy claims his mirror melted clean off, another? A tramp-stamp tattoo appeared the next day, claims he never got it!‚Äù

She lowered her voice, leaning even closer to Mike. ‚ÄúIf he gets close enough to you, he will leave something behind.‚Äù

Flo reached into her apron and pulled out a dusty old Blackberry. She tapped a few buttons on it, and the screen popped to life.

‚ÄúStill works,‚Äù she said with a smile. ‚ÄúThere used to be a GeoCities page for him. Folks across the world would upload photos of their‚Ä¶ marks.‚Äù

She turned the screen toward Mike, and a gallery of blurry low-res images loaded slowly: a scorched jean jacket, a melted Ontario license plate, and a blurry lower-back tattoo shaped vaguely like a flaming dong.

Flo tapped the screen. ‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs from a guy in Fredericton. Said he passed out in an Irving parking lot and woke up with that.‚Äù

The last one was an old Polaroid image, scanned by a user named‚Äî

‚ÄúDong Quest 69?‚Äù Mike said incredulously, scoffing. ‚ÄúSure, Flo. That‚Äôs a reliable source.‚Äù

Flo shrugged and put the Blackberry back in her apron. ‚ÄúFunny name or not, hun, that photo‚Äôs been floating around long before the internet.‚Äù She sipped her coffee and patted Mike on the cheek.

‚ÄúThe truth is out there, baby cakes. You saw it. So did all the people posting on 69legends.geocities.com/dickRider. You can accept it,‚Äù she shrugged, ‚Äúor you can deny it‚Äîwhatever gets you through the night.‚Äù

She swallowed her last gulp of coffee and stood up. ‚ÄúEnjoy the pie and the coffee, hun,‚Äù she said with a smile. She reached into her apron and pulled out a business card, setting it down on the counter beside Mike‚Äôs cup.

The lights buzzed above Mike, the jukebox crackled out a Tommy Hunter song, and for a moment Mike hesitated before picking up the card and putting it in his pocket. He pulled a couple of crumpled five-dollar bills out of his pocket, throwing one on the counter before he left through the front door.",1,1756234748.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

I know that black is your favourite colour, even though you look better in blue. I know you're stubborn to a fault, hate love songs, love your father, believe in strange superstitions, respect your family despite the crap they've put you through, and always need something sweet after dinner.

I know when you're stressed, when you're tired, or upset. I know when you're happy, or frustrated, or focused. I know you are a light sleeper. I know you're lazier than any person has a right to be.

Most days, I know you better than I know my own heart.

Why won't this stop though? I firmly believed that the better you knew someone, the harder it was to love them. 

Why do you keep getting easier to love?

Why is your smile still the most beautiful thing in the known universe?

Why is your voice still the only sound that will quiet the demons in my head?

Why is a day only a good day when I've seen your stupid face?

I hate this, you know?

I wait by the phone all day for your texts. I smile like a fool when I'm talking to you, or about you, and I don't even realise it.

I hate it.

And then you come home every night.
And you eat the food I make, and spill forth more praises than I know I'm worthy of.
And you tell me silly stories that make me laugh through my tears.
And you say my name like it's something sacred that you're privileged enough to hold in your mouth.

And my heart stalls, and my breathe hitches, and I simply cannot ignore it anymore.

And I can't simply say ""I love you"".
That seems too small a sentiment.

We met on a queer dating app. She said she is demisexual, needs an emotional bond first, and wants to start platonically. I am demisexual too so that was fine. We met four times, each date lasted 5+ hours (coffee, movie, picnic with a romantic view, dinner and a walk). She texts me first thing in the morning and often late at night. It feels like I am her first and last thought of the day.
Her behavior confuses me. She sends Instagram reels where the first slide is neutral but later slides are romantic quotes. She sends songs with emotional lyrics that feel like hidden messages. She takes care of small details about me (switching walking sides, avoiding things I dislike) and even suggested a code word for when we cannot or it's hard for us to show emotions. When I pulled away once, it seemed to trigger her abandonment fear and she anxiously quickly reached out again.
So I do not know: is she actually developing feelings but too scared to show them, or is this just intense platonic attachment? For anxiously attached people: does this sound familiar?

1n0uhn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/1n0uhn3/welli_finished/,Well...I finished,"I finished my first watch through of girls and I can't help but feel very mournful. Here are a few observations and discussion points in no particular order - 

- I wish we got more resolution from some of the other characters. I know it was Hannah's story ultimately but it felt like we were missing conclusions from Ray, Shoshanna, Adam, Jessa, Elijah. We went from following these characters even when they were pretty far outside of Hannah's world to only seeing their conclusions as it related to Hannah's direct experience. 

- Marnie got infinitely worse as the series went on. We can all agree that most characters were awful but she felt particularly bad at the end. From completely bouncing after she realized Charlie was on drugs to again neglecting Desi when he was suffering from addiction to finally making Hannah's baby and breastfeeding journey all about her. It elt really hard to sympathize with her at all in the last couple seasons.

- I actually sympathized with Jessa more than Marnie in the last couple seasons and didn't mind her getting with Adam. The thing that really bothered me though is how insistent Jessa was that the movie be told through her perspective of Adam and Hannah's relationship. I think it's the next episode when Jessa goes to Hannah and essentially begs her to be her friend again. The girls seriously cannot make up their mind. 

- Speaking of not being able to make up their mind, I wish Shoshanna stayed in Japan. It felt not very well thought out that she started a romance with Yoshi and made a huge deal about not wanting to go back to the United States only to (I think in the next episode) not want to be with Yoshi at all and only can think about returning home. I do get that they were going for a duality within her mind because she does seem conflicted when she arrives at the airport. I just think it would have been fitting to have her stay in Japan and create a new life for herself then. She understandably is over the friendship dynamic, yet still invites everyone but Hannah to her engagement party. I think she's going to be captive to these relationships for the foreseeable future. 

- Ray should have gotten a visit from Hannah when she was deciding if she should move out of New York. I was so confused how the relationship just seemed to fall apart towards the end. Was it the van bl0w job? It feels like they are brother and sister (and Ray even calls Hannah his little sister at one point) but then his role gets pushed to the very side. He deserved more of a conclusion then just getting with Shoshana's old boss. And I'm not just saying that because him and Elijah taking nude pictures of Hannah in the coffee shop was one of my favorite scenes ever.

But yeah...great show. I started watching after giving ""Too Much"" a watch and now feel like I should rewatch that show just to see Elijah and Hannah cosplaying as parents.

Everyone around me says life basically goes downhill after 25, and honestly that thought crushes me because I feel like I‚Äôve already messed up every area of my life before even hitting 30.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:

* I‚Äôm still a virgin, never gotten a match on a dating app, and never dated.
* I am unemployed currently living at home; almost 300lbs overweight at 5'6
* In college I did go to parties and tried to socialize, but I was overweight, ugly, and had no self-confidence so nothing ever happened.
* I can talk to women just fine, but I‚Äôve never had ‚Äúgame‚Äù and I feel unattractive.
* I‚Äôd love to date and have sex so much but two weeks ago I even tried seeing a prostitute and ended up robbed with nothing in return.
* On Hinge, I‚Äôve even offered money (up to $2k for just a coffee date in public) and still get no responses.
* I‚Äôm starting to accept that being a virgin at this age might mean I‚Äôll never get that experience. At this point, even just getting to know a girl would feel like a blessing. I don‚Äôt even care if I‚Äôm cheated on or treated badly  I just want to know what it feels like to be wanted.

**At the same time, I‚Äôm trying to do things to rebuild:**

* **I left a toxic healthcare job and am trying to pivot my career.**
* **I‚Äôm in therapy and working with a career coach.**
* **I‚Äôm doing CrossFit 5 days a week.**
* **I‚Äôve started GED tutoring to keep myself busy and give back.**

But still, most days I feel worthless and lost. I hear ‚Äújust put yourself out there‚Äù but nothing has worked.

So I want to ask:

* For those of you who hit 30 (or later) and felt like you were at rock bottom ‚Äî how did you rebuild?
* What helped you keep going when you felt like you had no hope?
* Is there really a chance life can turn around in your 30s, or is it just too late for someone like me?

¬† 1  
  
¬† THE MAN IN THE RAIN  
  
¬† slicker walked slightly bent over, his breathing labored and his body sweaty. The extra weight he was bearing, though not all that substantial, was awkwardly placed, and the terrain was uneven. It was never an easy thing to tote a dead body through the woods in the middle of the night. He shifted the corpse to his left shoulder and trudged on. The soles of his shoes bore no distinguishing marks; not that it would have mattered, since the rain quickly washed away any traces of footprints. He‚Äôd checked the forecast; the rain was why he was here. The inclement weather was the best friend he could ask for.  
  
¬† Aside from the dead body draped over his sturdy shoulder, the man was also remarkable for the black hood he wore, on which was stitched an esoteric symbol that ran down the length of the cloth. It was a circle with crosshairs through its middle. Probably instantly recognizable to anyone over the age of fifty, the logo once inspired a dread that had significantly eroded with time. It didn‚Äôt matter that no one ‚Äúalive‚Äù would see him wearing the hood; he took grim satisfaction in its lethal symbolism.  
  
¬† Within ten minutes he‚Äôd reached the location he‚Äôd carefully selected on an earlier visit, and laid the body down with a reverence that belied the violent manner in which the person had died. He took a deep breath and held it as he undid the telephone wire holding the bundle closed, and unwrapped the plastic. She was young with features that had been attractive two days prior; the woman was not much to look at now. The soft blond hair fell away from the greenish-tinged skin, revealing closed eyes and bloated cheeks. Had the eyes been open, they might have still held the startled gaze of the deceased as she endured her own murder, an experience replicated roughly thirty thousand times each year in America.  
  
¬† He slid the plastic all the way free and laid the woman on her back. Then he let out his breath, fought the urge to retch caused by the stench of the body, and sucked in another lungful of air. Using one of his gloved hands and his light, he searched for and found the small, forked branch that he‚Äôd earlier placed in the bramble nearby. He used this to support the woman‚Äôs forearm, which he‚Äôd positioned such that it was pointing to the sky. The body‚Äôs rigor mortis, though rapidly fading, had made the task difficult, but he was strong and had finally levered the stiffened limb to the correct angle. He took the watch out of his pocket, checked with his flashlight to make sure it was set properly, and placed it around the dead woman‚Äôs wrist.  
  
¬† Though far from a religious man, he knelt over the body and muttered a brief prayer, cupping his hand over his mouth and nose as he did so.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt directly responsible, but you were all I had. You didn‚Äôt die in vain. And I believe you‚Äôre actually better off.‚Äù Did he really believe what he had just said? Maybe not. Maybe it didn‚Äôt matter.  
  
¬† He looked at the dead woman‚Äôs face, studying her features scrupulously as though a scientist observing a particularly fascinating experiment. He had never killed another person before. He‚Äôd made it quick and, he hoped, painless. In the dull, misty night the woman seemed surrounded by a yellowish glow, as though she‚Äôd already become a spirit.  
  
¬† He drew farther back and examined the area all around, checking for any extraneous items that might lead to evidence against him. He discovered only a piece of cloth from his hood that had caught on a bush near where the body lay. Careless, you can‚Äôt afford that. He placed it in his pocket. He spent several more minutes looking for other such items nearing microscopic size.  
  
¬† In the world of criminal investigation it was these forensic ‚Äúno-see-ums‚Äù that did one in. A single drop of blood, semen or saliva, a smudge of fingerprint, a hair follicle with a bit of DNA-littered root attached, and the police could be reading you your rights while prosecutors circled hungrily nearby. Unfortunately, even full awareness of that reality offered little protection. Every criminal, no matter how careful, left potentially incriminating material at the crime scene. Thus, he‚Äôd taken great care to have no direct physical contact with the dead woman as though she were an infectious agent that could cause a fatal disease.  
  
¬† He rolled up the plastic and pocketed the telephone cord, checked the watch once more and then slowly made his way back to his car.  
  
¬† Behind him lay the dead woman, her hand upraised to the watery heavens. Her watch was slightly luminous in the dark and made a dull beacon for her new resting place. She wouldn‚Äôt remain undiscovered for long. Dead bodies aboveground rarely did, even in places as isolated as this.  
  
¬† As he drove off, the hooded man used his finger to trace the symbol on his hood, making the sign of the cross at the same time. The crosshairs symbol also appeared on the face of the watch he‚Äôd placed on the dead woman‚Äôs wrist. That should certainly get a rise out of them. He took a breath full of excitement as well as dread. For years he had imagined that this day would never come. For years his courage had faltered. Now that the first step had been taken, he felt a great sense of empowerment and liberation.  
  
¬† He shifted into third gear and sped up, his tires grabbing the slicked roadway and holding firm as the darkness swallowed up the lights of his blue VW. He wanted to get to where he was going as fast as possible.  
  
¬† He had a letter to write.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† MICHELLE MAXWELL  
  
¬† picked up her pace. She‚Äôd completed the ‚Äúflat‚Äù portion of her run through the hills around Wrightsburg, Virginia, sequestered southwest of Charlottesville, Virginia; the terrain would now grow much steeper. Maxwell was a former Olympic rower who‚Äôd subsequently spent nine intense years in the Secret Service. Consequently, the five-foot-ten-inch woman was in remarkable physical shape. However, an enormous high-pressure system had parked over the entire mid-Atlantic, making this spring day unusually humid, and her muscles and lungs were beginning to strain as she headed up an incline. A quarter of the way through her run she‚Äôd put her shoulder-length black hair into a ponytail, though stubborn strands still found their way into her face.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd left the Secret Service to start a private investigation firm in this small Virginia town, partnering with another former Secret Service agent, Sean King. King had left the Service under a dark cloud but had become an attorney and forged a new life in Wrightsburg. The two hadn‚Äôt known each other while working for Uncle Sam; rather, they‚Äôd teamed up on a case the previous year while Michelle was still in the Service and King had become embroiled in a series of local murders. After bringing that matter to a successful conclusion and gaining some notoriety in the process Michelle had suggested they start their own firm, and King, somewhat reluctantly, had agreed. With the reputation they‚Äôd gained from the previous case, and their skills as investigators, the business had quickly become a success. There had come a lull in the work, though, for which Michelle was grat  
eful. She was an outdoors woman, and she got as much satisfaction out of camping or running a marathon as she did busting counterfeiters or putting the clamps on a corporate spy.  
  
¬† The woods were quiet save for the rustling branches from a moisture-laden breeze that was conjuring miniature cyclones from last winter‚Äôs dead leaves. However, the sudden crack of tree branches caught Michelle‚Äôs attention. She‚Äôd been told that the occasional black bear could be spotted around here, but if she did encounter an animal, it was far more likely to be a deer, squirrel or fox. She thought nothing more of it, although she took comfort in the pistol riding in the clip holster attached to her fanny pack belt. As a Secret Service agent she‚Äôd never gone anywhere without her gun, not even the toilet. One never knew where a nine-millimeter SIG and fourteen rounds might come in handy.  
  
¬† Moments later another sound caught her attention and kept it: running feet. In her Secret Service days Michelle had heard many types of running feet. Most had been innocuous; others signaled a darker purpose: stealth, attack or panic. She wasn‚Äôt sure how to classify this one yet: good, bad or out of shape. She slowed her pace a little, using her hand to shield her eyes from the sunlight breaking through the tree canopies. For a few seconds there was dead silence, then the sounds of rushing feet returned, now much closer. Okay, what she was hearing was clearly not the measured pace of a jogger. There was a level of fear in the rushed and unsteady-sounding footfalls. Off to her left now, it seemed, but she couldn‚Äôt be sure. Sound tended to whipsaw here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù she called out, even as her hand reached down and took out her pistol. She didn‚Äôt expect an answer and didn‚Äôt get one. She chambered a round but kept the safety on. As with scissors, one should avoid running with a loaded gun while the safety was off. The sounds kept coming; it was human feet certainly. She glanced behind her; this might be a setup. It could be done in pairs: one to draw her attention while the other got the jump on her. Well, if so, they were going to be very sorry they chose to pick on her.  
  
¬† She stopped now as she finally locked on the sound‚Äôs source: it was to the right, above the knoll directly in front of her. The breathing was accelerated; the rush of legs, the crashing of underbrush, seemed frenetic. In another few seconds whoever it was would have to clear the rim of dirt and rock.  
  
¬† Michelle slipped off her gun‚Äôs safety and took up position behind a wide oak tree. Hopefully, it was only another jogger, and the person wouldn‚Äôt even be aware of her armed presence. Dirt and pebbles shot out over the edge of the knoll heralding the arrival of the source of all the commotion. Michelle braced herself, both hands glued around her pistol grips, ready if necessary to put a bullet between someone‚Äôs pupils.  
  
¬† A young boy burst out from the top of the knoll, was suspended in space for an instant and then with a scream tumbled down the slope. Before he hit bottom another boy, a little older, came into view at the knoll‚Äôs crest but caught himself in time and merely slid down the slope on his butt, flopping next to his companion.  
  
¬† Michelle would have thought they were just horsing around, except for the look of utter terror etched on both their faces. The younger one was sobbing, his face streaked with dirt and tears. The older boy pulled him up by the scruff of his shirt, and they took off running, both their faces crimson with accelerated blood flow.  
  
¬† Michelle holstered her gun, stepped out from behind the tree and held up her hand. ‚ÄúBoys, stop!‚Äù  
  
¬† The pair screamed and shot around on either side of her in a blur. She spun around, grabbed for one but missed. She called after them, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? I want to help you!‚Äù  
  
¬† For an instant she contemplated sprinting after them, but despite her Olympian background, it wasn‚Äôt certain she could catch two young boys whose feet were apparently jet-fueled by sheer fright. She turned back around and looked toward the top of the knoll. What could have scared them that badly? She quickly altered her line of thinking. Or who could have? She looked once more in the direction of the fleeing boys. Then she turned back and cautiously made her way up in the direction the kids had come from. Okay, this is getting a little dicey. She thought about using her cell phone to call for help but decided to check things out first. She didn‚Äôt want to call the cops in only to discover the boys had been spooked by a bear.  
  
¬† At the top of the knoll she easily found the path the two had used. She slipped through the narrow trail erratically carved by their frantic flight. It ran for about a hundred feet and then opened into a small clearing. From here the path was less certain, but then she spotted the piece of cloth dangling on the lower branch of a dogwood, and she made her way through this cleft in the forest. Fifty feet later she came to another clearing, this one larger, where a campfire had been doused.  
  
¬† She wondered if the boys had been camping here and indeed been frightened by some animal. And yet they‚Äôd had no camping gear on them, and there was none here in the clearing. And the fire didn‚Äôt look all that recent. No, something else is going on.  
  
¬† In an instant the direction of the wind changed and drove the smell deep into her nostrils. She gagged, and her eyes assumed their own level of panic. She‚Äôd experienced that unmistakable smell before.  
  
¬† It was putrefied flesh. Human flesh!  
  
¬† Michelle pulled her tank shirt up and over her mouth and nose, trying to breathe in the stink of her own sweat rather than the rank odor of a decomposing body. She made her way around the perimeter of the clearing. At 120 degrees on her mental compass she found it. Or her. In the brush that ran along the fringe of the clearing the hand was sticking up, like the dead woman was waving hello or in this case good-bye. Even from this distance Michelle could see that the greenish skin on the arm was slipping down off the bone. She scooted around to the upwind side of the body and took a replenishing breath.  
  
¬† She ran her gaze along the corpse but kept her gun ready. Though the stench from the body, its discoloration and the skin slippage showed the woman had been dead for quite some time, it could have been recently dumped here and the killer still nearby. Michelle had no desire to join the lady‚Äôs fate.  
  
¬† The sun was glinting off something on the woman‚Äôs wrist. Michelle drew closer and saw that it was a watch. She glanced down at her own watch; it was two-thirty. She sat back on her haunches, her nose cemented into her armpit. She called 911, calmly telling the dispatcher what she‚Äôd found and her location. After that she called Sean King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you recognize her?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think her own mother would know her, Sean.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way. Just stay on your guard. Whoever did it might come back to admire his handiwork. Oh, and Michelle?‚Äù said King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just start running on a treadmill?‚Äù  
  
¬† She clicked off, took up a position as far away from the body as she could while still keeping it in view, and maintained a sharp lookout. The nice day and endorphin-churning run in the beautiful foothills had suddenly taken on a grim veneer.  
  
¬† Funny how murder had a way of doing that.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† THE SMALL CLEARING WAS  
  
¬† seeing quite a bit of activity, all of it man-made. A wide area had been cordoned off with yellow police tape intertwined among the trees. A two-person forensics team was foraging for clues directly around the crime scene, analyzing things that seemed far too small to be of any significance. Others hovered over the body of the dead woman, while still others were threading their way through the surrounding woods and underbrush looking for items of interest and possibly the ingress and egress of the killer. One uniformed officer had photographed and then videotaped the entire scene. All the cops wore floater masks to guard against the stench, and yet one by one they took turns hustling into the woods to empty their stomachs.  
  
¬† It all looked very efficient and orderly, but for a seasoned observer it was clearly bad guy one, good guys naught. They were finding zip.  
  
¬† Michelle stood off a ways and watched. Next to her was Sean King, her partner in the private investigation firm of King &  
Maxwell. King was in his forties, three inches taller than the five-foot-ten Michelle, and had short dark hair graying at the temples. He was trim and broad-shouldered but had gimpy knees and a shoulder that a bullet had ripped into years ago during an arrest that had gone awry while he was working a forgery investigation as a Secret Service agent. He‚Äôd also once been a volunteer deputy police officer for Wrightsburg but had resigned, swearing off guns and law enforcement for the rest of his days.  
  
¬† Sean King had suffered through several tragedies in his life: a disgraceful end to his Secret Service career after a candidate he‚Äôd been guarding was assassinated right in front of him; a failed marriage and acrimonious divorce; and most recently, a plot to frame him for a series of local murders that had dredged up the painful details of his last days as a federal agent. These events had left King a very cautious man, unwilling to trust anyone, at least until Michelle Maxwell hurtled into his life. Though their relationship had started off on very rocky ground, she was now the one person he knew he could absolutely rely on.  
  
¬† Michelle Maxwell had started life at a dead run, streaking through college in three years, winning an Olympic silver medal in rowing and becoming a police officer in her native Tennessee before joining the Secret Service. Like King, her exit from the federal agency hadn‚Äôt been pleasant: she‚Äôd lost a protectee to an ingenious kidnapping scheme. It was the first time in her life she had failed at anything, and that debacle had nearly destroyed her. While investigating the kidnapping case she had met King. At first she‚Äôd taken an instant dislike to the man. Now, as his partner, she saw Sean King for what he was: the best pure investigative mind she had ever been associated with. And her closest friend.  
  
¬† Yet the two could not have been more different. While Michelle craved adrenaline highs and pushing her body to the limit with intensive, lung-and-limb-shocking physical activities, King preferred spending his leisure time hunting for appropriate wines to add to his collection, dabbling in owning the works of local artists, reading good books, as well as boating and fishing on the lake that his home backed to. He was an introspective man by nature; he liked to think things out thoroughly before taking action. Michelle tended to move at warp speed and let the pieces fall where they may. This partnership of supernova and steady glacier had somehow flourished.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid they find the boys?‚Äù she asked King.  
  
¬† He nodded. ‚ÄúI understand they were pretty traumatized.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTraumatized? They‚Äôll probably need therapy all the way through college.‚Äù  
  
¬† Michelle had already given a detailed statement to the local police, in the person of Chief Todd Williams. The chief‚Äôs hair had become noticeably whiter after her and King‚Äôs first adventure in Wrightsburg. Today his features held a resigned expression, as though murder and mayhem were now to be expected in his tiny hamlet. Michelle watched as a slender and attractive red-haired woman in her late thirties carrying a black satchel and a rape kit arrived on the scene, knelt down and started examining the body.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the deputy medical examiner assigned to this area,‚Äù King explained. ‚ÄúSylvia Diaz.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDiaz? She looks more like Maureen O‚ÄôHara.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGeorge Diaz was her husband. He was a very noted surgeon in the area. He was struck by a car and killed several years ago. Sylvia used to be a professor of forensic pathology at UVA. Now she‚Äôs a physician in private practice.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd a deputy M.E. on the side. Busy woman. Any children?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. I guess her work is her life,‚Äù said King.  
  
¬† Michelle put her hand up to her nose as the direction of the wind changed yet again, flinging the stench of the body directly at them. ‚ÄúSome life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGod, she isn‚Äôt even wearing a mask, and I‚Äôm about to hurl from back here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Twenty minutes later Diaz rose, spoke with the police, popped off her examination gloves and started snapping pictures of the body and surrounding area. Finished with that, she stowed her camera and started to walk away when she noticed King. She smiled warmly and headed toward them.  
  
¬† Michelle whispered, ‚ÄúAnd you forgot to tell me that you two dated?‚Äù  
  
¬† King looked at her surprised. ‚ÄúWe went out a few times a while back. How‚Äôd you know that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAfter spending close-up time with a dead body, you don‚Äôt get a smile like that unless there was a prior relationship.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks for the astute observation. But be nice. Sylvia‚Äôs really wonderful.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she was, but I don‚Äôt need to hear the details, Sean.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRest assured, you‚Äôll never hear the details while there‚Äôs breath in my body.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI see. You‚Äôre being quite the Virginia gentleman.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I just don‚Äôt want to be critiqued.‚Äù  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 4  
  
¬† SYLVIA DIAZ GAVE KING A  
  
¬† hug that lingered a bit past ‚Äúfriends‚Äù status, Michelle felt, and then King introduced the two women.  
  
¬† The deputy medical examiner looked at Michelle with what the latter perceived as an unfriendly gaze.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in a while, Sean,‚Äù Sylvia said, turning back to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd been swamped with investigative work, but things have finally slowed down.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Michelle broke in, ‚Äúdo you have a cause of death on our corpse yet?‚Äù  
  
¬† Sylvia looked at her with a surprised expression. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really something I can discuss with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was just wondering,‚Äù said Michelle innocently, ‚Äúsince I happened to be one of the first on the scene. I guess you won‚Äôt know for sure until you do the post.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be doing the autopsy here, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù asked King.  
  
¬† Sylvia nodded. ‚ÄúYes, although suspicious deaths traditionally were sent over to Roanoke.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy no longer?‚Äù asked Michelle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere used to be four official facilities certified to conduct autopsies in the state: Fairfax, Richmond, Tidewater and Roanoke. However, due to the generosity of John Poindexter, a very wealthy man who was also a past Speaker of the House in the state General Assembly, we now have a certified forensics substation right here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStrange donation, a morgue,‚Äù said Michelle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPoindexter‚Äôs daughter was killed here years ago. Wrightsburg falls on the jurisdictional line between the medical examiner‚Äôs office in Richmond and the western district office in Roanoke. Because of that, there was a fight over which office would perform the autopsy. Roanoke finally won out, but during the transfer of the body the vehicle was involved in an accident, and vital evidence was lost or compromised. Consequently, the girl‚Äôs killer was never caught, and as you can imagine, her father was not very happy. When Poindexter died, his will left the money to build a state-of-the-art facility.‚Äù Sylvia glanced over her shoulder at the body. ‚ÄúBut even with a state-of-the-art facility the cause of death on this one might be tricky.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny idea on how long she‚Äôs been dead?‚Äù asked King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA lot depends on the individual, environmental factors and degree of decomposition. With a body dead this long the postmortem may give us some idea of a time frame, but that‚Äôs all.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI see some of the fingers have been chewed off,‚Äù said King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnimals, clearly.‚Äù Sylvia added thoughtfully, ‚ÄúBut still there should have been more signs of invasion. They‚Äôre trying to get an ID on her now.‚Äù  
  
¬† King said, ‚ÄúWhat do you make of the hand posed like that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAfraid that‚Äôs for the official detectives, not me. I just tell them how the victim died and collect any evidence during the post that might be useful. I played Sherlock Holmes when I first started doing this job, and I was quickly put in my place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with using your specialized knowledge to help solve a crime,‚Äù commented Michelle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think so, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Sylvia paused and said, ‚ÄúI can tell you that the arm was braced up by the stick and that it was done deliberately. Beyond that, I‚Äôm out of ideas.‚Äù She turned to King. ‚ÄúIt was good to see you again, even if it was under these circumstances.‚Äù She put out her hand to Michelle, who shook it.  
  
¬† As the woman walked off, Michelle said, ‚ÄúI thought you said you used to date.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe did. It‚Äôs been over a year now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure she got the message.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI really appreciate the insight. Maybe you can read my palm next. You ready to go? Or do you want to finish your run?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, but I‚Äôve had enough stimulation for one day.‚Äù  
  
¬† As they passed close by the body, King stopped and stared at the hand that was still pointing to the sky, his face suddenly tense.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Michelle asked, watching him closely.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe watch,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† She glanced at it, now seeing that it was set to one o‚Äôclock and didn‚Äôt appear to be running. ‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMichelle, it‚Äôs a Zodiac watch.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúZodiac?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomething tells me we‚Äôre going to see this person‚Äôs work again,‚Äù said King.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 5  
  
¬† THE ISOLATED AREA ON A  
  
¬† bluff overlooking one of the main channels of thirty-mile-long Cardinal Lake had long been a favorite place for the teenagers in Wrightsburg to gather and perform a variety of acts their parents wouldn‚Äôt approve of. The night being overcast and drizzly with a wind rattling the trees, there was only one car parked up on the bluff, but the occupants were putting on an energetic show nonetheless.  
  
¬† The girl was already naked, her dress and undergarments folded neatly in the backseat next to her shoes. The young man was frantically trying to pull his shirt over his head while the girl was undoing his pants; it was tough going in the cramped quarters. The shirt finally came off about the time his pants and underwear were ripped down by the hard-breathing young lady, for whom patience, at least under these circumstances, was clearly not a virtue.  
  
¬† He slid toward the middle of the front seat after putting on a condom, and she climbed astride him, facing him. The windows of the car were fogging up now. Over her shoulder he stared out the windshield, his own breath growing faster as he closed his eyes. It was his first time, though his partner appeared far more experienced. He‚Äôd been dreaming of this moment for at least two years, his hormones building to levels of utter agony. He smiled as she moaned and rocked on top of him.  
  
¬† Then he opened his eyes and stopped smiling.  
  
¬† The figure in the black hood stared back at him through the windshield. Through the thickening condensation on the glass he saw the shotgun muzzle come up. He started to throw the girl off him, instinctively thinking he would start the car and get out of here. He never made it. The glass exploded inward. The impact of the buckshot against her back slammed the girl into him, yet her body shielded him. Still  
the collision with her head broke his nose, almost knocking him out. Awash in her blood but as yet not critically wounded, he clutched the dead body against his chest, as though it were a cherished security blanket capable of warding off the bogeyman. He wanted to scream yet couldn‚Äôt. He finally let the girl go as he slid toward the driver‚Äôs side. His movements were clumsy, his mind clouded. Had he been shot? He didn‚Äôt know it but he was suffering from shock, his rapidly rising and falling blood pressure dragging his body through levels of stress it wasn‚Äôt designed for.  
  
¬† He started to turn the key in the ignition when the driver‚Äôs side door opened and there was the black hood again. As he stared helplessly, the shotgun muzzle glided at him like the deadliest snake in the world. The boy started to beg and then to cry, the blood pouring from his destroyed nose. He inched back away from the gunman, until he bumped against the girl‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù he wailed. ‚ÄúNo, God, no!‚Äù  
  
¬† The nine pellets of the shotgun blast hit him in the head with the collective force of a gigantic hammer, and he fell next to the dead girl. The front of her was unmarked; however, the other side was obliterated. Looking at the girl lying there on her back, one couldn‚Äôt tell what had killed the young woman. The cause of death of her boyfriend was far more obvious, considering he no longer had a face.  
  
¬† The killer leaned his shotgun against the car‚Äôs passenger side, opened the door and reached in. He placed a watch on the young man‚Äôs wrist, bracing the arm up against the dash, finally wedging it between the dash and the door. Next he fiddled with the watch that the dead girl was already wearing. Then he pulled off the cheap amethyst ring the girl had on and put it in his pocket. He lifted a St. Christopher‚Äôs medal from around the young man‚Äôs neck. That also went into the hooded man‚Äôs pocket.  
  
¬† Over the boy‚Äôs body he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre not personally guilty, but you were part of the original sin. You didn‚Äôt die in vain. You righted a long-overdue wrong. Take comfort in that.‚Äù  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt bother praying over the girl. He took an object from his pocket and laid it on the floor of the car, shut the door and lumbered off. As the rain came in through the shattered windshield, the two dead and naked young people seemed to be clinging to each other.  
  
¬† On the floorboard was the object the killer had placed there.  
  
¬† It was a dog collar.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 6  
  
¬† CHIEF WILLIAMS STOPPED  
  
¬† by the offices of King & Maxwell located in a two-story brick townhouse in the heart of the small yet posh Wrightsburg downtown. The offices had housed King‚Äôs law practice before he‚Äôd taken down his legal shingle. The chief sat with his hat in his lap, eyes puffy and features strained as he filled in King and Michelle on the grisly double homicide.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI left the police force in Norfolk so I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this sort of crap,‚Äù Williams began. ‚ÄúMy ex-wife got me to move here for the peace and quiet. Damn, was that woman wrong! No wonder we got divorced.‚Äù  
  
¬† King handed him a cup of coffee and then sat down across from him, while Michelle remained perched on the edge of a leather couch. ‚ÄúWait‚Äôll the papers get hold of this one. And poor Sylvia. She‚Äôd just finished the autopsy on that girl, and then she had to do two more.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho were they?‚Äù asked King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStudents at Wrightsburg High School: Steve Canney and Janice Pembroke. She was shot in the back; he took it full in the face. Buckshot. When I opened that car door, it cost me my breakfast. Hell, I‚Äôll be seeing them in my sleep for months.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo witnesses?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot that we know of. It was a rainy night. Theirs were the only tire tracks up there.‚Äù  
  
¬† Michelle perked up. ‚ÄúRight, it was raining. So if you didn‚Äôt see any tire tracks, the killer must have walked up to the car. You didn‚Äôt find any traces of that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMost everything was washed away. There was an inch of bloody water on the floor of the car. Steve Canney was one of the most popular kids in school, football star and everything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd the girl?‚Äù asked Michelle.  
  
¬† Williams hesitated. ‚ÄúJanice Pembroke had a reputation with the boys.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs being‚Ä¶ accessible?‚Äù asked King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWas anything taken? Could it have been a robbery?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot likely, although two things were missing: a cheap ring Pembroke usually wore and Canney‚Äôs St. Christopher‚Äôs medal. We don‚Äôt know if the killer took them or not.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou said Sylvia finished the autopsies. I‚Äôm assuming you attended them.‚Äù  
  
¬† Williams looked embarrassed. ‚ÄúI had a little problem halfway through Jane Doe‚Äôs post, and I got tied up while she was doing the other autopsies. I‚Äôm waiting on Sylvia‚Äôs reports,‚Äù he added hastily. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an official homicide detective on the force, so I figured coming here and picking your brain wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny clues?‚Äù asked Michelle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot from the first killing. And we haven‚Äôt identified her yet either, though we were able to fingerprint her and we‚Äôre running those. We had a computerized facial composite done too, which we‚Äôre circulating.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny reason to believe the killings are connected?‚Äù asked Michelle.  
  
¬† Williams shook his head. ‚ÄúPembroke and Canney will probably turn out to be some love triangle thing. Kids these days will kill you in a second and think nothing of it. All the crap on TV they watch.‚Äù  
  
¬† King and Michelle exchanged glances and then he said, ‚ÄúIn the first killing either the murderer lured the woman into the woods or forced her to go with him. Or he killed her elsewhere and then carried her into the woods.‚Äù  
  
¬† Michelle nodded. ‚ÄúIf the latter, a strong man, then. With the killing of the teenagers the person might have followed them there or been waiting on the bluff.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, that area is well known as a make-out place, if they still even call it that,‚Äù said Williams. ‚ÄúBoth victims were naked. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking it was maybe some boy Pembroke dumped or a kid who was jealous of Canney. The Jane Doe in the woods will be the harder one to crack. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going to need your help.‚Äù  
  
¬† King looked thoughtful for a moment and then said, ‚ÄúThe watch in the first murder, did you really notice it, Todd?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, it seemed a little bulky for the girl.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSylvia said the arm the watch was on was deliberately braced up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt know that for sure.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI saw that the watch was set to one o‚Äôclock,‚Äù continued King.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight, but it had stopped, or the stem was pulled out.‚Äù  
  
¬† King glanced at Michelle. ‚ÄúDid you notice the make of the watch?‚Äù  
  
¬† Williams looked at him curiously. ‚ÄúMake of the watch?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was a Zodiac watch: circle with crosshairs.‚Äù  
  
¬† Williams almost spilled his coffee. ‚ÄúZodiac!‚Äù  
  
¬† King nodded. ‚ÄúIt was also a man‚Äôs watch. I think the killer put it on the woman.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúZodiac,‚Äù repeated Williams. ‚ÄúAre you saying‚Ä¶?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe original Zodiac serial killer operated in 1968 and 1969 in the Bay Area, San Fran and Vallejo,‚Äù answered King. ‚ÄúI think that Zodiac would be a little long in the tooth. But there have been at least two Zodiac copycat killers, one in New York and another in Kobe, Japan. The San Fran Zodiac wore a black executioner‚Äôs hood emblazoned with white crosshairs in a circle, the same symbol that‚Äôs on the Zodiac watch. He also left a watch on his last victim, a cabdriver, if I recall correctly, although it wasn‚Äôt a Zodiac. However, the man suspected of being the Zodiac in San Francisco owned a Zodiac watch. They believe that‚Äôs where he got the idea for the crosshairs-in-a-circle logo he wore that earned him his nickname. The case has never been solved.‚Äù  
  
¬† Williams hunched forward in his chair. ‚ÄúLook, this is all really speculation on your part, and quite a stretch at that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Michelle glanced at her partner. ‚ÄúSean, do you really think it‚Äôs a copycat killer?‚Äù  
  
¬† King shrugged. ‚ÄúIf two people copied the original, who‚Äôs to say  
a third person couldn‚Äôt? The San Francisco Zodiac wrote to the newspapers in code‚Äîone that was finally broken. The coded letters revealed that the killer was motivated by a short story titled ‚ÄòThe Most Dangerous Game.‚Äô It‚Äôs a story about hunting humans.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA game about hunting humans?‚Äù Michelle said slowly.  
  
¬† King asked, ‚ÄúDid either of the bodies in the car have a watch on?

I‚Äôve been frustrated watching people pay $15+/month for book summary apps that offer fewer than 10,000 titles. So I built something different.

What I built:
	‚Ä¢	209,000+ book summaries (yes, really)
	‚Ä¢	21 languages available
	‚Ä¢	3 reading speeds: 3-min (key takeaways), 6-min (highlights), or 10-min (comprehensive)
	‚Ä¢	Focus on non-fiction (business, self-help, psychology, history, science), but we also have an extensive fiction catalogue

The problem I‚Äôm solving:
The average person reads 12 books per year, but there are millions of valuable books out there. Most non-fiction books have 1-2 core concepts stretched across 300 pages. My platform distills these insights so you can learn from a book during your coffee break instead of spending 8+ hours reading. It can also be used as a tool to discover what books you want to fully read. 

Why I think this is different:
	‚Ä¢	Blinkist: ~6,500 books, $99/year
	‚Ä¢	Headway: ~1,500 books, $90/year
	‚Ä¢	Instaread: ~5,000 books, $96/year
	‚Ä¢	MinuteReads: 209,000+ books, $69/year or for a limited time $179 for lifetime subscription

Current status:
MVP is live. It‚Äôs rough around the edges but functional. I‚Äôm a solo developer and know there are bugs to squash and features to add.

I need your help:
	‚Ä¢	What breaks when you use it?
	‚Ä¢	Which features are missing that would make this actually useful for you?
	‚Ä¢	What books do you want summarized that aren‚Äôt there?
	‚Ä¢	Is the UI confusing anywhere?
	‚Ä¢	Would you actually use this? Why or why not?

1n0u923,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n0u923/some_days_i_hate_everything/,Some days I hate everything,"I 43f 4 years ago was diagnosed with heart valve disease. I was told at the time it was minor and they didn‚Äôt see any need for surgical intervention or medication just changes in diet and exercise. Great! I changed the way I ate I started going to the gym 4 times a week, something I‚Äôve never done in my life. At the time I was going through a divorce that caused my adult kids to stay away from both of us. I was alone and not in a good place mentally either. Over the years I‚Äôve managed to land my dream job, find an amazing man that treats me better than anyone ever has and he actually loves me, I have all of my kids back, and I have my best friend my dog. This summer I wasn‚Äôt feeling well I started getting really tired like to the point I felt like I was gonna pass out. I was getting lightheaded, nauseous, muscle cramping, and short of breath. At my regular appointment I bring it up to the cardiologist so they recommend some further tests because up till this point I had been doing great no changes in my condition or symptoms. So fast forward and I get an echo done. The doctor calls and tells me that the valve has gotten worse and is no longer listed as mild but instead severe and he needs to refer me to the structural heart team because there are also 2 other valves weakening and the left side isn‚Äôt pumping fully. This crushes me. After a couple of weeks they recommend medication. On that medication you know that long list of side effects they say are rare well I had all of them. While we are testing medication meanwhile it‚Äôs my first week at my new job. I have dreamt of this job my whole life and I finally have it. Some days I‚Äôm sweating from the medication or I‚Äôm so sick that I am sure they can all tell I‚Äôm not right. I‚Äôm also getting calls from the doc office about tests needed and the side effects. Finally they changed my meds and it made a huge difference. Because of the severity of everything they essentially decided I need open heart surgery. I went into panic about losing my dream job and how am I gonna do this as a single lady on my own with a dog. Luckily I work for the same company I was just promoted so I am protected by FMLA. My boyfriend of 3 years offered to live with me and care for me and my kids offered to pitch in. So I found all of this out the last week of June and it‚Äôs now late August. Since I found out I‚Äôve had a TEE, my blood drawn 12 times, 5 doctors visits, and numerous calls with nurses, doctors and schedulers. My bf took me to the TEE and took great care of me while I recovered. On September 3rd I have my heart catheter scheduled for mapping so a few weeks after that I should be in for surgery. The reason that some days I hate everything is because while I am going through all this my bf shares custody of his kids with his ex. I‚Äôve been hanging around him and his kids for almost a year now and they live with the two of us part time now for a month. My bf has been divorced the same amount of time as me but every so often his ex will try to guilt him into coming back. So after he told her he couldn‚Äôt help her on one her days because I had an appointment he had to be at (that she kept prying into so he told her about my condition) she started this why do you love her instead of me we have history and kids together. I need closure can we meet for coffee stuff. So while I‚Äôm stressed about my new job, my health, and regular life, I now feel like she is trying to take him away from me. I already feel vulnerable because of what we are facing is enough to break up a lot of couples and will I still be attractive after they cut an 8 inch incision in my chest. There will also be over a month where we can‚Äôt be intimate. He reassures me he will never go there and he‚Äôs not leaving me for sure but I was married to a narcissist and I grew up in foster care, I have a hard time trusting people will stay when it gets hard. I‚Äôm sorry for the rant I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and my kids are my only family and I don‚Äôt wanna vent to them. I have always taken care of everyone else and everything on my own this is a huge change for me and I feel helpless. I‚Äôve gotten so sick that I can only stand to do about an hour of house work before I‚Äôm spent. Luckily everyone I mentioned has been helping and I‚Äôm learning to let them. Anyway if you‚Äôve made it this far thanks for reading my gripe I hope you have an amazing day.",1,1756233996.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

 I shall be making gamebook and branching narrative adventure full playthrough videos with no edited out bits,  monetisation, going on about coffee and bells, AI, or other shenanigans, as always. 

Just now, I'm halfway through trying to escape the delightful Dave Morris ' vampire lair, so shall crack on with that then see about doing the Warlock of Firetop Mountain in a double birthday collab lol.

¬† Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. The disturbing clatter whined inside Jaxon Tremain‚Äôs mind, playing without permission or welcome. He laughed bitterly. He didn‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôd been locked up in the dank little cell. A week? An eternity?  
  
¬† Perhaps an endless dirt nap loomed in his future. Yeah, undoubtedly. He should be glad. It would be another endless ticktocking, except there would be no pained awareness, no crazed waiting for death to‚Äîfinally? blessedly? regrettably?‚Äîcome.  
  
¬† Survived worst, he thought, trying to comfort himself.  
  
¬† Once, he‚Äôd been shot and burned with a pyre-gun. An accident during training, but his shoulder still bore the fire-seared scars. Another time, he‚Äôd been undercover, ratted out, then weighed down with steel beams and tossed into a muddy man-made river. Water and grime had filled his mouth, stinging like acid down his throat, into his lungs. When he‚Äôd miraculously fought his way free, he‚Äôd been surprised to find his skin still intact, muscle still glued to bones.  
  
¬† Once, he‚Äôd been stabbed in the kidney. A straight cut, all the way through, severing one of his favorite organs. Foolishly, he‚Äôd turned his back on a suspect one second too long and adios, old friend.  
  
¬† Sometimes that‚Äôs all that was needed. One second.  
  
¬† The words echoed in his mind. One second was a single tick. Or tock. He laughed again, but the laughter soon turned to gagging and the gagging to coughing, the coughing to choking pain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going insane,‚Äù he muttered when he calmed. Not that the words were understandable. ‚ÄúTickity, tockity, tickity, tockity. ‚Äù How many more were left for him?  
  
¬† Couldn‚Äôt be many.  
  
¬† Being an Alien Investigation and Removal agent for New Chicago certainly has its perks, he thought dryly. ‚ÄôCause when an agent needed help breaking his nasty breathing habit, he got help.  
  
¬† Since Jaxon‚Äôs abduction, a group of aliens had whaled on him so many times he‚Äôd lost count. They‚Äôd probably whale on him a thousand times more, fists flying at him in tune with that fucking clock. Tick, tock. Another laugh. Yep. Insane.  
  
¬† The otherworlders had beaten him because he‚Äôd refused to answer their questions. Even when screams had erupted inside his mind, loud and discordant, mortality in every pitch, he hadn‚Äôt caved. Remembering the screams, he shuddered. Perhaps all the men and women he‚Äôd killed over the years had risen up, their souls fused with his as they finally made themselves known, determined to be heard at last.  
  
¬† Now, at least, the screams were buried somewhere deep, replaced by that damn clock. A small price to pay, he supposed.  
  
¬† Unfortunately, his body‚Äôs suffering had only intensified.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd been punched in the mouth until his teeth shredded his gums. His tongue was the size of a baseball, so big he couldn‚Äôt even move it to ensure he was still the proud owner of all those pearly whites. His nose was broken, yet somehow the scent of urine still taunted him, blending with the metallic aroma of dried blood and sweat. His, a thousand others.  
  
¬† His eyes were swollen, leaving only tiny slits. Not that there was much to see. Murky darkness failed to live up to its promise of sweet oblivion, revealing four barred walls, a plastic-lined floor to better clean any gore, and old-fashioned metal chains that continually sliced into his wrists and ankles like razors.  
  
¬† Those chains rattled as he shifted to a more comfortable position against the bars. Big. Mistake. He winced as intense pain ripped through him; his air supply ground to a tormented halt. Several ribs were broken and any type of movement just cracked them farther apart and made inflating his lungs an impossible chore, hundreds of needle-sharp pricks cresting.  
  
¬† Concentrate on something else, something enjoyable. Well, there was a bone protruding through his left arm and his right ankle was snapped back so far it was a miracle his foot hadn‚Äôt fallen off. That was better, right?  
  
¬† Survived worse, he reminded himself. Dated Cathy Savan-Holt.  
  
¬† A stick banged against his cage.  
  
¬† Jaxon stiffened with the realization that he was no longer alone. His vision was blurred as he scanned the small enclosure, quickly landing on the intruder. Hate filled him. Hate‚Äîso helpless, a victim‚Äîfrustration and a twinge of fear.  
  
¬† The Delenseans had returned.  
  
¬† Not the party-loving race we always thought they were. Jaxon wondered if they‚Äôd come for interrogation or round eight of human pi√±ata. Maybe both. He‚Äôd noticed the six-armed bastards sometimes liked to multitask. Either way, Jaxon had probably reached the end of the line.  
  
¬† Bye-bye, breathing habit.  
  
¬† The other-worlders had to be tired of his lack of cooperation. They had to know his lips were sealed no matter what they did to him.  
  
¬† I led a good life. Kind of. As a trust-fund baby whose grandparents and parents had helped rebuild the city after the war and still had their fingers in several security businesses, he had more money than God, had traveled the world, and had friends who would die for him. Some already had. But he‚Äôd remained unattached to any semblance of home and hearth, distanced from nearly everything around him.  
  
¬† That distance seemed foolish now.  
  
¬† More banging. ‚ÄúScared?‚Äù a heavily accented voice taunted. Metal creaked against metal as the door opened.  
  
¬† Darkened as the cell was and swollen as his lids were, Jaxon could only make out a shadowy outline. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù He barely managed to work the words past his enlarged tongue, wasn‚Äôt even sure the bastard could understand him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you, been counting the minutes till you returned and all that shit. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou sound terrible. Like a drunk. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFuck you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow that I understood. ‚Äù A pause, a laugh. ‚ÄúYou know, you weren‚Äôt this brash when I followed you all those weeks. Undetected,‚Äù the alien added smugly. ‚ÄúYou were always so reserved, so stoic. Not a single curse ever passed your lips. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Yes, Jaxon was known for his patience and manners. He‚Äôd taught himself to exude both. Forced himself to exude both, actually. Sometimes he could even pretend the serenity came naturally, that he didn‚Äôt have to fight for it every second of every day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo explanation?‚Äù  
  
¬† About what? What had they been discussing? Oh, yeah. His lack of etiquette. ‚ÄúAmazing what having your toenails ripped off will do to a guy‚Äôs personality. ‚Äù Actually, this was the real him. The sarcasm he usually repressed, and the potty mouth he usually flushed before a single bad word could escape. Safer that way. For everyone. Right now, however, he didn‚Äôt give a shit what he acted like or what the consequences were. ‚ÄúWant me to show you? Prove it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTsk, tsk, tsk. ‚Äù Not a hint of anger laced the alien‚Äôs tone. He was too cocky for that, too assured of his power. ‚ÄúSo brazen you are. So foolish. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShoulda abducted Dallas, then. He‚Äôs the smart one. ‚Äù Under normal circumstances, Jaxon would never have uttered another agent‚Äôs name. But this group of Delenseans had been studying A. I. R. for weeks. Undetected, he inwardly mocked. They practically knew more than Jaxon. Everything from day-to-day operations at headquarters to where the agents lived and what their hobbies were.  
  
¬† They‚Äôd taunted him with the information. Chuckled like every word had been a gut-busting joke. Even now, there was a sound track of their jeers in his ears: Five o‚Äôclock sharp, Dallas arrives. He drinks a cup of coffee, talks to Kitty. Ghost shows up, usually eight minutes late. He has a new girlfriend and has trouble leaving her.  
  
¬† They‚Äôd been able to take Jaxon from his own home quickly, expertly. Easily. As he remembered, embarrassment heated his cheeks. What kind of agent allowed himself to be taken from home? Answer: a bad one. Now there was a joke.  
  
¬† No way could he have been prepared, though. Shockingly, the blue-skinned aliens had mastered mol  
ecular transport. Something humans hadn‚Äôt yet done, though they‚Äôd been working on it for a long time. Must be an innate ability of the race rather than technology. Still.  
  
¬† Mortifying how quickly he‚Äôd been taken by the unadvanced race. One minute Jaxon had been lounging on his couch, drinking beer and watching virtual play-offs, and the next three Delenseans surrounded him, grinning like they‚Äôd just received swallow-it-all blow jobs. The next, he‚Äôd been here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSleeping?‚Äù the alien asked, breaking the silence.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. Maybe you should go. Let me rest. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd maybe Dallas is already on my To Be Captured list. ‚Äù Again, the bastard sounded smug.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll love the accommodations. You‚Äôre such a good host, Deli. Maybe I‚Äôll invite you to my home sometime. Show you my toys. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Rather than rile him, Jaxon seemed to amuse him all the more. ‚ÄúCall me Thomas. We‚Äôre going to be on much more‚Ä¶intimate terms, you and I. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Jaxon didn‚Äôt have to rack his brain to interpret that little gem. Rape, the one thing they hadn‚Äôt done yet. Don‚Äôt give him a reaction. You slept with Cathy, remember. Nothing worse. ‚ÄúDeli, man. ‚Äù He was careful to enunciate every syllable, wanted the words understood. ‚ÄúHate to hurt your feelings, but you‚Äôre not my type. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The alien shrugged. ‚ÄúI will be soon enough, I‚Äôm sure. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He drew in a slow breath, held‚Ä¶held‚Äîgod, the pain‚Äîthen released it just as slowly. In, out. In‚Äîhe stilled, frowned. Thoughts of rape receded, drowned by an intoxicating awareness. What was that delicious fragrance? He inhaled again; his nostrils twitched. And then he knew.  
  
¬† The Delensean wasn‚Äôt alone.  
  
¬† The otherworlder emitted a whiskeylike scent, yet Jaxon smelled something sweet and heady. Something floral. His blood heated and his skin pulled tight. His stomach clenched. His shaft even twitched in its first show of interest since his imprisonment‚Äîand long before.  
  
¬† Jaxon blinked in surprise. Weak as he was, the reaction should have been impossible, yet his body was acting like the fragrance was laced with undiluted pheromones. That must mean‚Äî  
  
¬† Woman.  
  
¬† Human? Alien? Does it matter? Enemy, definitely.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd always enjoyed the scents women slathered over their bodies, but this one seemed so much more everything than anything else he‚Äôd ever encountered. The perfume was utterly feminine and wholly alluring, like a drug. Illegal. Enthralling. He could have basked in it for hours.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBrought you a present this time,‚Äù Thomas said. He chuckled, as if remembering another of his lame-ass jokes. ‚ÄúI hope you like her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† A second shadowy figure stepped around the other-worlder, not moving closer to Jaxon but staying at a distance so that she could most likely study him. A long moment thundered by in silence. He could tell that she was tall for a female. Probably five nine or five ten. Blonde, if the bright halo glowing around her head was any indication.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis eyes are practically sealed shut,‚Äù she said, her voice husky and rich. Sexy.  
  
¬† Jaxon‚Äôs blood heated another degree, shocking and angering him. What kind of moron lusted after his executioner? And there was no doubt in his mind that‚Äôs what she was. Why else would she be here? Tick, tock. A muscle under his eye spasmed. That annoying counting had begun yet again. Damn it. What would it take to get rid of it? Death?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that a problem?‚Äù Thomas asked her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know I like to see their eyes when I work. ‚Äù  
  
¬† This time, there was a princess-whine in her tone that might have been amusing in any other situation. She made him think of a little girl who‚Äôd asked Santa for a pony but had found a kitten under the tree instead. The kitten wasn‚Äôt what she‚Äôd wanted, so the kitten wouldn‚Äôt to be tolerated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy apologies, Marie,‚Äù Thomas said, and damn if he didn‚Äôt sound like he meant it. ‚ÄúThe agent provoked our wrath. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Sincere remorse from Thomas? Marie must frighten him. Interesting.  
  
¬† Marie sighed angrily and stretched a hand toward Thomas. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll discuss this later. Was he given a truth serum?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course. He told us his name was Minnie Mouse and he lived on Nightmare Lane. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTraining people to fight such drugs should be illegal,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúMy tools, please. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt speak; don‚Äôt you dare speak. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need any tools, honey. ‚Äù The words left on a determined burst, unstoppable, meaning to prove his fearlessness. But leaving it at that would have proven the opposite, so even though he wanted to remain silent, he purposefully added, ‚ÄúCome sit on my lap and I‚Äôll tell you everything you want to know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He expected her to gasp, to stomp over and slap him. Maybe part of him hoped to goad her into beginning whatever she had planned. Nothing was worse than waiting, not even the electric-shock nipple clamps they‚Äôd used earlier, and those had provided a bitch of a hurt.  
  
¬† Marie merely gave another of those pouting sighs and said to Thomas, ‚ÄúYes, I see what you mean. His attitude is quite maddening. Though that doesn‚Äôt excuse your behavior,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúYou invited me here. As your guest, I expect my desires to be heeded. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course. His face will not be touched again. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. What has he told you so far?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOutside the lies, nothing. No matter what we‚Äôve done to him,‚Äù Thomas said, obviously perplexed, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs told us nothing about the virus. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he knows nothing,‚Äù Jaxon muttered. Another lie, of course. He knew a lot more than even his boss assumed. And as Marie and Thomas muttered between themselves, some of the memories began flickering through Jaxon‚Äôs mind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou and you alone will work this one,‚Äù Jack Pagosa had said, handing him a sealed golden folder. Jack‚Äôs usually ruddy face had been pale, his eyes constantly darting to the office door as if he expected someone to burst inside at any moment, gun in hand. His thick salt-and-pepper hair stood on end, his hands plowing through it every few seconds.  
Why me?‚Äù Jaxon had asked as he‚Äôd plopped into the seat in front of his boss‚Äôs desk, immediately wanting to snatch back the words. He knew why, and no one liked to hear they were being given a job simply because they were the last option, the only person available.  
  
¬† Mia Snow, Jack‚Äôs right-hand agent, was busy training New Chicago‚Äôs newest recruits, young girls fresh from boot camp. And Mia‚Äôs partner, Dallas, had been unstable ever since his recovery from a near-death experience.  
  
¬† Jack popped a handful of antacids, chewed, swallowed audibly. ‚ÄúNot why you‚Äôre thinking, obviously. One, you‚Äôre the calmest man I know. And two, you can get answers out of a dead man. ‚Äù More antacids. ‚ÄúOh, yeah. And the fewer people who know those answers, the less chance of panic. This is all very hush-hush. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Later that night, when Jaxon opened the folder and began reading, he hadn‚Äôt felt calm. He‚Äôd felt panicked.  
  
¬† Seemed a new alien race had snuck their way onto the planet.  
  
¬† Government was calling them Sch√∂n. Beautiful in German. There‚Äôd been a few sightings here and there, and their numbers seemed to be small. No more than eleven, so no big deal. After all, a new alien race seemed to arrive every fucking day. Not that he was bitter or anything. What brought the Sch√∂n under A. I. R. scrutiny, however, was the fact that they excreted some kind of toxic liquid.  
  
¬† The liquid not only killed, it did something far worse.  
  
¬† These otherworlder men were, apparently, so lovely to gaze upon, human women were throwing themselves at them. And every woman who did so ended up in the hospital with grade-nine hallucinations, losing touch with reality more and more every day until finally developing a hunger for human flesh they couldn‚Äôt suppress.  
  
¬† Jaxon had interviewed them in both the beginning and ending stages of the sickness. His stomach rolled with the memory. He hadn‚Äôt told anyone what he‚Äôd learned and wasn‚Äôt going to until he‚Äôd processed the information himself. Panic? Jack had no idea.  
  
¬† After the interviews, well, the women had needed to be put down like animals and Jaxon had been the one to do it. He‚Äôd hated himself for it, still hated himself, but there‚Äôd been no other recourse. Those females would have eaten their own young‚Äîliterally‚Äîif they‚Äôd been allowed to live.  
  
¬† He should be on the streets right now, hunting the Sch√∂n. Until they were destroyed, more and more victims would surface. Didn‚Äôt take a psychic to figure that out, just a person with half a brain. Jaxon qualified. Right now, he felt like only half of his remained. If he didn‚Äôt get out there soon‚Ä¶  
  
¬† You know Jack. He‚Äôs got someone on the streets already, doing what you were supposed to be doing. Jaxon tried to take comfort in that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat thoughts tumble through your mind, hmm?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jaxon blinked, the woman inside his cell coming into gradual focus. He must have drifted, because he hadn‚Äôt heard her move, yet she was now crouched in front of him. Her long legs straddled his and she was gently cupping his cheeks in her soft hands. One of her palms was warm, the other cool and silky, as if it were covered by some kind of material and ice was packed underneath.  
  
¬† Though his vision was murky and distilled, he was quite certain he‚Äôd never been closer to perfection. Her eyes were mesmerizing onyx and framed by midnight. Her skin was pale and smooth, lickable cream. Her nose perfectly sloped. Her cheekbones a work of art. Her lips a fantasy come to life. Plump, red, luscious, the kind of lips a man usually had to pay for to enjoy.  
  
¬† Her scent was stronger now, all the better, and he thought he caught a hint of jasmine. Wild, exotic. Like the woman herself?  
  
¬† Like it mattered. Much as he wanted to, he didn‚Äôt delude himself. She was a professional torturer and killer, had probably studied the human body so that she knew every sensitive place and the best ways to enforce maximum pain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt even give me a tiny little hint?‚Äù she beseeched, her long lashes fluttering, beckoning him deeper into the black sea of her gaze. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHint?‚Äù He played stupid. Sadly, it was not a difficult task. ‚ÄúHint about what?‚Äù  
  
¬† What was she wearing?  
  
¬† Finally, a silver lining to his ravaged face. He couldn‚Äôt see clearly enough to discern her clothing, which meant, in his mind, she was wearing lingerie. Black, like her eyes. With sheer lace. She had small breasts, but they were soft and pink-tipped.  
  
¬† Despite his condition, his dick lengthened, thickened, hardened.  
  
¬† Marie gave a sweet little gasp, as if she felt that hardness, but didn‚Äôt move away. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect such a response from you. You‚Äôre surprising me at every turn, Jaxon Tremain. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She spoke as if she were weaving a spell, soft and melodic, her voice lulling him, drawing him in and holding him under. What would she sound like during orgasm?  
  
¬† Damn, where were these thoughts coming from?  
  
¬† He heard Thomas groan impatiently, but he didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúYou should unchain me,‚Äù he told Marie, using his most seductive voice. ‚ÄúWe should go on a date. ‚Äù  
  
¬† A pause, a frown. Her head tilted to the side as she studied him more intently. Frown deepening, she reached for his left wrist, caught herself, and stilled. She gulped and licked her lips. ‚ÄúAnd what would we do on this date?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jaxon imagined he heard a wistful note in her tone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd have lots and lots of fun. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, really. ‚Äù Her frown softened at the edges, adding all kinds of sexy to her expression. ‚ÄúMy type of fun or yours?‚Äù  
  
¬† He knew what she was asking: pain or pleasure. ‚ÄúMine, but I‚Äôm sure we could incorporate some of yours if you asked me nicely. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMarie, this is‚Äî‚Äù Thomas interrupted.  
  
¬† Her entire body stiffened, and her chin whipped to the side as she pierced the alien with a fierce glare. ‚ÄúShut it, Thomas. You‚Äôve already pissed me off once. Want to make it twice?‚Äù  
  
¬† Silence.  
  
¬† Jaxon latched onto the chance to examine her more closely. In profile, her chin had a stubborn jut to it and her ear was studded with multiple diamonds. She had shoulder-length hair, straight as a ruler, and he wished he had the strength to reach up and sift the pale velvet strands through his fingers. Wished he had the good fortune to have the strands spread over his thighs while she sucked him dry. Like you can handle that right now, idiot.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing you again. ‚Äù Facing him once more, Marie stroked her fingers over his cheeks, careful, so careful of his bruises. ‚ÄúBlood loss affecting your concentration, sweet?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. What?‚Äù  
  
¬† She uttered a warm chuckle. ‚ÄúAn apology, after everything that‚Äôs been done to you. How surprising. ‚Äù Another chuckle. ‚ÄúYou were about to give me a hint. About the Sch√∂n, their virus, and the women they‚Äôve infected. ‚Äù  
  
¬† When he pressed his lips together, her warmth vanished.  
  
¬† Tick. Christ! Not the clock. Shut up, shut up, shut up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre in a lot of pain, Jaxon. ‚Äù Her voice was all business now. ‚ÄúTell me what I desire, and the pain ends. The agony stops. You have my word. ‚Äù  
  
¬† As they had every other time he‚Äôd been asked, fifteen years of fieldwork and a year of training kicked into gear. Always deny. A single detail can blow an entire case. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚Äù Tock.  
  
¬† There was a heavy pause. ‚ÄúWould you know if I cut off one of your testicles and you had to watch Thomas eat it?‚Äù Violent as the question was, she asked it with the sweetness of an angel. One of her brows arched as she waited for his answer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOuch. ‚Äù How many times had she performed that little operation? ‚ÄúNope. I‚Äôm afraid that wouldn‚Äôt jog my memory. How could it? I don‚Äôt know anything. ‚Äù Tick.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs it bad that I was hoping you‚Äôd say that?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for his response. ‚ÄúThomas, be a dear and hand me Damocles. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMmm, excellent choice,‚Äù the alien said happily. A few seconds later, metal whistled against syn-leather, and then Thomas was grinning and clomping to Marie‚Äôs side.  
  
  
¬† Now Jaxon arched a brow. Or rather, hoped he did. Most of his facial muscles were currently unworkable. He hoped he looked interested rather than terrified. ‚ÄúDamocles? You name your weapons?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou mean you don‚Äôt?‚Äù she asked in surprise. She gripped the hilt of a sword, and he could see sharp, curved steel glistening from the only bulb hanging from the ceiling.  
  
¬† At least it was clean, no rusty, metallic aroma wafting from it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNever have. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA shame, since they can be a person‚Äôs best friend. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOr worst enemy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She tapped the end of his nose with her free hand, the one uncovered. Warm. ‚ÄúHad you been armed at your home, you might not have been taken. Best friend. ‚Äù  
  
¬† At the patient censure in her tone, he barked out a laugh. ‚ÄúLesson learned, believe me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSadly, it‚Äôs too late. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ticktock, ticktock. For some reason, all of his emotions drained from him. He should have been more afraid than ever. Should have been trembling, pissing his pants. Something. Instead, the only emotion that returned and stayed was a curious sense of relief.  
  
¬† Finally, the beatings would stop. The rape wouldn‚Äôt happen. And maybe the afterlife would pair him with an angel who looked just like Marie. Minus the penchant for killing, of course.  
  
¬† When did you become such a pussy? Fight this! Fight her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLast chance to tell me what I want to know,‚Äù she said, pressing the cold steel to his neck.  
  
¬† One second passed. Another. When he continued to remain silent, she nicked the skin until a bead of blood trickled. Thankfully the ticking did not resume. Odd, though, since these were most likely his last moments on Earth.  
  
¬† She pressed harder.  
  
¬† He gave no reaction to the sting. Hell, a little prick was nothing compared to what he‚Äôd already endured. Slowly she lowered her hand, gliding the blade over his bare chest, cutting skin along the way. She reached his navel, twirled paper-thin slices all around, then stopped right between his denim-clad legs.  
  
¬† Thomas, who‚Äôd remained at her side, chortled with glee. Probably had a hard-on.  
  
¬† God, I hate making him happy. Jaxon swallowed a sudden rise of anger. Not so relieved anymore.  
  
¬† His fight reflex sparked to life, blending with the anger and warring with his need for closure. Sweat poured down his chest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Marie prompted. The tip nicked his pants and pressed between his balls. ‚ÄúAnything to say?‚Äù  
  
¬† Closure won. Without him, these people would never be able to find the Sch√∂n. And if they couldn‚Äôt find the Sch√∂n, they couldn‚Äôt use them as a weapon against humans, or whatever else they were planning.  
  
¬† Jaxon closed his eyes and said good-bye to one of his favorite body parts. I love you little guys. We had some good times together.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLast chance, Jaxon. ‚Äù  
  
¬† His gaze met Marie‚Äôs, locking, clashing. Unflinching. ‚ÄúI told you. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her lush lips rose in an exquisite smile, lighting her entire face. Just then she was the perfect blend of good and evil, innocence and absolute wickedness. His traitorous heart skipped a beat in total, masculine appreciation. Her teeth were straight and white, the pink tip of her tongue peeking out the center as if she were nibbling on it. ‚ÄúThat answer just saved your life,‚Äù she said, and then her arm lashed to the side and she stabbed Thomas in the stomach.  
  
¬† Blood sprayed Jaxon‚Äôs face as Marie moved her blade in and out. The alien jerked and gasped in pained shock. Jaxon could only watch, morbidly awed, utterly confused. That death blow had been meant for him. Hadn‚Äôt it?  
  
¬† Smile becoming dark, lethal, Marie rose on her knees, twisting her wrist to drive the blade even deeper while hacking at every organ she could reach. ‚ÄúEnjoy hell, you sick fuck. You have no idea how long I‚Äôve wanted to do this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Thomas collapsed in a motionless heap, convulsing to his death, and all Jaxon could do was stare over at him, wondering what the hell was going on.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† Mishka Le‚ÄôAce‚Äîaka Marie‚Äîstuffed her hands into the dead alien‚Äôs pants pocket, searching for the key to Jaxon‚Äôs chains. Thomas had a deathly fear of ID scans, which would have been needed to open and close a good pair of lasercuffs. A. I. R. could, theoretically, capture the signal and hunt him down. Not that she‚Äôd ever seen it done.  
  
¬† But fears were universal, unreasonable, and sometimes uncontrollable. Usually she whined about the lack of technology, practically begging Thomas to try it. Today she was thankful for his continued refusal, for it saved her a hell of a lot of time. Rather than disable wires, burning both her and Jaxon, all she had to do was insert a piece of metal and twist her wrist.  
  
¬† When her fingers curled around the key, she tugged it out and rushed to the agent she‚Äôd been sent to rescue. Or kill. Everything had hinged on his ability to keep a secret.  
  
¬† Amazingly enough, he‚Äôd kept his mouth shut. She‚Äôd expected him to break the moment she placed the blade to his dick. But he hadn‚Äôt, shocking her to the core, and now she would save him.  
  
¬† She wondered what he knew, what surreptitious things danced inside his head. Had to be valuable, perhaps life-altering, otherwise she wouldn‚Äôt have been pulled from another job for a simple extraction.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThink you can walk?‚Äù she asked him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† His words were slurred, barely understandable. Anger, confusion, and uncertainty pulsed from him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your new best friend, honey. ‚Äù Within seconds, she had his ankles and wrists free and was jerking him to his feet. ‚ÄúYour boss sent me. ‚Äù Kind of.  
  
¬† A hiss of agony escaped him, and he quickly bent one leg at the knee, keeping his foot elevated. ‚ÄúBroken,‚Äù he grunted.

1n0u4tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1n0u4tq/tifu_i_went_through_the_most_confusing/,TIFU I went through the most confusing relationship ever‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt know if I was loved or manipulated üò¢ Has anyone been through this?,"From the very beginning, when I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. At first, it felt simple and innocent. But as time passed, things got complicated.

We once had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism according to her  and our conversations were often one-sided.

We planned to meet at the park but canceled because she said she had hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she mentioned the autism. She opened up about her past: an ex who abandoned her, another guy who replaced her‚Ä¶ I felt bad for her, so I tried to be there.

One day, I got robbed and almost lost her number. She barely reacted  cold, almost indifferent. She even said she wouldn‚Äôt text me if I stopped texting her. She‚Äôd talk a lot about her cats and her nephews, who also had autism.

There was this time her cousin said she used to drink with her ex  she got extremely angry about it. Later, I invited her to the movies since she once said we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed‚Ä¶ only to tell me the next day:
""Maybe we should just be friends?""

Despite that, we still went to the movies, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. But she never let me see her phone, avoided giving me her Instagram (she only gave it to me after we broke up), and was always distant.

Another day, we went to the mall  she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was too shy to turn the lights on. I reassured her, but suddenly her mood flipped completely. She became reactive, distant, almost cold again.

She also didn‚Äôt want me meeting her family. Even when I walked her home once, she seemed uncomfortable about it. There was another time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I joked about her being ‚Äútoo picky‚Äù about going out. She got furious.

We argued about small things  once, we played a game, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing altogether. Still, she‚Äôd bring me chocolates, we‚Äôd spend time together, and then suddenly, she‚Äôd talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party but kept changing her mind: first she wanted me there, then she didn‚Äôt, then she did again. I asked if she didn‚Äôt want me to go, and she insisted I arrive only after 6 PM. I got there a bit earlier, her sister saw me, and I ended up at a friend‚Äôs party with her.

She introduced me as her boyfriend, but out of nowhere, she suddenly joked:
""Let‚Äôs download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. Eventually, I called her and ended things she cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her to therapy and ‚Äúruining her happiness.‚Äù Then, out of nowhere, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected.

I gave in. We started talking again‚Ä¶ until I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to ‚Äúgo find someone else‚Äù and claimed she was looking for a friend‚Äôs ex there.

I still told her I loved her. She said she went somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom even called me asking if I loved her daughter and invited me over for coffee.

We tried talking again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I got upset and vented online, and she found out. That‚Äôs when she accused me of using her, of tricking her, and said she only acted this way because she was insecure and autistic. She told me she prayed for me every day‚Ä¶ and then she blocked me.

And just like that‚Ä¶ she disappeared.

What did I do wrong?


TL;DR: . From the start, We had moments of affection movies, kisses, chocolates, even a motel but she‚Äôd switch from loving to cold in seconds. She introduced me as her boyfriend, yet joked about me finding ‚Äúa hot girl,‚Äù invited me to parties but changed her mind, cried when I broke up, blocked me, came back saying she missed me, and then I caught her on a dating app she denied it, told me to ‚Äúfind someone else,‚Äù but kept pulling me back. Her mom liked me and even invited me for coffee, but then she said her dad was angry at me, leading to more fights, accusations, and guilt trips. In the end, she said her behavior came from insecurity and autism, claimed she prayed for me daily, blocked me again‚Ä¶ and disappeared. I tried, I forgave, I gave everything, but I was left questioning if any of it was real and what I did wrong.",0,1756233728.0,tifu,11,0.21,False
1n0u442,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0u442,Window treatment and more for living room,"I just repainted my living room a nice swiss coffee and am trying to figure out how to make it cozy and welcoming. I've got a pretty blank slate so far, and I'm struggling to decide on a treatment for the 8ft wide window.

  
The house came with old metal venetian blinds which scratched the hell out of the beveled casing around the window, so I don't think I want to go back to those unless I can figure out how to mount them further out from the wall. I was thinking curtains would be the move to help soften things up, but I'm not sure about the heigh or placement. 

The molding is about 92 inches up, so 96"" curtains would pool on the floor even if I put the rod right up against the ceiling. In pic 2, I placed markers where 84"" curtains would need to hang in order to not pool, but it would be loser to the window than it is the ceiling. I suppose I could always tailor longer curtains but I'd rather not, is it always a faux pas to hang curtains closer to the window than the ceiling?

I'm also looking for ideas on color/texture for curtains and a larger area rug. I like neutral tones but I don't want everything to look too bachelor pad brown and black, so possibly a lighter beige or camel and then layer some forest green/ real plants around as an accent? And definitely some nice large artwork over the sofa is needed as well, but I'm not sure where to start. Abstract prints always felt cheap and too generic to me, but I also don't know if I'm ready to invest a ton of money in a nice piece that I'm not 100% in love with.

The top is 18x60"" made of cherry. They want to put a couple stools there and sit and drink coffee and look out the window. I have an Uplift desk with this really nice chamfered concave rounded edge profile. It's very comfortable for resting your arms on, and I'd love to try to replicate it. I'm not really sure what tools to use though. I don't think a hand plane will work due to the concave curve. Would a spoke shave be the right tool? I have an old one that I've never really been able to get tuned up properly, so that would be new territory for me. Could/should I just do the whole thing with rasps/files/sandpaper?

taylor staying single would've been too powerful i guess. she flew too close to the sun with midnights i guess and they had to tame her by linking her up with a man.

[Sorry, this screams of performance art lore to me.

[Just pointing out that the very classic song ""(I never promised you a) Rose Garden"", famously recorded by Lynn Anderson is part of the Zodiac soundtrack, the movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and based off of the Zodiac Killer <3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1n0sd1v/comment/nat40mt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

It was written by a man named Joe South and according to the wikipedia ""In 1970, Lynn Anderson recorded ""Rose Garden"" after hearing Joe South's version. However, Anderson's producer rejected the song's recording because he did not consider it to be a female tune. After much convincing, the song was eventually recorded and released as a single by Columbia Records. The song became a crossover hit after it reached both the American Billboard country and pop charts. ""Rose Garden"" also became a major hit worldwide, reaching the number-one spot in multiple countries.""

It has a line that goes ""I could promise you things like big diamonds rings but you won't find roses growing on stalks of clover, so you better think it over""

I only skimmed the wikipedia so I'm sure there's more relevant info and lyrics in there somewhere

Also just btw its a banger and very swift, highly recommend a listen

* They're in love and so happy and they're going to get married and have a family!
* This is PR for their careers, and they will get married to continue to cover up their actual private lives and partners.
* This is performance art, where an engagement, then broken engagement and/or runaway bride situation will occur.

I genuinely feel so unsure what is actually going on, and oddly like it isn't my buisness? I can dig into the art, theorize, and have opinions, but Taylor and Travis's personal lives aren't actually my buisness. They don't know me, and whatever parasociality I can form, I don't really know them either.

I just hope they are happy, with whatever is going on.

I also keep thinking of a tiktok or something that suggested that literally any other storyline would be less interesting than Taylor building a relationship with a popular football player, so of course she is going to keep telling this story to keep people entertained and engaged.

>Tbh I don't think it changes anything in terms of our previous theories. I think it just means she's taking the bearding to the next level to progress her personal relationships. But I'm still sort of disappointed. Let's hope it's worth it for both of their relationships",825,1756233586.0,SubredditDrama,368,0.88,False

In terms of jokes per minute, Veep is the league leader of shows I've watched by a WIDE margin. There's literally something funny happening approximately every 4 seconds. You need to be ready for this show. Like drink a pot of coffee right before watching kind of thing.  
  
Eastbound & Down, Vice Principals & Bored To Death is more stoner type comedy in my book. Laid back type stuff. The funny comes at you in very manageable doses.

Barry is it's own thing.  Maybe brew a half pot before watching that one.  
  
In terms of shows not classified as comedies but still funny as all get out, I think Deadwood takes the cake. Followed by Succession, The Wire and Big Little Lies.",20,1756233540.0,hbo,20,0.75,False

Coming on here to sorta rant out all this stuff that I feel sounds so annoying and long out loud to loved ones. Im 24F and just started taking metoprolol tartrate twice a day for 26% burden of pvcs. I wore holter monitor for 5 days. Normal BP usually 110/80 or 70. Echo normal (trace regurgitation in M and P) blood work normal, waiting for CT and MRI to be done, need my heart to slow down and have less pvcs to have this imaging done hence taking the metoprolol. No caffeine anymore, little to no more alcohol, MMJ user that needs to quit. No tobacco products. I am a highly stressed out mom. Moderate excersize.

I have 3 children and discovered this on my second pregnancy when I went to the ER twice for hyperemesis gravidarum. I did have HG in my first and third as well. They told me I was having steady pvcs and what not and told me to see a cardiologist both visits. I did not worry about it, I thought It was just me being very sick, low potassium and dehydrated from all the vomiting. I never felt them and my OB never said anything at all my regular visits. This child was born with a heart murmur that went away at 3 months. My third child, I also went to the ER twice or three times for HG and then the flu. All times I was having frequent pvcs. OB still not saying anything to me. I gave birth to #3. Nurses in the delivery room were watching my heart monitor saying it looks/sounds weird and if i was aware. This child has a murmur that still has not resolved at 1 yr age to this day. Its faint but its there. Normal echo.

2 months later I get this horrible sore throat that lasted for a week or longer. im assuming this was strep ive had it before as a kid. I neglected to get to the doctor because I was too busy being mom and it was during two hurricanes crushing our area. Once the sore throat subsided, I broke out into psoriasis guttate. I looked horrible and it was painful it was in every spot you could think of besides my face. That lasted for months steroid cream didnt do much. Its been almost a year of that and im probably 80% clear at this point. I also got double pink eye from all the kids cooties. after that shit show, I haven't been sick and this is when I really started noticing how much my heart was pounding/fluttering especially if drinking espresso, my coffee preference. 

So probably since baby 3, ive really started to feel them especially in bed at night. I dont ever sleep through the night from the kids. When im getting up to tend and back in bed, same thing. You'd think I was running around or being chased the way it's racing/fluttering. I also feel out of breath when these are present. It definitely freaks you out quickly when you can feel your heart beat that clearly and all the weird pumps. So i finally went to the PCP who heard it and then i wound up at the cardiologist.

As stated at the top, most of the findings are normal besides the burden being so high. *I think its strange 2/3 had or have a heart murmur it does not run in our families* Im in favor of the ablation once everything else is ruled out. Doctor seems to think its idopathic but he wants to be absolutely positive so im thankful to be doing all imaging to really know. Its truly hard to be patient for it. In the meantime, im just an anxious mess (on the inside). Not sure if the metoprolol is working because im still having the racing feeling here and there. I definitely feel the side effects - more sleepy, cold fingers, sweating more during workout, increased hunger. I keep thinking something from that strep throat made things worse or that all the *severe* emotional and physical stress (3 vaginal births) I've been through as a young mom and in my teenage years, that there is damage like scarring. i got my heart broken many times in high school, and have dealt with alot of family/work drama in adult life. I feel i sound like a hypochondriac but anxiety picks at you! Its just truly strange to feel these things. thanks for reading :)",3,1756233539.0,PVCs,1,1.0,False

¬† Jude Donovan was used to hunting killers‚Äîused to running them down like the damn dogs they were and caging the bastards.  
  
¬† So when he followed his latest prey into the swamps of Louisiana, an area that looked like it had been home to nothing but beasts for the last few centuries, he wasn‚Äôt nervous.  
  
¬† Until a bullet thudded into him.  
  
¬† Sonofabitch. The fiery pain blasted in his shoulder even as the retort of the rifle echoed in his ears.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not taking me back, you bastard!‚Äù The snarl came from up ahead, to the right. The tip of the barrel jutted over a fallen log.  
  
¬† Jude gritted his teeth, but didn‚Äôt bother glancing down at the wound. No time for that, not now. ‚ÄúBobby Burrows!‚Äù He called out the man‚Äôs name. Voice loud and hard, as if he weren‚Äôt bleeding like a freaking stuck pig. ‚ÄúThere are two ways we can handle this‚Ä¶‚Äù He stalked forward. Drops of blood littered the ground around him. Great. Blood would attract the gators and hell knew what else. The bastard would pay. ‚ÄúFirst way‚Äôs easy, as in‚Ä¶you drop that rifle and come out with your hands up. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving up! I won‚Äôt go to jail! I won‚Äôt!‚Äù The tip of the weapon began to move. Fuck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen we do it the hard way. ‚Äù Jude inhaled and caught the cloying scent of the swamp, the rich flavor of his own blood, and the man‚Äôs scent of fear and sweat. ‚ÄúI come and get you‚Äî and I rip you apart. ‚Äù Simple enough. His eyes narrowed on his target. The ground disappeared beneath Jude‚Äôs feet as he sprang forward.  
  
¬† A man darted out from behind the log, eyes wild, rifle clutched tight to him. With a big-ass scope on it, of course. He lifted, aimed‚Äî  
  
¬† Jude growled, a deep, inhuman sound, and he swiped out with his right hand. He caught the wanted man in the right shoulder, and saw the spatter of blood in the air. Bobby‚Äôs this time, not his.  
  
¬† Wound for wound. Blood for blood. The way of his kind.  
  
¬† He grabbed the weapon, wrenching it out of Bobby‚Äôs hand. Bobby, a guy in his forties, balding and with big fists, stared up at him, terror on his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äîyou‚Äôre not‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude smiled. Held up his hands. Blood stained the claws that seemed to burst out of his fingertips. ‚ÄúHuman?‚Äù  
  
¬† A whimper.  
  
¬† The smile stretched even more. His shoulder ached like a bitch, pulsing every few seconds, but Jude ignored the pain. An old habit. He leaned forward, ran his claws over the squirming man‚Äôs stubbled face. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not. What I am, Bobby, is the worst nightmare you‚Äôve ever had. ‚Äù He let his claws dig into skin. ‚ÄúTell me, did you enjoy cutting those women?‚Äù  
  
¬† Bobby‚Äôs screams pierced the night.  
  
¬† The first time she saw him, Jude Donovan was covered in blood. Erin Jerome recognized him instantly‚Äîshe‚Äôd seen his picture in the local paper just days before. She watched as Jude handed the wanted man he‚Äôd apprehended over to the local cops. Watched as Bobby Burrows, a man who‚Äôd cruelly sliced up the faces of his ex-wife, his two ex-girlfriends, and some unlucky woman he‚Äôd stumbled across in Baton Rouge, was shoved into the backseat of a squad car.  
  
¬† She could hear Bobby‚Äôs shouts from across the street. His yells of ‚ÄúMonster!‚Äù And his ravings about claws and killers.  
  
¬† Disgust tightened her lips. Jerk was probably already preparing for his defense. An insanity plea. Erin would bet a month‚Äôs salary on it.  
  
¬† Not that she was going to let the freak get away with something like that.  
  
¬† Oh, no, as an assistant district attorney, it was her job to make sure that old Bobby got to see the inside of an eight by twelve foot cell, preferably for the rest of his miserable life. Angola prison was waiting for him.  
  
¬† Straightening her jacket, because this was only her second week on the job and she needed to be professional‚Äîor, at least try to be‚ÄîErin crossed the street. Her eyes were drawn to Jude.  
  
¬† The bounty hunter.  
  
¬† He worked for Night Watch, a huge, multi-state operation that had a main base in Baton Rouge. Night Watch was reputed to be one of the best, if not the best, bounty hunting agencies in the country. No matter what it took, their hunters caught their prey.  
  
¬† A fact that, right then, made her enormously grateful. Her job would get a whole lot easier now that she had the defendant in custody.  
  
¬† Her heels tapped on the pavement. Time to‚Äî  
  
¬† Jude‚Äôs head shot up. His eyes, the bluest she‚Äôd ever seen, lazered in on her.  
  
¬† Erin stumbled. No, oh, hell, no‚Äî  
  
¬† She caught his scent then. The wild scent of her kind.  
  
¬† Other. Shifter.  
  
¬† Erin wasn‚Äôt human, well, not completely anyway. And she knew the truth about the world around her.  
  
¬† She knew that humans weren‚Äôt the only killers out on the streets.  
  
¬† Sucking in a sharp breath, she straightened her shoulders and kept walking. The animal scent of the hunter teased her, as did the thick fragrance of blood in the air.  
  
¬† Dammit, this is the last thing I need. She‚Äôd tried so hard, for so long, to be normal.  
  
¬† Then this guy had literally landed in her path.  
  
¬† His nostrils widened as she came closer. She knew he was drinking in her scent, knew too by the faint line that appeared between his brows that he couldn‚Äôt quite understand what she was.  
  
¬† Story of my life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMs. Jerome. ‚Äù One of the uniforms stepped toward her, a wide smile on his face. His partner slammed the car door, effectively isolating Bobby and ending his claws rant.  
  
¬† Maybe that hadn‚Äôt been an insanity plea in the making after all.  
  
¬† She crouched down, gazing at Bobby through the window. Her breath rushed out. ‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù But she knew.  
  
¬† The uniforms looked at Jude.  
  
¬† Jaw clenched, so did she.  
  
¬† And Erin realized she‚Äôd made a serious mistake. His eyes held hers. Saw too much.  
  
¬† Danger.  
  
¬† Oh, yeah, this guy was a serious threat. To her.  
  
¬† Not good-looking, not really, at least not in that classic, magazine way. A mane of thick blond hair teased his shirt collar.  
  
¬† Framed a face that was hard, a little cruel. High cheeks. Sharp nose. Square jaw.  
  
¬† No, not a GQ face. But still‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Sexy. Somehow, he was still sexy. Maybe it was those lips. That scar that slipped right over the edge of his top lip.  
  
¬† Shouldn‚Äôt have been sexy, but it was.  
  
¬† He was.  
  
¬† Freaking animal attraction, that‚Äôs what it was.  
  
¬† The guy had an air about him, one of those I-don‚Äôt-give-adamn attitudes. A wildness in his eyes and in the curl of his lips.  
  
¬† Erin swallowed. She couldn‚Äôt help taking an uneasy step back.  
  
¬† His eyes followed the movement, and one golden brow rose. After a moment, he shrugged. His gaze raked over her body.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd you are‚Ä¶?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAssistant District Attorney Erin Jerome. ‚Äù Gritted out. Why was there blood all over Bobby? If something happened and this case got thrown out‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot the question I was asking. ‚Äù Bland as you please. That brow was still up.  
  
¬† Her lips parted. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù No way could he have meant‚Äî  
  
¬† His eyes swept over her again, and a smile lifted his lips. ‚ÄúInteresting. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Right then, the only interesting thing she saw was Bobby. A lie. But she‚Äôd always been good at lying to herself. And about herself. ‚ÄúWhat. Happened?‚Äù  
  
¬† Another shrug. ‚ÄúHe slipped in the swamp. Fell on some branches. ‚Äù  
  
¬† It was Erin‚Äôs turn to let her eyes drift over him. Drift over his too-wide shoulders and muscled chest. ‚ÄúIs that your blood?‚Äù  
  
¬† she asked quietly. ‚ÄúOr his?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLittle of both. ‚Äù  
  
¬† A headache began to pound behind her le  
ft eye. Erin grabbed on to her patience and held tight.  
  
¬† What was the guy‚Äôs deal? Was he the crazy one?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, Ms. Jerome?‚Äù It was the uniform to her right. ‚ÄúYou want us to go ahead and take Burrows to processing?‚Äù  
  
¬† Erin shook her head. She‚Äôd been listening to the police radio, hoping for some word on Bobby. The guy had vanished less than an hour after posting bail‚Äîshe still didn‚Äôt know what the idiot judge had been thinking. She‚Äôd been desperate for some word on the sadistic jerk, and then, like a sweet gift from Fate, she‚Äôd caught the news of his capture.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd almost flown down to Burns Swamp. ‚ÄúTake him to the hospital. Get him patched up. ‚Äù She pointed at the cop. ‚ÄúDo not let him leave your sight for even a second, understand? Bail‚Äôs revoked. Once the docs give the ok, haul his ass back to jail. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Hopefully, he‚Äôd stay locked up for the rest of his miserable days.  
  
¬† The uniform, Ray Neal‚Äîshe‚Äôd met him twice before‚Äîgave a nod. He and his partner climbed into the car, then drove away, taking her criminal with them.  
  
¬† And leaving her alone with the hunter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWanna answer my question?‚Äù His voice was deep, rumbling.  
  
¬† Goosebumps rose on her bare arms, and it was far too warm for her to have a chill from the weather.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust what question was that?‚Äù She tilted her head to the right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† She let her brow furrow. She‚Äôd fooled Other before, she could do it again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not sure I understand. I told you, I‚Äôm Assistant District Attorney‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell human. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her breath caught on a gasp. No, he hadn‚Äôt just said‚Äî  
  
¬† He stepped toward her, a fast move that brought their bodies too close. Jude leaned in, lowering his head over the curve of her throat. And inhaled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù She shoved him, hard, and watched with no small satisfaction as he stumbled back.  
  
¬† Oh, yeah, big guy, I‚Äôm much, much stronger than I appear. He wasn‚Äôt the first one to learn that little lesson.  
  
¬† She almost bared her teeth at him. Almost.  
  
¬† After all, she wasn‚Äôt an animal. No matter what the whispers back home said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know just what you think you were doing,‚Äù she snapped, glaring at him as she narrowed her eyes. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôd better watch what you do and what you say around me. ‚Äù Was the guy crazy? You don‚Äôt smell human. He couldn‚Äôt say things like that.  
  
¬† The words were too dangerous.  
  
¬† She reached into her purse. Dug out her card. ‚ÄúCall my office. My assistant will take care of any paperwork you‚Äôve got. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He stared at her a moment longer. Then, slowly, his tanned fingers rose. Long fingers, callused. Strong. He took the card, and his fingertips brushed over her hand.  
  
¬† Erin didn‚Äôt flinch and she was extremely proud of that fact.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood work, Donovan. ‚Äù After giving him that grudging token of appreciation, she nodded and began to march back toward her car.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd taken all of five steps when she heard his whistle. Long, loud, and very appreciative.  
  
¬† Erin stilled.  
  
¬† I really don‚Äôt need this shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your scent. ‚Äù Hard words. Scary words. Because she knew what they meant.  
  
¬† If Jude Donovan truly was a shifter, and every instinct she had screamed that he was, then having her scent, well, it meant he had her. He‚Äôd be able to follow her, to find her, almost anywhere.  
  
¬† A shifter. What were the odds she‚Äôd stumble onto him?  
  
¬† One of the little perks in the Other world‚Äîthe world full of supernaturals and nightmares, the world that, rather unfortunately, was her life‚Äîwas that like recognized like. Demons, because, yeah, those conniving bastards were real, could  
  
¬† ‚Äúsee‚Äù others of their breed. They could look right past the magic glamour and peer into the darkness inside.  
  
¬† Witches felt the power pull from their brethren.  
  
¬† And shifters, well, they could smell each other‚Äîa distinct scent. One that carried the wisp of power and the scent of the beast.  
  
¬† Jude Donovan smelled of power. Of wild, strong man. Of savagery. No denying that scent.  
  
¬† As for the beast‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt need the marks on Bobby‚Äôs face to know Donovan had claws.  
  
¬† Erin began to walk again. One determined step after another.  
  
¬† And even when she climbed into her car, she could feel his eyes on her. Watching and seeing too much.  
  
¬† Now, she‚Äôd have to be extra careful to stay on her guard and not let the hunter discover the secrets she kept so carefully hidden.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened to you?‚Äù Dee Daniels asked the minute Jude strode past the rather unassuming entrance of Night Watch‚Äôs Louisiana branch. She stood quickly, her blond hair cut brutally short around her elfin face. There was envy in her eyes as she stared at him with her lips slightly parted. ‚ÄúYou lucky bastard, you took prey down, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude grunted and rolled his shoulder. He‚Äôd shifted before coming into the agency. A fast, hard shift to speed up the healing process. His kind were blessed with a freaking phenomenal recovery system. Some shifters were lucky, they could heal almost instantly from their wounds. Others took a few days for a full recovery. It all depended on the power of the beast inside.  
  
¬† Because he was a very rare shifter breed, Jude was on the luckier end of the spectrum. He could heal fully in hours.  
  
¬† Yeah, he‚Äôd have a scar because the system wasn‚Äôt that perfect. More like he had his own little micro surgeon inside, stitching him back up. Soon, all that would remain of the jagged hole would be a slim line of raised flesh‚Äîonce the skin melded itself back together.  
  
¬† He dropped his bag near his desk. Damn but he was tired.  
  
¬† He hurt.  
  
¬† And he was horny.  
  
¬† All because of a little human.  
  
¬† No, not a human. He‚Äôd stake his life on it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou tracked the bastard down in twelve hours. ‚Äù Dee gave a faint hmmm, kind of like a revving motor. ‚ÄúJerk, you‚Äôve just broken my record. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The disgruntlement in her voice had a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, babe, there‚Äôs always next time. ‚Äù Dee was a bloodthirsty one. She was the toughest and sneakiest fighter he‚Äôd ever come across.  
¬†And she was one hundred percent human.  
  
¬† A human with a serious attitude.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let that asshole stay on the streets. ‚Äù Because he‚Äôd seen the pictures. Seen just what good old Bobby had done to the women who‚Äôd ‚Äúwronged‚Äù him.  
  
¬† Poor Sheila Gentry had gotten seventeen stitches in her face because she‚Äôd made the mistake of saying no when the guy asked her out for dinner. She‚Äôd taken a pit stop at a gas station and found one hell of a Romeo who wanted to pick her up.  
  
¬† Psycho.  
  
¬† Caged psycho now.  
  
¬† The little ADA had better do her job and keep him there.  
  
¬† He eased into his chair. Heard the grunt of the leather. ‚ÄúDee, what do you know about Erin Jerome?‚Äù  
  
¬† She blinked her chocolate eyes. The lady was all of five-foot-three. One hundred and fifteen pounds. She looked like a hard wind would blow her over.  
  
¬† But he‚Äôd seen her take down demons twice her size.  
  
¬† Dee knew the score about the Other world. Knew it, and often hated it.  
  
¬† A frown had her brows pulling low. ‚ÄúThe new ADA? She just started. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Yeah, he knew that. He would have known about her if she‚Äôd been around for more than a few weeks.  
  
¬† Her scent. He‚Äôd never smelled anything like it. Roses. Soft, subtle. And‚Ä¶more. An alluring, haunting scent of woman.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt smell like an animal. Didn‚Äôt give off the wild, rich scent of female shifters.  
  
¬† But the minute he‚Äôd seen her, the minute he‚Äôd caught her fragrance in the air, his whole body had stiffened.  
  
¬† And he‚Äôd gotten the biggest hard-on of his life. There was something there. He knew it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, hell, she‚Äôs Other. ‚Äù Dee curled her lip. ‚ÄúI swear, you guys are taking over the city. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Yeah, they were.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is she? Witch? Djinn? One of those charmers?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude didn‚Äôt speak. Because he didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA vampire?‚Äù Ice dripped from her voice. Dee hated the vamps. Her mission in life was to exterminate as many of them as she could.  
  
¬† Not that he blamed her, really. A vampire master had slaughtered her family years ago.  
  
¬† Dee was real big on the ‚Äúeye for an eye‚Äù mentality.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶think so. ‚Äù Erin‚Äôs skin had been flushed with color. Kissed by the sun. Vamps were usually paler than, well, death.  
  
¬† The lady had been a real looker. Coal black hair, thick, spilling to her shoulders. Red lips. Cheeks almost brutally sharp.  
  
¬† Eyes wide and gold. And a little black mole near the corner of her left eye.  
  
¬† Great body. High breasts. Round hips. Long, long legs.  
  
¬† Sexy.  
  
¬† Tall, slender, she‚Äôd walked with confidence, grace.  
  
¬† Until she‚Äôd seen him.  
  
¬† Then he‚Äôd watched her stumble, for just a moment.  
  
¬† Because she‚Äôd sensed what I am.  
  
¬† Only another shifter should have been able to sense him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt smell like a shifter,‚Äù he muttered, rubbing his hand over his face. Hell, he shouldn‚Äôt even be worrying about this now. He should be sleeping. Drinking. Congratulating himself on another job well done.  
  
¬† Not obsessing over a woman who clearly wasn‚Äôt interested in him.  
  
¬† Yeah, ‚Äôcause smelling a woman, sniffing her like a freaking dog‚Äîthat was the way to get a date.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust let me know if you hear anything about her, okay?‚Äù he finally said.  
  
¬† A cautious nod.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Dee. ‚Äù He closed his eyes‚Ä¶and saw Erin.  
  
¬† Shit. He needed to get a life.  
  
¬† He needed to take a life. Needed to kill. Needed to feel the sweet trickle of life being washed away.  
  
¬† The Slasher, Bobby Burrows, waited just behind the bars. There he stood, stalking around and muttering about evil and devils and hell.  
  
¬† And annoying the hell out of him.  
  
¬† That bastard had been on the news for the last two nights.  
  
¬† Bobby‚Äôs fat, ugly face had been splashed across the screen‚Äîmaking him sick.  
  
¬† Bobby Burrows didn‚Äôt deserve fifteen minutes of fame. He deserved a trip to the grave.  
  
¬† Bobby grabbed the bars of his cell. Tightened his thick hands into straining fists around the metal and screamed, ‚ÄúThe fuckin‚Äô devil marked me! I want reporters in here, I want my lawyer, I want‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRelax. ‚Äù He sidled closer to Bobby, finally stepping out of the shadows he loved so much and smiling. He jerked his thumb toward the group of guards who were watching television near the entrance to the cages.  
  
¬† Cages. That‚Äôs what he called ‚Äôem. To keep the animals inside.  
  
¬† But sometimes, the cages couldn‚Äôt hold the animals.  
  
¬† He drew in a deep breath and caught the scent of the man‚Äôs sweat and blood. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not gonna help you. ‚Äù They were too busy huddling up and watching a game to give a shit about the guy left in holding. He smiled and hoped he didn‚Äôt look too hungry. ‚ÄúBut I will. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Bobby squinted at him. The left side of his face was covered by a large, white bandage. ‚ÄúWhat? Who are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† His hands rose to the bars, reached for Bobby‚Äôs‚Äî  
  
¬† The Slasher jumped back.  
  
¬† Ah‚Ä¶not as stupid as he looked. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you tell me who hurt you, Bobby?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI-I did. The devil‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe devil‚Äôs not real. ‚Äù He‚Äôd never seen him. Judgment wasn‚Äôt for the afterlife. It was for here and now, to be delivered by the strong.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, he is. ‚Äù Absolute certainty. ‚ÄúFound me in the swamp. Changed before me. I shot the bastard, but he still came after me. ‚Äù He licked his lips. ‚ÄúThen he cut me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The bars were so thin. Not nearly strong enough to keep him out.  
  
¬† But strong enough to trap the human inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe let you live, didn‚Äôt he? I don‚Äôt think the devil would do that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a monster!‚Äù Spittle flew from Bobby‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúHiding behind the face of a man. That fuckin‚Äô hunter! Pretendin‚Äô, he‚Äôs pretendin‚Äô!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe all pretend,‚Äù he told him softly, aware of the excitement burning through his gut. He didn‚Äôt have any more time to waste. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs how we live. ‚Äù His hands flew through the gap in the bars. His right hand locked around the Slasher‚Äôs throat.  
  
¬† A wheeze slipped past Bobby‚Äôs lips.  
  
¬† Smiling, he jerked the human‚Äôs head to the right. He heard the sharp snap of bones.  
  
¬† And felt a rush of power as the man sagged in his grip.  
  
¬† Slowly, his left hand rose. He cast a glance back toward the guards. They were still glued to their TV.  
  
¬† Fucking oblivious humans.  
  
¬† Claws pushed from the ends of his fingertips. He raised his left hand and plunged the claws into Bobby‚Äôs heart.  
  
¬† As the blood flowed, a soft sigh escaped his lips.  
  
¬† No way was the media going to be able to overlook this kill.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd be taking over the news now.  
  
¬† Jude got the call from the police station forty-five minutes later. A cop who owed him a favor tipped him off.  
  
¬† The call was brief, and the details came fast. Burrows was dead. The ADA was on her way.  
  
¬† And, oh, yeah, it looked like an animal had attacked the guy‚Äîwhile he was locked up. Of course, the cops hadn‚Äôt seen a thing. Bobby had been all alone in holding one minute, then sliced and diced the next.  
  
¬† Jude grabbed his jacket. Slung it over his shoulder‚Äîalmost healed now. He ran for the door.  
  
¬† And ignored Dee‚Äôs shout behind him.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to see the body. ‚Äù  
  
¬† His voice, even deeper now, stopped her as Erin began to climb the steps leading to the police station and to the dead man.  
  
¬† She glanced back over her shoulder. She‚Äôd caught his scent seconds before he‚Äôd spoken. ‚ÄúHow do you even know there‚Äôs a body here, Donovan?‚Äù The District Attorney‚Äôs office had received the c  
all less than fifteen minutes ago. Just how had the hunter learned about the death?  
  
¬† Suspicion had her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† He jumped up the steps. Grabbed her arms. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill the bastard, no. If I‚Äôd killed him, well, he would‚Äôve been left in the swamp and been gator bait by now. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Erin swallowed. Nice, to, ah, know. ‚ÄúThen why are you here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSame as you. I want to know what happened to the Slasher. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes narrowed. You don‚Äôt want to see the body. ‚ÄúSounds to me like you already know. ‚Äù Which meant she had a leak in the department. Not surprising. Not particularly good news, either.  
  
¬† His wide shoulders lifted in a shrug. ‚ÄúTrust me on this, you don‚Äôt want to see Bobby Burrows right now. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She licked her lips. ‚ÄúAnd, trust me, I‚Äôm a big girl. I can handle it. ‚Äù Not like it was her first murder scene. Not by a long shot. She was twenty-nine years old, and she‚Äôd been working the rough cases since she‚Äôd passed the bar years ago.  
  
¬† To make a difference, sometimes you had to get your hands dirty.  
  
¬† Erin turned and continued stalking up the stone steps. Jude shadowed her moves, his body a ripple of muscle.  
  
¬† His scent filled the air around them.  
  
¬† Her heart raced, too fast. Was the frantic beat from the dread filling her at the thought of a dead man waiting in what should have been a secure cell?  
  
¬† Or was it from something more?  
  
¬† No.  
  
¬† She shoved open the glass doors. A guard near the front rushed forward. ‚ÄúMs. Jerome‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Her thumb jerked toward her hulking shadow. ‚ÄúKeep Donovan up here. I don‚Äôt want him anywhere near my crime scene. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her sensitive ears picked up the hunter‚Äôs swift inhalation and the nearly soundless‚Ä¶‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need me on this one, sweetheart. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Sweetheart. She slanted him a scathing glance. ‚ÄúDoubt it, hunter. Doubt it. ‚Äù Then she stalked down the tiled hallway, heading for lockup, and wondering just what sort of sight waited for her.  
  
¬† You don‚Äôt want to see the body.  
  
¬† The lady had one fine ass.  
  
¬† Even as anger tightened his body, Jude couldn‚Äôt help but admire that beautiful sway.  
  
¬† His nostrils were full of her scent. Woman, roses, and just a hint of rich, wild forest. Yeah, that wildness‚Äîthat fragrance had slipped into the air when those gorgeous eyes had narrowed and rage coated her voice.  
  
¬† Erin Jerome was so much more than she pretended to be.  
  
¬† The beast within him roared when she got close, and when she got too far away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry, man, you heard the orders. ‚Äù Jamison McGee, a good cop and a good human, frowned at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna have to stay‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, James. ‚Äù Jude rocked back on his heels. He could smell the blood from here. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be changing her mind. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Because he hadn‚Äôt been kidding when he told the pretty ADA that she‚Äôd need him.  
  
¬† Jude glanced toward the vinyl chairs near the entrance. ‚ÄúWhen she comes looking for me, I‚Äôll be waiting. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Five minutes, ten tops, and he‚Äôd wager his ADA would be running her sexy ass right back to him.  
  
¬† Because it seemed that another monster was out hunting. One that had killed right under the noses of the Baton Rouge PD.  
  
¬† Talk about a bold asshole.  
  
¬† Jude almost could admire that. Almost.  
  
¬† The scent of the blood burned her nostrils. Most of her kind liked that smell. She hated it.  
  
¬† Erin straightened her shoulders and strode forward. Four uniformed cops stood just in front of the entrance to the pen.  
  
¬† They glanced up at the clicking of her heels. One of them, an older guy with rich coffee skin, graying hair and a strong chin, stepped toward her. ‚ÄúMs. Jerome, you‚Äôd better brace yourself. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked worried. Looked like he thought she was going to pass out after one glance at the stiff.  
  
¬† She really wasn‚Äôt the passing out kind of girl.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks for the warning. ‚Äù The second one she‚Äôd gotten in less than three minutes. But Grant Tyler wasn‚Äôt being an ass with his warning. The young cop next to him was stark white and shaking. He looked like he might be doing some fainting at any moment.  
  
¬† Oh, hell. A cop ready to hit the floor was never a good sign.  
  
¬† Erin pointed toward the door. ‚ÄúShow him to me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant pushed open the door.  
  
¬† The stench nearly made her gag. Then she saw him.  
  
¬† Bobby‚Äôs arms had been yanked through the bars, left to hang over the edges of his prison. His wrists had been cut, long, thick slices, and his blood pooled on the floor. His eyes were open, wide, and his face had been slashed. A bloodred smile stretched from one ear to the next.  
  
¬† Positioned. Styled. His body had been arranged for the ultimate shock value.  
  
¬† Erin‚Äôs lips pressed together.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Grant whispered.  
  
¬† There was a flash of light as the crime scene guy snapped a photo.  
  
¬† She flinched. ‚ÄúFine. ‚Äù No, no, she wasn‚Äôt fine. What the hell had happened? Her gaze jerked to the left, then the right. The other cells were empty. Transfer had been made just hours before, and she knew Bobby had been the only prisoner in holding.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd planned for him to be the only one there‚Äîall the better for the cops to keep an eye on him.  
  
¬† This was so not good.  
  
¬† A killer, murdered while he was surrounded by cops.  
  
¬† Murdered by cops? Her stomach knotted.  
  
¬† Erin turned away from the body. Goosebumps rose on her flesh. ‚ÄúWho was here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was. ‚Äù Admitted quietly. ‚ÄúBurns, Grimes, and Hyde. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her fingers pressed into her right temple. The blood. ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt see a thing?‚Äù Doubt had her voice rising. No way, no way was that possible.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe were up front. ‚Äù His lips tightened. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see what happened and didn‚Äôt hear a peep. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh, shit. This was a nightmare.  
  
¬† Captain Antonio Young strolled in then. Wearing a perfect suit, not so much as a wrinkle anywhere to be found.

I recently picked up a Gaggia Classic Pro E24 and I'm pairing it with my Baratza Encore ESP grinder. From what I've read, this grinder should be more than adequate for the kind of espresso and cappuccino brewing I'm aiming for.

My setup includes a proper tamping station, WDT tool, and a good scale. I'm using freshly roasted beans from a local roastery. I've tested three different bean varieties so far - one performed significantly better than the other two, while one of the underperformers was a grocery store bean.

I'm having trouble achieving the standard 2:1 ratio in 25-30 seconds. My shots are consistently running too fast, and I keep finding myself grinding finer and finer, staying in the 2-6 range on my grinder (out of 40 total settings).

I also just installed the 9-bar spring mod since I was planning to do that anyway. I've only pulled one shot with it so far, and didn't notice a dramatic difference from the stock spring.

I've been tracking all my shots in Excel, recording grind settings, dose, yield, timing, and puck condition to try to identify patterns. Feel free to take a look. I installed the 9-bar spring mod right before pulling my 7th shot.

Thanks in advance!

1n0tz3e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0tz3e,Questions for a GMC Safari AWD...Worth the price and worthy of a first build for full time living (for part of the week),"Asking was $4,995 Post and photos from the Listing:

*""Starts right up and runs and drives great. Beautiful exterior color minus normal wear and tear ect as you can see in pictures. Aw*e*some van for so many different possibilities and uses. It‚Äôs got the legendary v6 fuel efficient v6 with low miles and known for going for a very very long time almost bullet proof I heard and with under 100k this one has a lot of life left and may even be considered a classic/antique! That being said it is over 25 yrs and of course some as-is however it does run and drive and would personally drive it anywhere I need to go. Van is presentable and sounds healthy and goes straight down the freeway. Having the high top conversion which is in good shape makes this idea for a camper van and being AWD you can get to those harder to get to places with a piece of mind for 4 season use.""*

Hey y'all, so I'll preface this all by saying I am completely new to everything related to living in a van. As it would stand, however, I am looking to buy and outfit a van as a part time living situation. My partner will be looking to move in together and, I have reason to believe we will be looking to live in a certain location that will be closer to their work and further from mine. My job is too good, at my current point in life, to quit and, even if I can find another one in a similar field, I'm not sure it would be the best idea. And even then, I'd like to be vested in everything before I up and leave.

The good news is that I have a hybrid work schedule which means I could spend 2-3 days of my work week at home, weekends with my partner at home as well, and then 2-3 days in the office (it's a 50% things which is awkward for a 5 day week). Effectively, my plan was to create a van I could live in during the days I'm at work so I wouldn't need 2 rents. I have a shower at work if needed, but also it's a city and a Planet Fitness or something is also available. I have access to laundry as well, a kitchen and fridge at work to heat up/store food and make coffee (so long as I remember to bring things with me) and, so far, I should have no issues with a place to park overnight. It would be in New England, which had some pretty wild lows last winter, a few weeks between 0-5 F, and while camping in a van seems really fun, living in a van year round definitely seems like it will have it's issues. But also, I'd like to know that the van I get would be able to survive colder winters (turn on in sub freezing conditions).

That being said, I can't ponder any of this without a van, so I had a question about this specific van for sale not terribly far from me. From the looks of it, it seems like a fair enough proposition. Lower miles, AWD, a type of van that isn't know to explode randomly like some other older models, manages to have some kind of personality. I wanted to ask some initial opinions from people who are more seasoned in these things. What to look out for, check for, is the price fair? Are their common issues with these types of vans? Does anyone have any experience driving these in colder conditions? I don't know, maybe some other stuff I'm forgetting. Thank you for all your help!",1,1756233353.0,VanLife,5,1.0,False

Also Charlotte i LOVE watching your videos, especially where you and Mike are both present :)   
  
I (39F) have had a lifelong best friend, V (39F). Our moms were best friends, pregnant at the same time, with us, and we grew up practically together. I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© (35M) for 10 years, we‚Äôre engaged, and V was going to be my MOH, though since the engagement in March our friendship began to fall apart.

A little background:  
About four months ago, V called me unexpectedly to ask if my fianc√© was controlling me. She assumed this for a few reasons, one being because I was looking at my phone a lot while at her house (I was organizing wedding ideas into a folder, to show her, my MOH) but she didnt think to ask, she just kept it in for 5 weeks. another being because I didn‚Äôt immediately answer her call while I was having a minor argument with my fianc√©. i was with my mother whilst taking this call and didnt want to cause stress or drama for her, so i let V talk, acknowledged what she said then ended the call, after she said if I ever had to choose between her or my fianc√©, I should choose him ‚Äî which I did.

During that conversation, she insulted my fianc√© repeatedly (calling him an arrogant pr1ck, saying he ‚Äúneeds to shut his mouth,‚Äù and claiming her partner ‚Äúmisses my ex‚Äù, and telling me she had to stop her partner coming to inflict violence on mine, il explan why, below). She also misrepresented incidents involving her children and mine. For example, in Nov 2024 i think, her son was handling my son‚Äôs expensive and rare collectibles inappropriately, putting them up his shirt, (my son wasnt here at the time either) and my fianc√©, who hardly knows this kid beyond short visits, asked a clarifying question ‚Äî she framed this as calling her child a thief, plus, excused it as 'he has ADHD, he just like to rub things on his tummy, no-one else has a problem with him doing it'. After this happened, her child (according to her) cried all the way home asking why we dont like him. This situation was further complicated by her double standards: she has another friend, D, whos child was in Vs childs school.

Anyway, back to the call. 

At the time i was on the phone with her, I tried to stay calm, set boundaries, and later texted her explaining I wasn‚Äôt happy with how she had treated my fianc√© and family. there was a little back and forth, including me highlighting what her partner had done to her, so maybe dont judge mine so harshly. the conversation ended with her threatening to come to my house to 'have it out'. she never showed.

Since the friendship ended, the worries about her child causing disruption at our wedding were lifted, the drama and stress that comes with the friendship (she has a lot of triggers and i hear about them every time they happen) has been like a weight lifted off my shoulders. somehow i feel more free and relaxed.

Additional context about her family situation:  
V‚Äôs partner has a long history of problematic behavior, he has gambled away money meant for the kids‚Äô Christmas presents, hidden drug use, used dating apps behind her back, and stayed up watching porn instead of sleeping next to her. Meanwhile, V tolerated this behavior and applied double standards when judging my fianc√© for normal couple interactions.

I did wonder if venting to V about minor arguments with my fianc√© colored her perception of him. However, she vents to me in the same way, and I still think her partner is cool. The difference is that her partner has repeatedly crossed major lines, and she projects her own issues onto my relationship.

Also Charlotte i LOVE watching your videos, especially where you and Mike are both present :)   
  
I (39F) have had a lifelong best friend, V (39F). Our moms were best friends, pregnant at the same time, with us, and we grew up practically together. I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© (35M) for 10 years, we‚Äôre engaged, and V was going to be my MOH, though since the engagement in March our friendship began to fall apart.

A little background:  
About four months ago, V called me unexpectedly to ask if my fianc√© was controlling me. She assumed this for a few reasons, one being because I was looking at my phone a lot while at her house (I was organizing wedding ideas into a folder, to show her, my MOH) but she didnt think to ask, she just kept it in for 5 weeks. another being because I didn‚Äôt immediately answer her call while I was having a minor argument with my fianc√©. i was with my mother whilst taking this call and didnt want to cause stress or drama for her, so i let V talk, acknowledged what she said then ended the call, after she said if I ever had to choose between her or my fianc√©, I should choose him ‚Äî which I did.

During that conversation, she insulted my fianc√© repeatedly (calling him an arrogant pr1ck, saying he ‚Äúneeds to shut his mouth,‚Äù and claiming her partner ‚Äúmisses my ex‚Äù, and telling me she had to stop her partner coming to inflict violence on mine, il explan why, below). She also misrepresented incidents involving her children and mine. For example, in Nov 2024 i think, her son was handling my son‚Äôs expensive and rare collectibles inappropriately, putting them up his shirt, (my son wasnt here at the time either) and my fianc√©, who hardly knows this kid beyond short visits, asked a clarifying question ‚Äî she framed this as calling her child a thief, plus, excused it as 'he has ADHD, he just like to rub things on his tummy, no-one else has a problem with him doing it'. After this happened, her child (according to her) cried all the way home asking why we dont like him. This situation was further complicated by her double standards: she has another friend, D, whos child was in Vs childs school. Ds kid bullied Vs kid relentlessly, to the point where V was sending me videos of her own kid saying he wanted to be unalived. much worse than telling her kid no and it making him cry, right? well she still took D out for breakfast every week whilst this was going on to her child, but my partner was a villain from one 'non enabling' situation....

I've been an avid coffee drinker since my early teens, but I mostly stuck to instant coffee for years. In June this year, I made the switch to pre-ground coffee using a South Indian coffee filter, and honestly, it's been a game changer.

I started off with Blue Tokai‚Äôs pre-ground coffee, which I really enjoyed. Recently, I picked up a pack from ODD Coffee (waiting for delivery).

Now I‚Äôm looking to explore more Indian coffee brands  preferably ones that are:

* Affordable (I‚Äôm a college student, so budget matters)
* Good for South Indian filter-style brewing
* Flavorful enough to enjoy daily

I'm open to both classic blends (with or without chicory) and more modern/specialty roasts as long as they aren‚Äôt *too* expensive.

Any recommendations from the community? Would love to hear your favorite go-to brands, hidden gems, or even any online stores that do good deals. Plus what other equipment should i get.

Yesterday, I (MTF, 31) passed out at work. I was low on sleep, hadn't eaten in a few days, was dehydrated, had too much caffeine, and had taken a new bus route that let off further from my place of employment than I thought--which would be fine at a different time of year, but in August, on a particularly humid day...  
  
Not to mention, 5+ years of coursing Estrogen have changed my tolerance for heat.  
  
Yeah, yeah, kinda my fault. Been having a rough time.  
  
Anyway, I arrive at my place of work, and with in like 2 minutes of waiting outside to come in, I apparently pass the fuck out.  
  
I come back to consciousness, and security has called paramedics. I try really hard to get them not to take me anywhere--I'm uninsured. I've also had some bad experiences with public safety since I came out and transitioned so many years ago--I had a similar fainting episode at a bus stop a year prior, and I was very definitely assumed to be a drugged-out sex worker (didn't help that my dress ripped in the process, my makeup was running down my face thanks to sweat, and I didn't have a permanent address at the time). Not that there is anything wrong with sex workers, it's just not what you want police to suspect you to be.  
  
Despite my protests (I don't blame my boss at ALL for this), I'm carted into the ambulance and driven to a nearby hospital. I start vomiting pretty bad (it's all black coffee, yay!). We make it to the hospital, attach me to an IV, and the questions start.  
  
Now, this is where the problems begin. See, the whole time until now, everybody has just assumed I'm a cis woman. That's how I'm treated at work (love my jobs), and EMTs/security/fire didn't act any differently. These are obviously people over never met, which is kinda part for the course these days. I guess this part is nice. They have no idea I'm trans. They don't do this mythical ""what is your gender"" thing that 'phobes think has corrupted our society. For the people who say they ""can always tell"": cool, but no.  
  
So I'm in a room,¬†and look, I've been trying to subtly hint. Just in case it may be necessary medical information, and also, sometimes people get pretty mean when they think they've been \*tricked\*. So I'm trying to discretely drop hints.. My legal name is different than my actual name (the change takes money), and the old one, while not the \*most\* masculine, is still more commonly a man's name (hence the change). And they are just NOT picking up what I'm putting down. Nurses are helping me get situated into a hospital gown (my brand new shirt is literally 100% soaked through with sweat), which obviously isn't helping me correct any assumptions because there's a bra and, like, the parts of the body that fill a bra under there. I'm being asked questions, they're doing tests, and we get to (I don't remember the exact phrasing, I was kinda out of it) questions about pregnancy. And I'm insistent that I can't be pregnant, because like, well, medical technology sure isn't there yet. But they badger me a bit there. I get more insistent. I'm not yelling--I really couldn't at the moment if I tried--but I do start laughing a little. Get some weird looks, but eventually, most of the nurses leave.  
  
I assume that's the end of it. We do the rest of the tests, I'm given a ton of fluids and some potassium, and so many hours later, I'm discharged with a packet of test results and the strong insistence to take better care of myself. Fine, I deserve that.  
  
I'm looking over what they tested this morning, because I'm trying to figure out how financially f\*\*\*ed I am, and low and behold, they ran a pregnancy test. Lower and beholder, it came back negative.  
  
Now this is the part where I'm wondering if I'd be the asshole. On the one hand, I really don't want to pay for it, and they didn't listen to or believe me. On the other hand, I think this could have been solved if I'd been more forward explaining that I'm trans. It just like didn't come up, and wouldn't without strongarming the issue, which tends to, y'know, make people hostile. There's a fair argument to be made that this is my chickens coming home to roost.  
  
So... would it be fair for me to protest the charge?",1,1756232892.0,AITAH,8,0.57,False

Nearly 40 woman w/ ADHD and anxiety/a sprinkle of regular depression since childhood, SUPER type A but trapped in a type B life. Married to college sweetheart, four kids under 10, three boys who are constantly dangerous/fighting/inventing new ways to get hurt... In college I took 20 mg adderall and did really great, though still ended up doing everything the night before it was due. The structure of school was such a blessing, graduating Magna cum Laude, leadership in of all the things, very involved, etc. After graduating I intended to go back for a higher degree (needed for my major) but put it off bc I was already anxious about the student loans, I put it off... I didn't end up going back, it just always felt like something I'd eventually do until it didn't. 

Husband ended up enlisting and I worked remotely full-time until we had kids. Fast forward nine years, four kids deep, husband thankfully God out last year bc I couldn't handle the single parent life anymore- it did significant damage to my mental health and our marriage.

He took a crazy pay cut to get out and we moved almost 6 hours away to restart. No family near, so starting fresh is hard. Anyway, things are just out of control every single day. I am in a CONSTANT state of flight or fight. I think about the same tasks on my to-do list repeatedly, every day, multiple times a day. Some are big projects- things I've even gotten all the necessary things for (like painting certain rooms, trying to learn to put up curtain rods or anchored pictures) but just cannot start. Some things are even quick, under ten minute some even one minute tasks, but I quickly forget and re-remember over and over and then am distracted again.  Like right now I needed to go buy kcups on Amazon and instead I've started researching ADHD paralysis etc. and found this group on reddit. Coffee hasn't been ordered. I don't even have the page one. 

Anyway, maybe 7 months ago I restarted adderall at 10mg which didn't do anything. Next I went back to 20mg like in college, which helps me WANT to get the things done but I still feel so overwhelmed by the 10000000000 task to do list that just is constantly being added to every room I walk into, every word anyone says, that I can usually do only something like laundry reliably. Something requiring no thought, just repetitive tasks.  Even making dinner is a terrible stressor every day and it's often 4/5pm and I don't know what I'm making still.  I can't even handle meal planning bc no child likes the same thing and it's just so overwhelming. 

I've asked my doctor to maybe increase the dosage, but she said to wait to see if adding Wellbutrin helped (which would also help boost my absolutely non-existent libidio which is at an all time new low- how can I think of doing anything like that when I can't even breathe), and now she moved states suddenly and I have to wait two months to even meet the new one physician. I also forgot to take said Wellbutrin for the last week and a half bc we went on vacation and I just totally forgot (and didn't take any medicines) so I don't know if I should bother restarting. I can't tell if it had any effect on me whatsoever. I also have seen an increase in taking .5 mg Xanax bc my the end of the day I just feel like I'm going to explode and scream with how overwhelmed I am and as soon as my husband hits the door I hide in my room for as long as I feel like I can to breathe again. 

I just feel like I am just drowning. I'm so short tempered, so exhausted, I just can't catch my breath. Instead, I often now find myself mentally checking out and scroll my phone and get annoyed when I'm brought back to reality by anyone.

My internal monologue and to do list just never ever stops and it feels like I'm just failing everywhere; my marriage, my home, my children (growing up in a messy messy house with no structure- I can't even implement chores despite knowing it would help us both. I've started and given up 100 times, tried chatGPT, fancy Skylight calendar has been sitting in the box since mother's day never turned on...slide chore charts, printed ones. I can't make it make sense in my head so I just get more stressed out trying implement anything at all. It doesn't help that my eldest son is also def ADHD and likely ODD.) 

I'm paralyzed and living in Groundhog Day/year/life suddenly and not so suddenly and I just can't get out of this horrible rut. I'm not the parent or wife I want to be, this isn't the life we all should be existing in. I feel so lost and guilty and overwhelmed and I just could use some advice or encouragement. I actually plan to show all this typed out to my doctor, all the way in November, to give them and idea of what I'm feeling right now.

I've previously been on Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and Prozac for depression. I don't really feel like any really made me feel any differently. The only thing I can actually feel like the adderall and Xanax (separately) but the adderall isn't enough and Xanax obviously can't be relied on long term- current doctor wouldn't even prescribe it but knew I had a bunch from my last prescription and was aware I'd take it occasionally. She also tried giving me Buspiron and Hydroxyzine instead of Xanax but neither did anything at all.

the only thing that‚Äôs helped me stop picking in the past was having acrylic nails. they made it difficult for my nails to penetrate the skin so i was able to heal much faster. i know that nails are against dress code but with how bad it‚Äôs been recently, i need to find a way to relieve the pain and break the habit. i would just get gel nails with no charms, just a plain nude color with the smallest possible extension. would my sm/dm be open to the idea of me getting accommodations for this? i can provide a doctors / therapists note. 

i know some partners got accommodations for their piercings so i was hoping i could there was some leniency, especially because mine is medical. does anyone know how this could work? ",0,1756232838.0,starbucksbaristas,17,0.47,False
1n0tqwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SECFilingsAI/comments/1n0tqwy/cimg_inc_quarterly_report_released_heres_what_you/,CIMG Inc. Quarterly Report Released - Here‚Äôs What You Should Know,"Report Summary

Key Financial Metrics (Quarter Ended December 31, 2024)
- Revenues: $22,853, down significantly from $965,932 in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting the reduction of the single-serving pour-over coffee packaging business.
- Gross Profit: $15,479 (Q1 FY2024) vs. $124,534 (Q1 FY2023).
- Operating Expenses: $1,517,758, lower than prior-year's $2,145,642 due to overall reduced business activity.
- Net Loss: $1,536,249, improved from a loss of $2,148,611 in the prior-year quarter.
- Comprehensive Loss: $1,728,287 including $192,038 in foreign currency translation loss.
- Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share: $(0.17), an improvement from $(1.84).
- Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: 8,982,676 vs. 1,168,221.
- Cash & Cash Equivalents: $124,715 at period end, down from $464,222 as of September 30, 2024.
- Inventories: $4,608,307, slightly higher than $4,548,035 at year-end.
- Total Assets: $5,167,814 (Sept 2024: $5,587,655).
- Total Liabilities: $3,640,244, a significant decrease from $6,238,323.
- Stockholders‚Äô Equity: $1,527,570, improved from a deficit of $(650,668).
- Net Cash Used in Operating Activities: $(1,338,781), an improvement compared to $(2,193,439) in the prior-year quarter.
- Recent Capital Raises: Convertible notes and private placements raised approximately $2,000,000 during the quarter; post-quarter, $10,000,000 through convertible notes and warrants, and $1,068,480 for 6,000,000 shares.

Risks
- Significant Revenue Decline: Revenues decreased nearly 98% YoY (from $965,932 to $22,853) due to reduction of core business lines, resulting in much lower gross profit ($15,479).
- Liquidity and Solvency: Cash position is weak at $124,715; company relies extensively on equity and convertible debt financing to fund operations. Total liabilities remain significant ($3.6M), with notable short-term obligations, including accounts payable/accrued expenses ($1.8M), short-term loans ($433,512), and convertible notes ($678,308).
- Customer Concentration: For Q1 FY2024, one customer (Customer LXM) contributed 59% of total revenue. Loss of key customers could materially impact ongoing revenues.
- Litigation: The company is involved in existing litigation (see Kim Litigation, Curtin Litigation, Ex-Directors Lawsuit). Legal costs or adverse outcomes could result in substantial obligations.
  - The Kim Litigation, filed October 3, 2024, in the Southern District of New York, is still unresolved and may have financial consequences.
  - Former directors brought suit against the company in March 2025.
- Ongoing Losses and Going Concern: The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, but the company's accumulated deficit ($83.9M), persistent negative cash flows, and dependence on continual external funding raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
- Geographic Concentration Shift: No North America revenue reported for the quarter; all revenues were from PRC, indicating regional business risk and less diversification.

Management Discussion and Outlook
- Strategic Refocus: The company has reduced its single-serving pour-over coffee business and shifted focus primarily to Asia, specifically PRC. Management notes the impact of changing consumer preferences and a reevaluation of product lines.
- Operating Expense Reduction: Management has cut operating expenses YoY (from $2.1M to $1.5M), citing reduced payroll and administrative costs as a result of divestitures and restructuring.
- Capital Raising: During the reported quarter and subsequent period, the company has been able to raise new capital ($10M convertible note, $1.1M share issue). All such activities are crucial given negative operating cash flows and limited remaining cash.
- Discontinued Operations: Previous loss drivers were divested, contributing to reduced losses, but have also impacted top-line growth. All discontinued operations had no impact in the most recent quarter, signaling completion of the transition.
- Inventory Management: Inventories increased slightly and may present risks regarding obsolescence if not aligned with new sales focus.
- Foreign Exchange Risk: The company reported a significant comprehensive loss component from FX translation ($192,038), reflecting sensitivity to currency fluctuations due to international exposure.
- Legal and Regulatory: Active legal cases are noted, and the company reserves the potential for future adverse outcomes and associated costs.

Investor Considerations
- The company‚Äôs financial condition remains precarious, characterized by ongoing operating losses, small cash reserves, and continual need for external financing.
- Near-term survival hinges on the timely completion of capital raises and successful defense or settlement of ongoing litigation.
- Execution of the new strategic focus, primarily in the PRC, has yet to demonstrate revenue recovery.
- Investors should closely monitor liquidity, legal proceedings, customer concentration, and management‚Äôs ability to execute on stated plans for restructuring and business focus.

PREP TIME: 20 min.      
COOK TIME: 45 min.    
SERVINGS: 9 serves.    

INGREDIENTS:   
‚Ä¢ 60 g Sugar ((can use granulated or white sugar)),    
‚Ä¢ 60 g Brown Sugar,   
‚Ä¢ 50 g All Purpose Flour
‚Ä¢ 1 g Cinnamon ((approx. 1 tsp - can add more if you like)),   
‚Ä¢ 60 g Butter ((cubed, cold)),   
‚Ä¢ 60 g Butter ((softened or melted - see notes)),    
‚Ä¢ 2 Eggs ((use 3 if your eggs are on the small side)),    
‚Ä¢ 150 g Sourdough Starter ((or sourdough starter discard)),   
‚Ä¢ 150 g Milk ((or can use buttermilk)),    
‚Ä¢ 5 g Vanilla Extract ((optional - can use almond extract)),   
‚Ä¢ 200 g All Purpose Flour,   
‚Ä¢ 10 g Baking Powder,   
‚Ä¢ 5 g Salt,     
‚Ä¢ 160 g White Sugar,   
‚Ä¢ 1 Lemon (zest only) ((can use orange if you prefer)),   
‚Ä¢ 350 g Blueberries ((fresh or frozen - see notes)),   

PREPARATION STEPS:    
1. Before you start, preheat your oven to 200C (390F) and lightly butter or spray with oil a 9"" x 9"" cake pan.    

2. Add the white or granulated sugar, brown sugar, all purpose flour and cinnamon to a small mixing bowl. Mix these together until well combined.    

3. Now add the cold, cubed butter to the top of this mixture and use your finger tips to rub the dry mixture into the butter until it resembles bread crumbs (it's ok if there are some clumps of butter still). Set this aside while you make the cake batter. If your kitchen is warm, pop this streusel topping in the freezer.   

4. Now mix the wet ingredients together in a bowl. So add the softened butter, eggs, sourdough starter, milk and vanilla extract to a bowl or batter jug and whisk until well combined. Set this aside.    

5. Next, combine the dry ingredients, excluding the blueberries, in a bowl and mix until well combined.     

6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together using a spatula until a light cake batter is formed. Set this aside.    

7. Now if you're using frozen blueberries (as you can see I am in the photos) you'll need to toss these in around 20g of flour before you use them. Do this now and then pop them aside while you assemble the cake.    

8. Now take the cake pan you prepared earlier and spread half the cake batter on the base. Then spread half the blueberries across the cake batter. Spread the rest of the cake batter over the blueberries and then add the rest of the blueberries over this so you should have now used up all of the batter and blueberries.      

9. Sprinkle all of the streusel topping over the top of the blueberries and batter and then place the sourdough blueberry buckle into the oven and bake for around 45 minutes at 200C (390F). You'll know the sourdough buckle is done when the streusel topping is golden brown and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cake.,    

10. You can serve this cake warm straight out of the pan. To do this, I just a lasagne server to cut and lever the warm buckle out. If you want to slice it evenly, I find it's best to wait until it's cool and then remove from the pan and slice with a serrated knife.    

NOTES:      
This sourdough blueberry buckle is a tender, streusel-topped coffee cake that‚Äôs bursting with juicy blueberries (you can use fresh or frozen) and a subtle tang from your sourdough starter. Use either active sourdough starter or discard for a delicious, no-waste treat perfect for breakfast or dessert!

I enter the store, usually empty or max. 3 other people inside. I browse the 10-15 different jerseys, some bibs that I have all seen on the website. There are rarely any sales, the prices are pretty hefty (as I knew). There is an espresso bar where there is between zero to two customers. I usually leave the store after around 10 minutes and feel a bit frustrated having made the effort to go there in the first place.

On YouTube the cycling influencers usually rave about these stores, the friendly atmosphere, the phantastic coffee... but really, what on earth do you do there? Most people buy the clothes online in a sale or with a Strava code, no? I have no idea if the coffee is good but there are many places in Berlin and NYC with good coffee. I can't imagine to start about casual conversation about cycling with the shop owner.

Sorry for the rant but maybe someone can enlighten me how to ""use"" a Rapha store (or maybe it's only for those who live next door and go on group rides?).",11,1756232751.0,Rapha,14,0.92,False

The room doesn‚Äôt imprison you‚Äîit convinces you that you left of your own free will.

But every hallway I manage to escape becomes a replica, a false sense of security and safety. Grief doesn‚Äôt die; it decorates. 

It builds walls out of the memories that I don‚Äôt trust, gifts me keys I don‚Äôt remember earning, and it multiplies the number of doors I must walk through.

Some doors lead to moments that I swore never happened, but I couldn‚Äôt tell you if they did or not. Others feel too tender to be false. 

The room knows that I will open any door if I think she‚Äôs behind it.

My one hope is finding the right door so that I can take my little girl home‚Ä¶

If haven‚Äôt read parts 1, 2, or 3, I urge you to start there. What follows won‚Äôt make sense otherwise.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I navigated my way through the thick darkness of the closet only to emerge back into the hallway this time.

Not in bed. Not on the floor.

Just‚Ä¶ there.

Too quiet. Too clean. Too curated.

My knees gave out and I slid down the wall, slumping against the peeling wallpaper like a drunk dragged out mid-dream. 

The rough texture of the wallpaper pricked at my skin like thorns as the lights above me buzzed with indecision ‚Äî flickering in and out, caught between seconds.

For a long moment, I couldn‚Äôt move.

I didn‚Äôt want to.

Because I knew the truth before I even looked:

I was back.
Not free.
Just deeper.

I stood slowly, joints stiff, breath stale in my throat.

And that‚Äôs when I saw them.

Not one Room 409.

But two.

One door ‚Äî rusted over, scorched black around the handle like it had once been set ablaze.

The other ‚Äî soft sea-glass green, lit from within by the kind of warmth only nostalgia can fake.

I reached for the burnt door first only to realize it wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Locked.

The green one?

It opened by itself, as if imploring me to explore its interior.

The hallway behind me vanished. The path led only forward now.

I walked into the room slowly only to realize that this was my own living room. It didn‚Äôt feel like home though.

It felt like a replica, like a too-perfect stage set, waiting for actors who never come. The throw blanket was folded neatly across the arm of the couch, the air was stale, but free of dust. Familiar, but‚Ä¶ wrong.

It was as if someone had reconstructed it from memory instead of experience.

There was a book on the coffee table that I didn‚Äôt recognize.

A Study of Grief in Nonlinear Time

I picked it up to study it further and noticed that there was no author or a barcode.

I opened the cover and noticed a handwritten note inscribed on the first page:

‚ÄúWhat you bury does not die. It waits in corners, closets, and in the reflection that lags a little too long.‚Äù

My hands were shaking before I realized I was holding the journal again, but not in my hands...in my daughter‚Äôs hands.

I screamed in fright and dropped the journal but like a cat that lands on its feet, it landed perfectly, open.

New words filled the page where the old ones were:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one who lived here. Memory is a hallway. You didn‚Äôt build all the doors.‚Äù

I backed away from the journal quickly and noticed that silence of the house had grown deafening.

I moved room to room ‚Äî kitchen, bedroom, hallway ‚Äî every space eerily pristine, untouched like a crime scene scrubbed clean. Sanitized grief.

That is when it shifted.

The hallway lengthened to disorienting proportions.

It was subtle at first. A few extra inches. Then feet. Then yards.

That old rose-colored wallpaper peeled from the edges, revealing something familiar beneath it.

The bones of Room 409.

It was bleeding through my life again.

I followed.

‚∏ª

The door was new this time.

It was sea-glass green.

Worn brass knob scuffed down to silver, a victim to the erosion of time.

I hesitated before I opened it.

Inside, a child‚Äôs room awaited me. But it was not Emily‚Äôs.

Different toys littered the floor, and the walls were covered in drawings I didn‚Äôt recognize. They consisted of stick figures with hands too long, all smiling like they didn‚Äôt know how not to.

And in the center of the bed sat a boy.

He had chestnut brown hair with tiny freckles that adorned his face. He had eyes that looked far too old to belong to someone that small.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I froze, unsure who this child was. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in the wrong‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came back,‚Äù he said.

I blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly as if he found my question funny. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

It was in that moment that I felt it. That static that buzzed behind my eyes like a hive of enraged hornets. The one I‚Äôd learned to associate with the room.

It was watching me again.

The boy‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúYou remember her, don‚Äôt you? Your daughter?‚Äù

I nodded stiffly, fear guiding my movements like a marionette.

‚ÄúThen remember me.‚Äù

The walls vibrated intensely as the drawings that decorated them on them twisted and distorted until the stick figures became‚Ä¶me.

The drawings depicted me crying, screaming, blank faced and standing in between a black and green door.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The question lurching from my throat.

The boy stood up from his position on the bed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the morning you left the blinds closed. The day her laugh slipped away. The moment you stopped caring ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the version of you that never left the room.‚Äù

The sound of a door screeching open came from behind me.

I turned to see that it wasn‚Äôt a closet anymore that I was looking at.

It was a hospital room, Emily‚Äôs hospital room.

The bed was empty, the sheets disheveled. Mr. Grey, the stuffed elephant was torn apart, the stuffing strewn across the linoleum like snow.

When I turned back, the boy was gone. The journal was in the place where he had been standing.

A new page was open for me to read:

‚ÄúYou thought grief ended when the tears stopped. But silence is where it grows strongest.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I ran through shifting rooms and bending hallways.

Furniture contorted into unnamable shapes.

Doorways opened into impossible spaces ‚Äî reality glitching and gasping for its final breaths.

Static droned in my ears as Emily‚Äôs voice echoed from within the walls like a voice trapped inside a cave.

Faint. Distant. Warped.

‚ÄúYou left me in the dark too long. I became something else.‚Äù

I burst into the living room again‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.

The photographs were all wrong.

One showed me with no face.
In another, Claire‚Äôs eyes were scratched out.
In the last, Emily stood alone at the playground by the swing set.

I rushed to the front door and pulled at the door begging to be free but‚Ä¶

Nothing.

It wasn‚Äôt stuck. It wasn‚Äôt locked.

It just‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt real.

‚∏ª

The journal was waiting for me on the dining table, like a guest waiting for dinner.

I didn‚Äôt want to read it, but at the same time‚Ä¶I did.

With morbid curiosity, my eyes befell the pages again.

‚ÄúSometimes the room doesn‚Äôt show you what happened. Sometimes it shows you what you‚Äôre becoming.‚Äù

Then came the knocks.

Soft, restrained.

At the window.

I looked to see that standing outside, in the rain‚Ä¶was me.

A younger version of me somehow.

His eyes were wilder than mine, consumed with grief. A cracked and splintered smile adorned his face.

He was clutching something in his hand, something I recognized immediately.

It was a room key.

409.

He raised his hand and dropped it on the windowsill, before turning to walk away.

I flung the window open and cried out after him.

But there was no man or rain, just a hallway.

It was stretched out like an open wound, the rose wallpaper pulsing beneath the beige paint like a beast in a deep slumber.

My world had become the room.

‚∏ª

I collapsed onto the couch in a disheveled heap, unsure if I was exhausted or just empty.

The air buzzed slightly, not with sound but with sorrow.

It had shape now, actual weight to it.

Then a voice permeated from the walls.

It wasn‚Äôt Claire‚Äôs or Emily‚Äôs voice I heard, it was my own. 

But it was older, gruff, significantly more bitter.

Worn down by time, guilt, and memory.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bury grief like a body. It doesn‚Äôt rot‚Äîit roots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked, uncertainty dripping in every word of my question.

‚ÄúYou do the hardest thing, you remember everything. Even the parts that hurt, those especially.‚Äù

The voice dissipated as yet another door appeared before me.

It was sea-glass green again.

It opened before I reached for it.

I stepped through and saw the same child‚Äôs room as before only now the boy was gone.

The bed sat empty, perfectly undisturbed like a lie frozen in time. 

On the wall rested a mirror.

That wasn‚Äôt there last time‚Ä¶I thought as I found myself walking towards it.

I closed my eyes, fearful of the reflection that awaited me.

I opened them slowly, reluctantly.

It revealed‚Ä¶me.

Finally, me.

There was no smile, no delay.

The man in the mirror perfectly reflected me.

For the first time in what felt like hours‚Ä¶ days‚Ä¶ maybe years‚Ä¶

My reflection wasn‚Äôt lying.

Beside me, the journal hovered in the air like it had been waiting for this exact moment.

The pages turned like a wind was directing it to do so until it landed on the final page.

It read:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about leaving the room. It‚Äôs about choosing what you bring with you when you do.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look away from the mirror, I held my gaze like I was delivering a testimony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù I spoke, my eyes focusing with intent.

My reflection nodded as if to say: For now.

The room didn‚Äôt slam shut; it quietly closed and folded like a book after its final chapter.

The air became heavier, warmer, as if someone had been crying in it for hours.

I turned back to see that the hallway was gone and had been replaced with a stairwell.

There was no railing, just worn wooden steps spiraling downward into the cold depths below.

As I approached, I noticed something was carved into the first step:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve remembered too much to go back.‚Äù

I swallowed nervously and took the stairs one step at a time, slowly descending towards whatever fate awaited me at the bottom.

Each step beneath my feet echoed wrong.

Not with footsteps but with faint whispers.

‚ÄúIt was your fault.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt there.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe was waiting.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

I tried to remember her laugh but the room was louder, it drowned out my every thought like TV static.

It was enough to make me scream but I stayed resilient until I made it to the bottom.

When I reached the last stair, I noticed a door.

It was unmarked and‚Ä¶weeping?

Thick, blackened water leaked from beneath it. Slow as molasses. Heavy as oil.

I reached for the handle and felt a harsh heat burn my palm like the room on the other side was ablaze.

I pulled away, but the door opened on its own accord.

Inside: a kitchen.

The low sound of a child laughing from another room.

It felt familiar and safe.

Too safe.

It felt like a trap disguised as comfort. 

Every chair was perfectly angled. Every photo frame dustless. The lamp light illuminated the room in a soft gold, like memory filtered through nostalgia.

I stepped toward the counter and noticed an open lunchbox sitting there. It was a deep shade of purple and covered in stars.

A sticky note sat beside it.

It read:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do better today. I believe in you.‚Äù ‚Äî Dad

I stared at the note. It was in my handwriting, but I never wrote it.

The hallway compelled me toward the framed photos lining the wall.

Birthday parties she never had. 

Beach vacations we never took. 

Her graduation, years too far ahead.

All these memories decorated the wall.

I reached out to touch one and felt the image ripple, like I was touching water.

The room wasn‚Äôt showing the past; it was fabricating an entire future.

It was nothing more than an elaborate lie.

It was offering forgiveness I hadn‚Äôt earned.

And I almost accepted its apology.

Almost.

That is, until I saw the final door.

It was a small and narrow closet.

Inside, sat a woman in a chair. Head bowed as if she were napping.

‚ÄúClaire?‚Äù Her name hung in the air in quiet suspension as I awaited a response.

She lifted her head slowly to reveal her bloodshot eyes and sickly pale skin.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here,‚Äù she warned tiredly.

I knelt beside her, ‚ÄúI had to know.‚Äù

She looked at me with something like pity. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason we buried it. The room showed me too. What comes after and what you won‚Äôt survive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did it show you?‚Äù I pleaded, eager for more answers.

Her pregnant pause filled my heart with tension before she finally spoke to me again:

‚ÄúEmily and I‚Ä¶ we forgave you, didn‚Äôt we? That‚Äôs what you needed us to do...what you wanted.‚Äù

I reached for her hand.

It was cold but not lifeless.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not her.‚Äù I acknowledged as I pulled my hand away.

She offered a soft smile laced with sadness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the version of me you needed. The peace you imagined. Not the truth.‚Äù

I stood and watched as the closet and the darkness behind her deepen.

In the distance, I could see the faint outline of the three numbers on a placard that have come to haunt me:

409.

The loop always ends here.

I looked down one last time, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

Claire nodded, ‚ÄúAnd neither is the version of you that keeps pretending you‚Äôre healing.‚Äù

She faded before my eyes as did the world around us as I found myself back inside Room 409, alone.

Then came several loud knocks.

At first, I thought it came from the door. Then I realized that they were coming from beneath the bed.

I slowly crouched to peek underneath.

There was no figure, just a piece of folded paper.

It was written in Emily‚Äôs handwriting.

‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd stay but you left me with the room.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees and wept, the emotional dam finally giving way.

My tears were not ones of fear; they were of recognition from finally understanding that I had never left.

My body went home, filed reports, and wore smiles.

But the part of me that held her hand when the machines turned off?

That part never made it out.

And the room?

It fed that part comfort, false memories, and just enough hope to continue to play pretend, until the truth was just one version of the story.

I wiped the tears that stained my face and saw it.

A door had manifested itself in the middle of the room.

It was new, but not.

The door was numbered:

409.

The journal sat in front of it, its pages fluttering.

I opened it and noticed there was only one line embedded into the page:

‚ÄúIf you walk through this door, there‚Äôs no forgetting again.‚Äù

I turned the page.

Blank.

Except, there was a key.

Etched into it were the numbers 409.

And beneath it, Emily‚Äôs name.

I whispered it aloud like prayer, surrendering myself to the room.

It shuddered and drew its breath before letting out an exhale that felt final before I opened the door and stepped through the doorway.

Inside, things were familiar once again, but not mine. 

The room looked almost untouched: bed made, curtains drawn, no blood on the carpet. There were details I couldn‚Äôt explain, however. 

There was a pair of women‚Äôs shoes by the dresser and a little girl‚Äôs coat draped over the chair. 

Static blared from the TV in a deafening manner as I approached it.

As I got closer, I noticed a VHS tape resting on the nightstand.

Its worn-out label read: Room 409 ‚Äî short film.

I inserted the tape into the battered VCR under the television and watched the screen crackle to life. 

At first, only a title card: The Lotus Hotel presents‚Ä¶

Then: me. Standing with Brenner and other investigators in a brightly lit room, looking down at the photographs of a man and a woman, narrating the scene.

Only‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt speaking. My mouth moved, but a different voice spilled out ‚Äî slower, brittle, almost stitched together from a dozen different recordings like memories falsifying their own reconstruction.

A voice made from fragments rather than complete thoughts.

The lines it spoke‚Ä¶ they were mine. 

From the briefing with Brenner. 

From the report. 

From the story I told myself.

‚ÄúThe detective believes he‚Äôs solving a crime‚Ä¶ but what he‚Äôs really doing is running from the ending.‚Äù

I shut it off and as I did, the light to the bathroom turned on.

It was like I was being beckoned by the room to explore further.

I headed towards the bathroom and found a file folder on the sink. 

The cover bore my name, handwritten.

Inside were intake forms, psych evaluations, and words like disassociation and trauma-fueled construct. 

There were dates on the reports as well. Some matched the timeline I remembered, and others were from almost a decade earlier. 

There was even a photo of me. I had shorter hair, wore a hospital bracelet, and had eyes that looked like they hadn‚Äôt slept in years.

That‚Äôs when I noticed it: the mirror behind the sink.

And the version of me staring back.

He didn‚Äôt move when I did. He didn‚Äôt flinch when I recoiled. He just stood there, smiling. Slowly. Sadly.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I trembled.

He mouthed back: ‚ÄúThe real one. The one who never left.‚Äù

I ran out of the bathroom and down the hallway, adrenaline coursing through my veins as my feet thudded against the carpeted flooring.

My feet guided me through the stairwell. The lobby flickered‚Äîpristine, then rotted‚Äîtwo timelines fighting to overwrite one another. 

A bellhop stood at the front desk, humming to himself.

When I approached, he turned‚Äîand had my face.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Mr. Cartwright,‚Äù he said courteously. ‚ÄúWill you be staying with us long this time?‚Äù

I backed away, the color draining from my face as the elevator dinged behind me. 

I watched the doors open and heard a child‚Äôs voice singing softly from within.

Emily‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRow, row, row your boat‚Ä¶‚Äù

I practically leapt into the elevator and pressed the buttons in a frantic plea that one of them will lead me towards the exit.

I hit every floor. Each opened to a different version of the Lotus. One looked like a hospital. One like a courtroom. One like a funeral home. In one, I saw myself sitting with a doctor. In another, I stood at a graveside alone.

All timelines. All versions of me.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Eventually, I made it back to Room 409‚Äîthe original one, I think. Or maybe a new copy. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

I stepped inside. The lights were dim. Dust settled in slow motion. The air felt ancient.

And there, burned into the wallpaper above the bed in blackened letters:

The room doesn‚Äôt imprison you‚Äîit convinces you that you left of your own free will.

But every hallway I manage to escape becomes a replica, a false sense of security and safety. Grief doesn‚Äôt die; it decorates. 

It builds walls out of the memories that I don‚Äôt trust, gifts me keys I don‚Äôt remember earning, and it multiplies the number of doors I must walk through.

Some doors lead to moments that I swore never happened, but I couldn‚Äôt tell you if they did or not. Others feel too tender to be false. 

The room knows that I will open any door if I think she‚Äôs behind it.

My one hope is finding the right door so that I can take my little girl home‚Ä¶

If haven‚Äôt read parts 1, 2, or 3, I urge you to start there. What follows won‚Äôt make sense otherwise.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I navigated my way through the thick darkness of the closet only to emerge back into the hallway this time.

Not in bed. Not on the floor.

Just‚Ä¶ there.

Too quiet. Too clean. Too curated.

My knees gave out and I slid down the wall, slumping against the peeling wallpaper like a drunk dragged out mid-dream. 

The rough texture of the wallpaper pricked at my skin like thorns as the lights above me buzzed with indecision ‚Äî flickering in and out, caught between seconds.

For a long moment, I couldn‚Äôt move.

I didn‚Äôt want to.

Because I knew the truth before I even looked:

I was back.
Not free.
Just deeper.

I stood slowly, joints stiff, breath stale in my throat.

And that‚Äôs when I saw them.

Not one Room 409.

But two.

One door ‚Äî rusted over, scorched black around the handle like it had once been set ablaze.

The other ‚Äî soft sea-glass green, lit from within by the kind of warmth only nostalgia can fake.

I reached for the burnt door first only to realize it wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Locked.

The green one?

It opened by itself, as if imploring me to explore its interior.

The hallway behind me vanished. The path led only forward now.

I walked into the room slowly only to realize that this was my own living room. It didn‚Äôt feel like home though.

It felt like a replica, like a too-perfect stage set, waiting for actors who never come. The throw blanket was folded neatly across the arm of the couch, the air was stale, but free of dust. Familiar, but‚Ä¶ wrong.

It was as if someone had reconstructed it from memory instead of experience.

There was a book on the coffee table that I didn‚Äôt recognize.

A Study of Grief in Nonlinear Time

I picked it up to study it further and noticed that there was no author or a barcode.

I opened the cover and noticed a handwritten note inscribed on the first page:

‚ÄúWhat you bury does not die. It waits in corners, closets, and in the reflection that lags a little too long.‚Äù

My hands were shaking before I realized I was holding the journal again, but not in my hands...in my daughter‚Äôs hands.

I screamed in fright and dropped the journal but like a cat that lands on its feet, it landed perfectly, open.

New words filled the page where the old ones were:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one who lived here. Memory is a hallway. You didn‚Äôt build all the doors.‚Äù

I backed away from the journal quickly and noticed that silence of the house had grown deafening.

I moved room to room ‚Äî kitchen, bedroom, hallway ‚Äî every space eerily pristine, untouched like a crime scene scrubbed clean. Sanitized grief.

That is when it shifted.

The hallway lengthened to disorienting proportions.

It was subtle at first. A few extra inches. Then feet. Then yards.

That old rose-colored wallpaper peeled from the edges, revealing something familiar beneath it.

The bones of Room 409.

It was bleeding through my life again.

I followed.

‚∏ª

The door was new this time.

It was sea-glass green.

Worn brass knob scuffed down to silver, a victim to the erosion of time.

I hesitated before I opened it.

Inside, a child‚Äôs room awaited me. But it was not Emily‚Äôs.

Different toys littered the floor, and the walls were covered in drawings I didn‚Äôt recognize. They consisted of stick figures with hands too long, all smiling like they didn‚Äôt know how not to.

And in the center of the bed sat a boy.

He had chestnut brown hair with tiny freckles that adorned his face. He had eyes that looked far too old to belong to someone that small.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I froze, unsure who this child was. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in the wrong‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came back,‚Äù he said.

I blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly as if he found my question funny. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

It was in that moment that I felt it. That static that buzzed behind my eyes like a hive of enraged hornets. The one I‚Äôd learned to associate with the room.

It was watching me again.

The boy‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúYou remember her, don‚Äôt you? Your daughter?‚Äù

I nodded stiffly, fear guiding my movements like a marionette.

‚ÄúThen remember me.‚Äù

The walls vibrated intensely as the drawings that decorated them on them twisted and distorted until the stick figures became‚Ä¶me.

The drawings depicted me crying, screaming, blank faced and standing in between a black and green door.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The question lurching from my throat.

The boy stood up from his position on the bed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the morning you left the blinds closed. The day her laugh slipped away. The moment you stopped caring ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the version of you that never left the room.‚Äù

The sound of a door screeching open came from behind me.

I turned to see that it wasn‚Äôt a closet anymore that I was looking at.

It was a hospital room, Emily‚Äôs hospital room.

The bed was empty, the sheets disheveled. Mr. Grey, the stuffed elephant was torn apart, the stuffing strewn across the linoleum like snow.

When I turned back, the boy was gone. The journal was in the place where he had been standing.

A new page was open for me to read:

‚ÄúYou thought grief ended when the tears stopped. But silence is where it grows strongest.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I ran through shifting rooms and bending hallways.

Furniture contorted into unnamable shapes.

Doorways opened into impossible spaces ‚Äî reality glitching and gasping for its final breaths.

Static droned in my ears as Emily‚Äôs voice echoed from within the walls like a voice trapped inside a cave.

Faint. Distant. Warped.

‚ÄúYou left me in the dark too long. I became something else.‚Äù

I burst into the living room again‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.

The photographs were all wrong.

One showed me with no face.
In another, Claire‚Äôs eyes were scratched out.
In the last, Emily stood alone at the playground by the swing set.

I rushed to the front door and pulled at the door begging to be free but‚Ä¶

Nothing.

It wasn‚Äôt stuck. It wasn‚Äôt locked.

It just‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt real.

‚∏ª

The journal was waiting for me on the dining table, like a guest waiting for dinner.

I didn‚Äôt want to read it, but at the same time‚Ä¶I did.

With morbid curiosity, my eyes befell the pages again.

‚ÄúSometimes the room doesn‚Äôt show you what happened. Sometimes it shows you what you‚Äôre becoming.‚Äù

Then came the knocks.

Soft, restrained.

At the window.

I looked to see that standing outside, in the rain‚Ä¶was me.

A younger version of me somehow.

His eyes were wilder than mine, consumed with grief. A cracked and splintered smile adorned his face.

He was clutching something in his hand, something I recognized immediately.

It was a room key.

409.

He raised his hand and dropped it on the windowsill, before turning to walk away.

I flung the window open and cried out after him.

But there was no man or rain, just a hallway.

It was stretched out like an open wound, the rose wallpaper pulsing beneath the beige paint like a beast in a deep slumber.

My world had become the room.

‚∏ª

I collapsed onto the couch in a disheveled heap, unsure if I was exhausted or just empty.

The air buzzed slightly, not with sound but with sorrow.

It had shape now, actual weight to it.

Then a voice permeated from the walls.

It wasn‚Äôt Claire‚Äôs or Emily‚Äôs voice I heard, it was my own. 

But it was older, gruff, significantly more bitter.

Worn down by time, guilt, and memory.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bury grief like a body. It doesn‚Äôt rot‚Äîit roots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked, uncertainty dripping in every word of my question.

‚ÄúYou do the hardest thing, you remember everything. Even the parts that hurt, those especially.‚Äù

The voice dissipated as yet another door appeared before me.

It was sea-glass green again.

It opened before I reached for it.

I stepped through and saw the same child‚Äôs room as before only now the boy was gone.

The bed sat empty, perfectly undisturbed like a lie frozen in time. 

On the wall rested a mirror.

That wasn‚Äôt there last time‚Ä¶I thought as I found myself walking towards it.

I closed my eyes, fearful of the reflection that awaited me.

I opened them slowly, reluctantly.

It revealed‚Ä¶me.

Finally, me.

There was no smile, no delay.

The man in the mirror perfectly reflected me.

For the first time in what felt like hours‚Ä¶ days‚Ä¶ maybe years‚Ä¶

My reflection wasn‚Äôt lying.

Beside me, the journal hovered in the air like it had been waiting for this exact moment.

The pages turned like a wind was directing it to do so until it landed on the final page.

It read:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about leaving the room. It‚Äôs about choosing what you bring with you when you do.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look away from the mirror, I held my gaze like I was delivering a testimony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù I spoke, my eyes focusing with intent.

My reflection nodded as if to say: For now.

The room didn‚Äôt slam shut; it quietly closed and folded like a book after its final chapter.

The air became heavier, warmer, as if someone had been crying in it for hours.

I turned back to see that the hallway was gone and had been replaced with a stairwell.

There was no railing, just worn wooden steps spiraling downward into the cold depths below.

As I approached, I noticed something was carved into the first step:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve remembered too much to go back.‚Äù

I swallowed nervously and took the stairs one step at a time, slowly descending towards whatever fate awaited me at the bottom.

Each step beneath my feet echoed wrong.

Not with footsteps but with faint whispers.

‚ÄúIt was your fault.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt there.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe was waiting.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

I tried to remember her laugh but the room was louder, it drowned out my every thought like TV static.

It was enough to make me scream but I stayed resilient until I made it to the bottom.

When I reached the last stair, I noticed a door.

It was unmarked and‚Ä¶weeping?

Thick, blackened water leaked from beneath it. Slow as molasses. Heavy as oil.

I reached for the handle and felt a harsh heat burn my palm like the room on the other side was ablaze.

I pulled away, but the door opened on its own accord.

Inside: a kitchen.

The low sound of a child laughing from another room.

It felt familiar and safe.

Too safe.

It felt like a trap disguised as comfort. 

Every chair was perfectly angled. Every photo frame dustless. The lamp light illuminated the room in a soft gold, like memory filtered through nostalgia.

I stepped toward the counter and noticed an open lunchbox sitting there. It was a deep shade of purple and covered in stars.

A sticky note sat beside it.

It read:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do better today. I believe in you.‚Äù ‚Äî Dad

I stared at the note. It was in my handwriting, but I never wrote it.

The hallway compelled me toward the framed photos lining the wall.

Beach vacations we never took.

All these memories decorated the wall.

If haven‚Äôt read parts 1, 2, or 3, I urge you to start there. What follows won‚Äôt make sense otherwise.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I navigated my way through the thick darkness of the closet only to emerge back into the hallway this time.

Not in bed. Not on the floor.

Just‚Ä¶ there.

Too quiet. Too clean. Too curated.

My knees gave out and I slid down the wall, slumping against the peeling wallpaper like a drunk dragged out mid-dream. 

The rough texture of the wallpaper pricked at my skin like thorns as the lights above me buzzed with indecision ‚Äî flickering in and out, caught between seconds.

For a long moment, I couldn‚Äôt move.

I didn‚Äôt want to.

Because I knew the truth before I even looked:

I was back.
Not free.
Just deeper.

I stood slowly, joints stiff, breath stale in my throat.

And that‚Äôs when I saw them.

Not one Room 409.

But two.

One door ‚Äî rusted over, scorched black around the handle like it had once been set ablaze.

The other ‚Äî soft sea-glass green, lit from within by the kind of warmth only nostalgia can fake.

I reached for the burnt door first only to realize it wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Locked.

The green one?

It opened by itself, as if imploring me to explore its interior.

The hallway behind me vanished. The path led only forward now.

I walked into the room slowly only to realize that this was my own living room. It didn‚Äôt feel like home though.

It felt like a replica, like a too-perfect stage set, waiting for actors who never come. The throw blanket was folded neatly across the arm of the couch, the air was stale, but free of dust. Familiar, but‚Ä¶ wrong.

It was as if someone had reconstructed it from memory instead of experience.

There was a book on the coffee table that I didn‚Äôt recognize.

A Study of Grief in Nonlinear Time

I picked it up to study it further and noticed that there was no author or a barcode.

I opened the cover and noticed a handwritten note inscribed on the first page:

‚ÄúWhat you bury does not die. It waits in corners, closets, and in the reflection that lags a little too long.‚Äù

My hands were shaking before I realized I was holding the journal again, but not in my hands...in my daughter‚Äôs hands.

I screamed in fright and dropped the journal but like a cat that lands on its feet, it landed perfectly, open.

New words filled the page where the old ones were:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one who lived here. Memory is a hallway. You didn‚Äôt build all the doors.‚Äù

I backed away from the journal quickly and noticed that silence of the house had grown deafening.

I moved room to room ‚Äî kitchen, bedroom, hallway ‚Äî every space eerily pristine, untouched like a crime scene scrubbed clean. Sanitized grief.

That is when it shifted.

The hallway lengthened to disorienting proportions.

It was subtle at first. A few extra inches. Then feet. Then yards.

That old rose-colored wallpaper peeled from the edges, revealing something familiar beneath it.

The bones of Room 409.

It was bleeding through my life again.

I followed.

‚∏ª

The door was new this time.

It was sea-glass green.

Worn brass knob scuffed down to silver, a victim to the erosion of time.

I hesitated before I opened it.

Inside, a child‚Äôs room awaited me. But it was not Emily‚Äôs.

Different toys littered the floor, and the walls were covered in drawings I didn‚Äôt recognize. They consisted of stick figures with hands too long, all smiling like they didn‚Äôt know how not to.

And in the center of the bed sat a boy.

He had chestnut brown hair with tiny freckles that adorned his face. He had eyes that looked far too old to belong to someone that small.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I froze, unsure who this child was. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in the wrong‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came back,‚Äù he said.

I blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly as if he found my question funny. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

It was in that moment that I felt it. That static that buzzed behind my eyes like a hive of enraged hornets. The one I‚Äôd learned to associate with the room.

It was watching me again.

The boy‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúYou remember her, don‚Äôt you? Your daughter?‚Äù

I nodded stiffly, fear guiding my movements like a marionette.

‚ÄúThen remember me.‚Äù

The walls vibrated intensely as the drawings that decorated them on them twisted and distorted until the stick figures became‚Ä¶me.

The drawings depicted me crying, screaming, blank faced and standing in between a black and green door.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The question lurching from my throat.

The boy stood up from his position on the bed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the morning you left the blinds closed. The day her laugh slipped away. The moment you stopped caring ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the version of you that never left the room.‚Äù

The sound of a door screeching open came from behind me.

I turned to see that it wasn‚Äôt a closet anymore that I was looking at.

It was a hospital room, Emily‚Äôs hospital room.

The bed was empty, the sheets disheveled. Mr. Grey, the stuffed elephant was torn apart, the stuffing strewn across the linoleum like snow.

When I turned back, the boy was gone. The journal was in the place where he had been standing.

A new page was open for me to read:

‚ÄúYou thought grief ended when the tears stopped. But silence is where it grows strongest.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I ran through shifting rooms and bending hallways.

Furniture contorted into unnamable shapes.

Doorways opened into impossible spaces ‚Äî reality glitching and gasping for its final breaths.

Static droned in my ears as Emily‚Äôs voice echoed from within the walls like a voice trapped inside a cave.

Faint. Distant. Warped.

‚ÄúYou left me in the dark too long. I became something else.‚Äù

I burst into the living room again‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.

The photographs were all wrong.

One showed me with no face.
In another, Claire‚Äôs eyes were scratched out.
In the last, Emily stood alone at the playground by the swing set.

I rushed to the front door and pulled at the door begging to be free but‚Ä¶

Nothing.

It wasn‚Äôt stuck. It wasn‚Äôt locked.

It just‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt real.

‚∏ª

The journal was waiting for me on the dining table, like a guest waiting for dinner.

I didn‚Äôt want to read it, but at the same time‚Ä¶I did.

With morbid curiosity, my eyes befell the pages again.

‚ÄúSometimes the room doesn‚Äôt show you what happened. Sometimes it shows you what you‚Äôre becoming.‚Äù

Then came the knocks.

Soft, restrained.

At the window.

I looked to see that standing outside, in the rain‚Ä¶was me.

A younger version of me somehow.

His eyes were wilder than mine, consumed with grief. A cracked and splintered smile adorned his face.

He was clutching something in his hand, something I recognized immediately.

It was a room key.

409.

He raised his hand and dropped it on the windowsill, before turning to walk away.

I flung the window open and cried out after him.

But there was no man or rain, just a hallway.

It was stretched out like an open wound, the rose wallpaper pulsing beneath the beige paint like a beast in a deep slumber.

My world had become the room.

‚∏ª

I collapsed onto the couch in a disheveled heap, unsure if I was exhausted or just empty.

The air buzzed slightly, not with sound but with sorrow.

It had shape now, actual weight to it.

Then a voice permeated from the walls.

It wasn‚Äôt Claire‚Äôs or Emily‚Äôs voice I heard, it was my own. 

But it was older, gruff, significantly more bitter.

Worn down by time, guilt, and memory.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bury grief like a body. It doesn‚Äôt rot‚Äîit roots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked, uncertainty dripping in every word of my question.

‚ÄúYou do the hardest thing, you remember everything. Even the parts that hurt, those especially.‚Äù

The voice dissipated as yet another door appeared before me.

It was sea-glass green again.

It opened before I reached for it.

I stepped through and saw the same child‚Äôs room as before only now the boy was gone.

The bed sat empty, perfectly undisturbed like a lie frozen in time. 

On the wall rested a mirror.

That wasn‚Äôt there last time‚Ä¶I thought as I found myself walking towards it.

I closed my eyes, fearful of the reflection that awaited me.

I opened them slowly, reluctantly.

It revealed‚Ä¶me.

Finally, me.

There was no smile, no delay.

The man in the mirror perfectly reflected me.

For the first time in what felt like hours‚Ä¶ days‚Ä¶ maybe years‚Ä¶

My reflection wasn‚Äôt lying.

Beside me, the journal hovered in the air like it had been waiting for this exact moment.

The pages turned like a wind was directing it to do so until it landed on the final page.

It read:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about leaving the room. It‚Äôs about choosing what you bring with you when you do.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look away from the mirror, I held my gaze like I was delivering a testimony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù I spoke, my eyes focusing with intent.

My reflection nodded as if to say: For now.

The room didn‚Äôt slam shut; it quietly closed and folded like a book after its final chapter.

The air became heavier, warmer, as if someone had been crying in it for hours.

I turned back to see that the hallway was gone and had been replaced with a stairwell.

There was no railing, just worn wooden steps spiraling downward into the cold depths below.

As I approached, I noticed something was carved into the first step:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve remembered too much to go back.‚Äù

I swallowed nervously and took the stairs one step at a time, slowly descending towards whatever fate awaited me at the bottom.

Each step beneath my feet echoed wrong.

Not with footsteps but with faint whispers.

‚ÄúIt was your fault.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt there.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe was waiting.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

I tried to remember her laugh but the room was louder, it drowned out my every thought like TV static.

It was enough to make me scream but I stayed resilient until I made it to the bottom.

When I reached the last stair, I noticed a door.

It was unmarked and‚Ä¶weeping?

Thick, blackened water leaked from beneath it. Slow as molasses. Heavy as oil.

I reached for the handle and felt a harsh heat burn my palm like the room on the other side was ablaze.

I pulled away, but the door opened on its own accord.

Inside: a kitchen.

The low sound of a child laughing from another room.

It felt familiar and safe.

Too safe.

It felt like a trap disguised as comfort. 

Every chair was perfectly angled. Every photo frame dustless. The lamp light illuminated the room in a soft gold, like memory filtered through nostalgia.

I stepped toward the counter and noticed an open lunchbox sitting there. It was a deep shade of purple and covered in stars.

A sticky note sat beside it.

It read:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do better today. I believe in you.‚Äù ‚Äî Dad

I stared at the note. It was in my handwriting, but I never wrote it.

The hallway compelled me toward the framed photos lining the wall.

Birthday parties she never had. 

Beach vacations we never took. 

Her graduation, years too far ahead.

All these memories decorated the wall.

I reached out to touch one and felt the image ripple, like I was touching water.

The room wasn‚Äôt showing the past; it was fabricating an entire future.

It was nothing more than an elaborate lie.

It was offering forgiveness I hadn‚Äôt earned.

And I almost accepted its apology.

Almost.

That is, until I saw the final door.

It was a small and narrow closet.

Inside, sat a woman in a chair. Head bowed as if she were napping.

‚ÄúClaire?‚Äù Her name hung in the air in quiet suspension as I awaited a response.

She lifted her head slowly to reveal her bloodshot eyes and sickly pale skin.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here,‚Äù she warned tiredly.

I knelt beside her, ‚ÄúI had to know.‚Äù

She looked at me with something like pity. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason we buried it. The room showed me too. What comes after and what you won‚Äôt survive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did it show you?‚Äù I pleaded, eager for more answers.

Her pregnant pause filled my heart with tension before she finally spoke to me again:

‚ÄúEmily and I‚Ä¶ we forgave you, didn‚Äôt we? That‚Äôs what you needed us to do...what you wanted.‚Äù

I reached for her hand.

It was cold but not lifeless.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not her.‚Äù I acknowledged as I pulled my hand away.

She offered a soft smile laced with sadness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the version of me you needed. The peace you imagined. Not the truth.‚Äù

I stood and watched as the closet and the darkness behind her deepen.

In the distance, I could see the faint outline of the three numbers on a placard that have come to haunt me:

409.

The loop always ends here.

I looked down one last time, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

Claire nodded, ‚ÄúAnd neither is the version of you that keeps pretending you‚Äôre healing.‚Äù

She faded before my eyes as did the world around us as I found myself back inside Room 409, alone.

Then came several loud knocks.

At first, I thought it came from the door. Then I realized that they were coming from beneath the bed.

I slowly crouched to peek underneath.

There was no figure, just a piece of folded paper.

It was written in Emily‚Äôs handwriting.

‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd stay but you left me with the room.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees and wept, the emotional dam finally giving way.

My tears were not ones of fear; they were of recognition from finally understanding that I had never left.

My body went home, filed reports, and wore smiles.

But the part of me that held her hand when the machines turned off?

That part never made it out.

And the room?

It fed that part comfort, false memories, and just enough hope to continue to play pretend, until the truth was just one version of the story.

I wiped the tears that stained my face and saw it.

A door had manifested itself in the middle of the room.

It was new, but not.

The door was numbered:

409.

The journal sat in front of it, its pages fluttering.

I opened it and noticed there was only one line embedded into the page:

‚ÄúIf you walk through this door, there‚Äôs no forgetting again.‚Äù

I turned the page.

Blank.

Except, there was a key.

Etched into it were the numbers 409.

And beneath it, Emily‚Äôs name.

I whispered it aloud like prayer, surrendering myself to the room.

It shuddered and drew its breath before letting out an exhale that felt final before I opened the door and stepped through the doorway.

Inside, things were familiar once again, but not mine. 

The room looked almost untouched: bed made, curtains drawn, no blood on the carpet. There were details I couldn‚Äôt explain, however. 

There was a pair of women‚Äôs shoes by the dresser and a little girl‚Äôs coat draped over the chair. 

Static blared from the TV in a deafening manner as I approached it.

As I got closer, I noticed a VHS tape resting on the nightstand.

Its worn-out label read: Room 409 ‚Äî short film.

I inserted the tape into the battered VCR under the television and watched the screen crackle to life. 

At first, only a title card: The Lotus Hotel presents‚Ä¶

Then: me. Standing with Brenner and other investigators in a brightly lit room, looking down at the photographs of a man and a woman, narrating the scene.

Only‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt speaking. My mouth moved, but a different voice spilled out ‚Äî slower, brittle, almost stitched together from a dozen different recordings like memories falsifying their own reconstruction.

A voice made from fragments rather than complete thoughts.

The lines it spoke‚Ä¶ they were mine. 

From the briefing with Brenner. 

From the report. 

From the story I told myself.

‚ÄúThe detective believes he‚Äôs solving a crime‚Ä¶ but what he‚Äôs really doing is running from the ending.‚Äù

I shut it off and as I did, the light to the bathroom turned on.

It was like I was being beckoned by the room to explore further.

I headed towards the bathroom and found a file folder on the sink. 

The cover bore my name, handwritten.

Inside were intake forms, psych evaluations, and words like disassociation and trauma-fueled construct. 

There were dates on the reports as well. Some matched the timeline I remembered, and others were from almost a decade earlier. 

There was even a photo of me. I had shorter hair, wore a hospital bracelet, and had eyes that looked like they hadn‚Äôt slept in years.

That‚Äôs when I noticed it: the mirror behind the sink.

And the version of me staring back.

He didn‚Äôt move when I did. He didn‚Äôt flinch when I recoiled. He just stood there, smiling. Slowly. Sadly.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I trembled.

He mouthed back: ‚ÄúThe real one. The one who never left.‚Äù

I ran out of the bathroom and down the hallway, adrenaline coursing through my veins as my feet thudded against the carpeted flooring.

My feet guided me through the stairwell. The lobby flickered‚Äîpristine, then rotted‚Äîtwo timelines fighting to overwrite one another. 

A bellhop stood at the front desk, humming to himself.

When I approached, he turned‚Äîand had my face.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Mr. Cartwright,‚Äù he said courteously. ‚ÄúWill you be staying with us long this time?‚Äù

I backed away, the color draining from my face as the elevator dinged behind me. 

I watched the doors open and heard a child‚Äôs voice singing softly from within.

Emily‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRow, row, row your boat‚Ä¶‚Äù

I practically leapt into the elevator and pressed the buttons in a frantic plea that one of them will lead me towards the exit.

I hit every floor. Each opened to a different version of the Lotus. One looked like a hospital. One like a courtroom. One like a funeral home. In one, I saw myself sitting with a doctor. In another, I stood at a graveside alone.

All timelines. All versions of me.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Eventually, I made it back to Room 409‚Äîthe original one, I think. Or maybe a new copy. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

I stepped inside. The lights were dim. Dust settled in slow motion. The air felt ancient.

And there, burned into the wallpaper above the bed in blackened letters:

THIS IS THE ROOM YOU MADE TO FORGET HER.

I had multiple weight loss surgeries, lap band (2007) to a sleeve (2012) and have maintained a 200lb weight loss since. My diet is animal based with limited fruit and vegetables.  I carry extra skin in my torso and chest area from the weight loss.  I‚Äôm scheduled for surgery in November for the skin in the torso to be removed, leaving only saggy man boobs as proof that I was obese.  

I am pretty good at staying on trip of my health for the last 10 years or so though I have had a knee scoped due to a torn meniscus and I need a shoulder replacement due to severe damage to it. 

I have been looking into various supplements to improve my general wellbeing.  I currently take fish oil, multivitamin, d3 k2, electrolytes 1-2 times a day (prone to leg cramps at night and haven‚Äôt had one since taking the electrolyes) recently added 5-10g of creatine, drink 2 protein shakes to up that intake. It‚Äôs difficult to accomplish with food because my stomach was stapled.  I have been thinking of  adding l-theanine into the mix as I have started seeing there is increased focus and clarity especially when teamed with caffeine.  Have also toyed with adding methelyene blue also.  

So first question is do you folks think the supplements listed are a good way to improve wellbeing?

Second- I have seen mixed reviews on creatine with coffee. Some say good, some say bad. I don‚Äôt know where to plant my flag with that. 

Third - would adding the L-Theanine and methelyne blue be a good or bad addition and when should I introduce it into the body?

1n0tgyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1n0tgyi/should_you_try_the_vitalvariety_all_purpose/,Should You Try the VitalVariety All Purpose Cleaner Bundle or Not?,"Testing out VitalVariety B0CRSY9JCR in my home was quite the experience. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love a cleaning spree when you‚Äôre armed with a product that promises to clean, disinfect, sanitize, and ‚Äîmost importantly‚Äî leave your home smelling refreshed? This all-purpose cleaner bundle, featuring two 60-ounce bottles and a bonus microfiber cloth, certainly made its mark in my cleaning routine. Using these on floors, countertops, and even in tough spaces like the bathroom sink gave me a full sense of just what this cleaner could do. 

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
Pulling out this bundle, one thing immediately stood out ‚Äì its versatility. Sometimes, you find cleaning products that excel in one area but fail another. That wasn‚Äôt the case here. From tile floors in the kitchen to the ceramic sink in my bathroom, I was able to tackle grime pretty much anywhere. Diluting the concentrated formula was easy, and I found myself using less product than anticipated to get sparkling results. It feels a little satisfying when even my least favorite chore suddenly becomes effortless.  

**Positives**  
- Exceptional cleaning power that removes grease and tough grime  
- Leaves a pleasant and refreshing Original Scent that lingers without overpowering  
- Multi-surface capability ‚Äî great for counters, floors, stoves, and bathrooms  
- Bonus microfiber cloth adds value and convenience  

[Check VitalVariety B0CRSY9JCR price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0crsy9jcr/)  

**The Unique Cleaning Action**  
So what makes this cleaner stand out for someone like me, who‚Äôs probably tried every other cleaning product out there? For starters, its 4x Cleaning Action is no marketing gimmick; it genuinely powers through challenging spots. I spilt coffee on the counter early one morning and forgot about it until later that afternoon. Instead of becoming the usual hardened mess I resent cleaning, it was gone in seconds with just a quick swipe. Who knew scrubbing a stove after a greasy dinner could feel so rewarding?  

**Shortcomings**  
- The bottle design could use improvement; pouring directly from the heavy bottles can get messy.  
- Strong scent might not appeal to those with sensitivities to fragrances.  
- While versatile, it may not be suitable for sensitive materials like painted finishes.  

**The Inclusion of Concentrated Formula**  
This cleaner being concentrated caught my attention the moment I started reading the label. I tried using it at a diluted level for kitchen counters and undiluted for stubborn bathroom grout. Remarkably, it performed well in both instances without leaving streaks or sticky residues. It‚Äôs always a win when you find a product that doesn‚Äôt demand half the bottle to get decent results.  

**Product Alternatives**  
In my ongoing quest for the ultimate cleaning product, I‚Äôve also dabbled with competitors like Method‚Äôs Almond Surface Cleaner and Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Multi-Surface Concentrate. While Method adds a luxurious touch with its almond scent, it doesn't quite match the grease-fighting capabilities of the VitalVariety product. Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs is a favorite for its plant-based approach, but its bottle feels smaller and less economical for large households like mine. Neither, however, offers the same inclusive bundle feel with a microfiber cloth ready to go out of the box.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The value proposition here really deserves attention. You‚Äôre getting 120 ounces of cleaning concentrate bundled with a practical microfiber cloth. For what it‚Äôs able to achieve ‚Äî from eradicating bacteria to giving your home a consistent, pleasant scent ‚Äî this product easily paid for itself in saved time and effort alone. There are pricier alternatives out there, but honestly, the performance of this all-purpose cleaner makes it worth every effort spent lugging it around while cleaning.

I wasn‚Äôt particularly optimistic about upgrading from my trusty old plastic kettle, but this brushed stainless steel design caught my eye with its sleek look and practical features. Whether it‚Äôs making tea during late-night study sessions, boiling water for instant noodles, or serving up hot cocoa after a long day, this kettle has been a dependable partner. While I‚Äôve enjoyed using it, there are definitely aspects that some users might want to keep in mind.

**Standout Design and Build Quality**  
Its brushed stainless steel finish lends a professional and stylish appeal that fits seamlessly into any modern kitchen. One of the first things I noticed was how solid the kettle feels in hand. It‚Äôs lightweight at just under 3 pounds, but the material doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy. The dual water windows are another practical design addition that ensures I never overfill it. There‚Äôs no need to guess how much water you‚Äôve poured in, which is particularly helpful when making a single cup of tea or multiple servings. The cord storage underneath the base is another nifty touch that keeps the counter tidy. 

Despite the great design, the brushed surface picks up fingerprints rather easily, which means I find myself wiping it a little too often for my liking. Additionally, it‚Äôs hand wash only, so anyone who dislikes maintenance might find this slightly inconvenient‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre like me and prefer products that can be easily tossed into the dishwasher.

**Performance That Meets Expectations**  
This kettle is powered by 1500 watts, and I‚Äôve found it to be impressively fast. From a practical perspective, it boils seven cups of water quicker than I can set up my tea strainer. The quiet operation surprised me the most; it doesn‚Äôt make the annoying roaring sound some electric kettles produce. The lid, with its soft-open feature, really elevates the experience by preventing sudden steam release‚Äîa detail I find especially reassuring. No accidental burns when I lean over it while pouring! 

However, it lacks customizable temperature settings. For coffee enthusiasts who prefer precise water temperatures for brewing, this will fall short. I mostly drink black tea, so it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker for me, but multi-drink households might see it as a limitation.

**Key Benefits of the Breville Kettle**  
- Stylish and durable stainless steel design.
- Dual water windows for versatile usage.
- Soft-open lid for safer operation.
- Ergonomic handle for comfortable pouring.
- Cordless convenience with 360-degree base rotation.  

**Critiques that Stand Out**  
- No adjustable temperature options limit variety in brewing drinks.
- Stainless steel finish requires frequent cleaning due to smudges and fingerprints.
- Hand-wash only, which doesn‚Äôt suit those who prefer dishwasher-safe appliances.

**Competing Brands**  
Having owned similar electric kettles, I‚Äôd compare this one to popular models from Fellow and Cuisinart. Fellow kettles often win when it comes to design and precision temperature settings, which Breville lacks. On the other hand, Cuisinart kettles typically come with digital displays and more robust programmability, but they don‚Äôt always match the simplicity and elegance that Breville offers. What really makes this kettle special, however, is its balance of user-friendly design and performance. 

In terms of speed and reliability, it‚Äôs hard to beat. Those who prioritize safety and straightforward usability‚Äîlike families with children‚Äîmight favor this kettle over its competitors. However, serious coffee enthusiasts might find the lack of temperature settings a reason to glance elsewhere.

**Smart Spending on This Appliance**  
The kettle is not the cheapest you‚Äôll find, but its performance and design live up to the investment. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable electric kettle that perfectly balances form and function, this could meet your needs. It‚Äôs a particularly good option for everyday users who value convenience over having endless advanced features. The price, when compared with similar electric kettles on the market, feels justified. The warranty adds a sense of security too‚Äîknowing you‚Äôre covered for a year is always a plus.

**First impressions**

Fast response and good communication. Love the website and the master fragrance list. Owner is obviously very talented and multifaceted in their skill set as they also sell Art and Make up. Perfumes come in the sweetest glass bottles which were well packed. I left them to sit for two weeks.

**The Perfumes**

**Alice**: *Bakewell tarts and black tea, white roses painted red, a distant whiff of black pepper and orange marmalade.* The Bakewell tart note note is lovely from the offset. In the top notes there a slightly sour citrus note that smells a bit like washing up liquid (Neroli?)but then settles to the orange marmalade. When that notes dries down, the perfume is utterly divine and wafts nicely. A wonderful gourmand.



**Dangerous places**: *Raspberries dipped in bitter dark chocolate sweetened with honey and vanilla, spiced with allspice, cinnamon and black pepper and gifted with a single red rose.* Lovely, spicy, sweet. It starts off a bit generic winter spice candle scent but once the honey and chocolate kick in it is just heavenly. A big hit in the office.



**Desert Mouse**: *Spice coffee on a desert planet. Sandalwood, vanilla, black storax, cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, almond and white sage.* The opening is coffee and battenberg cake and I love it. After about an hour the spice kicks in and it‚Äôs so lovely and cosy.



**Heartmender:** *A pearly blend of white flowers, golden honey and tobacco, enlivened with white and mountain peppers and grounded in earthy oakmoss.* Has a soap note and at first that‚Äôs all I can smell. After about 40 minutes, the honey comes through which makes it pleasant but I cannot get any other notes from it.



**Hobgoblin:** *Warm, buttered bread, lightly spiced, honeyed oatmeal, and a wooden bowl of vanilla cream.* Such a clever scent, so buttery at first and then a glorious spiced vanilla. Smells like Lush YogNog. Everyone in the office loved it and I ended up gifting to friend to wear for DnD campaigns.



**Lament of the Mystic:** *A censer of sacred resins and blackened vanilla and a cup of tea leaves lie abandoned amongst bundles of clary sage and tobacco leaves in a hut overgrown with ripe fox grapes and moonflower.* I mostly just get smokiness- it smells like the fake smoke Ikea use in their little rooms to make them cosy. I was excited about the notes but nothing really comes through.



**Queen of Elphane:** *Fluffy white marshmallows, juicy apricots and candied violets topped with shaved fresh ginger and a dusting of cardamom.* Oh man, this is just beautiful. It smells like a lovely mocktail. It‚Äôs sweet, fruity and a touch spicy. I absolutely love it.



**Quixotic adept:** *Caramelized pears and candied nuts dusted with cinnamon and cardamom and sprinkled with orange blossom water.* Spicy resins but I like it a lot because it has a sweetness. It does lean a bit masculine with the smokiness in the dry down but it‚Äôs offset by a fruitiness.



**Seven poor princesses:** *Sandalwood and rich coconut-vanilla cream support a heart of sweet frangipani and palmarosa, brightened with a slice of pomelo.* I got soap, soap and more soap. In the dry down there was a slight plastically vanilla but that was it. 



**She-Bear:** *A cloak of fuzzy black musk and warm golden amber, a branch of cedar, a bouquet of carnations and roses, brightened with pink pepper and lemon blossom.* Ugh I am so sorry but this was awful. A screeching soap note that didn‚Äôt stop for hours. When it dried down it was just woody soap. I think maybe the black musk perfume oil is off? I got no other notes at all and I was so excited to try this. I was asked to wash it off my wrist at work as the office took offence.



**Final thoughts**

I think that there was a lot to like here and some really interesting scents for a gourmand lover like myself. There were a few disappointing scents but the really good scents more than made up for it. Absolute value for money and a great website also go a long way for me. I will be sure to try a few more scents in the future (I've already got my eye on the winter releases)

Next: Hopefully doing a review of Simon‚Äôs Nest but I haven‚Äôt heard from them since putting my order in so I‚Äôm not sure when it‚Äôll turn up.",14,1756232107.0,Indiemakeupandmore,11,1.0,False
