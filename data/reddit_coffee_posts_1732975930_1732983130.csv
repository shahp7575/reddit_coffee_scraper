I've visited this place four times in the past couple of weeks. While the food is enjoyable and the space has a stylish design, it’s ridiculously small. Every visit before 10 a.m. has come with an unavoidable wait of around 30 minutes.

During my most recent visit, after waiting to be seated, I finally found a table and settled in. When I went to grab coffee on tap, I discovered it was out of order. Frustrated, I returned to my seat, only to be approached by a manager who informed me that I couldn’t sit there. She then questioned who had seated me when I checked in. I explained that no one had seated me; I had simply been told to check in and find a seat myself. Instead of apologizing, she insisted I move to a different table.

If there are specific seating protocols, wouldn’t it make sense to have someone guide guests to their seats? The whole interaction felt unnecessarily rude, and the lack of guidance made the experience frustrating. It’s certainly not the kind of “service-first” approach I’d expect from a high-end lounge.",1,1732983003.0,ChaseSapphire,0,1.0,False

Sump had a really cozy vibe and pumpkin pies for thanksgiving. The pourovers were great. We had a Burundi natural and the Colombia ""tropical chiroso"" which I think was some sort of extended fermentation coffee, and it was super juicy and not too funky.

Comet is a multi-roaster and micro-bakery I'd been wanting to try. They had a lot of options from Manhattan, September, Momos, and other great international roasters. They also had Little Wolf and a couple other US roasters. The morning bun with lemon zest and cardamom paired with a white honey Costa Rica from Momo's in Busan, South Korea was life-changing!

Upshot really surprised me! It's a cute shop in the suburbs and I had a washed Nicaraguan pourover brewed on the origami. It had everything I'd want in a washed central American coffee.

1h3froa,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1h3froa/for_anyone_that_feels_they_cant_find_their_love/,For anyone that feels they can't find their love outside of the organization,"This is kind of an update of a post I made a month or so back. But, mostly I'm just writing this to encourage anyone who is struggling with finding a partner ""in the world"" or may fear leaving the organization because they feel that their only options are in the organization.

I think I briefly mentioned this before but I met my current gf roughly a month ago. I moved to a new country this past January to get my undergraduate degree but was actively using Bumble and Tinder to meet with dates. I know people's opinion about online dating varies a lot but I personally didn't have any issue with it. After a few dead ends and an almost hookup, I met her. Actually, we wound up matching and unmatching several times because of account issues but we were finally able to set up a time to meet. 

We met at a coffee shop and we almost instantly hit it off. We talked about many things but the conversation flowed and I didn't feel awkward. The date even ended with a kiss (my first) in the park. We met up 2 more times after that and made it official.

It felt freeing being able to talk without having to worry about trying to convert her or becoming ""unevenly yoked"". And when things escalated, I didn't have to feel guilty for bringing reproach on God's name for getting more physical than was ""appropriate"". I could express my affection freely and unapologetically. We've only been together a short time but the time we've spent together has been great. 

I'm not saying that as soon as you leave the organization, the love of your life will run into your arms but, if you have any fears that you will be lonely, i offt's possible to find someone you can click with. And I would argue that anyone you find on the outside would be more authentic than on the inside because you remove that extra layer of self censorship from the things you've been taught.

Two days before Thanksgiving, my husband and I got into a huge fight. A fight like we've never had before. I think the pressures and stressors we've built up inside just escaped us in the worst way. My husband has had a lot of family member loss over the last couple years. He has only a few family members left. He's been the only one keeping in touch, calling on holidays and wishing birthdays. Even planning trips to other states to see them. None of this family ever returns the effort. It's not that he wants them to change or wants them to want to be a part of our life, he just needed to get his emotions out and allow himself to accept the fact his family is trash. So we talked about it. We have deep conversations and this fight ended with one as well. We have each other. We have kids. And we decided the only ones who are important, are in this home. Me, him, our kids. 
Thanksgiving day, no one showed up. To go from a house full of 20+ to just the four of us was a huge slap in the face. My mom showed up. My mom always shows up. She has horrible health, horrible weight issues, depression, and is subjected to live the rest of her life taking care of my mentally disabled brother. But she always shows up.  She is our biggest supporter and I'm thankful for her everyday. 
I know my husband reached out to his family in days leading up to the holiday, asked what everyone was bringing, what time they thought worked. Not a single one replied. 
And I know an outsider would think ""well what happened to lead them to stop being involved""?....NOTHING. What happened was, we didn't go out of our way to contact everyone on thanksgiving, so no one else took the initiative. And that was the only answer I needed. 
Yesterday, the day after Thanksgiving,  I childishly made Facebook post about being abandoned by family on a holiday meant for family....Abandoned by the same family who keeps losing their loved ones to suicide and depression because they needed someone to care.  I gave them the entire day to reflect and reach out to my husband. Not a single one bothered. 
I remember years ago, my husband sisters (3 of them) told me they didn't feel the need to check up on us because I posed on Facebook every day. Those words have always stuck out like a bloody sword to me. So, I deleted my social media last night. If you don't have the respect to make an honest effort to be a part of my family's life, I'm not going to make it easy for you to ""check in on us"". 
I deleted them off of my child's messengers, deleted their numbers etc. I don't want my kids thinking a family is only family at a certain time. The only time we see or hear from my husband's mom...I don't even want to give her the pleasure of using ""mom"" as a title for her.....it's because she wants money or a hand out. Same with his youngest sister. I could go on about how selfish and messed up his family is. But it doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is, after 12 years of trying to accept his family, I don't have to try anymore. And even better, my husband is done trying I think, too. 
I have a small family, 4 other relatives. But that's all I need to know what family means and that's all I want my kids to value as family as well. 
Today, we woke up, husband and I poured our coffee and headed back to our room to sip in peace. But our peace was broke before it started as both kids sleepily wobbled out of their room and followed behind us, climbing in-between us on our bed. Seconds later, our 100+lb dogs followed chase and climbed into the pile. 
And for a good hour, the 6 of us huddled in a comforting mass, simply enjoyed the peace and love that sworms our home. 
This is a new beginning for us. ",1,1732982832.0,u_icandobetter_,0,1.0,False

1h3fpcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1h3fpcl/is_gollum_the_titular_lotr/,Is Gollum the titular LotR?,"Sauron is The Lord of the Rings.

Sauron is a spiritual being, an essence and abstract concept that is as much a spiritual shapeshifter as it is a physical shapeshifter. Sauron has gone by many names, and split his essence and spiritual energies into fragments, half of which was poured into the Ring. While bearing the Ring, Sauron was made more whole and wholly more powerful; and amplified version of himself.  His ability to exert his will, his dominion extended far beyond his own reach, with the help of the rings and the One, he achieved Morgoths vision…or almost. 

When separated from the Ring, the collective fragments of his spiritual essence that were NOT contained within the Ring, were scattered and Sauron could not take a physical form again. The Necromancer persona manifested after centuries of those fragments slowly coming together after Sauron’s destruction. The coincidence of the Ring abandoning Gollum the same month out of the last half a millennium that the Necromancers plans go into motion in the same general vicinity as one another is not a coincidence. It’s an awakening. But who/what is “Gollum?”

Sméagol finds the Ring, and almost instantly is corrupted by it. At this point, the Ring is the only physical form that the fragments of Sauron’s spiritual essence has, and I think represent roughly half of that essence. This collective of Sauron’s fragments manifests into a psychic/spirituaI persona that goes by the first name given to him: Precious. I believe that Sméagol is the physical host body for the Precious parasite, not unlike Venom from Marvel, or Professor Quirrel from Harry Potter. Sméagol’s consciousness clearly takes a backseat for the majority of Gollums unnaturally long life, and it’s only after the Ring abandons Sméagol that the Precious persona, a fragment of which will now always live on within (a) Gollum, which could be defined as a mortal who becomes wholly corrupted by the Ring, unlike the Nazgûl, who were mortals turned into wraiths by one of the nine rings. After holding the Ring for so long, Sauron’s fragmented persona, Precious, now leaves its own fragment with its former host, Sméagol, granting Gollum its continue long life despite being separated from the Ring. Precious remains with Sméagol, and thus Gollum goes on. 

This means, Gollum is the only physical form Sauron achieves in the Third Age, or at least the closest he comes to it. 

All of this really clicked this morning just being in total awe of Andy Serkis’ layered complexity and nuance used to bring Gollum to life. I could have never imagined so much from Gollum by just reading the text. But the pain and sadness and grief we hear in Sméagol’s moments of brief clarity, the remorse as he realizes the Ring is gone and despair to make sure he finds his only friend left, his only means to survive…it just hit different. 

Maia takes form and joins Morgoth = Sauron
Sauron / Rings = Lord of the Rings
Lord of Rings / -(Rings) = Necromancer (splintered 1/2 of sprit fragments) + Precious (1/2 of spirit fragments consolidated inside of The Ring
Sméagol + Ring = Precious controlled Gollum
Sméagol- Ring = 3/4 Precious controlled Gollum

Necromancer + Precious = Sauron reborn

1h3fm89,https://www.reddit.com/r/polls_for_politics/comments/1h3fm89/free_trade_and_tariffs/,Free Trade and Tariffs,"[Free trade and fair trade](https://fairtradecampaigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CAM_FreevsFairTrade101_190418.pdf) are two often discussed concepts, encompassing the idea that trade between countries should have limited to no restrictions to allow for supply to meet demand, or that trade should have limitations and regulations to allow for social, economic, and environmental factors. [Issues with free trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-trade.asp) can include local unemployment when another country doing trade can produce goods cheaper than domestically, as companies will often move to countries with more lax labor and environmental standards. There can also become a dependance on the global market, leading to a local collapse of manufacturing and ability to obtain goods in the instance of a trade war or other trade issues on a global level. 

Some of the benefits include lower prices for consumers, increased global ties, and unlocks a country to tap into economic theories of [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo), who suggests that free trade allows a country to focus on its strengths and ignore weaknesses. These theories have already seen historical precedent, as humanity created and survived as a species based on it's ability to work together creating a shared pool of resources. Imagine if Alaska had to create it's own resources for food, shelter, etc., instead of having access to free trade amongst states. Instead, they can focus on contributing $2.3B to the GDP by focusing on their strengths of fishing and oil production, relying on imports for other needs. 

On the other hand, there are benefits and drawbacks to fair trade as well. You might've heard of [fair trade coffee](https://www.drinktrade.com/blogs/education/fair-trade-guide), which costs more than it's free trade counterpart. If you don't buy it, you might not know the reason for that higher price is because that producer has guaranteed that farmers up the chain are being fairly paid, and that environmental standards are being met. Fair trade diamonds would guarantee they weren't mined by children, and that labor and environmental safety laws have been followed. Now, swapping to exclusively this model overnight would be catastrophic, as many production operations in a [staggering number of markets](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ilab/child_labor_reports/tda2023/2024-tvpra-list-of-goods.pdf) rely on broken labor laws in some capacity, and this would skyrocket prices. But making an effort to move towards fair trade in all industries would alleviate global and domestic human suffering and child labor. 

 Now when it comes to tariffs, in short: tariffs are a tax paid by importing companies to the government for bringing products overseas. This tax is always passed on to the consumer, as this page could not locate a company that internalizes that cost. Tariffs have amazing, niche uses, including the ability to protect domestic markets from foreign products, or punishing countries and companies for lax labor or environment laws that allow them to make products cheaper. If tariffs existed in a vacuum, these practices would be a great solution. However there is a comprehensive history of tariffs being levied in retaliation by countries affected, often leading to a [trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China–United_States_trade_war). 

For examples of exactly how out of control tariff's can get, lets look at a [case study from 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/09/30/trumps-tariffs-have-wiped-14-billion-off-of-harley-davidsons-market-cap/), when Trump imposed Steel and Aluminum tariffs from the EU, in an attempt to protect domestic steel and aluminum production (it does not appear that these domestic industries were under threat, but I cannot find clear evidence). First, the EU responded with their own tariffs on US exports like Harley Davidson, an American company. This led to Harley Davidson moving some of it's domestic production to Thailand, allowing them to avoid the EU-US tariff war. This led to Trump supporting a boycott of Harley Davidson, and them losing $1.4B in market share. In summary, these tariffs hurt our relations with allies like the EU, hurt domestic production as manufacturers move overseas to avoid them, loses the country jobs, and can have other retaliatory effects. We saw this as well during [tariffs on China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/08/30/amid-trump-tariffs-farm-bankruptcies-and-suicides-rise/#538c68662bc8) for unfair labor practices, where they retaliated with tariffs on American soybeans and Corn, America's two largest cash crops. This led to devastating conditions for farmers, and bankruptcies and suicides as domestic production outweighed demand, and [prices for soybeans collapsed](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=94885). 

This leaves a sticky, nuanced situation to decode. Tariffs are good when narrowly applied in small doses to targeted areas, but can be devastating when applied broadly, too sharply, or for the wrong reasons. Free trade can also be amazing for unlocking a countries strengths to contribute on a global market, and reducing the cost of goods for consumers. But applied too broadly, it allows for the festering of the worst practices, like child labor and environmental degradation, and can lead to domestic production leaving for easier overseas production.

While this page can't accurately poll the broad population on broad policies with this much nuance, what should the general outlook for the government be going forward?

Holidays were never supposed to be like this—a mix of joy and ache, the laughter of family mingling with the silence of absence. She had spent the day surrounded by warmth: her family gathered, children running about, and the hum of traditions carried on. She smiled, laughed, and played her part. But beneath it all was the ache she carried, the part of her life that no one saw.

The messages had been few. A quick note earlier in the week, a brief acknowledgment of the season. One man, the one who once set her heart on fire with his words, had gone silent since Monday. Another had sent a short text, careful in tone, his usual warmth replaced with the distance that had grown between them. She told herself she didn’t need their words to make her holiday complete, but she knew better.

Her current partner, the man she had once promised forever, sat across the room, sipping his coffee and watching the festivities unfold. Their relationship was its own storm—a rocky, unpredictable sea that she navigated out of habit more than passion. They were together, yet the distance between them felt insurmountable.

The holidays, for all their joy, had a way of amplifying what was missing. She missed the way things once felt, when love was fresh and uncomplicated. She missed the moments stolen in secret, the thrill of being seen, truly seen. And yet, she carried on, because she had to.

That evening, after the family had gone to bed and the house had grown quiet, she sat by the fire, scrolling through her messages. There was no new text, no sign of him. She thought of the men who had shaped her world this past year—the one who made her feel alive, the one who brought her stability, and the one she had tried so hard to make it work with again. Each relationship was a reflection of something she sought but had not yet found.

She poured herself a glass of wine, staring into the flames. The secrets she kept, the choices she made—they were hers alone, and she bore their weight quietly. She knew people would judge her if they knew, but they didn’t live her life. They didn’t understand the loneliness that even a full house couldn’t erase.

For now, she would stay the course, balancing the roles she played. Partner, mother, secret keeper. She couldn’t untangle herself from the web she had woven, but she could keep moving forward. And as the firelight flickered, she made herself a promise.

“This isn’t forever. One day, I’ll find the love I deserve. One day, I’ll choose myself.”

But tonight, she let herself feel the weight of it all. And then, like always, she tucked her feelings away, ready to face another day.",0,1732982287.0,sugarlifestyleforum,0,0.33,False

**Scent** - I outright hated the scent when I first got it thinking the money was completely down the drain, which makes me sympathize with the negative reviews that this has, as I understand that this is very pungent and sharp and unpleasant when you first smell it, almost like a turpentine-esque quality to it. I was hopeless that this would be any usable even if it gets better after maturing; nevertheless, out of despair of money lost, I kept it for maturing anyway. Fast forward a few months (and I mean more than 2 months or so) I recently tried this again and I was shocked to see what I was going to miss.
This is so deep, rich, alluring and dark yet alluring scent that I was desperately trying to attain. It starts off with a boozy accord backed with dark coffee (not the milky gourmand type) and spices (cannot make out which). The mid brings out a good dose of earthiness associated with patchouli and vetiver giving it a certain heaviness. All of these notes are backed with faint sweetness associated with slightly burnt sugar. The sweetness here is merely doing a delicate balancing act and the scent profile is far from the usual gourmand sweetness that everyone is accustomed to. The entire scent profile is therefore quite dark and would cater to majority of the people unless you know exactly what kind of genre of scent you getting into. It would not be wise to buy this in hope of getting something along the likes Khamrah Qahwa for example, which is much more sweet and pleasing. For people who are searching a more wearable, appealing (and much less dark) version of this masterpiece are advised to try out Artisan Ethnique.


**Performance** - The performance is heavy, in a good way. Since the scent is itself heavy and piercing (not to be confused with the sharpness you might get at the start) it is very well projecting and can be picked up easily in the air. Longevity on me was great as well, lasted for about 8-9 hours on my skin.


**Presentation** - The bottle is a beauty in itself and can be owned just as a collector piece to ameliorate your collection. The atomizer on the other hand is just okayish, it sprays a short and wide burst that is not very good and demands a careful and close distance spray.


Overall, this is a dark horse in the sea of sickly sweet gourmands. The development of this scent and the overall complexity it manages to achieve is a winner in itself and justifies the price.

1h3fhyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1h3fhyg/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

1h3fgxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurdaughFamilyMurders/comments/1h3fgxv/jury_was_not_tampered_with_during_trial_murdaugh/,"Jury was not tampered with during trial, Murdaugh juror says","*by: Natasha Young / WSAV - Crime & Safety / Posted: Nov 29, 2024 / 08:14 PM EST*

**HAMPTON COUNTY, S.C. (WSAV)** — It was the local murder trial that made national and international news.

You couldn’t go anywhere without hearing more about the Alex Murdaugh case. Did he kill his wife Maggie and son Paul and what would the jury say?

In the end he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by a jury.

Now one of those jurors, Amie Williams, has written about her experience in the jury box. “A Long Road to Justice” said a lot about the claims that the jury was “tampered with” before the decision was made.

“I was thinking when they were going through the evidence, this is a lot,” said Williams. “Trying to put everything together. But then as things progressed, it made more sense and as it was making more sense, as horrible as it was it got a little easier to see once you could see clearly what was happening.”

Williams also said that the juror who said she was influenced doesn’t make sense.

“I understand that there was one juror out of the 12 that says that she was influenced,” Williams said. “But I don’t understand that part at all. But we were polled.  Okay. I have to go back to that. We were polled and you said you made this decision of your own free will. I don’t think our verdict should be thrown out.”

One of the keys to the case in Williams’ mind was early one, she said, when the audio of Alex Murdaugh’s 911 call was played for the court.

“When you make a 911 call, they’re trying to get you the help you need,” said Williams. “You’re trying to get the help you need because of what’s happening. For him to give them suspects and a suspect or suspects and a motive was kind of crazy to me.”

WSAV asked her how much she looked at Murdaugh during the trial.

“I tried not to,” Williams said. “I looked sometimes. But when he really started the waterfalls crying and all that, I just turned my head because it was, I felt it was… it was too much. It was just too much.”

In response, we asked her if she felt like he was performing. She said yes.

“Yes, I did,” Williams said. “He just couldn’t make sense of the timeline after that. Nothing he said made sense. It did not click. It was obvious to me than that, no, you did it. “

Many people voiced concerns that the jury came back too quickly with the verdict.

“Andrew, six weeks (of testimony),” Williams said. “I mean, all that evidence and the prosecution did a good job breaking down the evidence and the witness testimony, they were so courageous, and they were believable. I feel they had no reason to lie.”

Williams talked in depth about the deliberations in the jury room.

“We did the initial vote just to see where we were,” Williams said. “Nobody knew who voted what because we just wrote yes or no down on a piece of paper. From there we were like, okay, let’s open the floor for questions.  And there were a lot of questions. We watched some video clips. We looked at certain pieces of evidence for whatever the questions were.”

She told WSAV that Clerk of Court Becky Hill never made her feel pressured and that she doesn’t see how Hill could’ve convinced 12 people to change their decision.

“I mean, unless she had a magic potion or a wand, or maybe she could twitch her nose like bewitched, I don’t know,” Williams said. “But I just couldn’t see it happen happening. You know? I was like, that’s insane. I was not influenced, not by her anyway, but by the evidence and witness testimony.”

In the end, when WSAV asked Williams if she believed Murdaugh was the killer, she said she did.

“And I still would have come to the same decision even if the death penalty was on the table,” Willaims said. 

The South Carolina Supreme Court is expected to decide if there is enough evidence of potential tampering to get Alex Murdaugh a new trial in the next few months.

Williams is donating the majority of her proceeds from the book to her non-profit “Sanctuary House” a proposed long-term shelter for abused and battered women.

She will be holding book signings Dec. 5 at the Colleton Coffee Shop in Walterboro at 5 p.m., and Dec. 6 at Mcintosh Book Shoppe on East Bay Street.

It’s so simple it has to work
& it does

I’ve worked with ppl I work in the field & I finally get what “sitting with your feelings” means 


Therapist give great advice. We don’t take most of it. We understand sometimes less than that - its all trial & error so if you’re struggling & feel weird talking to yourself in the mirror as almost everyone does, this is what all my clients are still doing to this day. 

When you’re out of the shower when you’re doing your make up or wherever you casually hanging out around a mirror start a conversation go over about 10 different topics to see which ones really stick with you and go with the ones that are the most uncomfortable. 

Choose one of those single things and spend however long it asks you to see how you’re doing as you would with a friend, on that topic. 

It can be 5 min bc maybe you get feed back like “im not doing good dude but I don’t wanna talk about.” The key is coaxing it out, always end the conversation on “thank you for asking/I appreciate you trying/your effort care and sensitivity are noticed and appreciated/etc.” 

Once you’re comfortable is when the change starts: 
you think you’re ugly that’s your line while you get ready, “I’m ugly” okay let’s talk then when you’re ready let’s FEEL about that. Feeling can come with memories - I avoid them like the police. My mirror is on my treadmill ppl … you’re gonna run its ok let yourself run a few times its not a failure

Once you can be okay to give that mirror your attention like your best friend which for some of us is a pet. So imagine that MF cutie suddenly talking okay. you’re gonna be engulfed am I wrong? 

Now conjure a minimum of three times that negate your original thought 

See. Speak. Do. 

Acknowledging yourself vs toxic positivity to yourself for the ppl who are all “fine” yall aren’t 
& to ppl who avoid and numb - elders are right it always catches up & never fails to be at the most inconvenient times. 

I would be lying to say that it ever goes away and it broke my heart & I’ve destroyed my life slowly over the year. I still get lost in my city I live in bc I’ve been that absent. I’m also healing but I no longer have the intrusive thoughts & SI that paralyze me. 
I’m back to helping others for a long enough duration to finally show up in this way here rn in my fav group

I’m just done. I’m a person who has love to give, but didn’t receive any from men. I am very simple. I don’t look at men’s appearance or physical look. I just want a kind heart man who can treat me right like a queen, who listens and be a great companion for me. Thats it. 

I met a man 29M, who I was interested for a few month we were getting to know each other. It was great. But slowly I kinda notice that he doesn’t treat me as nice as i thought, he doesn’t listen to my stories, he make me feel less than, one sentence triggered me when i didn’t want to join him to dine in or hangout in a cafe, “ Is it because you didn’t want people to see me with you? ” THAT BREAKS MY HEART!! 

For extra context, he made me sleep only for 4 hours. while he had 8 hours of sleep (he didnt work and I had to go to work) He knows I have an event and work that day. and I still want to see him so i invite him to come and do an errand. I drove him around, and even agree when he wanted to go to a cafe and get some coffee and donut. Then when I said I’m tired to go down and hangout in that cafe (I had along day w little sleep) he said “ Is it because you didn’t want people to see me with you?” I was so angry. But I’m not the type to yell. And he still has the audacity to not understand UP UNTIL I TOLD HIM SO MANY TIMES. He felt bad but didn’t even text me after that, not even the next day. I’m done.

Can i still save this?,"So i met this girl in the end of august, at a barbecue party, by a group of friends and we clicked instantly. I know there is an age gap and we talked about it, its not a problem to her or our families. She has a quite troubled background, her dad died a few years ago, and her big brother is in a coma for 7 years now, so its really just her and her mother. She is a lively, ever happy girl, to who i gave my heart and soul, and i would move mountains for her. She did feel the same way about be, she introduced me to her brother, who they treat at home, and not even her best girlfriend of 10 years has seen him. I was her first, which also only shows what kind of love and trust we had for each other. She just started uni, goes to work on the side, and she has the stuff at home, i really can unsterstand the stress and trouble she is going thru. However something changed in her. I had a feeling something is off and j brought it up, but she made me sure that she loves me and misses me, she is just in a place of her life where she cant see me as much as she would love to, or she is happy if she can write to me a few minutes. I left it at that. This was about a month ago. A week ago on saturday we had a friends birthday party, where we came together to watch series, drink a bit and celebrate. Everything was fine, but i felt her not really looking for my company, kind of slightly keeping the distance, but she embraced me when i went to her. When we went to sleep, we cuddled, had sex, i felt like everything is alright. In the morning we kissed, drank our coffees, ate breakfast, then finished the last 2 episodes of the series we started last night. At this point there were 4 of us, my cousin, his gf, my gf and me. The girls went out for a smoke and we played xbox. But i saw them kind of having a serious conversation so i decided to go check on them when we were done. As i stepped out, the other girl went in and my gf said we need to talk.
I already knew what was coming. She broke up with me, because she cant give me the love i deserve, and she does not feel the spark like in the beginning. This has been eating her for about 2 weeks, right about when i first asked if everything is ok. I cannot believe she does not love me anymore, this was way to special for it just to disappear. Could it be the trauma of male figures in her life? Did she convince herself that she does not love me anymore along those 2 weeks?

Slightly elevated neutrophils from recent tests.

Fear of dormant STD symptoms, despite negative tests and resolved gonorrhea.

---

Current Medications

Beta Blockers and Xanor (dose increased from 0.25g to 0.5g in 2024). But still I get reoccuring nightmares from my traumatic childhood memories which affects my sleep.

Medications help, but I’m not happy relying on them. Now catching up to exercise cardio to go back to normal again and hopefully not rely to.medications.

--
Main Struggles

1. Unexplained food intolerances.

2. Inability to tolerate crowded, noisy places.

3. Persistent anxiety about health and test results.
My latest neuro doctor recommended me to take anti depressants again and have a good therapy since I might have PTSD symptoms.
4. I hope anyone can explain how a 78% nwutrophils is normal, I hope the STD stuff is not adding up to.my current issue.
but after I recovered from my STD on April 2024, I never went hook ups again so I am 80% sure this is not STF related symtpoms.
5. I dont have a frea**ing Septum in my brain, which 2 neuro doctors said I shouldnt worry about it based on my CT scan

I'm looking for a good quality POD service. I've read horrible things about pretty much all of the major services, but mostly those have been concerning the design peeling or washing off of T-shirts, apparel coming out the wrong color, etc. I'm not looking for options in apparel though. I'm more interested in posters, sketch journals and other stationary, stickers, maybe canvas bags?, wallets, phone covers, and coffee mugs maybe but I'd be more excited to find other ceramic options, coasters, decorative pillows is another maybe. I looked at Printify's throw blankets but the shipping is high even if you just want a sample, and I'm hesitant because I've seen the most and worst bad reviews for Printify and Printful. Has anyone had any luck there for things other than clothing?

I'm not looking to get rich quickly or anything. I already had a side hustle/ creative outlet making resin coasters and other stuff, along with handmade jewelry that I sold out of the flea market, on FB  marketplace, and the occasional craft show. That was about 4 years ago though, before a series of unfortunate events that took my life in an entirely different direction. Lately, my SO and I have been buying pallets of products and selling them at the flea market.

 Anyway, back to POD. I'm not sure what I want exactly. Maybe to buy a few and sell them in person, or maybe set up an Etsy, or similar. I just want to make sure I'm not wasting my time and $ on POD sites that sound like scams to me. Also, I need something that is going to be easy to use and beginner-friendly. 

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Can I tell you about my adventure learning about AI and deep learning? When I first opened a book about it, my head was spinning! I remember staring at words like ""neural networks"" and ""backpropagation"" like they were written in alien language.

I still laugh thinking about my first attempt to understand how AI learns. I was sitting in my favorite coffee shop, surrounded by notebooks filled with scribbles, trying to make sense of it all. The barista probably thought I was losing it - I kept drawing the same diagrams over and over!

But then I found a way that worked for me. Instead of trying to eat the whole cake at once (that's how big the subject felt!), I took tiny bites. I started with just understanding what AI actually is - like explaining it to my grandma. ""It's like teaching a computer to learn from examples, just like how you taught me to bake cookies by showing me,"" I told her. Her face lit up, and suddenly it made more sense to me too!

Here's something funny - I started explaining these ideas to my rubber duck (yes, a real rubber duck on my desk!). Sounds weird, right? But talking to that duck helped me figure out what I really understood and what still confused me. When I got stuck explaining something, I knew that's what I needed to study next.

I remember my first tiny project - teaching a computer to tell apart pictures of cats and dogs. It was super simple, but wow, did it feel good when it actually worked! Each small win gave me confidence to tackle something a bit harder.

These days, when someone mentions deep learning, I don't break into a cold sweat anymore. I actually get excited to talk about it! And the best part? I love seeing that ""aha!"" moment in others' eyes when they finally get a tricky concept.

Are you trying to learn about AI or deep learning too? What's the thing that's making your brain hurt right now? Maybe we can figure it out together - sometimes just talking about it helps make those big, scary ideas feel more manageable!",1,1732980837.0,Deep_Learning_Tips,0,1.0,False

1h3ez7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WisdomWriters/comments/1h3ez7d/body_and_soul/,Body and Soul,"Some people believe in the immortality of the soul, but not Mr. Sutter, or ""Old Man"" Sutter, as he was colloquially referred to by his neighbors. That is, whenever he wasn't in earshot. He didn't buy into the nonsense about an immortal soul; instead, he held firm to the belief that not only does the soul die, but, in most cases, it does so long before the miserable shell that it inhabits will. Poor damn bodies just keep chugging along, ignorant of the fact that their long-time roommate won't be home for supper ever again.

The sun hadn't yet started its day's routine when Mr. Sutter was already pouring his first cup of coffee. He didn't need to set an alarm like in the days of his youth. Nowadays, he would just wake every hour or two until he decided he was finally finished with the teeter-totter ride and start the same day over again that he started the day before and the day before that. He ran a calloused hand up and down the right side of his face to survey three days' worth of bristle there. His consideration to shave hadn't lasted one round while in the ring with its unevenly matched opponent, *What's the Point?*, the heavyweight champion of Mr. Sutter's lasting mindset.

Sutter didn't know exactly when *his* soul gave up the ghost, but he was confident that it was long dead. No eulogy was given for it, and no obituary was ever written for it. But it *was* entombed and in a glass casket no less, for any and all to behold who dare look upon its pitiful dried husk. All they need to do is look into Mr. Sutter's tired eyes.

As a child and even a young adult, that soul of his shined through those eyes with a far greater luster than a mountain of diamonds catching a sunrise. They burned like suns of their own, fueled by the desire to experience life. He often thought his eyes had been his most commanding feature. Maybe his *only* commanding feature. But now? Now, those eyes didn't shine anymore. They harbored only the desiccated remains of what was.

Although the soul just up and died without any kind of warning, and despite its life not having been celebrated with the usual pomp and ceremony that is common for its much less interesting lodging place, the body, when it dies, the soul, like any other loved one, leaves behind memories. Mr. Sutter remembered clearly how he felt while his soul was still alive and healthy. He remembered how much it enjoyed riding a bicycle down blistered summer roads and the sound the tires would make running over the sticky asphalt. The music it created just as well had been composed by Mozart himself; it was so damn beautiful. And he remembered how his soul would treat him with a certain, indescribable magical feeling when he would wake in the morning with the window open no more than a crack. The chill of the autumn air permeated the room and left the tip of his nose frozen, while the rest of him was warm and snug beneath layers of heavy blankets. He remembered the powerful radiating force his soul would emit while eating a bowl of hot oatmeal prepared by his mother after he had been playing in knee-deep snow drifts all morning long. How the steam would carry the scent of warm cinnamon to frolic around his face as he shoveled spoonful after spoonful. Then there was the memory of Sherry Erving sitting in the passenger seat of his old '77 Oldsmobile; she was wearing that red t-shirt that might've been a little too tight for modesty. Vividly, he could recall what felt like going warp speed down that country road, left hand on the wheel, right hand clutching Sherry's right shoulder. All the windows down and warm summer air rushing over them and whipping their hair into a chaotic frenzy; all the while, Taylor Dayne's voice blasting from the radio, demanding that someone tell something to her heart, and they, doing their best to sing along with her. Man! His soul especially loved that night.

Now things were different, and Old Man Sutter knew it. Even if he tried to relive those old joys, he'd just be going through the motions. And he'd probably look the damn fool to boot. And oatmeal? He could do with or without it. The body finds no joy in oatmeal. It only brings pleasure to the soul. Yes, there was no doubt; his soul was deceased. Maybe it was poisoned a little bit here and there until, at last, it succumbed to the toxin. Or maybe it was beat to death with the rhythmic, hard-hitting blows of daily routine. It may have just been crushed to paste by the mighty weight of responsibility. Whatever the case, it was truly and unarguably dead. Departed. Gone. No more.

About eight years ago . . . Ten years ago? Twelve? Hell! He didn't know. Being able to tell time by weeks, months, and years must've been business for the soul because now, time bled together something awful. What Mr. Sutter thought might've happened a year or two back may have actually been upwards of four years ago. But some time ago, however long, he had heard Sherry Erving was now Sherry Young; she taught high school English class (had been for years), and she had two kids of her own. He oftentimes wondered if it had been that Brian Young prick that she married. He didn't completely know why, and he knew full well that it was none of his concern either way, but he had hoped that it wasn't.

Old Man Sutter had been married once, too. Almost a full year. She vanished nearly as quickly as his soul had. Although he was much quicker to notice her absence when she was gone. She may have been the first to give his soul a little drop of poison. A parting gift before she began a new life. Who knows? All the paperwork was passed along through the ""friendly"" hands of the postal carrier, who (he was sure) would look at him with daggers after she would bluntly state, ""I need you to sign here, Mr. Sutter."" As she left, ""Have a good day, Mr. Sutter,"" and the toothiest damn smile he ever saw. That was almost thirty-two years ago. He could still see that patronizing, toothy smile as clearly as if it was a photograph. And whenever he thought about it, his face flushed, and he muttered very unpleasant words.

Not too long after Mr. Sutter's soul died, an unruly bunch made themselves at home. Cynicism seemed to be the leader of the group. Then there was Cynicism's kid brother, and second in command, Bitterness. A day wouldn't go by without Mr. Sutter hearing from both of them. They were always quick to offer their bombastic opinions. Arthritic Knees really liked to make themselves known too and were bad company for the other two, often instigating them into bad behavior. Mr. Sutter didn't know if they had rightly inherited what was once his soul's property or if they were simply opportunistic squatters that saw a void and filled it. Either way, he didn't like their company nearly as much as he had enjoyed that of his soul's.

Mr. Sutter groaned and lowered himself into his recliner. When he did this, his knees made the kind of crunching, crackling sound one might expect to hear if they were to gently squeeze a bag of cereal. Hearing that sound bothered him a few years ago, but now it was so commonplace that he hardly gave it a second thought. He pulled the lever on the side of the chair, and the footrest kicked up with a metallic twang and a pop. Then he shifted once, twice, and a third time until he was as close to comfortable as he was likely to get.

Television was the same every day. The world was on fire, and everyone trying to fight against it was using buckets of gasoline. Some days television just depressed him. Other days it left him angry and disgusted. But every day he watched. What else was there to do for an old man with no family, no job, and no soul?

It wasn't too long before the television lulled Mr. Sutter back to sleep. As he sat and napped, images of Sherry Erving, that postal carrier, and the factory where he once worked all played around in his head. And Brian Young, too. Brian Young, whom he had not seen since long before he was ""Old Man"" Sutter. Back then, he was simply Rick. Ricky to his friends. But Brian Young was not among that small group of people.

Brian Young was a senior in high school when Mr. Sutter was a sophomore, and he called him neither Rick nor Ricky. He preferred instead to call him Dick. And instead of Sutter, he would say ""Sucker."" That always got plenty of laughs from everyone. There were other petty torments as well, but none that stung quite as painfully or that were as memorable as that stupid nickname. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will haunt you forever.

Mr. Sutter woke to the sound of someone knocking at his front door. At that sound, anxiety ran up and down Mr. Sutter's spine like a rabbit, not knowing which side of the road it wanted to escape to in order to avoid the car that was barreling towards it. Company wasn't something Mr. Sutter was used to. In truth, it wasn't something he enjoyed. Especially when it was unexpected.

After a few moments, the rapping at the front door repeated itself. For one fleeting moment, Mr. Sutter considered ignoring it. He found that his mother's well-intentioned advice to deal with bullies was far more effective against unwanted company. ""Ignore them, and they'll go way."" But finally he conceded, lowered his footrest, and grunted as he stood. ""Just a moment,"" he yelled as he reached for a shirt to throw on.

Mr. Sutter once heard a fella on television tell someone else that the universe was indifferent. He wasn't too sure if he could get on board with that train of thought or not. It sure as hell seemed to like its practical jokes it would occasionally pull on people. Those little moments of irony and coincidence that leave people blinking in dumbfounded disbelief. No. Mr. Sutter was sure that the universe had a sense of humor, and more often than not, people were made the butt of the joke.

Before he opened the door, Mr. Sutter glanced out the window to see who it was that was disturbing him. Some kid he'd never seen before was standing with his back to the door, staring across the street where a moving van was parked. A ""kid."" He must've been in his early or mid-twenties, but still a kid in the eyes of Old Man Sutter. He unlocked the door and opened it part way.

*Who are you? What do you want? I hope this isn't going to take long*, was what he thinking. He said, ""Can I help you?""

The kid turned and smiled. Mr. Sutter was certain he'd never seen him before, but there was something familiar about him. ""Hi! Good morning,"" he said, sunshine oozed from his lips. ""I just moved in next door. I wanted to introduce myself.""

*Oh! Boy! A new neighbor. And an outgoing one. Great. Well, I hope you don't plan on popping over here any ol' damn time you feel like it*. ""Oh! Well, welcome to the neighborhood,"" Mr. Sutter said, not knowing what else to say. Here, he opened the door a little wider and held his hand out to shake. ""Rick Sutter.""

""It's good to meet you, sir."" Taking Mr. Sutter's hand, he gave it a firm shake and continued, ""I'm Brian. Brian Young Jr.""",3,1732980690.0,WisdomWriters,0,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1h3eqzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1h3eqzz/aita_for_telling_my_gf_to_stop_selling_feet_photos/,AITA for telling my gf to stop selling feet photos,"For context, my gf(23) and | M(22) have been dating for a few months over a year now. Before we started dating she did let me know she does sell feet photos on the side to some guys she knows who pay for her to show her feet or send certain photos of said feet in all sorts of different situations.

I've been through different phases of it and sometimes I'm fine with it and her getting some extra money isn't any of my worries. She pays for my train tickets to visit sometimes, my lunches, or towards gifts for me, herself, anything under the sun it's just an extra money opportunity. With seeing the money be used on me aswell and recently I had been on an unemployment bender looking for a real job. She helped me and supported me through it all.
Other times l've felt uncomfortable with the idea, I understand she's not cheating and she's assured me it's only her feet and she has not ties emotionally to this man, but the idea of another man worshipping my woman's body has always been a struggle for me.
Like no that's my lady I don't want some dude thinking that's also his just because he pays for it.
(Below is a rant I had with some close friends)
Okay, I've come to a realization w this whole feet thing with my gf During my broke period (Still broke rn) I told her I don't want to hold her back from a side hustle I can't provide her money and this guy
""John"" is sending her money here and there for feet shit She's assured me there's no flirting or anything beyond his foot fetish But they snap constantly Like he's in her best friends list And if it's nothing beyond the foot fetish Why does she snap him her face and shit and they actually stay in contact

I've gone through phases w it, like yes you can do it get your money and then other times I'm like no l don't want you to do it, it makes me uncomfortable The last phase ended w telling her I'm okay w it and I can't give her money right now so if he's just paying for things to see her feet but nothing else idgaf But I woke up thinking about all the times I've been w her and he'll Snapchat her and she just responds w a selfie or some shit Got me thinking, yes he's attracted to her feet but for them to be snapping he must also be attracted to her face and her body right? Like no guy just wants a girls feet n nothing else I don't believe that So now I'm back into phase I don't like it and it makes me uncomfortable. Or if I'm w her she sends him a selfie of us letting him know I'm around and usually won't see much more of the guy after that.
So like?? Are they talking more on the side when I'm not around and that's when he's getting his little online gf attention bc she's trynna get a bag almost as if she was like a onlyfans girl just replying to the horny dude and making him feel validated ending up so he'll pay for her shit??? Like she's told me she would stop if I didn't like it and she has in the past but I wasn't able to provide extra money for nails, coffee, shopping, lunch so l was like go ahead like you can do it get your money and do what you gotta do But now, I woke up and I don't like it at all actually thinking about all the extra details I provided above Why you showing him your face, are the fit checks I get on the daily also going to him to entice him enough to stick around and pay for feet and horny shit

Like I don't wanna think some of the selfies I see and
¡ appraise, he's also gettin the same snap thinking it was for him too That part is kinda fucking w me And I want to bring it up to her but this would be the 8th time I've switch my perspective on it saying she can or can't do it But now there's more factors im accounting for about it all and I just don't think I like it anymore Now that I will have money coming in, I don't want her doing that shit But on the other side,
""John"" was paying for my train tickets here and there or sometimes he even paid for my lunch but he thought that money was going to her when in reality she also used it on me She's being loyal I don't think she's doing anything that would make me upset
I don't think she has any attraction to this dude son But if it's just for feet and fetishes why is he in your best friends list and having constant visuals of you and other things beside your feet I think it's the showing him I'm around is the part I'm struggling w Bc it always happens when she or I visit He at some point snaps her and she'll respond showing I'm around like is that code for no horny shit until l'm gone or is she showing him she does have a man so to like stay in a lane

Ig the devils advocate on my shoulder is telling me she's partially cheating, like there is some sort of attraction to the partnership they have even if he's just a horny dog wanting to see her feet like maybe she finds that aspect of it attractive and that he wants a part of her body and the idea he'll pay to see her is a thrill like that feels like cheating to me if it becomes a kink for her aswell like enjoying the attention
I guess l'm looking for some opinions on how some other people would feel on it or if I just gotta stop being a bitch about it. Thank you for the read.",1,1732980021.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

Given I'd done nothing to initiate this i.e. didn't have Wallet open, didn't pass my phone over the card reader, is this even possible? Can Wallet just decide to pay without any intervention from the user?

The only thing I can think of is I somehow did have Wallet open at the time, but it was never on the screen.

If anyone can explain what might have happened I'd be grateful.",0,1732979717.0,iphone,7,0.25,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I informed the farmer that the only reason the Women were buying his aubergines was to put them into their vaginas to simulate the act of sex. The farmer, rendered fair bashful by this, decided to implement a prepurchase questionnaire to filter out the misuse of his fresh produce. We sat in a small coffee shop the following afternoon and he was showing me the sort of questions he had come up with. A waitress brought us our hot beverages and gave me a wink, ""that'll be no charge Father,"" she said in a thick Irish accent, by God she was up for it, ""I say, my dear,"" I said, ""I haven't seen you at confession lately,"" and she smiled that she had been being a good girl and so had no reason to trouble me, and I told her that it was no trouble at all to hear her inner-most perversions and sprinkle the old holy water upon her face and chest as she 'Ave'd Maria'. She made her excuses and left our table.

""Cor,"" said the farmer, ""right old pair on her,"" and he laughed aloud and then his face turned pale and he stuttered and made as if he were talking about her shoes.

I took a sip from my coffee and smiled as he listed off with these excuses, and then I held up my palm, bringing him to silence, ""you know, Dave,"" I said, ""it is no sin that Adam admired and toyed with the udders of Eve; who was his own sister, and that he did so all the time under the smiling countenance of God Himself, indeed,"" I went on, ""it was Satan who introduced the idea of being ashamed at the body into Adam and Eves mind and caused God to throw them out of the garden of paradise.""

And the farmer was amazed, ""I had no idea that was the Churches position all this time,"" he said, taking up his coffee cup, ""you should, you know,"" he was trying to find the right words, ""say this in Church now and again, so people know,"" and he took a sip, ""you know?""

I changed the subject, ""have you finished writing the questionnaire?"" I asked him.

He held up a piece of crumpled notepaper, ""I have condensed a long list of questions into one single question,"" and said this in the manner of one with insight, and he handed me the paper, beaming.

I chuckled at the question, genuinely impressed, ""I like it,"" I said, and read: ""are you intending to shove this aubergine into your vagina?"" and I laughed, ""yes,"" I said again, wiping away a tear, ""it is very good; it will surprise and shame them.""

Farmer Dave and I talked further over our coffee. He had a cousin with very large breasts, it turned out, who had been told quite the contrary opinion by a Nun at some point. I explained that it was different for Women; that a Woman jealously guarded her anatomy and sought to enslave Men by lust, by the act of concealment and selective exposure, and that Nuns were only tasked with administering this lesson to other Women, and that Men are not supposed to take it seriously and this explanation seemed to satisfy him.

""These are like great revelations, Father,"" he piped up, producing a flask of whiskey and topping up our coffees, ""nobody has ever actually sat down and explain this to me before,"" he paused for a moment, seeming to be thinking of more words, ""I don't think many people in our village are aware of any of this,"" he said, ""they have some quite backward opinions about the matter, in fact.""

I shrugged, ""indeed: the Devil lays in wait.""

Farmer Dave hesitated and then said, ""yes I see what you mean there,"" and he leaned back again in his chair, ""well blow me,"" which was a colloquial expression of relief.

""Swish! Swish! Swish!"" said the Instructor to the class, he was explaining how to use the magic wand, that is: the penis.

""Oh no,"" shouted Ronald Weasels, as he came across the front row, ""I'll never be a Wizert,"" and he fell to this knees sobbing, spreading his semen all over his face quite inadvertently.

Hermonia watched all of this unfold from her hiding place in the cupboard in the corner of the class room, ""girls not allowed!"" she hissed, ""now I know why!"" and she took out her magical dildo and flapped it all around, ""transformius meus boyus nowus!"" she whispered, and the cupboard exploded.

""Satans britches!"" exclaimed Professor Dumbfuch, and he put his hands on his hips in what was probably intended to be a display of authority and annoyance but seemed rather flamboyant instead, ""who are you?"" he shouted at the boy who had emerged from the cupboard, ""by Lucifers tendrils!"" he added.

The boy who had emerged from the cupboard staggered around, ""by golly!"" he said, with a snorty snotty sort of voice; his upper teeth hung over his lower lip, a great pair of thick spectacles balanced upon his upturned nose; which resembled much of a pig, and his face was a polka dot tapestry of modern art, ""I did done think I did done something clever!"" he lisped, and then he said, ""duh?!"" as he struggled to remember what it was he had done.

Professor Dumbfuch cursed under his breath at the ignorant blathering poltroons he was forced to endure and have call him 'sir', his fists clenched in the pockets of his petticoats and he ordered to boy to take out his penis and participate in the class.

""My pee-pee?"" mooed Hermione, ""Wha- I thhhhink I got one of them somewhere.."" and she pulled out her waistband and looked down, much to the amusement of the entire class.

""Swish! Swish! Swish!""

""Swish! Swish! Swish!""

This wasn't so hard. No pun intended. Hermiones brain seemed to settle with the chemical input of a thimbleful of testosterone upon her own seething mess of unbridled rampant sexually charged estrogen, and her senses seemed to have recovered their normal faculty.

She looked at Ronald Weasal who stood beside her, ""swish! swish!"" he was saying, repeating after the teacher, ""hey Ron,"" she hissed, catching his attention, ""you're doing great,"" and she nodded down at his penis and gave him a long and lustful wink, ""keep it up,"" and she giggled, ""no pun intended!""

""URGH!"" shouted Ron, ""you fucking queer!"" and he backed away, knocking into the boys to the side of him, their pensies slashing across his own backside, causing him to utter another ""URGH!""

Professor Dumbfuch nearly lost his temper, ""By the ball sack of the METATRON,"" he roared, ""WEASELS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!""

And Ron, again, collapsed onto the floor sobbing into his hands. It was all too much for him.

Some weeks had passed in Pighead Borstal. Heromoania had utterly forgotten how to reverse her magical spell which had inverted her sex, although technically speaking the inverse of that was true. What's worse was that Ronald McDonald thought she was a flaming faggot, because, apparently, the slight drip of male hormones into her brain had awoken some deepsea lusts that had dwelled within the murky pits of her estrogen addled normalcy, and because of this she was horny as fuck for Ron. As in like: all the time and dripping wet.

What's worse is that Gyno Wezzles, who was Rons piping hot little sister, had developed a full on fucklust for Heromonion. What's worse is that Professor Dumbfuch had declared Heromoniumb a 'Tardy Pupil' for having seemingly vanished without a trace, and that handsome fucking awful boy Draco Dragoncock had 'falsely reported' seeing Hermione with a dick in her mouth, riding the 4/20 bus to Cumtown, and he had been believed.

""You've got such a nice arse,"" purred Gyno Wezzles, rubbing her palms all over Hermons fat sweaty body, ""I bet you've never had anyone stick their tongue up there, have you?!""

""FUCKING JESUS!"" shouted Hermione, leaping to her feet.

/

There was a clumsy knock on Professor Dumbfucks door, ""come,"" he called, ""no pun intended,"" he mumbled, sniggering to himself. His eyes skirted up from his porno magazine, and he grimaced, ""you,"" he said, in a flat monotone.

Hermon Goering began to stutter, playing with her chest, ""um, golly willies, Professor Dumbfuch-""

""THAT IS NOT HOW MY NAME IS PRONOUNCED"" Professor Dumbfuch shouted, throwing down his magazine and pounding his desk with his fists. He pounded several more times before the anger was sapped from his brain, at least as much so as it could, given the nature of his employment. He took to his feet, ""by Prosperines strung out body,"" he wailed, throwing himself to the open window, ""I would that Hermione Grangie would come back to my class, I fucking MISS HER,"" and he began to cry.

And Hermion Ganggangs fat unshaven face lit up as like Sol on the wax of Icarus, ""but Professor,"" she said, ""actually, I am a girl!""

Professor Dumbfuch was motionless, but his shoulders fell slightly, ""oh god,"" he sobbed, ""why does it just get worse, and worse, and worse...?""

""I mean that I 'AM' Hermon Gangbang, I casted a spell in the cupboard to make myself a boy, so I could be a weel withert, and gosh golly bananas candlesticks oatmeal,"" and she trailed away as the tears poured from her face, like stuck bag of old oil being caught on a rusty nail and the contents spilling all down the cellar steps.

Professor Dumdumb turned, ""is it so?!"" he pontificated, all of sudden seated and smoking a pipe, ""well that is rather a pickle,"" he chortled, ""no pun intended,"" and then added, ""by Satans Underpants,"" for it was sort of his job to make those sort of references for the purposes of edification to the student body as to what 'Magic' really was all about - this anyway is Christian Novel.

Hermonia stood, bollock naked, before the Professor, ""swish, swish,"" laughed the Professor, drumming his hands on the arm rest of his chair, ""swish swish!"" he kept saying, until slaver fell from his mouth and his face turned the pigment of an eggplant. Hermonia danced this way and that, singing, ""doo doo doo,"" in some half-hearted effort to entertain the foul old man.

""Enough!"" Professor Dumbfuch shouted, and Hermonia stumbled to a halt, she was caked in sweat and felt absolutely ridiculous, ""alright, alright,"" muttered the Professor, grasping his wand, ""I'll turn you into a woman,"" and he laughed at some private joke which Hermon didn't understand, but which Hagrid, who had entered the room with Hermon, found incredibly amusing.

""Wait,"" cried Robbie Coltrane, ""before you change her back, Dumbledonk, I must ask something,"" and he looked away, almost in shame, ""I must know... and you, Hermog, are the only one who can answer this question.""

""We have no time!"" shouted the Professor, ""the Wyvern approaches!"" and indeed, a big dragon was coming.

""I must know!"" shouted Hagboy, ""how would you compare being rogered in the rectum to being creamed in the quim? Is it..."" and tears welled in his eyes, ""..is it the same?""

""I am a virgin,"" said Hermione, ""so I would not know.""

Hagrid's face turned into a scowl, ""well then..."" and he began to growl and groan, ""YOU ARE JUST USELESS!"" and he flounced out of the room in an overly flamboyant manner.

Professor Dumbfuch sighed, ""it is time,"" he said, ""to bring this to end,"" and he waved his wand, ""turnus backus,"" he muttered and went back to his Comfy Chair, and the spell was instantly broken.

""Oh thank you!"" cried Hermiemoon, and she ran to the magical mirror which leered from the back of the classroom, and she admired her body as it always had been: her snorty snout, her upper teeth hanging over her lower lip, a great pair of thick spectacles balanced upon her upturned nose; which resembled much of a pig, and her face a polka dot tapestry of modern art.

""I say, Professor,"" she lisped, wiping snort from her nose, and snorting as little pig in the manner she always did, ""that was all jolly fun, but I think I'd like to just forget all about this,"" and she sang, ""fa la a la la,"" and skipped from the classroom with her tiny teats bouncing upon her flabby belly.

Professor Dumbfuch sighed and turned his attention back to his class, ""now where were we?"" he asked a random eight year old.

Michel came across my back, ""bon hom,"" he chuckled, and we spent the rest of the evening eating raw onions and baguettes.

""Michel,"" I said, ""don't you ever miss France?""

His face fell, ""senor,"" he said, ""it bring'a me much'a pain'a to think of'a my home'a land'a,"" and I gasped aloud, ""Michel!"" I cried, and embraced him tightly, ""you are my Frenchman now,"" I assured him, ""you may stamp upon grapes for with to make white wine in my garden, at any time you choose,"" and I cooed these words as if speaking to a dog or a baby, and he said, ""really senor, you'a mean it?"" and he beamed like a child.

I sighed with contentment as Michel ran from my bedroom and into the garden where he began jumping up and down.

The telephone rang.

""Prince Andrew, your grace, your brother; the King of England, requests you to lead a Crack Battalion of Sas troopers to plunder the Koreas both Southern and Northern whilst garbed in the mantle of Iranian Navy,"" came the voice.

""NO!"" I roared, ""the uniforms are too drab!"" and I pinched the bridge of my nose, exasperated at the universe, ""can we not simply wear our silk pyjamas?""

The voice hesitated, and finally an ""as you wish, you grace,"" and there was a click.

I rubbed my hands together with joy at the coming prospect, ""Michel!"" I cooed, dingling a little bell between my thumb and finger, ""Oh Michel! We have a Mission!""

We rode our helicopter blasting ""O' Vienna"" as we soared across the Reaverlands en route to Scone. I fancied that the whole of the North came and stood in the fields and along the motorways to salute their Grand Duke as he charged in armor to meet another foe of Mighty England. Of course they did not, praise God that they slept sound and ignorant toward my great sacrifices and perils.

""Bless you England! Bless the North!"" I roared through the din of propeller blades, and then I put my hand to my face and moved it down and then up again in the manner of my Mother when greeting a rabble of sycophants.

""It means nothing to me!"" I sang, ""it means nothing to me! O' Vienna!""

I strode through the halls of Scone House, the secret Command of the Royal Supreme Admiralty Cum Flying Tank Squadron Commando Special Service Palace Guard Ceremonial Knightly Order Platoon, half-drunk on my own valor. I slammed open the doors, ""let us raise Merry Hell!"" I shouted at nobody in particular, as helpmeets scurried all around to greet me and bask in my aura.

Within minutes our squadron were thundering down in jetpacks upon the barren streets of Pyong Yang.

I cursed as a giant net engulfed my entire person and found that I had been snared by Kim John, the Black Emperor Himself. I roared and bellowed and thrust with my sword and pistol but to no avail.

""Pwince Andwoo,"" the foul Man said, ""You are mwy pwisoner nwow,"" and he began to laugh.

# matter-of-factly and with a shit-eating grin

*""Can you go past the Mulberry Bush? The Mulberry Bush? The Mulberry Bush? Can you go past the Mulberry Bush - early in the morning,""* asked Edward, matter-of-factly and with a shit-eating grin.

Mary Starkers turned around and around as she struggled to face him, fast giving up and returning to her seat on the train, ""tell me, senor,"" she said, taking a Barracuda Singer by his coat sleeve, ""who is that man?"" and the Barracuda Singer informed her that it was ""Hedhorday,"" which was the Spanish way of saying Edward, and that he was a ""singer, also,"" and the Barracuda Singer began to sing himself.

*""El Chair on El Patio, 'round and around and around we go! El Chair on El Patio, now that you know you're better you know!""* and the Barracuda Singer sang this matter-of-factly and with a shit-eating grin.

Mary Starkers found that she had began to jive to the beat of the rock and roll band and she thrust her entire body from the train compartment window, singing, ""isn't life grand?"" and then the train dashed her torso into a fine paste as it turned a hard corner and entered a funnel.

""Oy Vey!"" cried the Barracuda Singer, and ""Oh sugar-smacks!"" cried the Edward, both matter-of-factly and with a shit-eating-grin.

Mary was in a better place, by all accounts. At least that is what the passengers on the 800-813 Express to Chutney were informed by the mechanical priest who jitterbugged his sermon Number Eleven. But none of it was true.

A clammy pair of hands ran up the legs of Johnathan Dungelpeterstadsboroughs-O'Quiche, and he roared like a jolly elephant as he found Mary laying atop of his rotund form later at night, in the Bed.

""I'm coming for you, Johnathan,"" explained Mary and it was all a dream.

/

""Sod!"" exclaimed Johnathan when he awoke, ""that was rather pleasing to the marbles,"" and he turned to his Wipe who lay beside him in the Bed, and he began to sing a pepper song,

*""I like my cabbage with mangos and rice,*

*I like my cabbage, let's have it tonight,*

*I like my cabbage with mangos and beans,*

*I like my cabbage, when after Good Dreams,""*

and then he began to pound the mattress, screaming at the top of his lungs.

""Gobek to slep'e,"" /X/claimed the Wipe, who lay idle in a package of thirty on the pillow, and Johnathan cried in shock and distress at the ephemeral voice which had emanated from his package of wipes, ""you are the devil,"" he reasoned, and immediately took up his telephone in his hand, ""police please,"" he said, ""get me The Pope,""

""Yes, this is The Pope speaking, what's the trouble?"" asked the Pope, speaking directly into the loudspeaker.

*""Hello,"" said Johnathon, ""I've a theological quandary for you to hear,*

*if you've got the time to spear,*

*call me daffy if you wish,*

*but my soul is on the line and I'll make it quick,""*

*""Dash and blast I'm a busy man,""*

*said the Pope, ""get to it, as fast as you can,""*

*""I think I've seen Jesus in a Cadburys Egg,*

*he came right out and touched my head,*

*he swore up and down that he was the Messiah,*

*but the notion comes to me now that he was a liar,""*

*""Ah, my boy, you're right to be the skeptic,*

*but tell me one thing; was his tone apoplectic?""*

*""All I can say with any degree of certainty*

*was that he had a shit-eating grin and looked about thirty,*

*and everything he said was in a matter-of-fact way*

*and he said if I called you you'd tell me what to say,*

*since he was insistent that I was now the Christ*

*because he'd gotten too busy and he some problem with his Wife,""*

*""Curses,"" came The Pope, ""that sounds like Him,*

*alright, my boy, tell me everything.""*

# JESUS: SON OF PANTERA

The Prophet Ioannes was laying in wait with his band of scraggly followers along a roadside somewhere in-between Iudea and the fishing villages that sat, without much success in fishing, on the coast of the Dead Sea which was an untapped salt deposit whose bounties were unknown to the local peoples. The followers of Ioannes were little more than brigands; poorly armed and lightly armored, and comprised no more than seven in number. Their economy consisted of the robbery and molestation of travelers along the road and, indeed, any who could not pay the exorbitant toll fee which Ioannes collected nominally on behalf of Archon Agrippa. As luck would have it, for Ioannes and his brigands, the Roman Propraetor and the Archon had failed to reach any kind of compromise on mining the salt and so no Roman Legionaries had been deployed to capture, crucify and end the reign of Ioannes over this small and insignificant part of the province of Arabia Petraea. Most merchant parties upon the roads, in any case, were fairly well-armed and numerous and so Ioannes posed no real impediment to the flow of commerce, thus, when the reader questions How and Why the events in this account were able to transpire as they did it was because nobody really cared about it.

It was at the time of our third prayers of the day that Ioannes and his heathen pirates spotted a likely victim. A lone Berber fellow with a African hair and wearing a garment with inverted seams cut a striking figure even at a distance, ""corr,"" said one of the pirates, ""that there be Iesus, the son of Pantera, he is neither of our world nor of their world,"" and they laughed at his unfortunate circumstance of birth, ""yet proclaims himself a Priest,"" and he added, ""of our heathen religion of which the specifics are not worth mentioning here,"" and another said, ""let us descend upon him from this hillock and set all about him with menace, and let us make pretense to extract coin from him and when he cannot pay we shall put a great radish into his bottom, as is our custom.""

Ioannes slavered at the prospect, for he was a low fellow of base impulses and the notion of violating the son of a Roman Citizen held high appeal to his ilk.

And so they set about enacting their heathen designs upon Iesus. Charging in a scattered manner down the side of the hillock, rotating their weapons above their heads in the style of the Dacians and patting at their mouths mid-hail so as to produce a ""wa wa wa wa"" effect which was deemed terrifying in their society, indeed, in many barbarian societies.

Iesus, for he had been trained somewhat in the artifices of War by his Father Pantera, spotted the oncoming barbarians and he merely smiled, for he knew that such was their impulse and total lack of self-restraint that by the time they reached him along the distance they would be much exhausted. Iesus was left-handed also and so had an advantage in close-quarter combat from the beginning. As the savages ran toward him, Iesus quietly dropped a handful of caltrops upon the path and made all of a sudden as if he had only just noticed them, and he readied his concealed gladius and pugio and made pretense to flee.

The savages, having exhausted themselves by the moderate sprint, had fogged their heads from the exertion and did not see the caltrops until a full four of their number had been crippled and mortally wounded by them. Ioannes, the slavering imbecile himself, had become impaled through the foot and he fell to the floor wailing in his heathen insignificant tongue, which was probably a form of vulgar Greek.

The unscathed brigands hesitated to pursue, having four of their seven incapacitated and unable to fight, ""you cowards,"" shouted Ioannes, ""follow the golem, chase him down, bring him to me!"" and he pawed feebly at his wounds which were lesser so than his comrades, two of which had been impaled fully through the ball of the heel, shattering their foot and lower leg entirely and would be cripples until the day they died. They flailed around pitiably, begging not to have their throats cut and their share of the loot taken from them to be left for dead, as was their custom.

It was at this point that they became aware that Iesus was running towards them all and they steeled themselves for impact, though their strength was much depleted. Iesus flung first his pugio into the nearest of them, striking the brigand in the fat of his gut and within the next instant had run straight past him, tearing the pugio from the fellows somtach with a gay twist and causing his innards to spill out upon the dirt.

Two of the remaining men rushed forwards themselves, one swinging with a curved blade and the other with an axe, but Iesus had come to a halt before they made their swings and had drawn his gladius and easily skewered each man through the back of their ribs and shoulders, causing them to fall forwards into a writhing heap of limbs.

The final man began to run, crying out for mercy, that he was ""the youngest,"" and that he had been bullied against his will into accompanying the brigands, and that they had forced him to perform sexual intercourse with his rectal cavity in the Athenian manner, and all the things we are familiar with what barbarian pirates say when a small skirmish does not go in their favor.

Iesus, some say, took the man as a slave whilst others say he cut the man and staked him out to be consumed by the cruel sun that burned in these lands, it is of little consequence except that in later days,some said, Iesus was often seen with a chained fellow whom he led by a ring through his lip and that it greatly pleased him to permit the wretched man, whomsoever he was, to serve him and wash his feet with oils and so on.

Now, when Iesus came to Ioannes he grabbed up the brigand leader by his beard and dragged him, screaming in protest, down to the coast of the salt sea, and made much sport of drowning and then reviving Ioannes, punching the salt water from his lungs and twisting the caltrop embedded in his foot when the fellow seemed either despondent or to have become dead from the water in his lungs, ""I will teach you be a fisher of men, cunt,"" Iesus roared each time, before thrusting Ioannes under the water and roaring with laughter as the mans limbs flailed helplessly, splashing all around.

/

In the months that followed, Iesus and his warband, trained in the style of the Mamertini by Iesus, conducted guerrilla war upon Herods caravans. As per the agreement between Aeneas and Herod, no caravans from the South, the East or the North that passed through Arabia Petraea would be molested by Aeneas in exchange for a modest tribute but once those caravans had 'left' Arabia Petraea it was another story.

Much of the dispute of this matter was peripheral the greater matter of the Viceroyality over the Ten Cities; the Procurator and the Emperor Himself had given their consent that Herod and Aeneas should meet each other in war to settle the matter conclusively with the loser agreeing to exile with the full monetary sum of their estates paid for by the victor. As both Kings were evenly matched in wealth and in manpower it would be a genuine ""toss of the coin,"" as we say in Ostia, as to which of the two would be that victor. However, being so evenly matched and being of that arid desert region which does so inspire torpidity in the humors of Men, neither King was in any sort of hurry to declare war upon the other and would have gone on in this manner for decades quietly chiseling away to gain some sort of temporary strategic advantage to tip the odds of the battle more in their favor.

Aeneas, as Iesus was aware, was not interested truly in the spoils from the caravans, though he had not said to so Iesus, but eventually with enough material loss Herod would be forced to muster arms and so with the masculine rapine of a predatory lion Iesus and his band emulated yet vastly exceeded the exploits of Ioannes.

Within time the legend of these exploits had passed from tavern to bathhouse across the Ten Cities and many a cut-throat made their way along those arid banks to seek out Iesus, to prove themselves to him in battle, and join his army.

King Herod was in no doubt of what had been transpiring and brought charges of banditry to the Roman Senate whilst King Aeneas accused King Herod of manufacturing the entire affair to provide some meager pretexts for war when the war had already been agreed upon, and he made Herod look much the fool in the eyes of the Senate; adding to this that his army had been waiting on the fields for several months whilst Herod had seemed to spend so long tying the laces on his sandals as if waiting for Aeneas to die of old age rather than risk humiliation and the loss of his titles. At in particular this last remark the Senate, much advanced in years as they were, particularly resonated and demanded that Herod meet Aeneas in battle by the Kalends of Mars or his claim to the throne of Iudea would be forfeit.

Few, at first, paid heed to one of the many soldiers in Aeneas retinue that the black Mauretanian dressed in golden scale atop an equestrian tunic was Iesus himself, though it was asked, ""what right have you to wear those stripes?"" and Iesus, looking first to his employer to permission to speak his mind freely, replied that his Father had served faithfully for all of his life, dying in North Africa, and that he himself, though being too preoccupied in his youth laboring at his widowed Mothers farmsteads to have joined the Legion Proper, had the lawful right no wear the equestrian stripes even though he would not presume the rights of a Roman Citizen. Upon hearing this, and this being spoken with such eloquence as to have come from the mouth of Cato himself; in the old figures of language, those Senators around were much impressed with Iesus and would have conferred full citizenship on him there and then if he had been somewhat less inclined to the letter of law and had not insisted that a citizenship 'given' and not 'earned' meant nothing - he was, of course, entirely correct. Nonetheless, this encounter greatly bolstered Aeneas in the eyes of the Senate and the Emperor Himself, it was said, had overheard these things and remarked most favorably upon the quality of Men that King Aeneas could call upon; it reflecting much of the quality of the people of Arabia Petraea.

/

Dust danced upon the wind that swept across the barren hellscape of Iudea. Iesus narrowed his eyes as the assassin ran toward him; a shamshir at the assassins belt, both hands at the pommel, ready to draw and turn Iesus's neck into a bloody waterfall. The teeth of assassin and Iesus clenched and in a blur of motion and sand the assassin spun like a ragdoll through the air, lifeless, with a pugio strike at the base of his skull and his torso cleaved open of its own weight as it scraped the tip of Iesus's gladius.

Blood spots dashed upon Iesus's face and he touched his cheek, drawing two red marks beneath each eye, ""Roma Invicta,"" he growled.

King Arete lay in his throne, smiling at this.

""I am too old,"" he lamented, as Iesus knelt in silence before his palanquin, ""but you fight with more grace than I possessed as a young man,"" and he smiled, ""look well,"" he said, meeting Iesus's eye, ""at the fate of Men who win battles,"" and he motioned to his own body crippled by the advanced years.

They say that in the days before that battle Herod was plagued by dreams that gnawed away his sanity; that Iesus came to him in different ways each night, cutting his flesh and leaving him drowning or gasping in a puddle of blood before Herod woke screaming, and always in the shadows, watching and smiling, was Arete.

It was then that Herod sent for Saul, offering him land, coin and royal marriage if he brought to him the head of Iesus that he might place it upon a stake in the royal courtyard beside that of Ioannes. In many ways, in the greater scheme of things, Saul was to Herod was Iesus was to Arete; champions of their respective lords and avatars of their will, that is to say: heralds of their kingship, for as Iesus struck with the resolve of Iupiters Own Lightning, Saul engulfed like the fog that hung over a marsh and struck with the deadliness of jutting bone that carried necrosis in its toxified marrow.

So it was that in the thick of the battle as tactics and discipline gave way to berserker lunacy that Iesus became aware of dainty metal needles that scattered the front of his scutum and caused smoke and the stench of sulfur to fill his nostrils. With an Eagles eye he saw their origin and a shrouded figure embedded deep within the ranks of sellsword hoplites melted away, and on came the next wave of bodies; screaming roaring and one by one their cries turned to the serene slumber of death.

Iesus caught the shrouded figure again and before it could strike he heaved a weighted blade that caught the figure hard in the chest, causing the assassin to stagger backward and reveal his face.

""Roma Invicta!"" roared Iesus and he plowed forward, cutting the feet from the wall of bronze shield-bearers that he crashed upon with the force of his body behind his scutum, shattering it completely, and his blades burned through the exposed flesh of the enemy soldiers, raising them up into a chorus of screams and pleas which rippled through the entire frontline as Arete's army followed in the wake of Iesus's carnage; kicking Herod's soldiers to their knees, bringing their swords down into their chests and then moving on to do the same the next.

The assassin slumped down into the dust, the breath gone from his lungs and corked only by the throwing-knife stuck deep inside him. Iesus was at one side, then the next, cutting a circle around him and savoring him for last; like a lion guarding its meal.

Suddenly Saul felt his hair ripped and his head pulled backward into the glare of the Sol, and Iesus bore down upon him with black eyes, ""what Woman are you,"" snarled Iesus, ""that you come to a sword fight with poison darts?""

Saul, growled like a furious beast, ""I am Saul of Tarsos,"" he hissed, ""a thousand souls hang from my belt, and in my tent are chained the righteous widows and children of those souls who have become my whores,"" and he showed his teeth.

Iesus knocked the man onto his side with a kick from his nailed sandal, ""then you know, 'Saul of Tarsos', as those souls have warned you in your dreams, that Mars bears no wrath to slay you quick in a fury. You will drag from a mule with your manhood slung around your neck, and when we reach the tent of your lord and master I will cut out your tongue and you will deliver the terms of his surrender in a stream of blood.""

And Saul's courage failed him and he squealed like a crippled beast as Iesus reached between his legs and sawed away his testicles.",1,1732979541.0,2ndStoicSchool,0,1.0,False

1h3egj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h3egj4/espresso_machine_for_lattes_2000/,Espresso Machine for Lattes [€2.000],"A few weeks back I decided to pull the trigger on an Eureka Atom W65 which replaced my Fellow Opus - the difference is amazing!

After making the first latte with my new grinder I immediately started researching for a new espresso machine to replace my Bambino Plus, but the marked is vast and I am starting to feel the analysis paralysis once more without haven gotten any closer to which machine I should choose.

My main wishes for a new machine is to have a well built machine (nice looks is a big plus) that is consistent in making back to back lattes and an occasional Espresso or Americano when the in-laws visit.

Minimal noise is also a big consideration as I'm moving to an older apartment and don't want to wake my neighbors when I make a 5 am coffee. I'm not one to experiment with different roasts or flow control - basically I just want it to be easy and quick to use in my daily routine.

Therefore I'm looking for inputs from people with experience with machines that matches my needs.

Thanks in advance!

1h3eefb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h3eefb/i_just_need_to_vent/,I just need to vent ,"TL;DR: is my husband being a toddler or am i just a nag? 

I don't have friends who would understand and I am really annoyed. so I need to vent. 

my husband (31 M) is a late sleeper, and I'm (30 F) an early riser. we have been together for 10 years. this is what it is and always has been. Our dogs also know this so they exclusively bother me on weekend mornings to get up and I always get up right away so my husband can keep sleeping - cause honestly, normally id be up shortly anyways. 

This morning, dogs start to bother me so I get up and my husband immediately gets up as well. very weird. he let's me know he hasn't been able to sleep cause of his runny nose and has been just laying there for a couple of hours...I was like okay, you could've gotten up with them, let me continue sleeping and wake up on my own for a change but whatever. clearly he's not feeling well. 

were on the couch, drinking coffee after getting everyone's breakfast and he's getting pissed off cause of his nose (he's a drama queen, it's not directed at me just general annoyed-ness. and hey I get it, its annoying) so I'm like did you take medicine?? and it's ""yeah i took allergy medicine, didn't work"" so I ask about cold medicine and it's more ""meh, we don't have that. im just accepting it"" (coooool, so you're not doing anything to help yourself but gonna be pissed off about. gottcchhaa) we agree on grabbing cold medicine later when we go out. all good.

nooooww, this man has gone to sleep for 3 hours now, on the couch where I now have to be quiet (we have a very small house, I cannot do anything of significance) we are in the middle of a painting and installing trim project we were supposed to wrap up today and I was planning on at least getting 
measurements and some painting done with. but again I have to be quiet.

When I talk to guys, I immediately ask if they have a wife or kid/s. I just want to make sure I remain respectful to them and that I set boundaries. He assured me he didn't have a wife. He  lived in the UK and he's alone. We got along quite well. He seemed to like me, and I liked him. I'm the kind of person that's quite straightforward. I don't bullshit anyone just to play around. I told him I like him and would like to get to know him better, and he said the same. So for weeks we've been talking daily, sometimes he'll call during breaks when he's at work. He'd be so sweet sometimes, sometimes indifferent. I just thought that's his personality. I'm just starting to know him. He said he's a workaholic, working 2 jobs to pay debts. He doesn't really get rest days. Then he started calling me endearments, I did as well. I've fallen in love with him, he told me to wait for him since he's going back in 2026 for a vacation. He said we'll go on road trips together, he said we'll have coffee together. We've established early on that we're attracted to each other as well. Then yesterday I had this thought to ask my old friends from his hometown if they had any news of him. I just wanted to make sure his single. It was my way of breaking the news to my old friends as well, I was thinking so they wouldn't get surprised when we eventually end up together (so naive). I wanted to make sure that falling for him wasn't a mistake. And lo and behold after they did some research, he's married. They are together in UK for many years. In my defense, I did check  early on but I didn't find anything. It seems he blocked me in his active account. The girls told me give him a benefit of the doubt since there are no latest posts from them, they maybe separated already. I waited for him to chat same night. I asked him to call (I wanted to see his face)  but he said he was busy. So I told him then, ""You have a wife. Why didn't you tell me? I asked you. I had no idea. I didn't want to hurt anyone or myself."" He said sorry, and that  he meant to tell me and but he got attached. He confirmed it. I said my good byes right there and then and blocked him. Looking back I should have seen the signs, maybe that's why I asked my friends to check, I had a subconscious inkling. Looking back I see many opportunities for him to tell me, yet he chose to deceive me. My eyes are wet, and my heart aches. I don't fell well today too as I am sick. I keep asking myself, why he thought it was okay to play me. I had to write this down, it's cathartic.

1h3ed6e,https://i.redd.it/28kn26wyz14e1.jpeg,Paint Experts Please Help :(,"Long story short, after 3 years of trying to choose a paint color, we painted our living room SW Alabaster and it's too bright white. But the interesting thing is that the room we painted it gets low and indirect natural light, so the room itself is pretty dark along with the dark hardwood floors. The room has lots of shadows and gets blue and some green light from outside, only northern exposure with some greenery. Because of this, we know we need a paint color that is higher on the LRV scale with no cool undertones, so we don't feel like we're in an icy cave, but not too high to keep the harshness toned down with the darker elements in the home, but also not too yellow because it mixes with the blue light and gives a green cast on the walls. To add on top of that, any greiges look very grey because of the indirect light and shadows, all of the grey comes out on the walls. 😫😫😫. Anyone have any ideas on what paint colors should we try? Can we try to darken Alabaster by 25-50 percent? Anyone try that before? This has been a struggle! Thanks for reading 

We've tried:
BM White Dove (still too bright)
BM Navajo White (too yellow and pink)
BM Grey Mist (too grey)
SW Aesthetic White (too grey and pink)
SW Swiss Coffee (too bright)
BM Cloud White (too bright)
BM Simply White (way too bright and yellow)

What we want:
An off white paint with warm to neutral undertones
LRV between 75-79
To give a cozy cottage-chic look 

What I was thinking to try:
Dunn Edwards Historic White 
SW Pearly White
SW Seapearl 

Pic above is with the Alabaster on the walls and a sample of BM Navajo White and BM White Dove. I know it can be hard to tell through a camera but what it looks like in the pic is very close to what it looks like irl (Sorry for the crinkled samples, my kid got to them before I could get them on the walls)

1h3easy,https://i.redd.it/oxw9tecgz14e1.jpeg,St. Andrew: The Fisherman Who Led Others to Christ,"Year: B(II). Psalm Week: 2. 

Liturgical Color: Red – symbolizing sacrifice of martyrs and the courage to live for Christ

Today is the feast day of St. Andrew. He was the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the first disciples called by Christ. A fisherman from Bethsaida in Galilee, Andrew’s encounter with Jesus transformed his life. As John’s Gospel recounts, Andrew immediately introduced his brother, Peter, to Christ, saying:

“We have found the Messiah” (John 1:41).

Andrew’s role as a connector—bringing people to Christ—defines his legacy. He answered the call to discipleship and followed Jesus with humility and courage, even to the point of martyrdom. According to tradition, he was crucified on an X-shaped cross, a symbol that remains associated with his martyrdom and steadfast faith.

St. Andrew is widely venerated and is the patron saint of Scotland. According to legend, some of his relics were brought to the site of modern-day St. Andrew’s in Scotland, cementing his connection to the country and its Christian roots.

Why This Matters to Catholic Fathers

St. Andrew shows us what authentic leadership looks like in bringing others to Christ, especially those closest to us. For Catholic fathers, his example reminds us of our responsibility to be spiritual leaders in our homes. Whether introducing a family member to the faith, teaching our children to pray, or leading through personal sacrifice, we are called to guide our families toward holiness.

The St. Andrew Christmas Novena, beginning today, is a perfect opportunity to live out this leadership. This devotion fosters discipline, reflection, and intentionality—qualities essential for Catholic fathers striving to glorify God in their homes. Take this chance to unite your family in prayer and deepen your Advent preparation.

Why Pray the St. Andrew Christmas Novena?

The Feast of St. Andrew also marks the beginning of the St. Andrew Christmas Novena, a powerful devotion that spans from November 30 to Christmas Eve. Unlike traditional nine-day novenas, this prayer is repeated 15 times daily for 25 days. It helps us spiritually prepare for the birth of Christ and offers an opportunity to focus on a specific intention.

This novena teaches perseverance and dedication in prayer, key virtues for Catholic fathers striving to lead their families spiritually.

How to Pray the St. Andrew Christmas Novena

1. Begin with the Sign of the Cross.

2. Pray:

Hail and blessed be the hour and moment in which the Son of God was born of the most pure Virgin Mary, at midnight, in Bethlehem, in piercing cold. In that hour, vouchsafe, I beseech Thee, O my God, to hear my prayer and grant my desires through the merits of Our Savior Jesus Christ, and of His Blessed Mother. Amen.

3. Repeat this prayer 15 times daily from November 30 to Christmas Eve.

Practical Tips for Catholic Fathers:

• Integrate Prayer into Your Routine: Pray the novena during morning coffee, your commute, or family prayer time.

• Involve Your Family: Lead your children or spouse in the prayer, showing them how to keep Christ at the center of Advent.

• Set an Intention: Use this novena to pray for your family’s needs or a loved one’s conversion.

• My Approach:  For me, I’ll be leading my family in this novena during our evening prayers. It’s a chance to get my wife into the rhythm and begin teaching our newborn son that Advent is more than preparing for gifts—it’s about preparing our spirits for Christ.

Let’s Pray

We humbly implore your majesty, O Lord, that, just as the blessed Apostle Andrew was for your Church a preacher and pastor, so he may be for us a constant intercessor before you. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen

I realized I said a lot but I really wanted to explain everything in detail so it makes sense from both perspectives. Thank you everyone for the advice and taking the time to help. It means a lot to me :)

I have a HUGE crush on a girl who I went to elementary school with. We didnt go to school together afterwards but its been about ten years since I haven’t seen her until the first day of September (a month ago). We are both 20, and I really wanted to find her again and talk to her. Back in elementary I did found out where she lived which is literally 2 minutes away from my house. (I had seen her going into her apartment and waved hi) I didnt know if she still lived there all this time but I didnt want to go and see but just to find her insta. I had found her instagram and after a couple months I messaged her. (After having the confidence to dm her) This is one of the important parts to my story. While im messaging her and when I was trying to find her Instagram, i had also found a few other classmates as well, including a girl who I found out on my own that shes friends with my crush. Now I will say I have zero interest in her, and I had never followed her on insta, but since her insta was public for everyone to see and my crush’s insta is private, I would look at her friends story and see if my crush was hanging out with her or just to see her from someone elses story and what kind of person she is. Because that friend would post pics of her and my crush all the time. Idk if that makes sense but all im saying is that I was curious and wanted to investigate. After all I had a crush on her ten years ago so I wanted to know who she was.

So I messaged her and everything went super well. We had really good conversations and I could tell she was really interested in me. We would talk for hours and I really began to like her personality and we got to know each other. I had asked her if we could go for some coffee after speaking with each other for about two weeks and she agreed to it. So I had picked her up in the morning we had a good time at a restaurant. Later that night I asked if she was down to go to the ferris wheel in one city because she mentioned it. She agreed to go and we set the day three days from then. 

The next day. Now it gets bad. My friends and I went to the same restaurant the next day and I messaged her saying im back at the restaurant. She then said oh I found out that my friend ( the one who I had been looking at her stories) grandmas friend owns that restaurant. She had mentioned her friends name to me as if I knew her so I thought it to be weird. But I had said I dont think I know (her name) . She said yes you do! We went to elementary together. About 15 minutes later i saw her friend posted her story and I went and checked it. An hour later my crush sent me screenshots of me viewing her friends story saying “thought you didn’t know her” now I dont know if that was lying or just a misunderstanding, but when I said I dont know her, i mean like, i dont talk to her, or know where she lives lol or anything about her other than the fact that she is friends with my crush and thats it. But she then said “ this early on and theres lies”, and that hurt a lot because now I broke trust. I asked if she can call me to talk about it and she called. At this point, i didnt know what to do. I wanted to clarify and fix it but I was so caught up in my emotions, that I ended up saying dumb things that probably didnt make sense. She told me in the call that she doesnt want to feel like she got to keep her head on a swivel, and I could really tell she lost trust in me. Then she said something that I could never forget. She told me in the call that she learned a lot about me just now. That really cut me. And im really sad to say, I probably sounded angry, and it felt like an argument :’(. Looking back I hate myself for how I acted and handled it, but thats what happened. She said at the end “how about no for the ferris wheel” which was what we planned three days later. We ended the call but five minutes later I called back apologizing. I didnt think I was sincere. But she said im going to take a step back. Later that evening I messaged her saying lets talk about it because I cant let this day go without making it up. And she said i think its best if we not because you were adamant about your stance and thats fine. She also said we dont have to come to an agreement. I responded by saying I have to get your trust back because you have a good reason say I lied. 

The day before the canceled plans for another date, I asked a friend who is much older than me, what to do to gain someones trust back. I ended up telling him everything and he said “if she said she wants to take a step back, that means she isnt interested in you and she never was. He told me she probably had someone else and other bs that I started to believe because i trusted him. But the thing is , he doesnt know her, only I do. But I believed him. Another big mistake. After my conversation with my supposed friend, i called her to ask if we were cool. But again, my emotions and how I was feeling got to me, I couldnt think straight and I ended up just talking bs to her and probably not making sense to her. But I asked if we were cool and she said yes we are cool, and that she had already forgotten about what happened but i didnt think she did. So we ended the call and that was the last time I spoke to her. My supposed friend told me to unfollower her, deleted messages and everything. And to ignore her. What kind of toxic shady advice is that. But I believed in what he said and caved into my insecurities that maybe she did find someone else or she didnt actually like me. All I did was unfollow her. BAD IDEA OFC. A day later, she unfollows me. I was devastated by what ive done. Everything ive done, without even daring to not even in a million years would I ever want to, yet I involuntarily pushed her and scared her away by my actions. The very girl I want to be in a relationship with. My stupidity. I tried calling and of course, no answer, texted her, left on delivered. That was the end of it. I pretty much fxked it all up. Lost her trust, and showed her how much of a fool I am and I cant handle situations. But, although I dont want to make an excuse, in my defence, I was going through a lot at the time. My mom had some health problems and needed surgery, and my friend who passed away, his son who I was close with was in the hospital for cancer and passed away the week my crush and I had the situation happen. So I had a lot going on emotionally and I think that had something to do with how I handled it. But its been a month since we talked, and I want to find a way to get back to how it was. And for her to trust me again. If I could express how I feel and apologize sincerely and say sorry for how I treated her and how I made her feel. if only I can have the chance to, I would absolutely. I thought of a letter, but I need help. Any suggestions, thank you to all who read my long story haha. i needed to express it. But anyway thanks for the advice. :)",2,1732978703.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I’m probably an introvert, because communicating with people is tiring and often I don’t understand their feelings and experiences. I don’t want children, I’m not religious, I try to love myself and I can’t be romantic, although I really want to.

I had asked her if we could go for some coffee after speaking with each other for about two weeks and she agreed to it. So I had picked her up in the morning we had a good time at a restaurant. Later that night I asked if she was down to go to the ferris wheel in one city because she mentioned it. She agreed to go and we set the day three days from then. 

The next day. Now it gets bad. My friends and I went to the same restaurant the next day and I messaged her saying im back at the restaurant. She then said oh I found out that my friend ( the one who I had been looking at her stories) grandmas friend owns that restaurant. She had mentioned her friends name to me as if I knew her so I thought it to be weird. But I had said I dont think I know (her name) . She said yes you do! We went to elementary together. About 15 minutes later i saw her friend posted her story and I went and checked it. An hour later my crush sent me screenshots of me viewing her friends story saying “thought you didn’t know her” now I dont know if that was lying or just a misunderstanding, but when I said I dont know her, i mean like, i dont talk to her, or know where she lives lol or anything about her other than the fact that she is friends with my crush and thats it. But she then said “ this early on and theres lies”, and that hurt a lot because now I broke trust. I asked if she can call me to talk about it and she called. At this point, i didnt know what to do. I wanted to clarify and fix it but I was so caught up in my emotions, that I ended up saying dumb things that probably didnt make sense. She told me in the call that she doesnt want to feel like she got to keep her head on a swivel, and I could really tell she lost trust in me. Then she said something that I could never forget. She told me in the call that she learned a lot about me just now. That really cut me. And im really sad to say, I probably sounded angry, and it felt like an argument :’(. Looking back I hate myself for how I acted and handled it, but thats what happened. She said at the end “how about no for the ferris wheel” which was what we planned three days later. We ended the call but five minutes later I called back apologizing. I didnt think I was sincere. But she said im going to take a step back. Later that evening I messaged her saying lets talk about it because I cant let this day go without making it up. And she said i think its best if we not because you were adamant about your stance and thats fine. She also said we dont have to come to an agreement. I responded by saying I have to get your trust back because you have a good reason say I lied. 

The day before the canceled plans for another date, I asked a friend who is much older than me, what to do to gain someones trust back. I ended up telling him everything and he said “if she said she wants to take a step back, that means she isnt interested in you and she never was. He told me she probably had someone else and other bs that I started to believe because i trusted him. But the thing is , he doesnt know her, only I do. But I believed him. Another big mistake. After my conversation with my supposed friend, i called her to ask if we were cool. But again, my emotions and how I was feeling got to me, I couldnt think straight and I ended up just talking bs to her and probably not making sense to her. But I asked if we were cool and she said yes we are cool, and that she had already forgotten about what happened but i didnt think she did. So we ended the call and that was the last time I spoke to her. My supposed friend told me to unfollower her, deleted messages and everything. And to ignore her. What kind of toxic shady advice is that. But I believed in what he said and caved into my insecurities that maybe she did find someone else or she didnt actually like me. All I did was unfollow her. BAD IDEA OFC. A day later, she unfollows me. I was devastated by what ive done. Everything ive done, without even daring to not even in a million years would I ever want to, yet I involuntarily pushed her and scared her away by my actions. The very girl I want to be in a relationship with. My stupidity. I tried calling and of course, no answer, texted her, left on delivered. That was the end of it. I pretty much fxked it all up. Lost her trust, and showed her how much of a fool I am and I cant handle situations. But, although I dont want to make an excuse, in my defence, I was going through a lot at the time. My mom had some health problems and needed surgery, and my friend who passed away, his son who I was close with was in the hospital for cancer and passed away the week my crush and I had the situation happen. So I had a lot going on emotionally and I think that had something to do with how I handled it. But its been a month since we talked, and I want to find a way to get back to how it was. And for her to trust me again. If I could express how I feel and apologize sincerely and say sorry for how I treated her and how I made her feel. if only I can have the chance to, I would absolutely. I thought of a letter, but I need help. Any suggestions, thank you to all who read my long story haha. i needed to express it. But anyway thanks for the advice. :)",0,1732978587.0,LifeAdvice,2,0.5,False
1h3e8tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h3e8tg/why_does_she_f21_bother_hanging_out_with_me_m25/,Why does she (F21) bother hanging out with me (M25) as a friend?,"Similar to my last post. 
But basically. Half a year ago. Met a girl through tinder, asked to hangout, she explained ""dating might not be for her right now but down to hang as friends"" sure I'm cool with that. Then we just hangout, get lunch, coffee, dinner, once a month. Usually me initiating the hangouts.

I may have grown feelings starting now. But if anything I think I prefer being friends. And not telling her how I feel.

But at the same time, I still don't get why she bothers hanging out with me. We bond over video games, internet culture, music. She talks about how she's constantly busy with errands and plans with her friends and family that live in different cities. She's very extroverted it seems compared to my extremely introverted personality.

I have friends of my own to hang with, I'm not lonely. But I feel bad asking to hangout when she's constantly busy and how she has to move things or check her schedule to see if she has time just for lunch or something.

Maybe I'm overthinking things and have the lowest self confidence, but I'm just genuinely surprised she hasn't ghosted me or just stopped wanting to hangout. Her friend group she talks about sound a lot more interesting than me. And I doubt I'm the only guy she probably hangs with one on one. So why bother hanging out with me? Like in general. I feel like it's one thing if we had mutual friends, but I'm literally a stranger technically?

Maybe I'm just not used to the energy some extroverts have. Also I still don't know if I'm an actual friend or just some guy?

Tl;Dr: met a girl on tinder, she wanted to be friends but my low self confidence doesn't understand why she hangs out with me anyways",1,1732978546.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

The following day, I awake to the rangers asleep in their bunks except for Sgt. Holdsclaw. In the visitor center Will stands beside an antique iron wood stove watching coffee bubble up into the glass stem of a percolator. He asks me if I’d like a cup. I accept of course. I ask if he wouldn’t mind having one more interview. He pauses for a moment before agreeing.

“I’d like to apologize for last night. I didn’t mean to upset you.”

“No apologies necessary. You didn’t know. We all have ghosts that visit us from time to time. I think everyone who survived the war carries some level of darkness. It’s like Black Walnut hulls; stains everything it touches. Everyone in my squad has lost people. Some of them have lost everyone. With no family left, we became each other’s family. I owe them a lot. They kept me alive when all I wanted to do was put a bullet through my own head instead of the monsters we were fighting.”

“Are all Ranger teams like this? As close, I mean.”

“Pretty much. Combat forges a bond that can’t be found anywhere else. We were facing epidemics all over. Suicide being one of them. Some people went to sleep and didn’t wake up. Others decided to take more direct action. And who could blame them? How many people watched parents, siblings, children, or spouses change in front of them. It’s terrible enough to lose a loved one but then they’re faced with them reanimating right in front of them. They have them back with them but in this ravenous perversion of what they used to be. They are then faced with killing this thing they had loved so very much. Their loved ones were ripped away from them, only to be returned to them as a waking nightmare, and again must say goodbye. We found so many people that couldn’t live with their suffering any longer. In time, those sights became almost as common as the zombies. Some people never lost people or weren’t close enough to others to be heavily impacted by their loss. Instead, these people mourned the end of the life they knew. Some were hit with culture shock so hard that they simply shut down. Others couldn’t live without the lifestyles that had grown to become their identity. No fame, no clout, no drama. I guess they thought that if the world was over, then so was theirs.” He takes a deep breath in and out before turning to me. “Now that I’ve thoroughly started this morning off on a low note, what would you like know?” 

“It’s okay. These things need to be heard if we’re going to move forward from what we’ve been through. You bring up an interesting point. How did people change when electricity was only being used for necessities?”

“I don’t think we knew how dependent we had become on technology before the war. I’m a millennial, my generation was born with computers and the internet just becoming a household thing. By the time the war broke out, we had the world at our fingertips. Through the screen of a smartphone, you could read any book, find the question to almost any answer, with an intoxicating level of instant gratification. When that all abruptly disappeared, boredom became unbearable for many. Of course, we adapted. People became workaholics to keep their minds busy or turned to two other avenues: books and board games. Books became as good as currency in many places and were worth their weight in good. I’m not joking, either. A guy paid me five silver bars for a copy of The Two Towers. Games brought us closer together with groups having nightly tabletop roleplaying sessions of Dungeons & Dragons or others coming together to play a game of Pandemic. Crafting became another huge escape for many people. Those who knew, taught those who didn’t. Many of these crafts were direct benefits to our struggle with the undead. For example, we had who took up leather working or chainmaille . In these cases, they made clothing and equipment for the rangers. We went from going out in layers of clothing to boiled leather vambraces , rerebraces , and greaves . Those who took up chainmaille, would make sections of it and others would sew them to the arms and legs of BDUs we found in military surplus stores.”

“Speaking of BDUs, I’ve been curious about something ever since I got here. Did the military issue you brown BDUs? Reason I ask is all the ones I’ve seen are blue.”

“Good question. One of the things produced during the war by Eastman were textile components that went into the bite-proof threads in our BDUs. Don’t ask me what components make them bite-proof. All I know is they work. Anyway, the blue dye they used came from the LC King factory in Bristol that made denim jeans. They would ship the textile components there, where they would be woven, constructed, dyed, and shipped out West. The guys in charge started getting BDUs out to military, militia, and law enforcement around the area. When it came to us, we asked if we could ours dyed with brown duck dye originally used for canvas before the war.”

“Interesting. Did the military notice when you guys met?”

“Of course. Many of them wanted a set. I can’t blame them. Try fighting in dark blue coveralls in the middle of a triple digit heatwave. One reinforced square  collapsed down around Augusta, Georgia because of heat. They had plenty of ammunition but not enough water. Troops on their firing lines started missing their targets and then stopped firing all together as they lost consciousness. When the dead finally reached their lines, many of them were so weak, they couldn’t fight back. Thankfully, this was only an isolated incident.”

“Did any other units get issued these?” 

“As a matter of fact, yes. The military noticed how we weren’t “regulation” as they put it. So they decided to make it regulation for rangers. Soon they started sending out brown uniforms to the rangers in the Ozarks and the Rockies.”

“Speaking of the military, was this when the AMG was created and mobilized?”

“Formally, yes. In reality, we’d been organized for a while prior to this. We consisted of hunters, park rangers, ex-military, backpackers, search and rescue workers, hikers, and a good number of Cherokee from the Reservation just West of Waynesville. Each squad consists of 5 rangers and one K9. Two with shotguns, two with rifles, and the last is a K-Handler armed with a silenced carbine. Each ranger’s specific loadout is different depending on what kind of mission they’re on. Hunting, tracking, patrol, search and rescue, sometimes escort duty for mule trains and porter convoys.

“You had mules and horses?”

“We didn’t have mules. Those were part of a group from over in North Carolina. When some of the roads became impassable due to Winter or roads got washed out, they would load up their pack mules with supplied and hoof it through the mountains, going places wheeled vehicles couldn’t. Same as they did in 2024. The military ended up making good use of them. We used horses occasionally. They were rare and we couldn’t risk them getting killed or injured. In combat, they would sometimes be used by messengers or scouts. When not used in the war, they would mostly be used for agriculture like pulling plows.”

“When the military did finally arrive in force, how were sweeps performed, given the rough terrain?""

“When the military was coming East, we all know they were marching shoulder to shoulder almost all the way. That changed when they hit Appalachia. That’s when Army Groups North and South went for Maine and Florida. For us, we linked up with Army Group Center as they pushed over the mountains. What we ended up having to do is go mountain by mountain, range by range. First, we surrounded the mountain. Second, we would call the dead off the heights. Reason we did this was because, if you tried to immediately push up the mountain and the dead heard you, of course they would come toward you. If you happened to be below a cliff or really steep hill, you could soon find zombies falling on top of you from above. We used this to our advantage. We would call them off the heights and watch as they would tumble down. If you were lucky, they would kill themselves on the way down or when they hit the bottom. Finally, we began our push up the slopes all the way to the peak. Once that was done, we would move on the next mountain.”

“Were reinforced squares used in this type of combat?”

“Not really. The closest we got to that was setting up an AC.”

“What’s that?”

“It stands for Alesian Circumvallation. It’s based on what Caesar used at the Battle of Alecia. You set up a firing line facing inward toward the mountain to deal with the zombies coming down the mountain. You also set up a secondary firing line surrounding the first but facing outwards from the mountain to deal with any zombies that might come from behind us. We had to do this for each mountain. That’s why it was such a slog to try and clear them out. I know Army Group North had to deal with the zombies that were frozen every winter and had to clear them out during the thaw. We had the same problem but not because of winter. Remember when I told you about the mining culture of Appalachia? Not all mines were recorded or had been lost to history. Another thing was the caves and chasms that went miles into the ground. Whether it was the floods washing them down there or the zombies chasing animals, like bears, down into their caves. It’s thought that as they went into the caves and started moaning, the sound would reverberate off the walls and would come back as an echo. They would hear the sound of their own voice and go deeper into the caves. If they formed a chain swarm, they would just follow one another right into the ground. Some would fall down mineshafts or continually walk round in the dark. Occasionally, they would find their way out and go wandering down the hill over ground we thought had already been cleared. Remember when I spoke about the zombies being buried in the silt during the floods? That was another thing. You could hope that they get buried and simply decompose. Unfortunately, that’s not what always happens. Some get buried and over time the river washes the silt away, and a zombie pops out of the riverbank. Speaking of water, that’s not even touching on the potential thousands beneath the water at lakes like Watauga. The waters there are always murky and visibility is next to zero. Each year, zombies walk out of water and zombies tumble out of the surrounding woods splashing into the water. This guy once told me that when he took his houseboat over Old Butler  during the worst droughts, he could look down off the side of his boat and see zombies walking around the town. It is because of these issues that we’re still in service for the foreseeable future. The AMG was meant to be a temporary force. Now, we end up hiking all along the AT from fort to fort that used to be welcome centers like this one or hostels for backpackers from before the war. I’ve been hunting zombies in the Cherokee, Pisgah, and Nantahala National Forests as well as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.”

“So, have you and the rangers been here this whole time?”

“No. We didn’t know about the issues with zombies popping back up behind us until months after. Up until then, we’d been fighting for years, might as well fight to the finish. After all, I’m a Tennessean. We got a reputation to uphold.” He says with a sly grin.

“Where all did you fight?” 

“For me and my squad, we fought East all the way to the Atlantic with Army Group Center before linking up with Army Group South. We ended up learning a lot from one another during that time and got really close to many of them. When we were integrated into the army, we were put with the FAR  teams and K-teams. When we pulled the zombies in and got behind the lines of our RS’s, we would be on the line or in Sandler  teams. We did start something by accident one time. We had just got inside the square and were prepping for them to fire up the speakers when nothing happened. We could see technicians trying to get the speakers fixed. The silence made the stress start rising, putting everyone on edge. Out of nowhere, one of the rangers begins playing that song  from Last of the Mohicans on his bagpipes while another set a rapid marching beat on a snare drum. It got the desired effect. From then on, some rangers brought instruments like banjos and mandolins to play during enticements or just during down time. Some of the music you heard last night was played during those days.”

“I’ve spoken to members of the military who ran across quislings and ferals  when they pushed East. Did you encounter any?”

“We did. We’d heard about both from Radio Free Earth but hadn’t encountered any. In hindsight, they were probably there the whole time and just didn’t know it. We really started seeing them when we linked up with the Army. For quislings, platoons were issued thermal optics since zombies don’t radiate body heat. As for ferals, when we first encountered some, they would usually run away but we would track them to their nests, burrows, or whatever they took shelter in. From there, a team would shoot them with a tranq dart and bring them in. Those were times when I was so glad we had shotguns. The ones that were fully grown could get mad as hell, charge, and beat the shit out of you if they get hold of you. In cases like these, we would shoot them with beanbag rounds, rubber bullets, or rubber shot. If they got really close, we’d shoot them with a pepper blast shell, hit them with a round of rock salt, or spray them down with bear mace.”

“When did you decide that it was time to come home?”

“While sitting on Myrtle Beach looking out over the Atlantic, I had that calling all Appalachians have when they’ve been away from mountains and forests for too long. As John Muir put it, The mountains are calling and I must go. When the government declared victory in the US, many of us came back to rebuild our lives. When we got back and looked out over the mountains, something was there that wasn’t there before. There was a sadness; a great wound on our collective spirit. The mountains looked like their life had diminished. It broke our hearts.”

“Could you explain a little more on that?”

“Appalachia has a rich hunting culture but it also has a rich culture of nature conservation and wildlife management. It didn’t dawn on us until after everything had happened that much of the life that inhabited these mountains was gone. Black bears were almost extinct. Deer were nonexistent. Those animals that were endangered before the war, were wiped out completely. It breaks my heart still to think about how many species are gone now, not just here but everywhere. This sadness caused many Tennesseans to sign up for the UN Multinational Force. I did but was denied cause they said they had too many applicants. Instead, they wanted my continued service in the AMG. I was hesitant at first until they said something I didn’t expect them to say. They said that Appalachia had a lot of healing to do and it needed rangers to help protect her as she protected us. I’m happy to say that the great wound has started to heal. Life has started to return. Last week I saw a flock of wild turkey. A few months back, I spotted a couple of deer on a distant hill. Last spring, we went into a few caves and almost got killed a couple times. Not by zombies. Had a run in with a couple of black bears, a couple of bobcats, and something I was convinced was extinct. A fucking panther .” He pulls down the collar of his shirt to reveal 3 parallel scars across his chest. “We didn’t kill it. The other shotgunner had loaded a boom round. The blast scared it away, left us with our ears ringing, and had another squad of rangers a few hills over booking it to our position. They found me covered in blood but all of us just laughing hysterically. Of course, the adrenaline was pumping but the only way I can explain it is it felt like we’d been jumpstarted. We felt something we had all but forgotten: Joy. I think it was that report that gave all squads an additional assignment; to combat poaching and protect the wildlife so that it can reproduce and heal the ecosystems.”

“What are your plans for the future? Do you intend on staying with the AMG or retiring?”

“I’ll stick with the guard as long as I can. The war is far from over. As the Wacko  said, we all gotta do our part. Appalachia still has a lot more healing to do and needs rangers to protect her. I’m proud to say that there’ll be plenty of rangers to take our place when we call it quits. Squads have already started taking on new recruits to train. There’s also been talk of the UNMF needing experienced mountain troops in places like the Swiss and Italian Alps or whenever they decide it’s time to tackle Iceland.”

As Will and his squad walk through the gates of Fort Waterwheel, for another week of hunting, he shakes my hand, leans in close, and whispers, “Remember. If you think you see something, no you didn’t. If you think you heard something, no you didn’t.” A smile crosses his face, unable to keep a straight face any longer and begins laughing before receiving a swift slap to the back of his head by another ranger.

“Hey, Will. One last question. Why do they call you Tiger?”

He chuckles. “It’s a reference to a distant ancestor who hunted an actual tiger through the mountains of Appalachia when it escaped from a circus.”

“Seriously?”

“Look it up. Johnny Cash even wrote a song about him .” He smiles as he turns to follow his squad into the trees.

Before I get started, I want to address something I know I'm going to hear a lot - this is his choice. He said he wanted to learn to read and he genuinely enjoys math. I literally just had to fend him off and send him to go play instead of diving into a math lesson so I would have time to sit with my coffee to write this out. He's a little nerd like his Mama and Daddy. \^\^;; He plays a TON and we only spend a little bit of time at the table with paperwork. He's crazy active and super social - no worries there! Anyway...

I have a 4-year-old son who can already read a bit (we're in the middle of the second book in the Elemental Phonics series) and is able to add/subtract with manipulatives within 20  and can write all those numbers as well. He can count by 1s and 5s to 100, and knows all his 2D shapes. He also wanted to learn how to use a rular and tape measure so he could build things like Daddy. He completed Preschool Beginner Math (same author as the Phonics series) as well. He's begging for more, so we're going to keep practicing reading and I guess we'll start the IXL Kindergarten level this afternoon so I don't have a riot on my hands. I can only get away with giving him fluff math lessons for so long here...again, totally by his own demands.

Given what he's capable of, I'm considering doing the 4-5 package for Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies, and the 5-7 Math and Reading packages. Does this sound right? This is my first round of homeschooling in any formal way so any advice on placement is very welcome. I want him to be challenged and moving forward, but I don't want to overload him so he grows to dislike doing school stuff.

Every day of my life I get up. I give up before I even have my coffee. I give up being great - I give up because I have never had a clear image of who I want to be.

I have nobody that I want to be. I wish I could be nobody.

In a way, everybody is a nobody; but what does that defeatist idea matter when at the end of the day, every nobody puts their work clothes down, strolls through the streets, and goes home to a dinner table to be somebody?

I have never felt connected to my name. Names are a beautiful thing, in a way - I believe that, in a way, every name fits. Every name is a reflection of the culture at the time of one’s birth, every name is a reflection of the hopes and dreams of the guardian that gave it. Some names are royal. Some names are religious. Some names are unique and new, and some are old-fashioned and reliable.

Some names, like mine, mean nothing at all. 

My name is an extension of my culture, my background, my language and the expectations set aside for me. But I never believed in names just for the sake of naming. Names are like labels. How different would it be if we all just received numbers and a short line of code? If we were just called by our initials, our numbers?

Of course, it would be different. Everybody who has a name attaches their own meaning to it. Royals, religion, individuality, reliability.

My name means nothing at all.

By the time we grow up we come to expect something of our names. We daydream that one day, it will be a brand of its own - that one day we will walk down the street on our way home and see it on iron-supported billboards. Each poster that once clung onto the wooden posts we walk by will be replaced by it. A name. A brand. A trademark.

What is a name worth if it’s nothing but a trademark?

 My name will never be a trademark.

Or maybe it will. Or perhaps it already is a trademark, if somebody else, that has come to own it before I, has decided so.



My name means nothing to me.

Culture, Identity… does such a thing even exist? I have no culture, my culture has eluded me, and in search of my “one true identity” I have lost everything that I already had.



In the end, it should be acceptable that some people don’t want to be people.



The expectations of others, of the people around me, of the somebodies around me, have weighed down my heart whether I will ever admit it or not.

Everybody believes that everybody walking by them is somebody; selfishly ignoring the fact that giving a name to a thing that does not deserve one is cruel in and of itself. Inhuman, in a way. What good ever comes from expectations?

Even just being expected to act like a person suffocates me most days. What good comes from acting like something I am not?

What good comes from pretending to be somebody? I never wanted to be somebody, I never wanted it, I hate it, I wish the mere idea to be dead and gone - but it cannot be helped.

In modern society, every nobody has to be somebody. Every nobody has to pretend that they are somebody to please somebody else. That’s the way things are.

Everybody has goals. Everybody has an idea of what they want to be, everybody knows who they are. Except for nobodies. I cannot fathom how somebody could even have the time to think about what kind of somebody they want to be, for I am nobody.",1,1732978427.0,todaywasaday,0,1.0,False

1h3e4at,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3e4at,Light vs dark bean crema?,"Hi espresso nerds! 

I ran an experiment trying to figure out what's going on with my beans. I just picked up a bag of Kenyan single origin light roast beans roasted on 11/16 and when pulling my shots noticed the crema was different than my other coffees. I've never brewed this bean type before (Kenyan single origin).

To compare my beans/cremas I used my timemore C2 grinder on #8 to grind a high altitude dark roast (roasted likely September ish) for a 17.5g dose with 36g output. Great tiger striping and crema development. Mouth feel was as expected, tastes like not my preference, lol,  but my wife likes it for her milk drinks.

When I grind the light roast, I seem to need to bump the grind size up a tad to 10 or so, as on grind 8 the beans do grind super well but the feed rate it incredibly slow. Like 17 grams takes 10x as long as the dark roast at the same setting. So what normally takes like 2 mins takes well... I've never actually had enough patience in the 300 or so grams I've ground to grind a 17 grams dose at the same #8 setting.... I'm not sure if that's due to the burr set just not enjoying lighter roasted coffee or what. But when I say slow it's like grinding one bean at a time slow. I have an electric grinder but it's not set up for single dosing and it's full of my wife's dark roast beans for her convenience. Shots at the grind 10 setting are fruity, sweet, some acidity which I attribute to being less extracted and lighter roast, as well as being ground by coni burrs. Overall enjoyable. 

Anyway back to my experiment. Pulled a series of shots and included some pics from testing. I did end up grinding both beans at the same setting (grind 8) despite it taking a few swaps of the hands due to tired arms and pulled some shots. The dark roast had great striping and a thick and bold texture, strong flavors, and actually slightly over extracted. The light roast is texturally very different, when pulling the shot, there was little to almost no striping, the crema development is poor, and dissipates quickly. The mouth feel is thin in comparason but the flavor profile is enjoyable overall.

I've had some light roast coffees that have incredible crema and ""quality"" feel. This seems to lack that. Is/could this just be a result of the way the coffee was grown or roasted? It's a natural process light roast, and I have had both washed and natural light roast develop quality crema. So is this a product of an aging machine (it would an excuse to replace our Bambino)?

Or is this just the nature of this particular coffee? Do we have enough data to even say? Maybe I'm just a bad home barista...",3,1732978169.0,espresso,3,0.8,False
1h3e3w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheCloaca/comments/1h3e3w4/aitc_for_a_simple_case_of_mistaken_identity/,AITC for a simple case of mistaken identity?,"Friends, I, Fatty Poen (12, eunuch, suave pinstriped gentlecat and gastronome), have been terribly insulted with the dreaded C word by my very own mommy for a simple case of mistaken identity. She keeps laughing about it, and I have no idea why she has to keep bringing it up. She's being rather rude, if you ask me.

It all started on Wednesday morning. Since it was rather unpleasant and wet outdoors, I decided to forego my morning rodent hunt in the driveway and join my cat brother Misery Meow and my dog brother Thorben for their usual morning cuddle on the big bed while Mommy drinks her coffee. Mommy was so excited about my presence that, after giving me skritches for an appropriate amount of time, she fetched a licky treat for me and Misery to share in bed. Misery might claim that she was worried because he hadn't been eating as much as usual and the treat was for him, but he's mistaken. It was because she was happy that I was there. 

Because Mommy knows I'm a genteel and polite gentlecat, she gave Misery his half first, which he ate with some enthusiasm. When my turn came, I allowed myself to become lost in the moment and let the deliciousness wash over me. But since Misery Meow is a puny little thing, Mommy was dispensing the heavenly nectar at a small-cat rate, which wouldn't do. To hasten matters along, I bit the tube - but subtly so as not to offend. 

Mommy seemed most put out and said, 'Fat Fat, you can't eat the packaging! Let's try something else.' I mean, I wasn't trying to eat the packaging - I'm not an idiot. Since I'm a cosmopolitan cat, I was willing to try anything to reimmerse myself in the moment, so I held my tongue. Mommy's wonderful plan was to squeeze the licky treat out on her finger, thus depriving me of the ability to set the pace at which the liquid manna was being dispensed. (Since I am very much a gentlecat, I won't comment on this strategy.)

I decided to let Mommy have her moment, closed my eyes, and dove back into the deliciousness. I wasn't entirely happy about having to wait between squeezes, but since I still don't have thumbs, I didn't have much say in the matter. After the second squeeze, I was again lost in the wonder of the moment. When the third squeeze arrived, I was so lost in the moment that I forgot that the licky treat required licking and involved Mommy's finger, so I cronched down hard on my snack. 

Well, I can't bear to repeat the words that came out of Mommy's mouth. A lesser cat would have been put off their snack at their mommy suddenly channeling Samuel L. Jackson. I, obviously, was unperturbed and waited for the next squeeze. When it wasn't immediately forthcoming, I gently patted Mommy's hand (and definitely did not deploy my murder mittens, whatever she might say) to enquire about the holdup. She grudgingly squeezed out the last drops, but she was awfully rude about it. She said things about me chewing on her with my back teeth and then trying to rip the skin off her hands with my giant claws and not breaking the skin only by some miracle. 

I was roundly denounced as a cloaca for this moment of mistaken identity. Is it my fault that I forgot that Mommy's finger wasn't made of licky treat? I have received my licky treats in my dinner service since. Every time Mommy dispenses the deliciousness, she calls me a furry little cloaca and laughs at me. This is terribly rude. She's the cloaca for being slow on the delivery, isn't she?

1h3drys,https://www.reddit.com/r/financestudents/comments/1h3drys/advice_from_a_finance_major_who_had_every_odd/,Advice From a Finance Major Who Had Every Odd Against Him,"To start, I (26M) almost didn't get into the industry because I thought you had to be prestigious and go to a top 10 Finance School. The truth is, that is the case early on, but if youre willing to work hard your economic status, or small college can get you not only the same positions as the Ivy League first years, but making more money than them at the same time. I am proof of that. I didnt get the crazy internships, or an internship at all in undergrad. I have no designations or certifications. However I do have something valuable and thats a loaded resume with evidence of hardwork. My whole floor was Ivy league grads, and when everyone would wear their Ivy League polos, Id wear my small, 5K student hometown college shirt proudly because I did what they did with 1% of the resources at my disposal.Dont Get me wrong, it did take a lot of extra work to catch up to those who were fortunate to attend an Ivy League School (I worked 2 years full time at a Big Bank through Junior and Senior Year with a full course load), but it ended up paying off after about year 3.



TL;DR: Finance opens a lot of lucrative opportunities, but if you want to make stupid money off the rip, major in Computer Science and minor in Finance and youll be making $110-$130 within 1-2 years and $250K to the moon after 5-7 years if you pursue IB or Trading positions(I have had 2 managers in their 40's-early 50's with sub 20years experience making a base salary of $1M a year and the older one was making $2M a year working about 10 hours a week). Or worst case youll be in data analytics making low $100's salary or $75-85/HR with 1.5x overtime (No benefits though) working around 35 hours a week if you get into banking. If you get a 4 year degree in finance from anywhere and know basic excel (Pivot tables, lookups, if statements) youll have a 100% chance to land a low end banking job making 75K a year minimum, and will be able to go else where within a year making at or close to $100K ($150K in NY and California).







It depends if you know how to use the current state of finance, and especially banks to your advantage. It is a hard degree, and you will want to quit towards the end because it makes the profession seem like hell. I majored in it not knowing what finance was, and almost quit UNTIL I landed a job in finance and loved it my junior year in college. It was not prestigious, and I was a glorified intern except I was full time. My duties were to get coffee and file papers every day and I did it the best I could. 



THE GOOD OF FINANCE

Here are the Pros Ive learned after 6 years of working in it at all levels (Mainly in Back Office Data and Middle Office Product Groups/ Did a stint in Front Office Trading):

=You will make 2x salary than your friends in other fields of business and most other non business majors by year 2/3. I started out making $34K a year and in 2 years I was making $97K. flash forward 6 years from when I started my college full time job and I am making $140K a year doing something I am good at now. My friends are presidents of their non finance or banking companies and they make around $75K on average. I was making 6 Figs as an entry level Finance Analyst.

  
=No exactly same position (Literally same company, title, pay, duties, but in different departments of Finance) are the same in any department or company. I have been a Sr Analyst for a few years now and the last bank I was at, I was working with our technology team to trouble shoot programming by telling them how the products I was responsible for reporting worked. I dont know how to program but I knew Equities and how they work. All my work went to the CFO of a top 5 bank directly. It was very tough and required me to really spend my free time learning excel in ways I could never imagine. Before that I was basically working in IT analyzing data to look for errors and handing it off to the official ""Finance Team"" even though I had the same title. It was the same title as the prior job  but half the hours and better pay with the same company, just a different department.

=Job hopping is not only the key in the beginning, but is expected. Banks pay the best, but theyre hard to get into. The cheat code to not only work for one (once you work for 1 major one you can easily work at any other bank), but to make more money than not only your friends and former coworkers is to job hop contracts. My coworkers have been working as long as I have but for my current team for 5-6 years exclusively, and they make $105K which is good for mid 20's and are 2 titles above me. However, even though I started out making way less on a short contract, I used that to leverage relevant experience on another contract and negotiated higher pay (Like $10/hr more each time). Next thing you know I am making a$64K pay raise after 3 short contracts at a top tier bank. And the best part- an interviewer wont question it as job hopping if you tell them off the rip that you have been working short term contracts. Short term contracts range from 3months- 9months..... Let them assume it was the former. So remember, if you do decide to go the contract route, youll be making $35-50K starting compared to people who start and stay at the same team youll be on in 5 years making $80K off the rip. However I promise that by the time you and your one company colleagues hit year 5 youll be making almost double what they make. Banks dont like to give raises. They shift you to another team or department and thats how you get a small pay raise 999% of the time. Finance can be brutal or wonderful so def hop around different Banks and positions to see what you are good at. 

=Banks are hiring contractors at a historical rate and are freezing fulltime positions because they dont want to lose money in benefits if the market finally corrects and they need to layoff large numbers of employees. This is good because you typically make $30-$40K more than the fulltime employees if you are on contract and can leverage that which is my next point. You also can usually get out of a contract with no strongs attached if you absolutely hate what they have you doing, or get offered a better position.

  
=Infinite leverage is a reality for you. The bad part about the contracting to get your pay rate up is there is a point where you cant go in terms of higher title than you had before with contracting. That is the situation I am in. The higher up you go the less positions are open. Typically after a Sr Analyst, or MAYBE a Finance Manager, you cannot find a contract, so youre stuck trying to find the same position and make the same money which usually isnt the case. Once you hit senior level, try and go fulltime because then you can keep moving up, just a lot slower. However by Then youll need benefits so it pays off. Also, again, youll be negotiating your prior pay for a few companies as a contractor which means if you ask for $130K for a position that your coworkers are making $90K (and they have been on your current team for the same amount of time you have been contract hopping AND they are usually 1 to 2 titles above you), youll probably get close to that number which means a bigger bonus as well/ you started out making more money than the guys who have never left that position which means when you get their title in 3-5 years like they did, youll be making about 40K more.

  
CONS of Finance

  
=Hard Degree. It is hard but worth it when you get that first $3-$5K check 2x a month (or if you contract youll be getting about $1200-1400 a week) compared to your friends making $3000 a month for the first year out of college. (If you are in NY specifically, raise all the figures Ive used by 75%). An example of pay disparity is a first year Front Office Trading analyst in Charlotte or Texas will make $110K right out of college at a minimum. A NY or California first year at the same company and same position will make $130K typically. The dispartity lessnes the lower prestige the position is, so a call center associate in Texas or NC will probably make about $25/hr starting whereas the same position with the same company in NY or California will make $35/hr (Nothing wrong with that position. It just pays typically the lowest industry wide because everyone does it to get a foot in the door). 

=No 2 same positions are the same. When I was working in Equities as a Finance analyst it was hell on earth and 60 hour weeks. When I left that to go to my current bank, I got a big title raise and have worked an average of 36hr/s a week this year. It is literally the complete opposite of the lower title I was in before. Again, explore different companies and teams because Id say 60% of jobs in finance are 2 of the following: either long hours, bad pay compared to other places, or a tough position with very hard work. Ive never had all three but I have had 2 at the same time (Bad Pay and a Challenging Position). Find a job that only has 1 of the 3 big issues with finance. But by all means try to avoid the bad pay as a contractor. The whole point of contracting your first year is to get your foot in the door. Year 2 you 100% should leave and land a higher paying job sooner than later or you will most likely leave the industry as a lot of Finance Majors do. This is due to the crappy pay your first year or the high stress entry level positions typically experience. Everyone in the industry has had to ""Pay their Dues"" except for the Ivy League 4.0 GPA , daddy's money kids. Banking is the cream of the crop for This degree, and it can either take your soul and replace it with money (Would not recommend), or it can give you more money than you know what to do with for half the hours of people outside of banking (Also remote work is standard at a minimum of 2 days a week for every banking position that isnt client facing (That's Investment Bankers and Traders who make around $500K a year after 2-3 years in that position but work up to 100hr weeks in a lot of cases). 

  
=You will spend more money and not realize it which may come off as ungrateful. Take whatever you need to get by when you first get into the industry, and use it to get by. When you start to make more money than you know what to do with, save everything you dont need to live on for 1 year. I promise youll have a hard time saving money early on because youll feel like youre rich most likely. Hell, I thought making $34K a year made me rich and didnt save a dime until I realized I was going to propose the next year, and managed to save about half of what I took home which has befitted me today because I invested it all. An example of this is when I first starting working in my entry level low paying job in the industry, I managed to invest about $1600 over the near 2 years I had the position. That money is now work a large chunk of my retirement, and I am grateful because it gave me a safety net if my savings ran out after I got laid off from COVID.

  
I hope this helps your decision making. Whatever you do, do not major in entrepreneurship, marketing, or business administration. Marketing is all the people that quit finance or people with unrelated degrees. In fact, dont minor in them either. You can make a lot more money with a minor in Computer Science or engineering in this industry than another business credential. Entrepreneurship wont get you a job , and makes you go into even more debt to start your business after you graduate. If the being a business owner doesnt work out, you will have a terrible time getting into high paying jobs (Like finance and Accounting). Business admin wont get you to being a manager any quicker. Every manager ive ever had was really good at finance and accounting and either got a designation (CFA which is nuts), FINRA Licensed (Series 7 and 63), or got an MBA and went to a different company and started out as a manager immediately. If you want to be able to work in marketing, become a manager like business admin teaches you how to do, or start a business, then Finance is the key, because it directly transfers to those type of positions. Also econ degrees are eh as well. It teaches you market theory, but it doesnt teach you the skills to profit off the market currently. Those jobs are more so taken by people with either top tier Finance degrees at the bare minimum but usually people with a math degree or STEM degrees (Physics, Engineering, Computer Programming)because the industry wants people that are nuts at math that they can teach finance concepts to vs having someone who knows finance and trying to teach them Calculus and or Computer programming.



Best of luck. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. I am so grateful I chose finance.

**Anton Rayne: Having won re-election together with Petr Vectern on a platform of continuity, our president faces a though battle with a divided assembly.**

https://preview.redd.it/8kgqmvy8h14e1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c899f47d7e8e8c4399f982b57914c30a621318

As he excuses himself through the crowded entrance of Zuco's, a small Bergian restaurant near the Maroon Palace popular with working men for its cheapness, I cannot help but think of how unlikely a figure Anton Rayne cuts as the most powerful man in Sordland. The Deyr-born Anton, only child of a farmer couple who spent his childhood among wheat fields, has comfortably won re-election after overseeing the country's return to prosperity during his first term. This helps explain the man's sky-high approval ratings, rivaling Soll's at his peak, but does not do so entirely. Gazing at the constant stream of shoulder taps and friendly call-outs he receives, I can witness first-hand his characteristic cheeriness and humility that voters find so appealing.

His job this time around feels much easier though. At the start of his term, Sordland's problems were many: economic recession, crumbling infrastructure, an overburdened welfare system, distrust in the government, organized crime, Rumburgian encroachment, political assassinations, to name a few. He had probably assumed the toughest job on Merkopa, but felt undeterred at the time. Rayne, in his wrinkled dark suit, flashes a big smile when I laid this out to him. ""I didn't do it alone."" He remarks, as a waiter leaves two cups of kebij on the table. ""I was fortunate to count with a team of passionate and skilled people.""

His cabinet had been an odd selection, containing all political shades within the USP. After the collapse of the Ewald administration, Rayne was the only senior figure within the party that had positive polling and his centrist views made it easier for the whole party to rally around. For the USP leadership, it was clear that Rayne was their only shot at retaining control and they were proved right. ""While most of my colleagues spent their time debating ideologies and pointing fingers at each other, I took to the streets, I talked to my constituents. There was anger, craving for change. And they were right."" He won on platform of Sollist unity, the halting of privatizations, democratic reform of all government brances, anti-corruption and bottom-up economic intervention.

***""We will not be dismantling the ACP during my second term and will continue to root out the rot wherever it is."" Even within the USP? I asked. ""Wherever it is.""***

""Change was in the air... We had to be ambitious."" His ambitious platform was fully implemented, with the constitutional reform being his mandate's main achievement. A lowered 8% threshold, removal of the Supreme Court's influence in further constitutional amendments, term limits, removal of the Justices' immunity and presidential absolute veto were the main changes. Reforms thought unthinkable mere years ago. ""I thank my brothers and sisters in the Supreme Court. Nia and Mrs. Edwards were crucial, and I thank Mr. Garaci for his flexibility and his help with Hawker's impeachment."" The latter was followed by the appointment of Ovid Greecer and his appointment as Chief Justice. The reforms were well received within the public, restoring public faith in Sordish institutions and most legal scholars agree that they established a much improved separation of powers.

The government also oversaw a big allocation of resources to the Justice Ministry, reforming the judicial process and enacting an extensive anti-corruption campaign with the formation of the Anti-Corruption Police. ""But we couldn't stop there."" Rayne added. ""I couldn't exit my office without some oligarch accosting me for some favor."" He was, of course, referencing the ACP's arrests of Walter Tusk, major shareholder of Bergia Steel, and Marcel Koronti, owner and CEO of HOS. These were accompanied by hundreds of other organised crime-linked arrests and thousands of firearm aprehensions. The notorious ""Skinner"" and ""Koranelli"" gangs were, for the most part, dismantled, but Rayne is still not satisfied. ""But I know the rot goes deeper. We will not be dismantling the ACP during my second term and will continue to root out the rot wherever it is."" Even within the USP? I asked. ""Wherever it is.""

**Menu:**

* Kebij cup x2 SR8
* Zabla SR9
* Sordish stew SR7.5
* Espresso x2 SR6
* Rivian red wine cup x2 - on the house

It was then that the plates arrived. Zabla for Anton, one of his favorites, while I ordered the ""dish of the day"": Sordish stew. Zuco himself carried the plates, bringing also an opened bottle of Rivian red (the most expensive wine the humble restaurant had) offering us a cup each on the house. After a heated back and forth between Rayne and our patron, who talked with the president on first-name terms, it was agreed that we would not pay for the cups but Rayne would be leaving a generous tip. ""This man is more stubborn than my old mule."" He complained. No stranger to poverty, Rayne takes pride in his humble background prior to becoming a foreign policy assistant within the USP.

""Free Rizian red! Can you believe it?"" The wine is quite expensive, even after the lifting of tariffs under the previous administration. This approachment to Rizia continued under Rayne with millions of Rizian guilders pouring into Gasom in exchange for a minority stake in the company. This, together other smaller foreign investments after the amendment of the EPA threshold to 49%, and even government money, translated into several new gas fields and expansion projects of current ones. The massive inflow of gas into the economy brought much needed price stability to a market long marred by inflation. This is not without critics however, as many worry about Rumburg's new minority stake in the vital Sordish company. ""Do I like partnering with Rumburg state-owned companies? I don't."" Rayne admitted. ""But we have prospered from it and the queen can't do anything while the EPA stays enacted. We have the upper hand.""

Prosperity certainly describes it. Not only did the economic recession halt, GDP has grown on an average, annualized basis by c. 16% throughout Rayne's 4 years. By the end of his term, unemployment sat at 5% and inflation at 2%, the latter tackled by the Gasom investments and a torrent of foreign currency from the nascent tourism industry. The massive H3 highway and Benfi International Airport projects brought the country to the forefront of international infrastructure ratings and attracted massive foreign investments from Agnolia and Lespia after extensive trade deals were signed. These, coupled with the Assembly's Tourism and Cultural Preservation Act and the administration's intensive regional investments in Agnland, brought the Sordland's poorest region, long seen as the country's backwater, up to par with the revitalized Gruni region.

***""Some of my colleagues pushed for the banning of the Red Youth and Young Sords. I don't agree with their ideologies, but they have a right to speak and I, as president, have a duty to listen.""***

This remarkable feet is being called the ""Great Sordish Recovery"". ""I'm the first to admit this isn't my doing."" Rayne retorted. ""I merely signed under my brother Symon's plans."" He said, referring to the minister of economy. ""But I did emphasize the projects should be done focused on the less privileged."" At the height of the recession, his administration distributed sizeable stimulus checks and passsed the Workers' Rights Act, establishing the current SR2.5/hour minimum wage and greatly increasing worker rights and protections while increasing sales taxes on alcohol, tobacco and luxury goods, leaving Rayne to be branded a communist by some in the opposition. Rayne chuckled. ""Ignoring the fact that they don't know what communism is, to me this is just neighborliness. Where I come from, you help out your neighbors in need because you don't know when you'll be next.""

These bills helped to calm tensions after the assassination of Bernard Circas, member of assembly and notorious Sordish communist. ""I did not agree with him, but I know he meant well."" Rayne's happy demeanour turned. ""A civil war was looming ahead again... I knew I had to do what I could to defuse the situation. So I did what worked for me in the past and took to the streets. It was important for people to see they were being listened to."" To this day, Rayne is largely credited for the early end to the disorder felt shortly after taking office.  ""Some of my colleagues pushed for the banning of the Red Youth and Young Sords. I don't agree with their ideologies, but they have a right to speak and I, as president, had a duty to listen.""

And Rayne listened to the Sordish League of Women by signing a decree granting equal education rights in what was seen as a huge step for women's rights in Sordland, long seen as a laggard by the international community. However, to everyone's surprise he then went on to veto the Women's Liberation Act, a bill pushed by the Women's Rights Comission the he himself had formed. ""Those days were hectic... I barely had any input into that bill and Nia and my wife threw my name around alot with the MoAs. Still, I was incredibly impressed by how they managed to get that assembly to pass such a radical bill..."" Rayne gathered his thoughts for a moment. ""The bill had very important measures, but they were asking too much, too quickly."" Did this not cause strife within your marriage? I asked. Rayne sighed yet again. ""The presidency is in some ways the most gratifying thing I've ever done and the most difficult."" 

***""We have received them with open arms. We only ask them to respect our culture.""***

Still, many voices within the USP and NFP have been critic on Rayne's decision to maintain Ewald's relaxed immigration policy. Because of Wehlen's internationally condemned Operation Bear Trap, hundreds of thousands of Bludish refugees have sought asylum within Sordland, worsening the Bludish homeless epidemic in Bergia and stoking ethnic tensions all across the country. This polls badly with the public and Rayne increasingly stands as an outlier in the party by sticking to it. ""I served in the Gumren outpost during the Wehzek civil war. I saw the horrors of war and ethnic cleansing back then with my own eyes. I can only appeal to my constituents to not look away from the atrocities being commited by Wiktor's regime and open their hearts to our Bludish brothers and sisters."" 

Rayne's stance has arguably saved hundreds of thousands of lives, but his support among Bludish voters is near non-existent still with most respondents citing concerns regarding the Unified Education Language Act bill that mandated all teaching to be done in Sordish. ""There are exceptions. Our ministry has granted some to schools in Bludish majority areas."" I pointed out those were scarce and many Bludish refugees in Sordish majority areas struggle greatly in their education. ""We have received them with open arms. We only ask them to respect our culture.""

The tone of our conversation had shifted, having spoken at length on such contentious topics, so I thought I would lighten the mood by talking about the Heljiland diplomatic crisis. Under Rayne, Sordland took the bold step to recognize Agnolian ownership of the long disputed island, deviating from most of the international community. ""What Sordland recognizes, is that Heljiland is held by Agnolia and that won't change without bloodshed. We believe there is a diplomatic solution here and ask Hegel to see reason."" Still, Rayne granted ATO with miitary access to the Erlory air base and received extensive Arcasian military industrial investments under his tenure which had done little to calm the tensions with Valgsland. Rayne stood resolute. ""And we will grow closer to them still if Valgsland keeps harassing our ship lanes and Agnolian territorial waters, or if Rumburg tries anything silly again."" Rayne is, of course, mentioning Rumburg's OMEC explusion after their bellicose encroachment on Sordland and Wehlen. ""I don't like that, but what choice do we have?"" Rayne sighed. ""Look, I don't agree with Malenyev, but I respect what he stands for. If he doesn't want further Arcasian encroachment in Merkopa I advise him to rein in Hegel, though knowing the man I know that is a tough request. As for the queen, she's got her own problems to deal with now."" Rumburg is facing a historic economic downturn as a consequence of the extensive Arcasian and Contanan sanctions after their nuclear program was revealed to the world by Rayne.

We were drinking our espressos by now and I wanted to talk with Rayne about his post-election outlook. The economic recovery coupled with increased tax revenue from the sales tax increases and Gasom dividends has left the new administration with another big war chest, but the Assembly has never been so divided on how to use it. The USP lost their absolute majority because, while they maintained roughly the same number of votes after losing some of their conservative voter base to NFP but gaining ground against the PFJP, the decrease in the electoral threshold saw the addition of the WPB to the Assembly's ranks. The minority government will require compromise with the other parties and Rayne has already ruled out working with the NFP.

While a three-way coalition is possible, the USP only requires collaboration from one of his rivals. Both disagree with the USP on their plans to expand military investment and double Sordland's naval capacity and both demand further constitutional reform which Rayne and the USP conservatives stated was out of the question. The PFJP would rather enact tax rebates for small and medium enterprises and finish the L-1 high speed railway that Ewald had promised while the WPB wants a program of social housing to counter the Bludish homeless crisis. Both want the creation of a minority rights comission. But Rayne remains optimistic, flashing his trademark grin. ""You mention what separates us, but there is much common ground. We all want to relieve our overburnded welfare system and reform our education. We all want to expand women's right. I know we can find a solution."" Collaboration will also be necessary for the upcoming confidence vote on the new ministerial appointments: Karl Greiser, Greater Holsord police chief and leader of the ACP, to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Lucian Galade, influential USP politician and Rayne's strategy advisor and confidant, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

But there is another thorn in Rayne's path. Fueled by personal divergences and a ""breakdown of trust"" between Albin Clavin and Rayne, the USP reformist wing has constantly been obstructing Rayne's administration for the last leg of his previous mandate. Albin has stated that without further constitutional amendments he would not help Rayne, further complicating the Assembly's tough mathematics. The president could not help but rub his forehead to fight his growing headache. ""I respect the man's ambition. Unfortunately he uses it to further himself rather than his constituents."" He downed his coffee. ""What he needs to do is let bygones be bygones and look forward.""",7,1732976668.0,suzerain,1,1.0,False

Need advice on how to navigate through it!!,"I (28F) have matched with a guy (31M) on Bumble a few weeks ago and have been getting along great so far. We chatted online for 2 weeks since I was out of town for a work trip and noticed that he placed his Bumble in snooze mode as soon as we planned a date.



Our first date just ended a few hours ago. He paid for lunch and I offered to pay for coffee & dessert! We had a pretty good time. The conversation went well, and there were no awkward silences despite us both being introverts.  We had similar interests and our values matched. We went for a short walk before going on our separate ways since we had our own errands to run.

  
He messaged me as soon as we went on our separate ways and I told him that we should get together again soon before we leave for our Christmas trips (I guess I was giving a hint for a second date? 😅). I went back to Bumble to check on his profile because I wanted to see what he was looking for. That was the time that I noticed that he's off snooze mode and I guess active again since his location and proximity is already showing (which was 1 KM from me haha).



Now I'm left confused if I did something wrong or if I just wasn't good enough and they're right off the bat trying to look for someone else or that's just how online dating works. 😂 Kinda feeling bad, but kinda don't want to care that much. But just can't help it!

Everyone in this post is over 18 btw
The past few weeks have been overwhelming. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about two months, but things haven’t been going well recently. I’ve been emotionally distant when I’m not around her, mainly due to my mental health struggles and fear of being loved. Unfortunately, this has put her through a lot. She’s amazing, but I’ve felt unworthy of her, pushing her away as I’ve done with others before.

Fast forward to this week: we’ve been talking, and we’re both miserable. I’m struggling to accept love, and she’s trying so hard only to feel unreciprocated. She told me she’s already begun grieving the relationship and doesn’t want to continue down that path—this feels like her last attempt to save us.

One incident that hurt her was when I showed her a picture of another girl. I’d originally sent it to a lesbian friend, thinking my girlfriend would find it amusing too, but she felt like I was comparing her to the girl. I apologized, explaining it wasn’t my intention and promised never to do it again.

The next day at university, I had a breakdown, crying alone in a bathroom. I was convinced the relationship was nearing its end. Later, she seemed more open to talking, so we went out for food with one of her friends. Eventually, two more friends joined us, and we talked for a while.

During this time, I began writing a letter explaining why I had been distant. While she was in class, I continued writing, trying to listen to her presentation. Afterward, she was upset, saying I hadn’t paid attention. I tried to explain, but she wouldn’t believe me.

Later, she invited me to her aunt’s house for coffee. Her friend and I joined her on the bus, where she hugged my arm, and I felt happy. I met her aunt and cousins, who are important to her, and we spent some time together. As it got late, she insisted I not take public transport home, saying her dad could pick me up. Eventually, though, I took the bus, listening to a playlist she made for me. It was full of love songs, and I broke down crying, feeling unworthy of her love.

That night, I told her I had cried to her songs, and when she asked why, I admitted I wasn’t used to being loved. She responded in a way that made me feel like she didn’t love me anymore. I said it was okay if that were true and mentioned the letter. She assumed it was about me not loving her anymore and went on a rant about how she felt like she was doing everything in the relationship.

I clarified that the letter wasn’t asking for another chance but explaining my feelings. I sent it, despite not finishing it, because I felt she deserved to know. In it, I shared my fears of being loved, how I felt unworthy of her, and my struggle not to push people away. I told her I would respect whatever decision she made.

She said she needed time to think. The next event was her birthday. On the last day of university, we all went to her house for a party. It felt great—she was opening up, dancing, and enjoying herself. One of her ex-best friends, who has a slight obsession with her, showed up. They had been on bad terms because of his past behavior, but I felt jealous because he seemed to connect with her so well.

I knew she wouldn’t cheat on me, but I worried that someone like him could replace me someday. He danced better, knew her interests, and spent much of the day close to her. Still, she returned to me, and we cuddled at times. As the night went on, only four of us remained, and one person was asleep. I was tired and couldn’t dance much because I’d hurt my feet. Seeing her and her ex-best friend bond made me feel like an outsider.

Around 4 a.m., we started sharing personal traumas. I broke down again, talking about my struggles with emotional numbness, anger, and fear of hurting others. Eventually, I had to leave as my dad came to pick me up. Before leaving, my girlfriend said she was never truly happy in life. I hugged everyone, including her, and left feeling conflicted.

Later, I texted her at 6 a.m.:
""Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for dancing with me last night and trying to teach me. It made me really happy to share a bit of your passion with you.""

P.S. I also tried to get along with her ex-best friend and even danced with him a bit. I also danced with her mom as she too tried to teach me.",1,1732976573.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1h3dh1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1h3dh1k/is_my_mother_a_narcissist/,Is my mother a narcissist?,"WARNING: LONG READ BUT STILL INTERESTING BECAUSE I'M SURE MANY CAN RELATE TO IT!

I have come to think that my mother might be narcissist and I have noticed several patterns on her behavior that actually would describe her perfectly as a narcissist.

\-She cannot handle any criticism, is unable to feel sorry and apologize about anything she did, she thinks she's ALWAYS right  and always uses the ""I do everything in this house"" excuse as a scapegoat to justify her nasty actions:  She always act like she's a ""selfless martyr that can do no wrong""yet ignores the fact that she was the responsible for forcing me to take unneeded medications which ruined my life and the fact that she neglected me during my childhood.  I told her about my abusive older sisters who would always criticize me and shut me down, making me feel useless and worthless(in short telling me that nor I, my opinions or whatever I did matter, that everything I did was worthless, useless and meaningless) and my mother resorts to blame this on me ""being introverted"" and not telling her about it, excuses herself for ""doing everything in the house"", yet I remember many times she was witnessing these facts and never did anything about it.

(As a matter of fact, I was NEVER ""introverted"", as a little child I was a very social girl who had no problems  in making friends until I closed my heart  to them because I actually believed what my sisters said about me, this happened when I was about 10 years old after being bullied to death by my sisters).

\-She always does everything in the house but REFUSES to be helped, for example if I make her a tea, coffee, sandwich, etc, give her a chocolate, candy or buy her a gift, She would ALWAYS reject them by saying something like ""I don't want it, thank you very much"" ""I'm not hungry right now, thank you"" or even worse ""Why do you waste money on this? how much did that gift cost you? do you realize that there are cheaper stuff than that? Stop wasting money on useless junk"" and also whenever I try to help her, like telling her that I can help her to dispose of useless garbage flooding our house(or that I could hire someone to do that for us) she'd always get defensive and would always say something like ""None of your business, I'll do everything by myself""

I also wrote a long letter to her, literally  staining my hands in ink and it just took a small insignificant ""fight"" over a stupid argument and she resorted to tell me ""Wow, everything you say is fake, you're fake. You just have the ability to write beautiful words with ease"". That statement gravely hurt me because all I did was calling her ""indifferent and cold"" because she was not replying to me when I was talking about a device that might help me to cure my illnesses and just after she called me  ""fake"" I  replied to her ""Listen, I love you and I want to end this discussion"" , what did she do? She used a scornful laugh, that really pissed me off so logically I could not stand by and be quiet about it.

\-She thinks that sending me to low-class private schools(which were mainly FULL of delinquents and violent outcasts) and useless, cheap, and ignorant psychologists and psychologists was somehow ""doing everything for me"" yet she refuses to acknowledge the fact that she literally completely disregarded a RAPE ATTEMPT on me(BUUT she thinks she did everything for me just because she talked about it  to the principals and teacher ""in a peaceful and non-violent way"" yet the disgusting POS who tried to rape me was allowed back into the school, which I gladly left).  She still refuses to acknowledge  the cause of my supposed ""introversion"" and why I ended up closing my heart to people during my late childhood/preteen/early teen years.

\-She ALWAYS use the ""Mother knows best, Mother must always be respected no matter what, learn your place and HIERARCHY"" method to, somehow, make me feel ""guilty"" for disrespecting ""my almighty goddess mother"", yet she never thinks that her words and actions have their consequences. She also uses the ""Actions speak louder than words"" technique to say that her who ""cooks, pays, had me under her roof and does everything for me"" is somehow an excuse for her insulting, nasty and scornful attitude. And also IT'S NOT TRUE THAT SHE PAYS EVERYTHING FOR ME that might have been true when I was a child but from my teenhood to this day: I have ALWAYS paid for my stuff, even asking for loans to pay them. Sometimes she might have helped me but even so, i always paid the biggest % of what I bought.

\-Ever since I was a child, she'd always tell me TOXIC crap like ""never trust no one outside of your family""  ""friends do not exist""  ""friends will always betray you, mark my words on it, what kind of loyalty do you expect from people who are not related to you in anyway"" . Even to this day. I recently told her that I was planning to leave this crappy family and she immediately told me ""Well, be careful though, or you might end up coming crying to your family"".

What kind of ""family"" is this? A family that has shown nothing but scorn, humiliation, neglection towards me? is that what you would call ""family""??? If so I would have NEVER wanted to be a part of such ""family"" to begin with.

TL;DR: My mother always wants to play this ""selfless martyr"" character, refuses to be helped, cannot handle criticism and justifies her nasty actions on her ""doing everything in the house""  and ""actions speak louder than words"" never feels sorry about anything, never apologizes, always finds a scapegoat, sowed(and to this day, she still tries to keep sowing) the seed of distrust, demands to be respected  because of the ""hierarchy"" BS.

I have a lelit Anita and using the built in grinder.
The coffee is good, getting desired setting and everything but after a few times grinding for new shots I started to notice that the setting is moving on by itself to a finer setting.
Before noticing this I got 1-2 great extractions and after that the machine would choke and didnt figure out why. 
The knob just turns by itself while grinding :(

The pic attached is what my setting is usually on. After a few times it goes to about 2 or very close to 2 by itself and it messes with my extractions and obviously wasting coffee beans in the process.

Anyone faces this? Fixed it?

Avinash - he is trapped by her relationship with Eisha. He clearly wants to show love angle with her. Couple of weeks ago he wrote something for her in Punjabi and yesterday's late night discussion confirms this. He understands fake love lapata will seal his position in the house till the end. He has already shown his angry kaleshi side and currently he's trying to show his mahaan side. Love lapata is the only missing thing in his journey and he's desparate for it. Eisha is not giving green signal which could mean she's still dating lord Shaleen. It would be beneficial for his game if he ditches Eisha and plays a solo game.

Shilpa - Karan Vivian are her goldmine and she won't let them go as much as possible. She has individual equations with people outside her group and keeps favouring them over people in her group. That's how she's avoiding nominations week after week. If she continues to play like this she will end up surpassing her MG stay in the house 😭

Karan - KV is one of the smartest player in this season. He knows Shilpa/Vivian would come across as backstabber and public sympathy will be on his side. That's why he doesn't take a strong stand against Shilpa or breaks his friendship with her. He even goes to the next level of supporting Shilpa right after she has backstabbed him because he knows how it would look. He's playing more directly now and calling out people the right moments. He's the player to beat in this season.

Chum - Chum is the most honest person in the house. Whatever she's doing is 100% herself and nothing is for the game. Her words, actions, reactions, friendships everything is genuine. Even her aggression is the only genuine aggression I have seen in the house ( most of the guys aggression I have seen looks fake). She has spoken in live feed about not looking for love right now and definitely not in a show but these parts will never make it to the episodes. So while makers or fans promote Chumveer they are only friends and chum has openly clarified it. The only thing she needs to be careful about is her aggression which can get out of hand pretty quickly.

Vivian - You will find it hard to believe but I think that the makers have finally turned against Vivian. They have started showing clips in the episodes where others are calling him out. Earlier they used to edit it out completely. Vivian has no game of his own and is just following his group of Eisha and Avinash. As long as he gets his coffee, gets to taunt Chahat and gets to eliminate KV in tasks he's happy being in the background for the rest of the season.

Sara - Sara saved herself from eviction by going on a rampage against Eisha and Avinash. She's ensuring her footage in episodes by the chudail act. She did Kalesh with KV and saved herself from eviction again. She understands kalesh would save her but she needs to play more carefully now. Trusting Dalal blindly would be her downfall. She should take individual decisions and not follow him the way she's doing right now.

Chahat - Based on Wkv feedbacks/sponsor tasks Chahat has understood Rahat ship is working outside. That's why you are seeing her more with Dalal in recent episodes and this will continue. On surface it would appear that she's playing more with heart and less with brains but it's actually the opposite if you notice closely. She's also the only solo player in this season. I respect people who can play the game and Chahat is certainly one of them. She has everyone fooled 🤣",20,1732975950.0,biggboss,13,0.81,False
