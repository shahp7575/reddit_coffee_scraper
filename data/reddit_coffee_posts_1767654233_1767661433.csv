I'm tired of them so I thought I'd give this a shot. I've heard good things from friends who have found interesting people on here. I like the idea of writing up a post and catching the intrigue of someone and not having the attraction based solely based off of pictures. Words can be impactful. How someone writes matters and so is what they say.

With all of that said what I'm looking for is a real connection. Possibly one that could lead somewhere someday. I'm basically looking to start our relationship with a cuddle buddy type situation and if we really enjoy spending time with each other I'm open to something more meaningful down the line. Just want to enter into it slowly and chat to start. Then plan a meetup for coffee and conversation or maybe even grab some dinner and go for a walk... something along those lines anyway.

A little about me:

I'm single and ready to mingle lol. I'm white (european background) but was born and raised in Toronto. Currently have my own place about 20 mins east of downtown. I have a great job that keeps me busy 9-5 mon to friday but I have some free time to spend around those hours. I have a car as well. I have brown hair, brown eyes and I'm in pretty good shape and live a healthy, active lifestyle. I go to the gym regularly and really enjoy doing things outside (while its warm out at least.) Think hiking, biking, going for a run or a long walk around Queen St E. I eat pretty well and take good care of myself. Would love to find a lady who pampers herself, stays in shape, lives a healthy lifestyle and is a good conversationalist. I'm pretty passionate about music, movies, video games and board games. I love horror movies and cuddling up with some snacks as well. Definitely looking for a little spoon and craving some touch.

I'm 17F if that matters

Some info about her: 160cm, east asian, had high cholesterol for a bit, but got it back down and didn't need any medication. doesn't smoke, drink, or take other substances. She just likes coffee and tea

The main things I've noticed:

1. A lot of repetition in her speech and actions. ex. She'll talk, forget what she's saying mid-sentence, finish it after thinking for a few moments, and then repeat the entire sentence/phrase over again for like 2-4 times, and is completely unaware that she just did. ex2. We would be walking on a sidewalk, but she'll suddenly stop, walk backwards, then walk forward again (repeating), and when I ask, she's silent for a few seconds before saying ""nothing"" as if she was in a trance or something

2. We're immigrants to Canada, and our first language is not English. However, it's been 10 years since we immigrated, and my mom has taken many ESL/English lessons and shown great improvement. But recently, she's been having trouble understanding English words and communicating in English (like at a restaurant), which she had absolutely no trouble with before.

  
3. She gets really, really anxious and stressed, like super easily. I'm currently applying to universities, and I'm constantly assuring her that I've got everything handled and I'm not missing anything whatsoever. i even used to places i didnt want to so that she'd feel more at peace(?), but there are just instances where she'll ask me a question (or if she's wondering about anything actually) and i don't give her a super proper answer with a huge breakdown, she gets really stressed and worked up like the world is gonna end, even if the answer to that question is general knowledge stuff or not important at all. It really stresses me out, too, because she starts pushing me with more questions in a panicked state.

  
4. She's a stay-at-home mom and had a part-time job for around a year last year, but quit in October. Since then, even she's told me that she started to gain weight, and has felt really ""dizzy"" or ""confused"", kind of like when you dissociate for a few moments and snap back like ????. Her mom, my grandma, is also like this. But she told me that when my grandma was her age, she wasn't like this at all. So, sure, it may be genetic, but the fact that she's becoming like this so early makes me worry a lot.

  
Maybe it's just because I'm under a lot of academic stress lately, but I feel like 52 is too young for her to be experiencing these things.

I always tell her to exercise more and eat healthier to take care of her body, but I don't think she takes it seriously. Are these things as concerning as I feel like they are? Should I take her to see a doctor? It's been on my mind for a while now.

I’m running on 3hrs of sleep, I haven’t eaten in 12-13hrs, and all I had today was cookies and coffee. I just sat myself down on desk and said “you’re not getting up from this chair until u finish what u have”.

I know it’s not healthy, but it only feels like I’m working 

when I’m like this, otherwise it doesn’t feel enough, I mean even this doesn’t seem enough, I wanted to study more but I unfortunately spent two hours on house chores so I only had 8hrs left. 

I need to work harder to I achieve what I want or my whole life is wasted. 

My fear of the future and the fair of being average eats me alive every second of the day that I can’t let myself rest cuz it feels like I’m wasting time and not working hard enough and that there’s out there right now somebody working harder than me and they’ll steal my dream.

I gave up on sport (I literally fall into depression when I stop doing  it) and other stuff that I used to love for this, and imagine if I fail at it 

People usually tell me I’m too young to care this much about that type of stuff but it’s not that easy for me, I’ve been worrying about my future since I was like 13, I always thought about what I wanted to be

I remember a teacher of mine once told me “if you want to live Luxe, u have to work luxe” and it’s been on my mind since then. It’s not about money, matter of fact if I wanted money I could’ve picked a way easier path, but I don’t want that, I just want to be fucking great.",1,1767661247.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1q5431k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lugg-ondemand-movers/comments/1q5431k/the_moving_physics_of_why_7_am_is_the_most/,"The ""Moving Physics"" of why 7 AM is the most efficient time to relocate","Moving day is a race against the clock that most people lose. We’ve all been there: you’re optimistic at 10 AM, but by 8 PM you’re eating pizza over a sink because the bed isn't built and you're too exhausted to find the silverware.

After analyzing thousands of moves in major metros (LA, NYC, SF, etc.), there’s a clear statistical ""sweet spot"" for efficiency. If you’re planning a move soon, here is why the **7 AM window** is the objective winner for your sanity and your wallet:

# 1. The ""Traffic Delta"" is Real

In a city like Seattle or SF, a 10-mile drive at 7 AM is a 20-minute breeze. By 9 AM, that same stretch hits peak congestion. While many movers (like us) only bill for labor at the doors, traffic kills the **rhythm** of the move. A crew that gets stuck in an hour of gridlock loses momentum, and your ""afternoon"" to unpack evaporates.

# 2. The Loading Zone ""Goldilocks"" Period

Before 8 AM, the city hasn't fully woken up. Street parking and loading zones are usually vacant.

* **The Math:** If your movers have to park 100 feet further away because the ""good"" spot got taken at 8:30 AM, they are walking an extra \~200 feet per round trip. Over a 50-item move, that’s **nearly 2 miles of extra walking** just to get your stuff to the truck.

# 3. The ""Fresh Crew"" Variable

Moving is an athletic event.

* **Slot 1 (7 AM):** Your crew is at 100% energy.
* **Slot 3 (2 PM):** Your crew has already moved 4,000 lbs of furniture in the sun. By being the first move of the day, you get the highest power-to-weight ratio from your movers.

# 4. Avoiding the ""Vertical Bottleneck""

If you live in a high-rise, the elevator is your enemy.

* **The Commuter Rush:** 8:00 AM – 9:30 AM.
* **The Delivery Rush:** 10:30 AM – 1:00 PM. Starting at 7 AM lets you claim the freight elevator before the building becomes a hive of activity.

# 5. Heat-Sensitive Cargo (The stuff people forget)

If it’s summer, the back of a moving truck can hit **120°F+** by mid-afternoon.

* **Vinyl Records:** Start warping at 140°F (easy to hit in a parked truck).
* **Electronics:** Capacitors and screens don't love prolonged heat soak.
* **Houseplants:** 30 minutes in a hot truck is a death sentence for a Fiddle Leaf Fig.

**The Reddit ""Move Early"" Checklist:**

* **The Coffee Strategy:** Don't just make a pot; have a ""go-bag"" for the machine so it's the very last thing loaded.
* **The Bed Hack:** Move your mattress and bed frame **first**. If you run out of steam at 4 PM, at least you have a place to sleep.
* **The ""Open First"" Box:** Clear plastic bin with toilet paper, chargers, basic tools, and box cutters.

**We just opened 7 AM windows** specifically to help people take advantage of these logistics. It’s the smartest way to ensure you’re actually sitting on your couch by lunchtime instead of crying over a hex key at midnight.

1q541as,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q541as/it_took_my_toothbrush/,It Took My Toothbrush,"To start, I work from home. Which means of course my days very often just... blur together. Wake up, coffee, laptop, meetings, yada yada yada, you get it. The apartment always stays quiet enough that I can hear the refrigerator cycle on and off, and my downstairs neighbors either shouting or turning their tv volume too far. But for recounting the events I have to say nothing had ever gone missing here. 

Yesterday morning, my toothbrush was in the kitchen sink.

See, I always keep it in the mirrored cabinet, top shelf, blue cup, always facing bristles out. Why? No clue, just how I always do it. So seeing it laying flat in the sink felt extremely wrong. I stood there for a long time, trying to remember if I’d been half asleep or distracted or maybe even if I rememebered sleep walking or something. I laughed it off, figuring the stress from the holiday season had just worn me down so much that I was losing it. 

All day though, little things felt slightly misplaced. My desk chair wasn’t tucked in all the way. The toilet paper was off the roll and sitting behind the toilet. My refrigerator light bulb was sitting on the eggs. I told myself this is what happens when you don’t leave the house enough. Your brain just crashes. I kept thinking of all those documentaries I'd seen talking about how insane stress and solitude can make you.

So to get a good laugh out of it all last night, I set my phone up on the dresser, angled toward the hallway. I honestly believed that I'd most likely just see myself getting up. Wandering around. Carrying out my day to day habits while asleep, like on auto pilot. Maybe subconsciously I also wanted proof that nothing was happening.

I feel like I slept poorly, but the recording went for the whole night.

For most of the night, I just tossed and turned in the bed. But at 2:17 a.m., something moves at the ceiling vent. Slowly opening it, turning the rectangle sideways and at and angle to pull it into the ceiling.

A thin, almost nude man drops down without a sound, unfolding himself slowly like one of those circus performers with extra joins. He’s extremely emaciated and lanky, maybe a little over six feet tall. He's close enough to the camera to tell that he doesn't actually have any eyes, only clumped scar tissue. He stands very very still, head tilted, listening. I remember feeling frozen to my seat when I first watchd the video back.

He moves through my apartment with a patience that scares me. Like a silent turtle. He walks out of my bathroom with my toothbrush, turns it in his fingers, smells it, then presses it briefly to his tongue before placing it to the floor. He does this with other things too occasionally when passing where the camera can see him. Some knives, medicines, and random decorations. He returns to my room then sniffs my shirts and pants before laying them back on the laundry basket.

Then he stands in the corner of the living room and just stands still. He's painfully still. He doesn’t sway. He doesn’t fidget. He just waits, facing the wall. Hours pass on the timestamp, and he doesn’t move at all.

At 3:41 a.m. I wake up to use the bathroom.
On the recording, he reacts instantly, sliding backward into the hall closet with an impossible speed. The door doesn’t open, his body drops to the floor silently and slides under. It looked like how mice or other small creatures can fit through far smaller holes.

I pass the closet on my way back, rubbing sleep from my eyes, completely and utterly unaware. He doesn’t come out until I’m back in bed, once again oozing out from under the door.

At 6:12, three minutes before my alarm is scheduled to go off, he moves again. This time he crawls up the wall in a spiderlike fasion. He disappears into the vent the same way he came out, soundless and careful. Placing the vent back on.

The alarm goes off. I wake up. I enter the bathroom, then return to my phone and end recording. I found the recording while drinking my coffee, sitting by my front door where I'm writing this now. I watched it twice. There are no glitches. No cuts. No explanation that makes me feel better.

I have alerted the police and have already gotten most of my things packed and ready to go. This is their problem now. Although, I haven't been able to find my toothbrush.

1q53rv1,https://i.redd.it/amxt0t20mmbg1.png,The Appearance of Seaside Manor Part 1,"**Chapter 1**



I never thought death would announce itself so clearly. One moment the coastline was calm, a place of quiet reflection, and the next it had become a place I had to escape with everything I had. The tsunami sirens shrieked above me, a metallic howl that drowned out thought and feeling alike, leaving only the frantic pounding of my legs as I fought through the sand. 

I didn’t even notice the body in front of me until I collided with it. My chest hit something solid, and suddenly I was face first in the grit. Dazed, I heard muffled curses through the sirens. A rough hand seized my arm and hauled me upright. A broad, sand-caked man with wild eyes steadied me only long enough to start dragging me away.

“I need to get to my car!” I shouted, trying to twist back toward the parking lot.

He snapped me toward him, voice cutting through the noise, “Forget it. The roads are already clogged. That wave’ll hit before you even get close.” He jabbed ahead, never slowing. “The sea stack. Seaside Rock. It’s the only high ground that’ll keep us above it.”

I froze. Seaside Rock? A single stone monolith against the ocean’s wrath? I looked toward the parking lot people swarming in panic, bodies pressing against each other in a futile surge toward their vehicles. I’d never push through in time. Seconds slipped through me like water, and hesitation was the most dangerous choice of all. My legs chose for me, and I bolted after the man toward Seaside Rock.

The cool air filled my burning lungs as salt and fear mixed in every breath. One of my flip flops flew off so I kicked the other off as well. My muscles screamed, but the sight of the towering stack pushed me onward. Then came the crushing realization, the cliff face before me was sheer, unwelcoming. Some sides had paths, but not here. This was vertical stone, and the seconds left were few.

I threw myself at the cliff anyway. There was no time to search for a better route, no room left for second guesses. My fingers scraped at the stone, hunting for anything that might hold. The rock was damp and brittle, and at the lightest touch small chunks broke loose and rattled down past my legs. I pressed my chest against the cliff, breathing hard, trying to keep my weight close as my arms shook from the effort. Every pull sent pain flaring through my shoulders. My hands slipped, caught, then slipped again. Somewhere below, the sirens screamed without pause, but now I could hear something else beneath them, a deep, growing roar that made my stomach twist. The ocean was moving fast.

My foot skidded and I slammed into the rock, knocking the air from my lungs. For a split second my grip failed entirely and I felt myself drop, just a foot or two, but enough to spark pure terror. My heart hammered so hard I thought it might drown out the sirens. I imagined my fingers giving out, my body tumbling backward into open air, swallowed by the wave before I even hit the ground. I clawed upward again, nails biting into stone. My arms were screaming now, my vision narrowing, everything reduced to breath, grip, pull. The ledge above still felt impossibly far away. I did not know how much longer I could hold on.

Then I saw movement. A shadow fell across the rock above me, sudden and unreal. I looked up just in time to see a hand reach down over the edge, fingers spread wide, urgent.

I did not think. I grabbed it.

The grip was solid, rough, painfully tight. With one violent heave, I was hauled upward. My feet scraped uselessly against the cliff as my body was yanked over the edge. I had made it, I was on the ledge, gasping, sprawled beside the same man from the beach. For a moment I could not move at all, just lay there shaking, alive by the thinnest margin.

For the first time since the sirens began, I could breathe.

**Chapter 2**



My body welcomed the pause, every muscle shaking with relief as I gulped down air. My breathing slowed, no longer ragged, and in its place came quieter sounds I hadn't noticed before. The rustle of birds hidden in the trees above, the wind combing through tall grass, the faint wash of waves far below. It's what I didn't hear that made me leap to my feet.

The sirens were gone.

The man who had hauled me up the cliff stood a few feet away, staring into the horizon. When I joined him, my knees nearly buckled. The beach, the town, even the distant ridges of the mountains had all vanished beneath an endless, restless sheet of water. It felt as if the sea had swallowed the world whole and left us stranded on its last shred of land.

I don’t know how long we stood like that, numb and silent. At last the man let out a long, heavy sigh. He swiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, turned from the sight, and walked toward the treeline.

He was built like a truck, broad in the chest and shoulders, strong enough that even with age the fitness still showed. His hair was mostly gray but well kempt . He wore casual beach clothes, and a cross necklace, looking like someone who should have been carrying a cooler to the sand, not pulling strangers out of death’s reach.

I hurried to catch up. “What do we do now?” The question came out flat, empty of direction. I don't know what kind of answer I was expecting, afterall what could we do?

He leaned against a tree, rubbing at his neck. “Find some shelter, I suppose.” His eyes swept the brush, deliberate but uncertain. “Food and water will be tough. Been up here plenty and aside from maybe some seagulls all we've got is some berries to scavenge.” He tilted his head toward me. “What's in the bag?”

Only then did I remember the weight on my back, I had completely spaced I was even wearing it. I swung the straps off. “Damn… my water bottle must have fallen while I was running.” I dug through the pack: a couple towels, my car keys, tennis shoes, wallet, phone, and a single granola bar. “I only planned on hanging out at the beach for a day so I didn't pack a whole lot.” I pulled out my phone to see if I could contact the police or something. No signal. Not that there's a whole lot the local police could do anyway if the town was completely submerged.

He read the frustration on my face. “I'll start looking around, maybe some tourists left something behind we could use. Try your phone again from higher ground. You might get a signal.”

I nodded and slipped on my tennis shoes before shouldering my pack. Before I left, he extended his hand. “Name’s Dale.”

I clasped it, “I’m Ethan.” Before letting go I blurted out, “Oh and thank you so much for saving me back there.”

He gave a short nod and turned, heading into the brush.

Before pressing forward I looked over my shoulder one last time at the ocean that had taken everything, and the silence that followed it.



**Chapter 3**



Seaside Rock was massive for a sea stack, rising up from the beach like a green fortress. From below it had always looked smaller, but standing on top of it was something else entirely. The surface stretched farther than I recalled, covered in dense brush and wind-bent pines that creaked with every gust. Narrow dirt trails wound through the growth, half overrun with roots and patches of tall grass. I remembered following some of these paths once before, back when this place was just a tourist stop. I had taken photos from the lookout points and laughed at the warning signs about unstable cliffs, never imagining I would one day be trapped here.

It only took about ten minutes of walking to reach the far end. From here I could see the endless expanse of water wrapping around us, swallowing what used to be the coastline. I checked my phone again, hoping for something, anything. No signal, no connection, no world left to reach.

This side of the sea stack had a much more gradual incline allowing me to walk right down to the ocean. Had time allowed this would have been a much less arduous route to take when coming up here. As I watched the tide roll in and out I sank onto a patch of grass and buried my face in my hands, the weight of it all finally pressing down. I had only come to the beach for a day, just to clear my head, to escape the constant noise of work and family obligations, to breathe in sea air and lose myself in the rhythm of the ocean. Now that ocean had risen up and erased everything. My apartment, the streets I grew up on, the friends I texted every morning without thinking, all of it was gone or buried somewhere under that endless stretch of water. The thought hollowed me out. I tried to picture the city lights at night, the smell of coffee drifting out of the corner cafe, the sound of my mother’s voice on the phone. Each memory felt fragile now, like something already slipping away. For the first time since the climb, I wondered if I would ever see any of it again.

I nearly leapt out of my skin when a hand clamped down on my shoulder. I spun around, heart hammering, only to see Dale with a finger pressed to his lips.

“We need to be quiet. Come with me,” he whispered. His eyes darted around like he expected something to be watching us. I didn’t even have time to ask what was wrong before he pulled me deeper into the trees.

My mind raced. What could possibly have him this on edge? Out here, the only wildlife I’d seen were gulls and a few small birds. There was no way something like a bear made it out here, right?

“Get down,” Dale hissed, shoving me into the brush before I could say anything.

Through the gaps in the leaves I saw an open field ahead, lined by thick trees. In the center stood a large group of people huddled outside an enormous house.

For a moment, relief replaced my fear. Shelter meant safety. People meant civilization. I scrambled to my feet before remembering we were supposed to stay hidden. Dale tried to pull me back, but his hand slipped from my arm as I stepped out into the open.

“Why were you so worried about finding shelter if there’s a house here?” I asked.

He let out a sharp breath, more weary than angry. “Because that house wasn’t here before.” His voice was low, uncertain. “I’ve been up this rock a dozen times. There’s never been anything like that.”

He straightened, eyes still scanning the field. “No point hiding now. Let’s just hope those folks are friendly.”

I followed his gaze as we walked forward. Many of the people wore the same kind of beach clothes we had on. Survivors, probably, who managed to climb up from another side of the sea stack. Still, Dale’s unease didn’t fade. His shoulders stayed tense, his steps cautious.

As we drew closer, I began to understand why. The house looked completely out of place. It wasn’t weathered or broken down like something left behind. It was pristine. Its white siding and dark shutters gleamed as if freshly painted, but the style was old, almost antique. I could imagine my great-grandparents living in a house like this, definitely not the style of modern construction. It towered three stories high, each window clean and intact. I never studied architecture but even I could tell this house was beautiful.

The people waved as they noticed us, and I returned the gesture. Dale, however, didn’t lift his hand. His eyes stayed locked on the house, like he was waiting for it to leap toward us.

“Hey, how’re you two holding up? Either of you injured?” one of the men called out as he approached. He was a stocky, shorter guy, only a little older than me, with a sunburnt nose and wind tossed hair that stuck out from under his cap.

“I’ve got some scratches here and there, but I should be okay,” I said. Dale stayed quiet.

“Good to hear. Name’s Ryan,” the man said, offering a quick nod. “You two wash up from the east side?”

“Yeah,” I said, shaking his hand. “Ethan. And this is Dale.”

Ryan gave a small grin. “Well, welcome to paradise.” He gestured toward the looming structure at the edge of the clearing. “None of us are too sure what the deal is with this place. I’ve heard that overseas they sometimes build emergency shelters on islands in case someone gets stranded, but this one feels kind of overkill.” He said, giving a short laugh.

His tone was oddly upbeat, like he was trying to convince himself everything was fine. “Some of the others think maybe the local government just had too much money, or it’s some secret tourist hotspot that hasn't opened to the public yet. Whatever it is, no one around here has heard about it either.”

“So why’s everyone still standing out here?” I asked. “Is the place locked up?”

“Yeah, we tried the doors and windows, nothing budged. Someone mentioned breaking in, but people got cold feet about that. Last thing we need is getting slapped with a charge for breaking and entering, right?”

“I don’t think we have to worry about that.” I muttered. “The sun’s going down soon, and the temperature will be going with it. Whatever is going on with this place it'll at least be safer in there than it is out here.”

Dale gave me a quick look, the kind that said he didn’t like it but couldn’t argue. The crowd around us started murmuring, a few nodding in agreement. The crowd was a ragged mix of ages and moods. A few people clustered close together and whispered, hands rubbing their arms as if the cold had already started to get into their bones. There were two kids clutching at a woman’s sleeve, eyes wide and unblinking. A couple of teenagers stood apart, scanning the treeline like they were waiting for trouble. Several of the older folks had that same drawn look, the kind of tired you only get after losing something you did not know you could lose. Even with the small spark of hope in the clearing, the air felt heavy with shock and uncertainty.

“I’ll even go ahead and be the one to break a window, so if anyone wants to sue for property damage I’ll take the fall,” I said, pushing forward.

Ryan flashed me another grin when I volunteered. A few people muttered objections, but mostly they just watched with the blank, exhausted attention of people who will do anything to not spend the night shivering outside. An older woman stepped forward suddenly. I expected her to protest, or give me a warning but instead she reached up and handed me a sweatshirt with a soft, urgent motion.

“Wrap this around your arm. It will help,” she said, voice steady but kind.

I took it and felt the weight of it in my hands. The fabric smelled faintly of detergent and salt. It was thick and worn, across the chest a faded crest and block letters peeked through, like some high school name or university logo. I folded the sleeve over my arm, the cloth bunching as I wrapped it twice around my wrist and forearm, then tucked the loose end under to hold it in place. The cotton rubbed against my skin and felt steadier than I had expected. It was more than a scrap of cloth now. It was a small promise that I could take a hit and still keep going.

I stepped up to one of the windows, suddenly aware of how exposed I felt. I had never broken a window before. Hell, I couldn’t even remember the last time I had thrown a punch. I took a breath, pulled my arm back, and braced myself for the sound of shattering glass.

Before I could swing, a loud metallic slam echoed throughout the clearing.

The front door swung open.

**Chapter 4**



My arm dropped to my side and I froze. For a split second I didn’t understand what I was seeing. A man stepped out from the doorway, bending slightly to clear the frame. He was dressed in formal clothes, the kind I had only ever seen in old movies or upscale hotels. His jacket was pristine, his shirt crisp, his hair perfectly combed despite everything that had just happened to the world outside. He looked untouched by the chaos around him. Not to mention he was incredibly tall, easily standing at 7ft.

I had no idea what I had expected. Maybe an old man clutching a shotgun, screaming at us to get off his land. Perhaps some government official begging us not to destroy a restricted property. Anything would have made more sense than this.

“My sincerest apologies for the wait,” the man said calmly. His voice carried easily across the field. “We were not expecting so many visitors, and as such there was some tidying to be done. It is my pleasure to announce that we are finally ready to entertain our guests. Welcome to Seaside Manor.”

For a moment, no one spoke. Then the clearing erupted. People shouted over one another, confusion spilling into anger. What the hell was this? We had just survived a tsunami. The world had been washed away beneath our feet, and this man was talking like we had shown up early to a dinner party. Several people surged forward, pushing past him and disappearing into the house without hesitation. Others hurled questions at him, accusations tumbling out in panicked bursts. Where had he been? Why was the house locked during an emergency? Who was he supposed to be?

He did not answer a single one. He simply stood there, hands gesturing towards the open door, face composed and unreadable. I could not tell if it was shock that kept him silent, or if he simply did not feel the need to explain himself. Either way, his calm only seemed to make things worse. The more he said nothing, the more restless the crowd became.

“If you wish to remain outside, that is perfectly acceptable,” the butler said, his tone unchanged. “For those who would like to join us for dinner, the lady of the house is more than willing to feed any who wish to dine with us.”

The shouting died almost instantly. His words clung to the air in a way yelling never could. Food. The word landed heavy in my gut. I thought of the granola bar still buried in my bag, the only thing I had left to eat. It wouldn’t even come close to filling me, let alone the fifty or so people stranded here together. Warm light spilled out from the open doorway, soft and golden, washing over the grass and the faces nearest to it. Compared to the darkening sky and the cold air creeping in, the house looked impossibly inviting and safe. I almost hated myself for how badly I wanted to step inside.

One by one, people began to move. Some avoided looking at the butler as they passed. Others murmured apologies, offered thanks, or nodded awkwardly before slipping through the doorway. I caught a glimpse of Ryan putting his hand on the butler’s shoulder and muttering something. The anger drained out of everyone, replaced by hunger and exhaustion. Survival had a way of making choices feel simple.

Then a figure forced itself through the crowd. Rapidly making its way toward the door.

A body slammed into the butler and drove him back against the side of the house. Despite the size difference, Dale’s hand was clenched in the front of the man’s jacket, his face red with fury. 

“Like hell I’m stepping inside that house,” Dale shouted. “Have you people lost your goddamn minds? A wave wipes out everything, this place just shows up, and you think this is normal? For all we know we’re all that’s left!” His voice cracked with rage and an underlying sadness. “None of this is right. I dunno what this freak is but this shit ain’t natural and I’ll be damned if we fall for his tricks.”

A few people rushed forward, grabbing at Dale’s arms, trying to pull him back. He shoved them away with surprising strength, keeping the butler pinned in place. The crowd exploded again, fear and panic bubbling back to the surface.

Through it all, the butler remained composed. His hands stayed open at his sides, his voice calm as he spoke to Dale like a parent soothing a child. I couldn’t hear the words over the shouting, but the contrast made my skin crawl. Dale was shaking, veins standing out in his neck, while the man he had pinned didn’t even look afraid.

I stood frozen, caught between the warm light of the doorway and the growing sense that stepping inside might be a mistake we would not get the chance to undo.

Dale kept shouting, the words tumbling out faster now, louder, like he was trying to drown out his own fear. “You’re some kind of demon, aren’t you? Or a ghoul sent here to lure us in? Were we drawn here to live out the end times? Like this is all part of Revelations? If you're just here to torment us then at least give a straight answer!”

The butler continued, almost gentle. “Sir, there is no need to be alarmed. If you would simply-”

“Cut the crap or I'm sending you through this fucking wall,” Dale snapped, slamming the butler into the house again. His grip tightened, knuckles white. “I’m not playing your games. If you don't answer the questions I swear to all that is holy I will kill you!”

The words hit the crowd like a spark to dry grass.

Someone screamed and in an instant bodies surged forward, shouting and shoving as fear turned into motion. Hands grabbed at Dale, others pushed toward the door, and the space between us collapsed into chaos. I felt an elbow slam into my ribs, then a shoulder strike my chest. My feet left the ground.

I stumbled backward, arms flailing, the world tilting violently. The warm glow from the doorway filled my vision as I fell, swallowing me whole. For a split second all I could see was light, hear was shouting, feel was the sudden weightlessness of losing control.

Then I crossed the threshold, tumbling into the house as the noise and terror poured in after me.",2,1767660436.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

And the depression doesn’t help the situation. I don’t want to be this pessimistic but FUCK! I HURT ALL THE TIME!!! I might be smiling at the park drinking coffee with a few friends on a rare day I go out but on the inside I’m in SO. MUCH. PAIN.

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Duet Night Abyss, Ocarina of Time, and One Step From Eden. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, , and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated pri[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)marily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

We broke up over a miscommunication and it was ugly. I ended up quitting the job we worked at together. The break up wasn’t the main cause, I was facing a lot of problems there and it just ended up being the leaf that broke the camel’s back. I got a comfy, government job in the niche field we work in. For context later in the story - My employer has won awards multiple years for being one of the greatest places to work nationwide. 

Fast forward to a year and a half later, we see each other in traffic. I deleted his number shortly after our break up but he texted me. We met up for coffee. I went into this coffee date assuming he just wants to get in my good graces so it’s not weird when he tries to apply. 

Well one coffee date turned into a few more dates and we’ve been seeing each other for about 5 months now. I’m happy, he treats me like a queen, the relationship feels solid, we’ve taken fun trips, and I’ve met his family. 

One of our friends sent him a job listing a month/month and a half ago that is essentially the same as what I am doing now, but in a different city and it pays better than my job. He said he wasn’t ready yet. 

Now my employer is hiring, and he applied. I want him to have a better work/life balance. It is a great place to work. There is a very good chance we will not work together. We have talked about slowing down plans of moving in together and how we would handle a break up if he was hired. 

I have this nagging thought that he might just be using me to get this job and might slowly break up with me if he gets it. It seems delusional, I’m aware, but I can’t get this gnawing worry off my chest. Nothing about his behavior gives me any other red flags outside of flashbacks of how he acted when we first broke up.

How could I appropriately ask him? lol if I even should at all?

Dra’lok’s knuckles turned white as he wrung his shaking hands around the shaft of the golden scepter in his hands, a rod shaped to resemble a long leg bone with a stylized skull on the top. His thumb ran over one of the runes engraved along its length, the oldest one, representing his first triumph, his first commendation. His concubines huddled at his side, casting fearful glances at the shadows, hissing at the other figures cowering in the corners, as if staking this small claim on territory helped them reassert some semblance of status. They had once been formidable women, of good stock, with good genes to pass on to his heirs. Now, their once resplendent coiffures were matted, tangled messes clinging to grimy, muddied skin and their tattled, filthy dresses bore but a faint echo of the wealth and splendor they once signified.

He was in not much better shape, himself. His robes, woven from the finest fabrics and embroidered with stylized representations of his genetic code, were torn and stained with blood. *Black* blood, not the blood of slaves, but his own, from the cut on his forehead where the heavy stock of the Terran weapon had struck him. He had once been a slavemaster, a respected member of the Dra’var’th middle class, afforded such and privileges as two concubines for pleasure and reproduction, a luxurious mansion with a view of the sunset and most importantly, the right to consume a slave’s soul once a year, growing his power and prolonging his lifespan. Now, he was the same as all the other figures huddling near him.

His mansion had been replaced with this cage, this *thing* once used to house slaves, not men of his station. It was cold and wet and far too dark, yet never silent, for the ventilation openings were designed to whistle in the wind, producing sounds intended to appeal to that most primordial instinct all living beings shared, the instinct which told them that a predator was near. Now, he was the one subjected to its terror, yet it was not that, nor the whimpering of the other captives, that truly chilled him to the bone.

*Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat*. There it was again, that horrible sound that haunted his every waking moment. It was a staccato beat from ancient history, one not heard on a Dra’var’th world in thousands of generations. It was *their* sound, the sound of primitive, kinetic weapons. Of *human* weapons. And every time he heard it, he couldn’t help but flinch.

He forced his eyes shut, as if doing so would somehow dispel that horrible sound, as if it would somehow make life go back to the way it used to be, when things made sense, when he had comforts and safety and respect and status and could demand that his whims be catered to with a mere frown. But of course, as he opened his eyes again, none of those things returned. For they were gone and the world he knew had changed forever.

*Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat*. His concubines flinched and whimpered at his side, seeking reassurance, seeking comfort and promises of safety. He kicked the first one away and struck the other with his scepter, for he had no reassurances to give, seeking his own in this basic gesture of cruelty. “Know your place, *whores,*” he snapped at them. Once, his voice would have sounded imperious, unyielding, demanding absolute obedience. Now, it was as feeble as the looks in his women’s eyes. *Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat*.

It was just his rotten luck. Or, perhaps, Lord Golgoth’s displeasure, for he had survived the gassing of the capital by sheer chance, a rogue wind blowing that horrible mist away from the suburb where he resided, only to be found by a Pact patrol as he tried to flee. His heirs had not been so fortunate. Both of them were further in the city when the Terrans and their allies shelled it. *Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat*. He flinched again, cursing his luck, cursing Lord Golgoth, wondering just what sin had he committed to earn his god’s ire. He had been a good slaver. He had broken many wills. He had served his own masters, just as his religion commanded him to, yet here he was, forced to listen to that horrible, nightmarish sound.

The door to the cage swung open, illuminating the darkness with the baleful, crimson glow of the planet’s twin stars. A voice called out, harsh and guttural, in Thralltongue, the language reserved for the slaves, meant to sound servile and meek, yet now somehow laden with authority even he felt compelled to obey. “Prisoners numbers seven hundred and thirty-nine to eight hundred and eleven step forward!”

Seven hundred and eighty-one. That was him. Eighty-two and eighty-three were his concubines, as luck would have it. “Move it, prisoner! We have a schedule to keep!” barked the voice of the soldier. Dra’lok didn’t want to move. As much as he hated his cell, he wanted to stay there, to make himself small, maybe the humans would just forget about him, maybe they’ll just-

He felt himself being hauled up by the collar of his robes. He hadn’t even heard them come in, hadn’t heard their metal boots on the floor, so lost was he in his own fear. He was shoved forward and out into the sun, his concubines shuffling after him. Outside, the rain had stopped, at the very least. Yet, as his bare feet sank into the soft mud of the plaza, all he felt was dread.

Around him, the suburb had been cleared out. Many of the mansions were still smoking, the humans having decided to simply burn them down after having difficulties with all the traps. The luxury skiffs that flitted about, were just smoldering wrecks now, or gone completely, probably taken elsewhere to be dismantled and analyzed for any useful technology. Instead, the skyway was filled with Terran drones and military craft, always moving in convoys led by one of those *tanks*, human war vehicles armed with railguns and missile launchers.

Once, slaves would have scrubbed the street clean by now, their eyes downcast as they rushed to finish their chores, for the last one to finish would get beaten or executed. Now, there were no slaves left. Or rather, they were all wearing those ashen-gray uniforms, now. Watching impassively as their former masters were marched off and loaded into one of those armored skiffs the Terrans used to transport cargo and troops, though Dra’lok didn’t know what they were called. The antigrav generators on this one whirred and growled incessantly, the primitive technology was infuriatingly loud.

One of the other prisoners decided to make a run for it. A female, Dra’lok noted, the females of his species were always the most unpredictable and it seemed even the humans had their hands full with them. She shoved the nearest soldier away and darted towards the ruined buildings, her shoes slipping on the muddy ground. Just a bit further and she would reach safety, just a bit more and she would be free, just-

A shot rang out across the plaza. The woman jerked, then stumbled and fell face-first into the mud. One of those damned Nyxian sharpshooters, of course, perched somewhere nearby, though Dra’lok couldn’t see where. Dra’lok’s concubines whimpered and all he could feel was disgust. At their weakness, for cowering, at himself for the numbness and fear he felt, at the entire universe for upending his life. He forced himself to move forward, one step at a time, one foot in front of the other. At least he wouldn’t be shot in the back like some damned beast, he thought as the vehicle’s doors slid shut.

It was not a long journey. Just a few minutes, really, it couldn’t have been more. When the doors opened again, Dra’lok could see he’d been transported further downstream, where the canyon widened into a broad depression that had once been fertile agricultural land. Now, all he could see were rows upon rows of pits, evenly spaced out. He was shoved forward, roughly. He hissed as someone tore the scepter from his hand, only to earn himself a cuff behind his ear and another rough shove.

They made him stand in front of one of those pits, his concubines still whimpering at his sides, clinging to his robes as if trying to hide behind him, as if that would do anything. Others were lined up alongside him, at the edge of that pit. Prisoners, just like him, once minor Dra’var’th nobles and colonial officials, now reduced to this. In front of him, a squad of human soldiers waited silently as one of their officers pulled up a file on his datapad. At either side of their formation, two of those horrible weapons had been mounted on tripods, the ones that made that horrible sound. What were they called? Dra’lok was fairly certain he’d heard someone mention it.

“… Seven hundred and eighty-one! Dra’lok! Middle caste, slaver!” The officer’s voice snapped him out of his reverie and called his attention back to reality as his name was called out. “Prisoner seven hundred and eighty-two! Dra’zora! Middle caste, torturer!” That was his first concubine, a fine woman, a respected woman, now flinching as if struck by a pain baton as her name was mentioned. “Prisoner seven hundred and eighty-three! Dra’noxa! Middle caste, fleshcarver!” His younger concubine, a true artist said to be unmatched in her generation. On and on that officer went, listing numbers, names and occupations, some of which Dra’lok had known, until he reached the end of his damned list.

These humans… Once, he had laughed at them, dismissed them as primitive, barely more than beasts. He had called them soft, had called them weak, incapable of understanding the fine arts of sadism and grasping the intricacies of fear. But now, as he listened to that horrible, mechanical sound of their weapons, to the tone of that officer reciting names off a list, he knew otherwise. For theirs was an altogether different kind of cruelty, a colder thing, devoid of the pleasure and joy of asserting superiority, one born of indifference and efficiency, yet so profoundly horrifying, that its implications shattered him.

The humans did not refuse to torture their prisoners out of softness and squeamishness. They simply did not give their captives the basic courtesy of hating them. That would have required an expenditure of mental energy, an emotional investment, however small, afforded to a living being. And what did that make him, then, in their eyes? A person? No. A beast? Not even that. He and his entire legacy, his bloodline, his everything, were just numbers to be crossed off one of their damned lists. “For crimes against humanity and gross violations of sentient rights, under article seven of the Pact charter, you are hereby sentenced to summary execution!”

A pair of soldiers racked some kind of levers on those horrible weapons of theirs. *Machineguns!* Yes, that’s what they were called. His concubines whimpered. Dra’lok wanted to shout, to hiss, to protest, to plead for mercy, to order these primitives to fall at his feet, to-

*Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat*. He felt the projectiles tear into his flesh with the force of an antigrav skiff, ripping through flesh and bone alike, tearing holes into his very existence. The world tilted, or rather, he did, he realized as his cheek slammed into the mud. In the corner of his vision, he saw his concubines falling backwards, disappearing into the pit while he had somehow remained halfway out, his upper torso balancing precariously on the edge while his feet hung over the abyss. If only he could get up, maybe he still had a chance, maybe he would survive!

Above him, the sun was obscured by a looming shadow. Dra’lok’s eyes sought its source, only to fall upon the armored boot of a human soldier. Slowly, with what strength he could still muster, he looked up at that impassive figure, face obscured by that expressionless helmet. He tried to speak, but only blood came out of his mouth. The human glanced down at him as if just noticing an insect. He drew a pistol from his belt, then pointed it at him…

The last thing Dra’lok heard was the mechanical sound that weapon made as the soldier’s other hand racked some sliding part. And then, the darkness claimed him.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The princess absently scrolled through the file pulled up onto her datapad, her thumb rhythmically sliding across the touchscreen. It was some introductory material on the structure of the Imperial diplomatic corps, normally meant for fresh recruits of that very same institution that was responsible for the humans’ many political achievements, from the peace settlement that ended decades of civil war, to the creation of the Pact, itself. It was an informative, detailed document, with charts and numbers and bullet point lists breaking down every relevant detail a new member needed to know.

Normally, she would have devoured such a thing with an eagerness born from a sharp mind that finally found something interesting to satisfy her boundless curiosity. Now, though… Valyra found herself unable to focus. Her other hand drummed a slow beat into the surface of the desk of the waiting room she’d found herself in, just a multipurpose office space attached to the Agamemnon’s detention block. With a sigh, she set the datapad down and reached for the cup of stale coffee that sat half-empty where she’d left it hours ago, long since grown cold. She’d raised it halfway to her lips when the door slid open and the silver-haired Kalidani duchess stepped in. “She’s awake,” Yelena announced in a tone that was as coldly professional as the perfect severity of her posture, though the barely-perceptible stiffness of her shoulders betrayed the cold fury she felt, a sentiment that matched the Alvari heiress’ own.

Valyra needed no other invitation. She stood up and followed Kainan’s protege deeper into the battlecarrier’s detention block, her own expression guardedly neutral as the duchess briefed her regarding the situation. “We have not yet informed her of what transpired after her capture,” Yelena said as she led the way. “And our silence led her to conclude that the planet was destroyed, a belief I haven’t deemed advantageous to correct.”

Once again, the princess could see why this woman had climbed so high in her species’ hierarchy in spite of her young age, for she’d been gifted with a remarkable degree of shrewdness on top of a sharp eye for detail that gave her the ability to not only notice the smallest and often overlooked details, but dissect them for advantages to apply in any given situation and swiftly formulate the optimal strategy to employ them. Had she not known otherwise, she might have assumed her to be Alvari, for she certainly had the intellect to match her species. Then again, it seemed that all the humans did.

This section of the massive vessel was as stark as the rest of the Terran flagship. Everything there was designed purely for function, for efficiency, every inch of space optimized for maximum usefulness, even more so than the habitation quarters, for while crewmembers would be afforded such necessary comforts as were required for maintaining optimal mental health and psychological stability for the human species, the brig, as the humans called it, was given no such considerations. Every cell was a box, exactly four meters, by four meters, by three. There was a bunk, really a simple slab of metal, bolted to the left bulkhead and a sanitation unit on the opposite one. The lighting was the same stark, impersonal white that seemed to be the default setting aboard every human vessel, provided by a pair of strips embedded alongside the edges of the ceiling, while a small black dome housed surveillance sensors used by the ship’s AI to monitor the cell’s occupant. And that was it. No viewscreens, no decorative embellishments, no devices meant to provide any kind of mental or emotional stimulation.

Not that Valyra cared for the comfort of prisoners right now, especially the one currently occupying the cell at the end of the long corridor, separated by a forcefield that vibrated with a frequency which caused the tips of her elfin ears to tingle, resonating with the nerve clusters there, which were responsible for the extraordinary sense of balance her species was known for. “Open it,” ordered the princess in a tone that was as cold as the polar ice of Kalidan. The guard hesitated, but a small nod from the duchess prompted him to obey.

Inside, Domina Dra’milla idly toyed with a lock of scarlet hair. She’d been stripped of her ceremonial and utterly useless armor and had been forced to don a set of drab, mustard-colored overalls of rough synthetic fiber, the kind worn by prisoners of the Terran Empire, without any pockets or metallic parts and whose sole embellishment, if one could call it that, was the number printed on its back and above the left breast. She did not look up as the princess entered her cell, though she *did* scoff, maintaining that infuriatingly smug expression on her features. Valyra was not in the mood to put up with her attitude, though. She flicked her wrist and her skin lit up with cyan-tinted bioluminescent patterns as the Dra’var’th woman was lifted off the bunk and pinned against the wall by the invisible grip of her psionic powers.

Dra’milla laughed, a sound that earned a mild scowl from the Alvari princess, followed by a telekinetic slap across the face that violently jerked her head hard enough for her to bite her tongue. She spat the blood on the stark floor of the cell before slowly turning to regard Valyra with a smirk. “My, oh, my…” she taunted, her tone laden with cruel condescension. “Has the scorned princess finally grown some fangs? Have you come to get your hands dirty? You’ll have to do better than that if you want to break me.”

Valyra ignored the barbs, keeping the haughty royal mask in place, her features the very definition of imperious disdain as she listed her demands with an air of boredom as if she were reciting a grocery list rather than conducting an interrogation. “My brother’s resources. His allies at the High Table. The disposition of his fleets.”

Dra’milla tilted her head back as far as she could and cackled defiantly. “Is that all, princess? And here I thought you were going to ask me about something that’s *actually* interesting,” she responded, earning her another telekinetic slap, which only prompted another bout of cackling. “The fact that I am still alive shows how weak you are. And soft, like that human whose bed you have been warming. How is he, by the way? Still alive, or has he given up the ghost along with the rest of the planet?”

Yelena stepped forward, but Valyra stopped the duchess with a gesture. Her hand shot out and roughly grasped the Domina’s chin, slamming her head against the bulkhead and forcing her to look at her. Her *Eryndai* was already in her other hand, the crystalline blade glowing with the same color as her eyes and the patterns on her skin as its deadly edge pressed against the Dra’var’th woman’s windpipe. Her lips curled into a smile that did not reach her eyes. “Let me tell you something about that human,” she said with a deadly edge to her voice. “Yesterday, he bombarded that entire city with poisons to stop your weapon. This morning, he ordered mass executions to be carried out. Tomorrow, he might glass a planet, or a hundred.”

The smugness in Dra’milla’s look was replaced by a look of uncertainty. “You’re lying,” she stammered, her tone feeble and trembling. Valyra nodded to the duchess, who tapped something on her wristcomp, causing a holographic projection to appear in the air. It scrolled through a list of names and Dra’var’th faces, the faces of all the local nobles that had already been executed. At its side, the projection cycled through drone footage depicting hundreds of pits, some already filled in, others still awaiting their future occupants.

“No,” the Domina muttered, terror slowly dawning on her features, but also a resolve that surprised both Valyra and the duchess. “No, no, no, no… I will not betray him. I will not betray Vaeloryn to you…” she repeated, over and over as she hugged her knees and started rocking, as if seeking to steel herself. Yet even that revealed something useful, for it indicated the extent of her loyalty towards the princess’ loathsome sibling. Another telekinetic slap sent her sliding across the floor until she slammed against the edge of that bunk, one of her horns cracking.

It was Valyra’s turn to smirk. “The only reason you are still alive, Dra’milla, is because we still have some uses for you,” she said, releasing her captive from her telekinetic grasp. The Dra’var’th woman slid to the floor like a sack of vegetables, a hand reaching up to rub the back of her neck. Valyra pressed on. “Now, we could simply pluck all the information we need directly from your mind. It would take me a few days to do it and likely a little longer for the humans, but we have more than enough time to do that. So, you had better start thinking of many, *many* ways in which you can be useful, because the thing you need to be concerned about, is what exactly is going to happen when your usefulness comes to an end.”

Yelena reached out and placed a hand on the Alvari heiress’ shoulder. “A word, princess?” she asked, a weary look in her eyes. Valyra nodded and accompanied her outside, the forcefield snapping shut behind them as the two women walked away. They both stayed silent until reaching that waiting room Valyra had been sitting in, before. The duchess tapped a command into her wristcomp, temporarily shutting down the surveillance in the chamber. “Your highness, you should let me handle Dra’milla’s interrogation, you need not waste your time with this.”

Valyra’s eyes studied the duchess’ expression. Until a few days ago, Yelena had despised her and she had regarded the Kalidani woman with an equal measure of disdain. A few days ago, the princess would have assumed such a request to be no more than yet another jab, but things had shifted since the battle aboard the relay station and Kainan’s protege now held a degree of respect towards her that she’d previously lacked. No, this was not some attempt at jostling for position, this was something else.

Yelena pressed on. “You should… go to him.” she muttered the words with no small degree of effort, her eyes looking at the floor, a small tremor in her hands. Valyra’s eyes widened in surprise, for *this*… This, she had not expected, not from the proud and jealous duchess.

“What is he to you, Yelena?” she asked, for the first time calling her by name rather than title. It was a question that had occupied her thoughts a few more times than she cared to admit, even to herself. It was fairly evident she and Kainan were close and that they’d known each other for some time.

The duchess let out a sigh, her shoulders slumping slightly. “I was a slave when he found me…” she began to recount, her voice small and vulnerable. “Barely more than a child when the slavers deemed me… not useful enough to be kept alive. I was to be placed in one of their machines and…” Her voice trailed off, the memories still raw.

Valyra’s expression softened as she realized where this was going. “You’re in love with him,” she said and it was not a question. The duchess flinched as if she’d been physically struck. The princess had suspected it for a while, though. Yelena hid it well and others would have missed it, but the poor girl idolized him and a woman knew how to recognize such things.

“He… doesn’t look at me that way, though,” the duchess muttered, her head bowing in defeat. She sighed, straightening her posture, steeling herself as she finally forced her gaze to meet Valyra’s eyes. “You know… For a time, I thought you were trying to use him. That you only sought to take advantage, to seduce him into serving your political ends.” And now, it was Valyra’s turn to sigh, for she, herself, thought she had concealed the extent of her relationship with Kainan well. But of course, a woman knew how to recognize such things.

“When he looks at me, he sees a sister, not… what I wish he saw,” Yelena said, fighting back tears that glistened in her eyes. “And right now, he needs something I can’t give him… Something only you can give him. So, you should… let me deal with things here and…”

Valyra stepped forward and pulled her into a brief, but warm embrace. “Thank you,” she said. “For telling me this. And for being a better person than I thought you’d be.” With that, the princess turned and left the waiting room, a thousand conflicting burdens warring within her own soul, but at the same time, feeling like at least one of them had been lifted from her shoulders.

She moved away and recently moved back into town but is being distant.,"Before she moved away to her country to be with her family,  I had sent her messages for a while that if she's ever back in town to come find me. I was very much into continuing the relationship. 

Now she finally came back and told me. However, she said she unexpectedly met someone (slightly long distance) that she's been dating for a month now. And she'd be interested to just meet for a coffee or something since we haven't seen each other for a year. 

I am a little salty that she is very protective of this new relationship but our one year relationship, she just kind of blew off, saying ""it was difficult timing, etc.""

I told her I'd have preferred it if she gave me an opportunity, knowing she was coming back to my town where I was waiting to see her before getting into a committed relationship with someone else... 

She just acts kind of hesitant and is giving mixed signals. I don't know if I should continue pursuing it or be put off by her behavior. Or maybe I'm being overly demanding.

The reason I'm pursuing her this much is because she is one of the only girls I've met that I could see myself marrying and we talked about that type of situation. 

It just annoys the hell out of me that she's like so wishy washy. 

I'd have no problem telling someone I was dating for a month that I need to tie up a loose end that I never tied up and see how I feel.

She is Christian so I think it is her faith of being faithful that is messing with her head too. 

I kind of wish she never told me she was back in town working if she was going to act like this...

She'll tell me one day that she is so happy I want to continue dating her. And then another day, she'll be like I don't know, I have a boyfriend and it's been a while. She's cancelled two of our meetings so far. But every time she cancels she's like I still want to meet another day. It's driving me crazy.",1,1767659282.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Like Daniel, I will seek peaceful solutions rather than resort to violence, and I intend to play with good karma.  
I will be wearing a light armor and carrying .45 automatic pistol.  
and.. I will not be using any unique equipment. (include weapon, ALSID)  
I've decided what weapon I'll use, but haven't decided what to wear yet. Are there any general light armor you'd recommend? (Actually, I'm debating whether to wear a conservative suit or a dead horse tribe stalker outfit.)  
As for ability settings... I plan to set Barter, speech, medicine and guns high.   
In terms of perks, I would obviously not choose perks like Terrifying Presence, Sneering Imperialist, or Cannibal, and I would also not choose Grunt.  
Grunt, as you know, is a perk that enhances not only the .45 automatic pistol, but all US Army service weapons. I excluded it because my character concept is a missionary, not a soldier.  
For traits, I'm going to choose Good Natured for now, but I'm not sure what to choose for the other one. Do you have any recommendations?  
In main story, I'm going to take the yes-man route.  
Joshua assessed the NCR as being overly devoted to money and power, lacking in love for God and sharing.  
and of course, the Legion is the enemy of the New Canaanites.  
House also received poor reviews due to his authoritarian dictatorship.   
So, I will take the concept of a courier also spreading faith, and choose the Yes Man route, which is player own route.  
In the HH DLC, i've wondering whether to follow Daniel and help them escape, or follow Joshua and defeat the White Leg Tribe and show mercy.  
In the case of SPECIAL, I'm trying to set it to 6 ST, 7 PE, 10 EN, 7 CH, 7 Int, 8 AG, 5 L,  like Joshua and Daniel.. but I don't have enough points to distribute. The only way to make up for it is through the Intensive Training perk. or, I could clear Lonesome Road DLC to earn more points.  
An easier option would be implants, but Mormon doesn't seem to favor implants.  
hmm, btw come to think of it, I'd have to act like a Mormon. Of course, I wouldn't be allowed to gamble, alcohol, drink coffee, or buy sex. What about drugs? If it's a non-addictive drug, then there shouldn't be a problem, right?

So... in conclusion, I need advice on light armor that fits this concept, a single trait, a suitable perk build, a behavior pattern, a melee weapon that can be used as a sidearm, and S.P.E.C.I.A.L.",4,1767659189.0,fnv,0,1.0,False

I was tired, so I broke off a 12g chunk for a 140ml pot, and given my preference for thick and bitter, I went long and hot for about 30 seconds for the first steep.



Man, it’s chocolaty with an interesting finish. The liquor can be a little deceiving though. With the bitter focused ripes I’ve had from W2T, the first steep or two are lighter in color but hit with more punch and body. This one feels more elegant and rounded, I guess, but still has that coffee vibe I’m really into right now. I think I'm going to have to try the Red Label next because my only complaint is that with all the leaf I threw in there it could have been thicker.

\-6A-

I don’t think I have much time left, so I’m going to try and get this all out before there’s nothing left of me that remembers how.

If this sounds dramatic, I’m sorry. I know how it sounds. I know how that title looks and if I’d read something like this a month ago, I would’ve, just like you, justifiably, rolled my eyes, assumed it was some attempt at creepy internet fiction, and moved on.

But I don’t think I exist anywhere else anymore. Not really. And if I don’t write this down now, I’m afraid the only place I’ll exist at all is inside these walls.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 

“Where am I going to sleep?” 

“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 

“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 

It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.

You’re grieving.

You were half asleep.

You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.

No sounds of drawers opening.

No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

I don’t know why I dragged a chair over and stood on it. Some part of me already knew nothing good comes out of opening hidden spaces in horror stories. But this wasn’t supposed to be a horror story. It was supposed to be my life.

Behind the vent was a shoebox pressed tight into the duct. It took a stupid amount of yanking and swearing to pull it free, dust cascading down onto my face.

Inside were photos.

Some old, some newer. Different sizes, different types of paper. All of them had been taken in this apartment.

An older man sitting on the edge of the bed, staring toward the door with wide, hollow eyes.

A woman crouched in the corner of the kitchen, her hands clamped over her ears, mouth open in a sound the photograph couldn’t capture.

A kid, maybe eight years old, standing in the bathroom doorway, half of his body blurred like he’d been moving as the picture developed.

And one Polaroid with a date scribbled on the white border. ‘Six years ago.’ A man stands in the middle of the main room, shoulders slumped, looking past the camera. He looks tired in a way that made my chest hurt.

Behind him, the apartment looks…wrong.

The hallway is longer than it is now. Or maybe narrower. The perspective feels off, like one of those optical illusions where lines bend where they shouldn’t. The walls seem to tilt inward. The door to the bathroom is where my kitchen window should be.

I put the lid back on the box and shoved it away from me like it might bite.

It didn’t occur to me right away that, if those photos were here, those people weren’t.

Not until I found the tapes.

They were in the coat closet. I found them when my jacket sleeve caught on a nail and when I yanked the sleeve away to hard it pulled back a slice of drywall just enough to reveal the edge of a plastic case. Behind the loose panel was a narrow cavity full of junk, old receipts, a cracked phone, socks with no pair.

And a small camcorder, battery compartment crusted with age.

I found a charger at a pawn shop two blocks away. I almost didn’t go. A very, very rational part of me wanted to throw the camera out and move on. But curiosity does the same thing desperation does. It makes you ignore warning signs.

The battery took a charge. Against my better judgment, I hit play on the first file.

The screen lit up with the same walls I was sitting between.

The man from the Polaroid sat on the floor, back against the bathroom door, hair sticking out in sweaty clumps. His voice shook when he spoke.

“If anyone finds this,” he said, “don’t…don’t move in here. It learns you. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was me at first. Stress. Drinking. Whatever. I thought I was just losing it.”

He laughed, a frayed sound, eyes darting around like he expected the apartment to interrupt him.

“It moves things. Just little things, at first. You’ll think you’re doing it. That’s how it gets you. It makes you doubt yourself. Then it starts changing the rooms. The doors don’t stay put. You wake up and the hallway is longer, or the bathroom’s on the wrong side. You try to leave and end up back where you started. It…”

The video glitched. Lines of static crawled down the screen.

When the image stabilized, he was closer. Sitting where I was sitting now. He looked straight into the camera.

“Once it knows you,” he whispered, “it keeps you.”

The footage cut off.

I sat there for a long time after the screen went black, listening to the soft wheeze of the camcorder and the thud of my heart. My reflection in the darkened TV looked pale and stretched.

The thing about hearing someone else describe your nightmare is that it doesn’t make it less real. It just means someone else was awake before you.

After that, everything got worse.

Sometimes I’d walk to the front door and there’d be a little extra space between it and the wall. Sometimes less. Once, I reached for the knob and my hand closed on empty air. No door. Just unbroken wall where it should’ve been. I blinked, and it was back.

The cheap ceiling light in the main room seemed higher each day. The kitchen felt narrower, forcing my shoulders inward as I moved. The bathroom mirror showed more wall behind me than there should have been.

I’d put my keys on the counter and turn around to find them on the floor. I’d swear I’d left the faucet off and hear water running anyway. I’d find food in the fridge I didn’t remember buying, half a jar of pickles, a slice of birthday cake in a plastic container, a Chinese takeout box with someone else’s handwriting on it.

The handwriting that started showing up in the margins of my own notebooks.

Sometimes it looked like mine. Sometimes like someone else’s. Sometimes like it was trying to be mine and not quite getting there.

Little notes, in the corners.

‘It remembers where you stood’ 

‘Stop trying to leave’ 

‘It’s been longer than you think’

I started having gaps in my memory. Not small, forget-where-you-put-your-keys gaps. Whole evenings gone. I’d look up and realize the light had changed, and I didn’t know what I’d done in the hours between.

Once, I came to standing in the bathroom, my hands pressed flat against the mirror. Written across the glass in soap, in my handwriting, were the words:

‘You’re apart of the layout now’

I wiped it away so fast I cut my knuckle on the edge of the frame.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. The days stopped lining up after a while. My phone’s clock keeps glitching, resetting to strange times. Sometimes the date jumps backward. Once it showed a year that hasn’t happened yet.

Calls don’t go through. Texts sit in “sending” limbo until I receive the ‘failed to send’ message or they vanish completely. The few people I managed to contact early on either didn’t respond or sent one word replies that didn’t sound like them.

Did I actually call them? Did I dream it? Did I imagine their voices? It’s getting harder to separate what I know from what the apartment wants me to think.

I’ve found other things, too. An envelope wedged under a floorboard, full of expired IDs from people I’ve never met. A ring at the back of a kitchen drawer. A pair of glasses on top of the cabinet so dusty they must have sat there for years.

None of it is mine. All of it is in my home.

Sometimes, late at night, when I sit very still and force myself not to cry, I swear I can feel the apartment thinking. Not with a mind, exactly. With intention.

The walls feel too close. The corners feel like they’re folding inward. The air tastes stale, dead, like it’s been exhaled too many times.

I keep catching myself doing things I don’t remember deciding to do. Rearranging the table. Moving the mattress. Closing doors I don’t remember opening. Once, I woke up with dust under my fingernails and the vent cover on the floor. The shoebox was back inside the duct, as if I had carefully put it there.

I don’t remember doing that. But the box didn’t walk back on its own.

That’s what scares me the most now. Not that the apartment is changing, but that it’s making me part of the process. Like I’m one more component it’s rearranging. One more piece of furniture it’s finding a place for.

When I listen very hard, I feel like I can hear echoes behind the plaster. Not voices, exactly. Just the sense of others. People who stood where I’m standing. People who thought they were getting a second chance with cheap rent and no questions. People who left notes and tapes and warnings that no one came in time to read.

I don’t think anyone came for them. I don’t think anyone remembered they were here once the apartment finished with them.

I can feel it finishing with me.

My thoughts are getting thinner. Sometimes I reread what I just wrote and it feels like someone else’s story. Sometimes I catch my reflection out of the corner of my eye and don’t recognize myself. For a split second, I see someone older. Or younger. Or someone who isn’t me at all.

I don’t know how this is going to end for me. I don’t know if there’ll be a body for anyone to find. I don’t know if the landlord really knows what this place does or if he just sees tenants go in and lists go back up when they “move out.”

All I know is that the apartment doesn’t like emptiness. It fills itself. With belongings. With memories. With people who think they have nowhere else to go.

If you’re reading this, and any of it sounds familiar, if you’ve ever walked into a too-cheap, too-empty place and felt it watching you back, please listen.

Don’t come looking for me.

Don’t try to find this building.

Don’t answer any listing that sounds like mine.

And if you ever see a studio advertised as “vacant long-term, immediate move in, no questions asked” for far less than it should cost…

don’t move in.

The apartment I’m in is empty again.

And it’s waiting.

Wanting.

“In the end, the tenant of 6A drifts into the fabric of the apartment, another life quietly absorbed by walls that remember far too much. Nothing in 6A ends with a scream or a struggle, only a slow, gentle, disappearance, until you realize how completely the room has claimed what’s left. The ledger closes softly on another missing tenant as the building settles around the loss of 6A…and somewhere above, behind the door of 7B, something is delivered to the tenant that they neither can ignore nor comprehend.”

Cooling + earlier shutdown fixed it immediately,"I struggled with sleep for the last 4-5 weeks. Normally I sleep 6.5–7 hours and feel fine, but recently my deep sleep dropped hard and my Garmin showed worse HRV and higher heart rate at night.

I tried supplements first (ashwagandha helped a bit, L-theanine) plus no coffee and different bedtimes, but nothing really fixed it.

When I looked at what changed, it was obvious: a new project had me working until \~8:30pm (I’m usually asleep by 9:30pm), and it’s summer in Australia so the nights are warmer.

So I stopped trying to supplement my way out of it and fixed the basics: hard stop on work after 6pm, breathing exercises before bed, and keeping the bedroom properly cool (lighter blanket, light clothing, room kept chilly). Improvement was immediate and my sleep is back to normal quality. I only take 150mg Magnesium Glycinate because I've been taking it for about 7 months and it does help.

The point (for me) is that supplements shouldn’t be the first solution. If sleep suddenly gets bad, it’s worth looking at what changed in your day and your environment, then fixing that first.

Maybe it’s obvious, but I’m sharing it in case it helps someone else.",3,1767659112.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

We live in different states and wanted to go on a trip so we could spend some time together. We also decided to get concert tickets to see an artist we both like while on the trip. At first, everything was going well. I bought the concert tickets and my plane ticket while my sister paid for the hotel. She was planning on waiting to buy her plane ticket till it got closer to the trip. 

About a week ago, we were talking about the trip and my sister mentioned that she was planning on buying her plane ticket soon. She asked me to send her my flight information so she could arrange to get in around the same time. My flight is set to arrive around 5:30 AM. My sister told me that there was no way in hell she could or would want to get there that early. I let her know that I was fine with that and told her to just let me know when her flight got in and we can meet somewhere in the city. She then proceeded to get very upset which honestly shocked me she told me I was being selfish for not wanting to wait in the airport for her.  I told her I didn’t mind waiting for an hour or so, but it didn’t really make sense for me to wait much longer. I would rather go to a coffee shop or somewhere else nearby. She got very angry and told me she couldn’t believe that I would even suggest that I told her that it didn’t make sense and I frankly didn’t wanna wait around in an airport all day when the trip was short to begin with and I wanted to enjoy the start of my vacation. 

Later that day she texted me saying she was no longer sure if she wanted to go on the trip. I attempted to call her a couple times over the next few days, but she did not answer. Eventually, we ended up talking, however it did not go well. She held her ground about me waiting at the airport for her saying that it was not only selfish and rude of me but also dangerous. She also started talking about our trip and saying that she was worried I would always want to be doing something or that I wouldn’t be OK staying at the hotel for half the day. I told her I was more than happy to have some chill days but also if I wanted to do something and she didn’t, I would simply do it without her and she could have chill time by herself. I in no way want to spend my vacation sitting around at a hotel scrolling through Instagram or watching TV. I tried to reason with her, but we seemed to get nowhere and I eventually told her I would talk to her later but I hoped we could figure this out and she still wanted to come.

Later that day, I texted her with a very simple message saying that she needed to let me know as soon as possible if she still wanted to go on the trip or not. I let her know that I planned on going regardless and needed to know if she no longer wanted to go so that I could book accommodations for myself and sell her concert ticket. She was mad about that too saying she couldn’t believe I would even think to bring that up right now, and that I was being a selfish child for carrying so much about the $200 concert ticket. I have not talked to her since. It’s been about a week. 

I’m now conflicted. I wanna go on the trip with her because that was the original plan and it would be fun to do a sisters trip. The trip is only five days and I’ve been looking forward to the short vacation however I’m now conflicted if my sister is gonna continue acting this way, I’m honestly not sure if it’s a good idea that we go on a trip together, but I’m honestly sad and surprised that she’s ghosted me and is getting so upset over such small things. So am I an asshole for not wanting to wait hours for her at the airport and what should I do now? She seems to get mad every time I bring up the trip, but is it worth trying to talk to her again or should I just go ahead and continue planning for the trip without her.  I’m not really sure what the best thing to do is now but the trip is coming up in a few weeks and I need to get some things sorted if I’m going to go by myself.

I am aiming to spend time at a few co-working spaces (*any recommendations for co-working spots are appreciated*), however I really enjoy coffee and want to support the cafes there while getting some work done. I will be staying in the Aflama District near the Cathedral, but I don't mind walking far.

I definitely want to make sure I am respectful of the local community and businesses, so I don't want to whip out my laptop in cafes where that isn't acceptable. My work won't have me on calls in there or being loud by any means, just essentially me sitting in silence.

If I were to spend some time (a few hours at maximum each day) in a coffee shop I'll always be sure to buy coffee and/or food consistently to support them, cause I don't want to freeload in there by any means. But I definitely just want to make sure I'm going to places where laptops are typically acceptable and that I'm not being disrespectful.

So in essence, I would appreciate any recommendations on coffee shops where I could work at for a bit during the day (preferably local coffee businesses, but again I don't want to overstep + I have a feeling non-franchise chains may be less lenient with laptops).

From what I understand, even though it’s weather-related, KLM still has to cover food and daily necessities while you’re delayed under EU rules. So I’ve basically been treating these extra days like I’m already on holiday. I’ve been going out for lunch every day instead of sat at home with my beans on toast, and I’ve also been buying to go coffee, plus pastries and snacks whenever I feel like it! I feel terrible after every time but it's free food!

  
I also did a a pretty massive grocery shop specifically because of the cancellation and didn’t really hold back because it’s still food and it’s not my fault I’m stuck here longer than planned. I even picked up some nicer bits I wouldn’t normally buy at home since this is basically replacing hotel and airport food!

The first grand place in my first grand tour. Woo-hoo.

“Do you need anything?” My agent says.

No, I say. Just reassurance is enough in itself.

I play the guitar as well as I can. I came from the bottom. That’s my motto. I argue that that’s every rapper’s motto, though, but my agent insists that the people love a good rags-to-riches story because it improves relatability in celebrity life and blah-blah-blah.

The only issue with the tour is that my nemesis, a hip-hop soprano named Sticks and Stones, is here. That’s her stage name. It doesn’t even make any sense; her iconography is mainly inspired by the galaxy. Stars. Planets. 

My name is Stones and Sticks.

She says her name comes from her powerful rags-to-riches story.

Mine, I had told the journalists, was more complicated.

Every night I sleep. I possess. I have dreams about stones, spears, and sticks being thrown at me. Other times I’m standing on a stool, limping, being hit by thrown, angry tomatoes. When they hit hard enough against a surface—me—they explode into a million pulpy pieces that run down my thin-woven gray shirt and, most times, into my mouth. It always gets into my mouth. And there is always a man standing on his throne, looking down at me, disappointed, disappointed with his blue eyes.

Then, I jump off the stool. It ends.

I’m preparing myself to go to sleep in a Hilton Hotel room, the kind with massive coffee makers that dispense into styrofoam cups that my agent insists that it’s clean. I know that he did his job, because everything reeks of bleach here. He knows that I hate dirty things and weak materials. 

I hop onto the mattress and place my head against the pillow. The sheets wrap me in an overwhelming cloak of fluff that I know has been washed with the Bulky setting. Those devices are still as foreign to me as my dreams.

I have to sleep face down in order to not get sleep paralysis.

Today I have to sleep face up because if I don’t the air-conditioning will hit my sore Achilles’ heel. It’s always been like that, but this time I decide if I want to perform well tomorrow I need rest.

I look at the clock. My neck is fine enough. It’s midnight.

I forgot to lock the door.

I don’t even try to move in my paralysis anymore. It’s hopeless. Instead I lay there and enjoy the ride, trying to remember song lyrics from old shows that I have to rehearse with no-name dancers tomorrow.



*Edges of light echo across the caverns*

*A man walks into a tavern*

*Everything, one to another*

*Can we ever forgive the Mother?*



Each and every ending of each line in the chorus is drawn out. 

Someone open3s the door. Someone comes in.



*Our soulless creator*

*Forgotten, abandoned*

*We’ve all been a baker*

*We’ve been everything's maker (oooh, yeeeah. . .)*



The only source of light is the city lights. The curtains are closed\*,\* anyway. I can’t see the figure’s face other than an earring in the shape of a star that is hooked around her ear.

She says, “Tomorrow.”

I try to follow along in my lyrics. I try to think about the movie they want to make about me, and how my songs have supposedly redefined the next generation of philosophy and metaphysics.

She says, “You will not win.”

Shut up.

She says, “Did those tomatoes taste good?”

I stop. You got that from an interview, I say.

She says, “How does it feel?”

I say, what’s ‘it’?

“Stop lying.”

No, seriously. What?

“The tribe. Our tribes.”

Can you please leave?

“Your mom used to be an archaelogist.”

No. She was a historian.

“Yes, but she was also a housewife.”

I say, every mom is a housewife.

“Yes, but yours took the children to school.” She clears her throat. “The schoolhouse, I mean.”

I say, You got that from an interview. What did my dad used to do?

“Your dad used to hunt.”

Mine didn’t. Couldn’t. Not possible.

“Your dad also used to fight the Union. The Jewish. The Americans.”

Please leave. You’re scaring me.

“My dad fought the Confederates. The Nazis. The Vietnamese.”

She says, “He also fought the people in rock makeup. He killed bison and made us rich.”

She says, “Your dad signed false treaties and unknowingly gave the land over to the Americans, causing land disruptions.”

She leans forward. I will win.

“It was very hard to catch you. You used to be a good thief. But God condemns burglary.

“He condemns everything you do.”

I lick my lips and watch her as her blue eyes sparkle in the vague moonlight.

“Same job. Different day. I have to shred my guitar and hit the high notes on the microphone to incapacitate you instead of using a good arrow shot.”

She picks up my right foot. I have to hold in a screech as the air-conditioning blows against it.

“Have a good day,” she says. She walks away. I’m even more motivated. I will study  harder.



*I went around here and there*

*Going, chopping, killing bear*

*I came up from the rags*



I stop. I can’t go on any longer.

Instead, I dig into my pillow and tears flow from my eyes. I take a good hard whiff at the pillow.

For context, we haven’t been dating for too long (roughly 3 months) and we’re both somewhat closeted lesbians (out to friends, not out to family) who live with our families in a smallish town. We hang out often but I feel like nothing we’ve done that exactly constitutes as a date and I’d really like to change that but there are some issues with planning something that I don’t really know what to do about.

The first is that there’s a severe lack of options in our town. I mentioned it already but it is relatively small so there really isn’t much to do that isn’t walking around our town, looking in shops and maybe getting something to eat. There are some activities that could be done like the cinema or bowling but that’s it. I’d like to bring her out of town to do things at some point too of course but for a first date I think something close to home could be better? I’m not sure.

The second, which is a little embarrassing for me, is that i’m kind of broke. I’m unemployed (i’m working on it) and while I do try to save up money to do nice things for her it really does limit the options I have.

The third, and most pressing for me, is that I don’t think she’d like most typical dates. Before we started dating, she told me about how she hated a date she went on with a guy that involved getting coffee and walking so I’d assume she wouldn’t like anything like that with me. She can be very picky with food so dinner is somewhat hit or miss, i’d like to try bring her on a dinner date I’m just nervous that she’d hate that. I feel like seeing a movie isn’t a good first date in general. When talking to a friend, he recommended that I do something that links to her more niche interests when the time comes along but right now, there’s nothing going on that I can do relating to them. I could just ask her what she’d want to do on a date but I feel like asking instead of just planning something feels far less romantic.

I wouldn’t mind so much if it was a group date because then I would invite mine too but the other day she asked if I wanted to go out for breakfast which I agreed to, then tried to change the location so it was in the same complex as where her partner works. She said she “felt bad he couldn’t come”. He was at work! It’s getting super strange. I appreciate that people want to be around their partners to do things, obviously! But the issue is, if you’re going on a “girls date” with your girlfriends why does he need to come? It’s happened a few times on girl dates where a few of us were going out and she brought him or he would just show up where we are sometimes. It was 4 girls and then her partner. It’s becoming very co-dependent where she won’t really do things without him, has to be home at 5 for when he comes home from work and won’t do things without “checking” that her partner is free before confirming plans. It’s getting very odd. We like him, so he isn’t the issue. He’s a nice enough guy and my hubby gets along with him well. I just don’t understand why she needs to do EVERYTHING with him. It’s just become an expectation that if we invite her, he will be coming so she has been getting left out of a few plans which I feel wrong about. Some of the girls organise trips and leave her out because they know he’ll be invited too. I feel bad for her but I also don’t know if she is aware that she does it. From an outside perspective, when it comes to co-dependency, is there anything a friend can do? Or is it just a deal with it type of thing until she realises?

And because of that I want a better quality earbud than some JBL vibe 2's that I have laying around, a pair of earbuds which have recently decided to shit the bed and not connect to anything anymore. So now I'm in the market for a new pair of earbuds. I have a few options that I'm looking into right now.

  
One: Buy a new pair of JBLs

  
The cheapest option and one that will be the easiest. Their audio quality is quite good, and they cheaply fulfill the purpose I want them for. But at the same time I want a pair that sound better and last longer than 6\~ or so months before they disintegrate into dust.

  
Two: Get something better

  
I'm kind of looking into this right now because I want to branch out and try something new, and also becuase I want to see the potential of earbuds for this very niche purpose. I was specifically looking into buying some Status ANC or Pro X's since I've been seeing all the hullabaloo about them online, but from a cursory glance at reddit and other forums it appears they (obviously) aren't all they're cracked up to be and just another Instagram slop product like raycons. (Though I have had good experiences with Raycon in the past).

  
I've also been looking around online at some Sony or Bose earbuds to buy, but checking a few reviews here they don't seem to be worth their price point either. 

  
So I need to ask, should I just get another pair of JBL earbuds, or should I invest in something of higher quality? And if I should invest in something better, what should I invest in?",1,1767658028.0,Earbuds,1,1.0,False
1q52s36,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1q52s36/waves_of_emotions/,Waves of Emotions,"Apologies for how long this is. I have been struggling and just needed a place to vent and get my emotions out in the open.  I have had other relationships that ended, but after a few weeks I start feeling better.  This one has just hit differently. We have been broken up for almost a year.

Ex and I had only been seeing each other for 6 months.  I (M34) lived in our hometown and she (F33) lives an hour away. She initiated, through friends, and we started to see each other when she would come home.  I knew her a little when we were younger, but not well. What I expected to be just getting to know someone, turned into being with someone that genuinely seemed interested in me for me. Not what I could do or offer. I felt safe, seen, and that it was not conditional.

It started out being casual, but felt like much more. We could talk for hours and laugh. It felt natural and right.  Overtime, I was invited to meet friends and go to family functions. I could really see a future with her. The time between seeing each other was hard, but better for me. I tend to place people on pedestals and the space allowed me to collect my thoughts.  I wanted to drive over and see her many times, even for 5 minutes, but didn’t (I regret it now). She was working on her masters, coaching, and working. I was afraid to take away from things that were important to her, or make her feel obligated to change her plans. It was early I. The relationship and I didn’t want to be “pushy” or “clingy”.

After four months, I asked what we were. She was hesitant to put a label on it with the distance (which I was ok with). A week later, she brought it up and was excited to give it a shot, even with the distance.  Over the next month, I sensed a bit of a shift. A little more distant, but I chalked it up to be being busy with everything. I reached out about taking a few nights a week to talk or FaceTimes. Even without the face to face, it was like a warm blanket to hear her voice and hear about her day.

After one of our calls, she anxiously said this wasn’t going to work unless she moved back or I moved there. I had already planned on driving over to see her before the call, thinking it would be for a fun hangout, but now a what happened conversation. On Saturday, we met, had an awkward lunch, and a deep conversation afterwards. I felt hurt after, but that we were in an ok place. I left with the feeling that she would still be in my life in some aspect. Having her has a close friend, not the outcome I was looking for, but an outcome that I could live with happily.

She was planning to start looking at moving back in 6 months. She told me this before the split. When she said about me moving to her town, I really considered it. Was looking at housing and was going to use that Saturday to see if she was just using the distance as an excuse or if she was being serious. Unfortunately, family circumstances made me feel like a horrible person if I were to leave.  I still don’t know.

I texted less but still reached out thinking we were on good terms. Little response. I gave it a few months and wished her luck on a project she had placed so much work into. Some response but very minor. End of summer, I reach out about doing coffee. Seemed receptive but changed plans.  Early this fall, I decided to try a dating app. First person to come up, is her. I spiraled. There was a finality that made me feel that I was not good enough for her.  Most of my life, I feel that I have only had conditional love, but she made me feel seen and heard. Someone who saw me for me and that I mattered.  How could something that felt so real to me just be tossed to the side like it did t matter?

Since the breakup, I have had waves of emotions.  Times where she is a distance thought and a light sting. Other times, she sets up camp in my mind and she is all I can think about.  The holidays have been harder. I reached out on New Year’s Day with no direction or agenda. Just to see if it would lead anywhere.  She told me what they did for Christmas. I told her that sounded like a great holiday and that I had thought of them (a close family member of hers had passed a few years ago on Christmas Day). She asked about my holidays. I responded and asked a her a question. No response back.  I know she was home for the holidays and wanted so bad to ask her to lunch or coffee. I decided beforehand, that I would not ask. If she wants to see me, she can ask.

I know there are other people out there and it is just about finding them. I have regrets of getting in my own way and thoughts I should have just drove to see her more whether she was busy or not. Was I being too nice?  I have a hard thinking she still doesn’t have some feelings for me.

I often think that I’m more in love of what could have been and not her. With her though, I believe it was real for me.  She is still living in the other town. I want her to be happy and walk the path that she wants. I just feel broken.",1,1767658011.0,heartbreak,0,0.99,False

So when I started thinking I might be seriously sick, my first reaction wasn't fear.


I was just... careful. Real careful when I asked them: ""What if I got cancer?""


Mom and Dad laughed it off. Said I was overthinking.


But then Dad got serious: ""If that happens? We'll figure it out. We'd sell everything if we had to.""


I stayed up all night thinking about it.


And then I made up my mind—I couldn't drag them down like that.


So I swallowed that whole bottle of sleeping pills.


But then I SAW them—laughing and talking in some fancy penthouse downtown.


That's when it hit me.


All these years I'd been forcing myself to be the ""good kid"" because of our ""hard times""?


Total lie.


Just some show they'd been putting on.


They weren't poor.


They were faking it.


And me?


I was dead. Actually dead.


---


During break, my nose started bleeding out of nowhere. Went through half a pack of tissues before it stopped.


My desk-mate Chloe looked at me, biting her lip. ""My neighbor's brother used to get nosebleeds like crazy... Ended up being leukemia or something. They tried everything, spent all their money, and he still—yeah. It sucked.""


I laughed and called her a jinx, but my stomach dropped.


I'd been exhausted lately. Couldn't even run in gym without gasping for air. And my knees had these random bruises that wouldn't go away.


I kept telling myself to stop freaking out, that I was just being paranoid.


But the fear kept growing. What if it was real?


I snuck off to the community clinic and got blood work done.


The doctor looked at the results and his face went serious. Said they couldn't rule out blood cancer. Told me to get to a real hospital ASAP for more tests.


My heart sank.


I grabbed that piece of paper and stumbled out. Don't even remember how I got home.


Mom was in the kitchen wearing her faded apron, and when she heard me come in, she called out: ""Go wash up! Made your favorite chicken soup today.""


I shoved the lab report deep into my backpack.


A while later, Dad came home too, looking exhausted. He took off that beat-up jacket with the frayed sleeves, tossed it on a chair, and let out this long breath.


Mom brought the food out. Stir-fried cabbage, chicken soup with barely any chicken, and a tiny plate of scrambled eggs—the only ""meat"" we had.


Dad ate fast, like he was starving.


Mom kept going on about how pork went up twenty cents again.


I picked at my rice, couldn't taste anything. The doctor's words kept playing in my head.


""Dad... Mom...""


I put down my spoon quietly.


They both looked up.


""What if I got really sick?"" I stared at the food, couldn't look at them. ""Like... cancer. What would we do?""


The table went silent.


Dad froze mid-bite. Mom's spoon clinked against her bowl.


""Stop it!"" Mom cut me off, face going tight. ""You're fourteen—quit saying stuff like that!""


""I'm just asking what if—""


My eyes started stinging but I kept going.


Dad put down his spoon and messed up my hair with his rough hand.


""Ava, stop it."" Dad's voice got hard. ""You're fourteen. Focus on school. If something like that happens—""


He stopped himself. ""We'll deal with it. I'll sell everything if I have to.""


""Right."" Mom cut in fast, voice tight. ""We'll figure it out. Now eat—it's getting cold.""


And that was it. Topic closed.


Dad went back to his food. Mom practically threw an egg on my plate. ""Eat.""


I listened to them. Then looked at their worn-out clothes and the sad little meal on the table.


""Sell everything...""


""Figure it out...""


I picked up my spoon and stared down at my bowl.


Tears hit the rice. I shoveled a huge bite into my mouth and swallowed it down with the tears.


Chapter 2


I've known we were broke since I was a kid.


The apartment was falling apart. Paint peeling off the walls in chunks. When it rained, water leaked into the corners and grew this nasty mold.


My closet? All hand-me-downs from Sienna. Sleeves worn shiny, colors washed out to nothing.


But Mom said they were still good, couldn't waste them.


She'd pat my head and sigh: ""You know how hard we work? Every day at that market, breaking our backs. Every dollar—"" She'd shake her head. ""You gotta do better than other kids. Be more responsible. You hear me?""


Dad would back her up, voice all serious: ""School's your job. Work hard. Don't let this be for nothing.""


I'd stare at my worn-out sleeve and nod.


What was I supposed to say?


That's how it was. We were barely getting by.


No allowance. When kids at school bought snacks or stickers or fancy pens, I just watched.


When they talked about getting pizza on the weekend or going to amusement parks, I had nothing to say. Just kept my head down and stayed quiet.


When I got hungry, I'd chug hot water. Made my stomach feel full and warm. Less empty.


If something hurt, I never said anything. Just dealt with it.


Last winter I coughed for a whole month. At night I'd cover my mouth so I wouldn't wake them up.


I coughed till my eyes watered. Still went to school the next day like nothing happened.


Dad and Mom always praised me: ""Our Ava's so good.""


Hearing that made me feel... I don't know. Weird.


I wanted to tell them stuff sometimes—


That my throat hurt.


That Sienna's old backpack was falling apart, the strap barely hanging on.


That I wanted a little birthday cake. Just once.


But I was scared.


Scared that if I asked for money, they'd work even harder.


Scared of seeing them look stressed.


Scared of hearing them sigh.


Scared my tiny wish would be the thing that broke them.


At night I'd lie there, couldn't sleep.


The doctor's face wouldn't leave me alone. And Mom and Dad's voices—""sell everything,"" ""we'll figure it out""—just looping in my brain.


Over and over and over.


By the time light started creeping through the window, I'd made up my mind.


If getting treatment meant destroying them—pushing them past broke, past exhausted—then I couldn't do it. I just couldn't.


I heard them moving around outside my door.


Mom cracked it open, whispered: ""Ava? We're heading out. Left food on the stove. Eat before school, okay?""


I mumbled ""okay"" into my pillow, kept my eyes squeezed shut. Couldn't look at her.


The door clicked closed. Their footsteps faded down the hall.


Then—nothing. Just silence and my heartbeat pounding in my ears.


I sat up. My hands were shaking.


Grabbed paper and a pen from my bag. Tried to write steady, tried to make the letters look normal. Like I wasn't falling apart.


Folded it up when I was done. Tucked it under my pillow.


Then I crawled over to that old cabinet and dropped to my knees. Yanked the bottom drawer open. Started digging through all the crap in there—old batteries, tangled cords, random junk.


Took forever, but I finally found it. Way in the back. That yellowed pill bottle.


I remembered when I was little—maybe six or seven—watching Mom take one of these when she couldn't sleep. She caught me staring and her face went dead serious.


""Ava."" She crouched down, held the bottle up so I could see. ""Don't ever touch this. You understand me? If you take these, you won't wake up. You'll leave me and Dad forever.""


The way she said it—I never forgot.


Now I was older. I knew what ""leave forever"" meant.


Dead.


If I died, they'd be free.


I got a glass of water from the kitchen, then came back and sat on the bed.


Twisted the cap off. Poured all the little white pills into my hand.


I stared at them.


Suddenly, mom and Dad's smiling faces flashed in my head.


My nose stung. Tears splashed onto my hands.


I got scared for a second. Didn't want to go.


But their smiles faded fast, turned into their tired, worn-out faces.


I closed my eyes and told myself—I can't be selfish.


Leaving is the last responsible thing I can do for them.


I took a deep breath, shoved all the pills in my mouth, and washed them down with the water.


It tasted bitter. Then nothing.


I put the empty bottle by my pillow, lay down, and pulled the blanket up.


That heavy feeling in my chest just... disappeared.


Outside, the light got brighter. Birds started chirping.


I closed my eyes. So tired. Just wanted to sleep.


Chapter 3


After a while, I kind of ""woke up"" again. My body felt light, like I was floating.


Looked down—another me was still lying there on the bed, face calm like I was just asleep.


So... I'm dead now?


But what happens next? I had no idea.


Then I thought of Sienna.


Last time I saw her was Christmas. She stayed three days and bolted.


Yesterday I called her, barely got a few words out before I heard chaos on her end. She hung up before I could finish.


Before I left for good, I wanted to see her one more time.


The second I thought it, everything flashed—and I was standing outside this bright coffee shop.


Through the window, I saw Sienna laughing with friends. She wore this pretty floral dress, hair done perfect, fancy cake in front of her.


My eyes landed on the designer bag next to her.


I'd seen that brand at the mall. Even counted the zeros on the price tag.


But how could Sienna have that?


I floated closer to look—then her phone rang and I jumped.


She moved to a quiet corner and I followed.


""Mom?"" Sienna's voice was light, distracted. ""What's up? Why're you calling?""


Mom didn't waste time: ""Your sister contact you? She's been weird lately.""


""Oh. Yeah, yesterday."" Sienna sounded totally bored. ""Tried to hit me up for a hundred bucks. Said she needed study guides or something.""


""Study guides?"" Mom's tone spiked. ""Since when? Why wouldn't she just ask us? That kid—what's she planning?""


I looked down. That familiar sting in my chest.


Truth was, I couldn't scrape together enough money for the hospital. So I lied.


""Chill, I didn't give her anything."" Sienna's voice had this smug edge. ""Acted like I was swamped, hung up quick. Let her come to you guys.""


""Good."" Mom's voice went sharp. ""Don't ever slip her money behind my back, you hear me? I find out, your allowance is done. And another thing—you're working now. Time to stand on your own two feet.""


""Mom—"" Sienna dragged it out, whiny. ""I'm not giving her anything, okay? My paycheck barely covers rent. You want me to survive or not?""


""Alright, alright."" Mom backed off, voice softening. ""Just watch yourself around her. She's smart. If she catches on, we're done.""


""I know! God. Thanks, Mom.""


Sienna hung up grinning and went back to her friends, already talking about some concert this weekend.


My head was spinning. They were definitely hiding something.


Then everything flashed again.


I was in this huge living room. Bright as hell. Shiny floors reflecting a crystal chandelier. Floor-to-ceiling windows showing off the whole city.


Where was this? How'd I get here?


I looked around, confused—then saw a woman lying in a massage chair, messing with the latest foldable phone.


A man walked over with two glasses of fresh juice, wearing comfy house clothes.


I stared at their faces and my brain exploded—that's MY parents.


Shouldn't they be at the market right now, working non-stop?


""Sienna."" Mom dropped onto the couch, already looking exhausted. ""We spoiled her so bad. Gave her every damn thing she asked for and now? Useless. Completely useless.""


Dad handed her the juice. ""She'll figure it out.""


""Will she?"" Mom shot him a look. ""And now Ava's pulling this crap too. Called Sienna asking for money—study guides, supposedly. Didn't even ask us. You know what that means.""


""Maybe she really needed something."" Dad sat down next to her, voice even. ""Ava's usually pretty solid. So she stretched the truth a little—kids do that. We're keeping an eye on her. She's not gonna go off the rails.""


""Yeah, well."" Mom leaned back, eyes closed. ""I'm so sick of this. Playing broke, living in that shithole apartment—it's killing me.""


""I know."" Dad started rubbing her shoulders. ""But it's for Ava, right? Once she's in a good school, we sit her down and tell her everything. She'll get it.""


""She better."" Mom's voice got tight. ""If she doesn't appreciate what we're putting ourselves through...""


""She will."" Dad squeezed her shoulder. ""Come on. Let me make you something good tonight. Whatever you want.""


Then they both smiled.


The words drilled into my ears but felt so wrong. Took forever to sink in.


And then it clicked.


They were faking it. The whole broke thing—fake.


And me? I was dead. Actually dead.

My husband (m42) and I (f38) have been together for 3.5 years, united in a ceremony for 1.5. We have a 1yo together and he has 3 children ranging in ages 6-12. Generally when I speak about the four children I call them all ""my""  children.

 His brother (m50ish) will just be known as ""B"" .  B's wife (f 51ish) will be called ""I"". I's little brother (m32ish) will be ""A"" and his wife (f28ish) will be ""K"".   

These 4 people are very close. They all go to the same Pentecostal church together. All of their extra activities seem to revolve around the church, and I have often felt alienated because I'm not part of the ""cool kids""  club, because I don't share the same beliefs. I do take it personally, but my husband and kids get shafted as well. I have tried asking the sisters-in-law to grab coffee, to come over, etc. We have invited them to various kids' events events like recitals, plays, games, matches, and birthdays. They have come to a handful of things, whereas we have come to almost everything they've invited us to. I even attended a kids' birthday party while actively having a miscarriage. More recently my mother-in-law came to town and we made specific plans. With only a few days notice, my sister-in-law "" I"" decided to have a surprise party for my brother-in-law B. We rearranged everything so we could go. Then we found out that one of the nieces was doing a solo at church that Sunday so rearranged things further. Our son ended up very sick so we couldn't go to the solo, but we tried. But our 6 year old's birthday party was this past Saturday and none of them bothered to even RSVP despite a second reminder to them.
The only thing we have declined to participate in is a yearly trip they take to a water park that costs hundreds of dollars per person, and we would not be allowed to sleep in the same room because we are not legally married. We decline to go to this because we are paycheck to paycheck family and we feel that they do not respect the seriousness and reverence of our union. 
When my husband and I got married we decided not to do a legal union but opted for a handfasting ceremony instead. I had on the invitations that it was a handfasting ceremony, and ""I"" ask me several times to explain to her what the ceremony would look like, and I obliged. 
For those of you who don't know, a modern day hand fasting ceremony can take several different shapes. Ours was fairly simple. I had my husband's two sons escort me down the aisle. I said a little something to the guests. We said something to each other. Then we called the kids up and each said something to them. Then we and the kids stood in a circle and put our hands in and then a friend of the family wrapped a cord of rope around our hands to signify that we and the children were bound to each other forever. 
""A"" and ""B"" were to be groomsmen, sign B as the best man. Ten days prior to the ceremony, A and B called my husband to say thay they wouldn't be able to stand to support him, that their religious convictions would not allow it. Understandably, my husband was very hurt and very angry.  B is his brother, and he grew up with A and calls him a brother. 
This, of course, put me in a tough spot as well. Yes, I was hurt by what they were doing to my husband and myself. We also were left to make a very quick decision. My husband had to decide if he wanted to try to find two new groomsmen or just stay with his one, his cousin, realizing whom he can really count on. He chose to stay with the one.

I will admit that my desperation to have a relationship with these people is perhaps unhealthy, and I am working on it in therapy. But I don't think that the simple desire to have a relationship with them is out of line. Up until now I have pretty much held my tongue in regards to them shutting us out. 
Today I asked my husband he agreed for me to create a group text and send them this:

First, I want to start off by saying that we love y’all no matter what. But more importantly, our kids love you, and they notice when you’re not around. So I think that it is of vital importance that the six of us adults get together and hash it all out. Daniel and I talk about this at least 3 times a month, and he is terrified that if I say anything, he’s going to lose whatever semblance of a relationship he still has with you all. I hope and believe that we can be adults/ family who want to mend things; I know we do. I know y’all are busy with the move, but this needs to be fixed now before the chasm between us is too large to cross. I will leave the ball in your court. Please give us some dates when y’all can meet up. We will host or come to you. If you need to know our schedules, please let me know.

I’ve been in a couple so called talking stages but I wouldn’t count those because I never had full interest in those girls. Some background on the type of person I am, i’m a very old-fashioned like romantic type of person, I want to do everything right, I wanna like make sure she’s treated like she should be. 

Over the past year I met this girl in my school and we’ve gotten quite close. She’s literally everything I could’ve ever looked for in a girl. She’s really caring. She’s kind she has just a pure heart pure soul. She always makes me smile. She’s always smiling. She’s always laughing whenever we’re together and that just makes me so happy. We had a class together this year and another class we share in common. Whenever we have tests, we go to the library nearby and study and sometimes just like talk and have fun you know just play around but it’s usually not just us one of our other friends. She’s in the class we have together and she comes to the library. There’s only been like a couple times where it was just me and this girl but everyone who sees together always asked me if there’s something going on. 

We’ve had several interactions outside of school too. I dropped her off from a party one time and  and I also went out to lunch with her after school with another guy and another girl and we’ve also been trying to plan this trip to Chicago with like a couple other friends too and she always seems very interested. 

She was recently talking to another guy the past month or two and they things during winter break and now I feel like this is my chance to make a move because our class that we had together is only one semester class and after this week, we won’t have a class together. 

She’s also so many signs that she’s into me even while she was talking to the other guy. And I was talking to one of my friends today, and he literally was telling me that he could tell she likes me because of the way she came up to me and she looked at me today, which was the first day back after winter break and I didn’t say anything to her during that moment and I am beating myself up for it. I just looked at her and looked away, even though she came up and she was right next to me. I don’t know. I was scared to say anything because I couldn’t think of anything to say right away but he was telling me that I should’ve said something because he could tell that she purposely came up to me because we were like a little separated from the rest of the group. 

I was thinking about asking her out just by saying if she’d be down to go grab a coffee sometime, but my friend also said that I could just ask her to go on like a little study not at the library because that’s where everyone goes but I like a coffee shop or something And that would be a less subtle way to do it but if I do that, I feel like the other girl in that class might like come to and like she wouldn’t take it like a full on like type of thing so I’m not sure please advise cause I wanna do it before this week ends.

She is a top executive with a very tight schedule, and we have been in an emotionally rich situationship for the past three months. She leans more avoidant than I do, but we are both trying to make the relationship as secure as possible. After one month of dating, she confessed she had fallen in love, only to deactivate for seven days immediately afterward. In late November, she deactivated again for another week. Upon her return, she told me she felt I lacked the initiative to take the lead.

In response, I made six different invitations during the latter half of December; she accepted three, and we had a lovely time together. Since November, she has not deactivated again. Instead, she communicates her needs more clearly, saying things like, ""For the next couple of days, I want to focus on my teenagers,"" or ""I’ll be busy working this weekend."" This transparency allows me to focus on my own life and give her the space she needs.

We maintain consistent messaging, and she usually calls me two or three times a week for over an hour each time. However, last week she mentioned feeling guilty and ""in great debt"" to me because of my frequent invitations, as she feels she cannot offer the same amount of time in return. I reassured her that there was no debt and that I simply enjoy her presence, but I still worry this feeling of obligation occasionally triggers her avoidance.

I am now wondering how to reintroduce invitations. Should I start with something small, like a coffee date? Last Friday, we had a great 90-minute call, though I perceived her avoidance increasing toward the end, so I didn't contact her again until last night.

We broke up last year, at the beginning of January. The breakup was sudden and honestly badly handled on my side. Throughout our relationship, I had complicated feelings about commitment. Early on, I wanted an open relationship. She didn’t. I eventually agreed to be exclusive, and overall the relationship was good, but over time I kept thinking about other people. That feeling never fully went away. On her side she clearly was quite anxious about being cheated upon since she had an history with that so  I had to give her a lot of reassurance about the relationship, and herself in general.

Shortly before everything ended, I brought up the idea of an open relationship again because I was basically thinking a lot about other women. She agreed, but clearly not enthusiastically. Around that time, I was emotionally confused and got closer to a friend from my social circle. One evening, I crossed a line and kissed that friend. The next day, I told my ex on the phone, and we broke up very abruptly.

We then met to talk a week after that. It was extremely emotional. I cried a lot. There were still strong feelings on both sides, and nothing felt fully closed. We even said we didn’t really know whether we would see each other again someday or not.

She told me clearly that if we were ever to talk again, it would be up to her to reach out. Because of that, I didn’t contact her for months. I was in pretty bad shape, full of guilt and shame, but I tried to respect what she asked. 

Around June, I reached out once. She didn’t answer for weeks, then eventually replied with a very clear message saying she had been deeply hurt and angry, and that she didn’t want to talk or meet anymore. She said she preferred to keep me as a memory and move on.

I didn’t contact her again after that. But emotionally, I never really moved on. I still feel like I have feelings for her, and above all I carry a lot of guilt.

I’m now in a relationship with the person I kissed. It’s actually going well and she’s really kind and supportive (she’s great). We talk a lot about all of this, but it’s not easy. When the guilt and sadness about my ex come back, I tend to withdraw emotionally, and that can hurt my current partner. So I often feel guilty on both sides.

In late autumn, I sent my ex a very light message suggesting a coffee to discuss, without pushing. She didn’t reply. Some days after that, I ran into her unexpectedly in public. She was with a guy she’s seeing now. The encounter was extremely awkward and we both froze and had a very short and weird conversation. Just after that, she replied to my previous message and said that maybe getting a coffee could be okay.

Since then, my mind has been looping. I replay everything, overthink the encounter, and fantasize about the coffee. Part of me wonders what would happen if I told her I still have feelings, and another part of me is terrified of hurting her again or crossing a boundary she tried to set, as well as hurting my current girlfriend.

I’m genuinely glad she’s able to move on and meet people. I don’t want to hold her back. I just feel very sad, very guilty, and stuck. I have been going to the therapist and it helped but only up to a certain point because I keep thinking about the whole thing constantly although it’s almost been a year and often feel quite depressed.

I’m not looking for validation. I’m just looking for perspective. If you’ve been in a similar situation, what helped you?

My meal today was 2 lattes (home made with protein milk). My lattes are a requirement and do take up 220 calories each day but I cannot live without them. Sometimes I do just coffee with a tiny bit of milk on work days so reduces to 190 calories or so. Lunch was a salad with chicken, a cookie (my fun item that's 120 calories and I only have once every now and then, otherwise normally would be more vegetables but I'm getting rid of Christmas junk), blueberries (1/2 cup), and a bison jerky stick. dinner is a Taylor farms salad (half) and 4 chicken fingers. 

I'm only at 48g of protein! And already at my calorie max (1692 so over). No where near my iron requirement. My carb is maxed out and most days I'm massively under my carb because I don't have the cookie or breaded chicken. 

Even yesterday when I had an ahi tuna bowl for dinner with veggies (no rice), and for lunch egg bacon sandwich on sourdough bread I still was good for protein but no where near iron.

He’s not a loud man. He doesn’t need to be. He has that stillness that career officers get when they’ve made enough decisions that changed lives—when their spine has learned to stay straight under the weight.

He stares at the map like it’s a confession.

To his right sits Scarlett, hair tied back, eyes sharp as broken glass—already on her second read of a printed dossier even though it just came off the secure line five minutes ago. She has a pencil tucked behind one ear and doesn’t look like she’s slept since yesterday.

To Hawk’s left, Duke is standing, arms crossed, jaw clenched—every inch the First Sergeant who knows that the clock is always running and someone out there is already bleeding, whether you have confirmation or not.

And near the edge of the room—half in shadow, half in fluorescent wash—Breaker works a console, cigarette unlit between his fingers like a prop he forgot he was holding. His headset is cocked slightly, listening to something nobody else can hear.

The screen shifts. Aerial imagery slides into focus.

A forest reserve. Or what used to be.

Now it’s a burn scar—a blackened wound carved into green country. Trees reduced to skeletal spears. Ash drifted into pale dunes along the ridgelines. The pattern of destruction isn’t random. It curves. It bends. It repeats.

It looks… deliberate.

Hawk finally spoke.

“Walk me through it again.”

A young intelligence lieutenant clears his throat.

“Satellite pass from three hours ago, sir. Thermal bloom started here—” he taps a point on the map “—then jumped in a staggered line. Spot fires. Controlled ignition. Like someone was drawing.”

Scarlett’s pencil pauses.

Hawk doesn’t blink. “Like someone was writing.”

The lieutenant nods. Swallows. “Yes, sir.”

Duke leans in. “Any confirmed enemy presence?”

“Local sheriff reported—” the lieutenant checks his notes, “—motorcycles. Loud. Modified exhaust. People wearing spikes and animal pelts. One witness claims chainsaws. Another claims flamethrowers.”

Breaker mutters without looking up. “So… the subtle kind.”

Nobody laughs. Not really.

Scarlett turns a page in her dossier. “That description matches Dreadnok signatures in three previous incidents. Two were later connected to Cobra logistics disruptions. One was never officially attributed.”

Hawk’s eyes narrow. “Why would they torch a reserve?”

Scarlett doesn’t answer immediately. She taps the paper with the pencil, thinking.

Breaker does. “Because it scares people. Because it makes the news if they want it to. Because it makes the wrong people move.”

Duke shifts his weight. “Or because they’re trying to flush someone out.”

That lands in the room like a dropped tool.

The screen changes again—zooming closer. The blackened earth forms arcs and angles. Not clean like a geometric diagram. Not sloppy like an accident.

It resembles a crude emblem.

Or a message.

Scarlett’s voice is quiet. “This isn’t arson for profit. It’s communication. It’s a signal.”

Hawk’s jaw tightens. “To who?”

Scarlett’s eyes lift from the dossier. “To us.”

There's a long pause before Hawk reaches under the table and pulls up a heavy folder—thick, classified, the kind of file that has ruined careers and saved lives.
Stamped across the front in faded red: DREADNOKS — THREAT ASSESSMENT

He doesn’t open it right away. He lets it sit there like a loaded weapon.

Duke’s voice is steady. “We can deploy a strike element. Hit their bikes, hit their fuel, box them in.”

Scarlett shakes her head slightly. “If we go loud, they scatter. Torch burns everything behind them. Zartan disappears into the civilian stream and we’re chasing ghosts.”

Breaker exhales through his nose. “If it IS Zartan.”

Scarlett flips her folder open and slides a photo across the table—grainy surveillance: a man’s face partially obscured, eyes cold, smile wrong. Not a mugshot so much as a threat captured accidentally.

She taps it. “When it looks like theater, it’s usually him.”

Hawk finally opens his own file. Pages of reports. Patterns. Psychological notes. After-action summaries full of redacted lines.

His finger lands on a paragraph and stays there.

“We’re not sending a hammer into a smoke cloud,” he says. “We need an assessment team first.”

Duke’s expression hardens. “Assessment teams get ambushed.”

Hawk meets his eyes. “So do hammers.”

A beat. The room hums.

Scarlett slides another folder forward—smaller, slimmer, but somehow heavier in implication.

Stamped in black: SPECIALIST REQUISITION — TRACKING / COUNTER-TRACKING

Duke glances at it and already knows. His mouth tightens like he tasted something bitter.

Hawk nods once. “Spirit.”

Breaker finally looks up from his console. “You’re calling Charlie in for a burn scar.”

Scarlett answers, calm. “We’re calling him in because the land is talking and we need someone who speaks its language.”

Duke doesn’t argue yet. He’s thinking.

Hawk flips through a page in Spirit’s file—notes that don’t read like normal military paperwork. They read like someone trying to translate a man into bureaucracy and failing.

He reads aloud, voice clipped:

PSYCH EVAL (SUMMARY):
Subject demonstrates unusually high emotional regulation under combat stress. Integrates spiritual practice as a stability mechanism. Exhibits ethical boundaries not easily overridden by command pressure. Low susceptibility to intimidation, coercion, or ego manipulation.
Risk: Subject may resist orders that conflict with internal moral code.
Mitigation: Clear mission intent; avoid ambiguous directives.

Duke lets out a breath. “That’s a polite way of saying he won’t do something stupid just because we tell him to.”

Scarlett’s mouth twitches—almost a smile. “That’s exactly what it says.”

Hawk closes the file. “We’re not asking Spirit to do something stupid.”

Breaker’s eyes flick to the burn scar image again. “Then what are we asking him to do?”

Hawk’s voice is low. “Tell us what the Dreadnoks are doing before we walk into it.”

Scarlett begins listing, like she’s reading a grocery order, but each name adds weight.

“Expected actors if this is a standard Dreadnok package:

Torch: incendiary capability. He’ll erase trails, deny terrain, burn civilians out.

Buzzer: intimidation and panic insertion. Loud. Unstable.

Ripper: brute force. Demolitions. Follows whoever looks strongest.

Monkeywrench: mechanical sustainment, sabotage, traps.

Zartan: if present, he’s the brain. Disguise. Misdirection. Psychological games.”

Duke’s voice is sharp. “If Zartan’s there, then we don’t have a Dreadnok problem. We have a containment problem.”

Scarlett nods. “Correct.”

Hawk gestures to the map. “Terrain?”

A technician steps up. “National forest boundary, sir. Mixed pine and chaparral, ridge lines, dry creek beds. Wind patterns unpredictable. Fire behavior is the real enemy. The burn scar forms an access corridor toward—” he highlights a section “—this zone.”

Scarlett leans closer. “What’s there?”

The tech hesitates. “Unregistered structures, maybe. Old cabins. A few… unofficial camps. Rangers call them squatters.”

Duke’s eyes narrow. “Refugees? Drifters? Off-grid types?”

Breaker’s voice comes in through his headset as he listens to a fresh intercept. “We’ve got chatter on civilian bands. People talking about ‘the biker monsters’ and ‘the sky turning black.’ They think it’s the end of the world.”

Scarlett’s gaze hardens. “Which means the Dreadnoks are winning already.”

Hawk taps the map again. “Mission goals.”

Scarlett answers without hesitation, ""I've identified four. One, confirm presence of Dreadnoks and identify leadership. If Zartan IS involved the stakes are raised exponentially. Two, determine intent—why this area, why now, why this pattern. Three, locate any civilians being flushed, trapped, or used as leverage, and four, prevent expansion of burn corridor toward population centers.""

Duke adds, voice flat: “And if Torch is out there with fuel?”

Hawk’s eyes don’t leave the burn scar. “Then we stop him before the forest becomes a signal flare for something bigger.”

Breaker raises an eyebrow. “Something bigger like… Cobra showing up to collect whatever the Dreadnoks dug out?”

Scarlett: “Or hiding.”

The room goes quiet again.

Hawk turns to Duke. “Team composition. Options.”

Duke’s brain is already running down lists like he’s checking rifles.

“Spirit as lead tracker. He needs a small support element—quiet, disciplined, no ego.”

Scarlett adds, “Low-Light for overwatch. Night movement. Silent coverage.”

Breaker, deadpan: “And someone who can keep comms intact if Monkeywrench starts jamming or cutting lines.”

Hawk looks at Breaker. “You volunteering?”

Breaker shrugs like it costs him nothing. “I’m always volunteering. You just keep ignoring it.”

Duke ignores the humor and continues. “We’ll want someone who can handle civilians—Doc or Scarlett.”

Scarlett doesn’t blink. “I’ll go if you want negotiation and intel extraction. Doc if you expect triage.”

Hawk’s eyes flick to the casualty statistics in the file. Then back to the map.

“Doc stays on standby,” he decides. “Scarlett, you coordinate intel and civ handling with Breaker here from HQ unless things go sideways.”

Scarlett’s jaw tightens just slightly—she hates being sidelined—but she nods. “Understood.”

Duke looks at Hawk. “We’ll need a hard edge in case they force contact. Beach Head is too loud. Roadblock is too visible.”

Hawk considered that, then nodded. “Lady Jaye?”

Scarlett glances up. “If Zartan’s in play, I want Lady Jaye available. She knows deception tactics, can recognize pattern behavior. She’s also one of the few who can spot when a ‘civilian’ isn’t.”

Hawk nods once. “Put her on the short list.”

He looks around the table, the faces, the fatigue. Then he points at the burn scar again, like he’s pointing at a wound on the earth.

“This is not a raid,” he says. “This is an investigation with teeth. We go in quiet. We come out with answers.”

Duke’s voice drops. “And if it’s not just Dreadnoks?”

Scarlett’s eyes are cold. “Then it’s a trap.”

Breaker finally lights his cigarette—against regulations, against common sense, but nobody stops him.

He exhales smoke into the recycled air and says, almost softly:

“Either way, Charlie’s gonna feel it first.”

Hawk reaches for the phone—secure line, direct.

“Get Spirit,” he orders.

Then, as an afterthought—because he’s Hawk, and Hawk always thinks three moves ahead—he adds:

“And pull every report we have on burn patterns tied to Zartan. I want psych to flag any symbolic signatures.”

Scarlett’s pencil starts moving again. Fast.

Duke stares at the screen a long moment, then murmurs like a prayer he doesn’t believe in:

“Let’s hope the land tells him the truth.”

Hawk’s eyes stay on the blackened forest.

“It will,” he says.

And for the first time since the briefing began, his voice carries something like anger.

“Because it has no reason to lie.”",3,1767657352.0,gijoe,0,1.0,False

**Background:**

Mom is now 96. My wife and I moved home from Europe about four years ago to take care of her. She has severe short term memory loss and needs a walker, but is in pretty good shape otherwise. Her doctors have her on vitamins and eye drops... that's it! 

**Day-To-Day:**

Mom sleeps upstairs and we made a bedroom in the basement. We have an alarm on her bedroom door so we get up when she gets up. Unfortunately, this can be as early as 6:30 AM or as late as 2:00 PM. We never know.

When we hear the alarm we rush upstairs and I help Mom take her morning vitamins and I put drops in her eyes. Then I make coffee and her English muffin. My wife cooks up some ham, a soft boiled egg, and frozen hashbrowns. This is the only thing Mom eats/wants for breakfast.

After breakfast, Mom goes to her computer. She will usually play for about an hour, then she wants me to help her into the rocking chair in her office. I get her a glass of water and a small snack.

Some days Mom will take a nap for an hour or two, but lately she eats her M&Ms and then wants help up from her rocking chair. She then sits at the kitchen table for about ten minutes. When I see her get up I help her back into her office chair where she plays another game on her computer.

This cycle repeats five or six times: office chair --> rocking chair --> kitchen chair --> office chair... until we are ready to eat dinner.

We eat dinner between 5:45 and 6:00 PM. Every meal includes multiple games of ""Are you Turk??? Who is SHE???"" We're pretty sure she knows the answers because she will then rattle off how many years we've been married, who our daughter is and where she lives, etc. Five minutes later: ""Are you Turk??? Who is SHE???"" and it starts all over again.  
  
After dinner we play 1 to 3 games of ""Marbles"" (it's played with dice and is similar to Aggravation). We never miss a night and she never wants to play anything else.  
  
When the game(s) are over I help Mom put on her Depends, get out of her bathrobe and slippers, and I tuck her in to bed.",3,1767657281.0,AgingParents,0,1.0,False

 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

1q52ebv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1q52ebv/former_hr_here_subtle_signs_your_company_is/,Former HR here - subtle signs your company is preparing for layoffs,"  


I’ve been through 3 rounds of layoffs (twice in HR, once when I was also laid off), and there’s a pattern that emerges before the axe falls. Not trying to create paranoia, but if you’re seeing multiple signs on this list, it might be time to update your resume.

This got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

Financial and strategic shifts:

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say “we’re being strategic about growth” out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for “we’re about to cut costs aggressively.” Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about “efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing” in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify “redundancies” and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or “efficiency studies,” that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to “make their mark” within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

Budget and resource signals:

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get “postponed” or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

Cultural and messaging changes:

The “we’re a family” messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

Real estate and facilities:

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

The ones people miss:

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

* Avoiding eye contact
* Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning
* Not fighting for resources they normally would
* Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

HR and administrative signals:

HR schedules random meetings with employees to “check in.” This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about “organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.” They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

Operational changes:

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

Financial desperation moves:

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.

IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

The “oh shit” tier:

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say “leadership sync” with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

The final 48 hours:

Executives all happen to be “in the office” on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a “quick sync” with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just “meeting.” That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.

WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN

Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

Financial preparation:

Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

Legal and administrative:

Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

Mental preparation:

This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

If/when it happens:

Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

Job search strategy:

Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT

Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

Support your laid-off colleagues. Write recommendations, make introductions, be a reference. What goes around comes around.",8,1767657089.0,careeradvice,12,0.58,False

Borderless, fast, and accessible.
Yet in 2025, paying for a simple coffee with crypto still feels harder than it should.
I’ve personally seen this problem many times. People stand at the counter, phones out, switching wallets, checking networks, waiting for confirmations. What should take seconds turns into awkward minutes. Sometimes, the payment fails entirely.
This isn’t a technology problem.
It’s a user experience problem.
Crypto has focused heavily on infrastructure: blockchains, bridges, stablecoins, scaling. But adoption doesn’t happen on whitepapers. It happens at coffee shops, restaurants, and daily life.
That’s where ROZO stands out.
ROZO doesn’t try to “educate” users into complexity. It removes complexity altogether. The flow feels natural, fast, and designed for real people not just crypto-native users.
The first time I tried ROZO, the difference was obvious. No confusion about networks. No friction. No stress at checkout. Just a smooth payment experience that finally feels ready for the real world.
What impressed me most is that ROZO is clearly built from observation, not theory. The team saw real users struggle, including experienced crypto builders, and decided that this problem was unacceptable.
If crypto wants mass adoption, payments must feel invisible.
They must feel as easy as cash or easier.
ROZO isn’t just another crypto app.
It’s a step toward making crypto usable where it actually matters: everyday life.
2026 is just getting started, and products like ROZO are how crypto finally leaves the old economy behind.",1,1767657039.0,u_Altruistic_Car_9574,0,1.0,False

We arrived here on 2 Jan and I had my last coffee in the airport that same day. We are staying in a vacation home but there isn’t any coffee in the kitchen. The island we are staying on is very remote and there aren’t really any coffee shops nearby and so I just decided I would go without the coffee. It’s been three days without it and I’ve already experienced mood swings, depression, fatigue, irritability and awful headaches. But my partner really wants me to use this opportunity to quit caffeine as I have tried so many times in the past but always end up going back to the bean juice. The only caffeine I have had so far is one cup of black tea yesterday and a Coca Cola today to try and ease the withdrawals. The only positive thing is my sleep has been AMAZING!! I’ve been going to sleep around 9am due to sheer exhaustion and have been averaging 9 hours of deeply restorative sleep each night. If I could go back in time I would have tapered off before vacation. Does anyone have any advice on how I can get through this vacation caffeine free? I am so tempted to just buy some coffee from the grocery store but to be honest this is probably a really good opportunity for me to quit since I don’t have to work.

1q524ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1q524ul/the_psychology_of_deleting_your_old_self/,The PSYCHOLOGY of Deleting Your Old Self: Science-Based Brain Rewiring for Abundance,"I used to wake up every morning feeling like I was stuck in some kind of loop. Same thoughts, same feelings, same shitty outcomes. Then I fell into this rabbit hole of neuroscience research, Joe Dispenza's work, and honestly it fucked with everything I thought I knew about change. Here's what actually works when you want to completely rewire yourself.

Most people think they're broken or lazy when they can't change. But here's the thing. Your brain literally gets addicted to your personality. Every thought you think releases chemicals, and your body becomes dependent on those chemicals the same way it would on any drug. So when you try to change, your brain throws a tantrum because it's going through withdrawal. This isn't woo woo stuff, it's basic neurochemistry. The good news is you can hack this system once you understand how it works.

**Your morning routine is programming your entire day.** Joe Dispenza talks about this constantly in his books and research. The first hour after you wake up is when your brain is most receptive to new patterns. Most people grab their phone immediately and start scrolling, which basically means you're letting random external stimuli program your mental state. Instead, spend 20 minutes doing what Dispenza calls mental rehearsal. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and visualize the person you want to become with extreme detail. Not what you want to have, but who you want to be. Feel the emotions of already being that person. Your brain doesn't know the difference between a vividly imagined experience and a real one, so you're literally creating new neural pathways before breakfast.

**Breaking the Addiction to Your Past Self** by Joe Dispenza is insanely good if you want to understand this deeper. Dispenza was a chiropractor who broke six vertebrae in a triathlon accident and healed himself through pure visualization and mental rehearsal. Now he's basically the go to guy for neuroplasticity and transformation research. The book breaks down exactly how your thoughts create your reality on a biological level. It's dense with neuroscience but he explains it in ways that actually make sense. This is the best book on personal transformation I've ever read because it gives you the actual mechanism, not just motivation.

The biggest mistake people make is trying to create a new future while still feeling emotions from their past. You can't become wealthy if you're constantly feeling poor. You can't attract healthy relationships if you're still operating from wounds. **Emotional regulation is the actual skill nobody teaches you.** Start tracking your emotional baseline throughout the day. When you notice yourself dropping into old patterns of anxiety, resentment, or scarcity, pause and ask what thought just triggered that feeling. Then consciously choose a different thought. Sounds simple but it takes serious practice because these patterns are deeply grooved into your neural networks.

The **Insight Timer app** has been a game changer for building a consistent meditation practice. It's got thousands of guided meditations including specific ones for rewiring limiting beliefs and attracting abundance. The free version is incredibly robust. I use it every morning for that mental rehearsal practice. What makes it different from other meditation apps is the variety, you're not locked into one teacher's style or philosophy. You can explore different techniques until you find what actually works for your brain.

For structured learning around personal transformation, **BeFreed** is a personalized audio learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google. It pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom podcasts based on what you want to work on. You tell it your goals or struggles, maybe improving emotional regulation or understanding neuroplasticity deeper, and it generates an adaptive learning plan tailored specifically to you.

What's useful is the depth control. Start with a 10 minute summary, and if it resonates, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive, you can pick everything from a smoky Samantha style voice to something more energetic when you need focus. It adapts as you learn and keeps everything in your Mindspace so insights don't get lost.

**Your environment is constantly signaling your brain about who you are.** If you wake up in the same bedroom, sit in the same chair, drive the same route, your brain automatically loads the same program. It's pattern recognition on autopilot. This is why people often experience major breakthroughs when they travel or move to a new place. You don't have to move across the country but you do need to disrupt patterns. Take a different route to work. Rearrange your furniture. Work from a coffee shop instead of your desk. These small environmental changes keep your brain in a more plastic, adaptable state.

The **Huberman Lab podcast** has some incredible episodes on neuroplasticity and behavior change that align with a lot of Dispenza's work but from a pure neuroscience angle. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist and he breaks down the actual protocols for rewiring your brain. His episode on dopamine and motivation completely changed how I approach goal setting. He explains why most people fail at change because they're getting dopamine hits from imagining success rather than from the work itself. Once you understand the dopamine system you can engineer your environment and habits to support actual transformation instead of just fantasizing about it.

**Gratitude isn't just some fluffy concept, it's a biological hack.** When you feel genuine gratitude, your brain releases serotonin and dopamine, the same chemicals as antidepressants. But more importantly, gratitude shifts you out of survival mode. Most people are operating from stress and fear all day which keeps you stuck in old patterns because your brain is just trying to keep you alive, not help you thrive. Spend five minutes every morning writing down things you're grateful for, but here's the key, actually feel it in your body. Don't just list things mechanically. Feel the warmth in your chest, the relaxation in your shoulders. That's when the neurochemical shift happens.

**Atomic Habits** by James Clear is essential reading for anyone trying to delete their old self. Clear breaks down the science of habit formation in ways that are immediately actionable. He talks about identity based habits, which connects perfectly to this idea of becoming a new person. Instead of saying ""I want to lose weight,"" you say ""I am someone who takes care of their body."" That subtle shift changes everything because you're operating from a new identity rather than trying to achieve a goal while still being your old self. The book is full of practical frameworks like habit stacking and the two minute rule that make it ridiculously easy to build new patterns.

The truth is, your old self isn't going to just disappear because you watched an inspiring video or read a book. It's going to fight like hell to stay alive because it's familiar and your brain prizes familiarity over everything else. You have to consciously and consistently choose to be someone different, especially when it feels uncomfortable or unnatural. That discomfort is actually proof that you're creating new neural pathways. Eventually the new you becomes the familiar you, and that's when everything in your external reality starts to shift. But it requires you showing up every single day and doing the mental work even when you don't feel like it, even when nothing seems to be changing yet.",1,1767656437.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1q523hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1q523hh/how_do_i_not_hate_my_mil/,How do I not hate my MIL?,"This is a serious question. My husband wants us to have a little bit more connection, although he's he is not trying to force a close friendship. In fact, he understands most of the issues and he's actually really good at telling her off when she needs it.

Currently when she is around I am gray rocking or on my phone, not paying her much attention.  

I will separate my complaints about her current actions versus how she raised my husband. 

My husband has forgiven her for how she raised him and he wants me to only judge her by how she currently acts. She has gotten a lot milder but it's really hard to ignore the past because her transgressions are completely inexcusable in my mind.

I have listed some of my most notable examples below and numbered them to make referencing them easier.

Current behavior issues from MIL:

1. The first time she came over to my house she walked through the place inspecting everything, pointing and saying ""eeeeewwwwww!"" anytime she found something that wasn't cleaned to her standards. The house really wasn't that bad, but regardless, this was very shortly after I had experienced the loss of a very close family member. It was difficult for me to breathe and eat, let alone clean the house and she knew about the loss. 

2. A few days after meeting MIL, we were taking a nature walk as a family and I pointed out some wild berries and she identified them incorrectly so I casually mentioned what they actually were in a non-corrective tone. I was just making conversation, and she got defensive and started arguing with me. Finally, when I wouldn't agree with her (I have a lot of botany knowledge and she knows this) she told me that the two different berry types are actually the same thing. That was the closest she could admit to being wrong. Obviously berries are not a big deal but the fact that she would rather make a dumb statement similar to ""blueberries and raspberries are the same thing"" versus letting me be right, was very concerning to me. 

3. Once MIL and I were sitting in the living room alone after husband left, and once he's gone she asks out of the blue if my husband plans on doing therapy because she says he is grumpy toward her. She then goes on a long rant about how she used to do therapy but it doesn't work on her because she is too intelligent and it was impossible for her to find a therapist who was smarter than her. I responded saying ""Well I am in therapy and I find it very helpful."" And she says ""ohhhh gooooood!""  She really emphasized how GOOD she thought it was that I was in therapy, right after implying that therapy doesn't work on smart people.

4. She stayed at our house for 3 weeks, a few months after we had our baby and she wouldn't make any of her own food. Even simple things like heating up a hot dog. But she would stand in the kitchen while I made food and look over my shoulder and tell me how to do it. She literally breathed down my neck while I was heating up a hot dog telling me when to turn it over in the frying pan and when it was ready. So is she is so helpless that she needs us to do everything for her? Or is she is so wise that we need her guidance on basic life tasks?

5. She brought her little dog over to our yard and let it poop everywhere and when I asked her to please pick up the poop she starts whining and asking if we have a bag. So she didn't come prepared and it seems she was planning to leave the poop there if I didn't say anything. When I handed her a bag she barely glanced at the ground and then claimed she couldn't find the poop anymore.  

6. We had only one rule about having her dog inside our house and that was that it did not go up on the couch. Well within 2 minutes the dog was on the couch and when we asked her to move it, she complained that the dog was too heavy. The dog is only 12 lbs and my mother-in-law is not disabled. 

7. When the dog jumps on us with her wet paws and we say something about it she just shrugs her shoulders and giggles and says ""can't help it!""

8. When I dress my daughter for going out she'll tell my daughter things like "" mommy didn't dress you warm enough! Come here and let Grandma fix it."" But then of course when we reach our destination, MIL complains how warm it is and takes off her layers. 

9. She stares at my body a lot and the only compliments she ever gives me are related to my body. She makes comments like no wonder my husband likes my butt, and I only lost the baby weight because I'm chasing a toddler. 

10. When I was pregnant she lived a different state and she kept asking for photos of my pregnant belly. When my husband explained that I'm not putting my body on display, she complained that she did not feel included if she couldn't see. So then she got sneaky about it, asking multiple times for a photo of us as a couple, saying she missed us, and emphasizing the picture should show our full bodies. We knew what she was up to so we said no and she pouted but eventually accepted it. Once after telling her my body was not on display to be gawked at or touched, she just said ""humph! Well I had to do it when I was pregnant!"" 

11. Before we changed our minds, we were thinking about buying a house with my mother-in-law. Thank goodness we didn't. But she kept acting like we were dummies who didn't know what we were doing and trying to control the whole process. Months before we were ready to start the process, she kept demanding to know how much money we had in savings. She set up an appointment with two different Realtors, planning on sending them to our house without asking us. She informed us after making the appointment and said she trusted us to pick between the two, but apparently she didn't trust us to pick our realtor without her narrowing it down first.

12. Anytime she would send me a house listing, if I had already seen it or if I was also interested in it, she suddenly lost interest. She would turn up her nose at every house showing we brought her to. 

13. When we finally told her we were going to do this on our own and bought our own house, she refused to come over and see it for the first month and then she complained about how small it was. (Probably because it is too small for her to move into)

How she raised my husband 

14.  After a string of abusive relationships she was single at 35 and wanted a child. So she used the turkey baster method with a sperm sample from a married friend and then lied to my husband throughout his entire childhood about who his dad was. 

15.  She lied to my husband throughout his entire childhood saying that they were Native American, saying they were specifically Shoshone and even actually raised him going to powwows and teaching him beading and drum making and taking him to vision quests. She finally admitted when he was in his late thirties that they were not native and a DNA test confirmed it. I can't believe the audacity to not only lie that they were native but to create an entire false reality around it and culturally appropriate to such a degree.

16.  Since my husband was  toddler she started making him do a lot of chores and eventually he did every chore in the house except for dishes, while she would sit around. She would inspect after he did his cleaning and if there was one tiny piece of lint left in a corner somewhere, she would make him redo the entire house.

17.  When my husband was a young child she would regularly start screaming that she was going to kill herself and then she'd lock herself in her room while still screaming that, while her poor little boy is clawing at the door begging her not to die. She'd ignore him until she came out like 3 hours later acting like nothing was wrong and ask him what he wanted for dinner. He told me she would never address the episodes with him or talk about it at all.

18.  She was originally financially secure with a job that provided her home ownership of a large home and a nice car and private school all on a single income, but then even though she had amazing health insurance (I have the same job now so I know it is good insurance), she supposedly developed a thyroid issue out of the blue when my husband was 8 years old, that apparently made it so she could not stay awake for more than 5 minutes at a time for 3 weeks. So she laid in bed for 3 weeks and of course she lost her job and she and my husband were destitute for the rest of his childhood and now she is still destitute and tries to get help from us.  I talked to a doctor a friend of mine and he said if MIL actually had a thyroid issue so severe that she couldn't get out of bed for 3 weeks or stay awake long enough to call a friend and ask them to take her to the doctor, then she would have had to be ignoring some extremely obvious symptoms and warning signs for months, if not years. So she either made the whole story up or she was really dumb enough to completely ignore her health when she had amazing health insurance and she will still not take responsibility that this is the reason that she is struggling financially still. She's the poor helpless victim. 

19.  Sometimes when we have her in the car with us and we pull up to coffee stand she will just start ordering out of the blue without asking us first. It seems like she's looking for opportunities to get something free out of us. Almost every time we buy her food or coffee or cook for her, she doesn't like it and complains about it.

20.  She stopped paying into Medicare in her 50s because she thought it was too expensive and now she constantly complains about not having health insurance. 

21.  After being a single mom until my husband was about 13 or 14 she married an extremely abusive man who would beat up my husband and multiple times threatened to kill him (a child!!). My husband had to run away from home for 6 months when he was 14 because his stepdad threatened his life. My mother-in-law didn't do anything to defend her son and still talks about her late husband as if he is a good guy. 

21.  When my husband was 15 years old, MIL barged in on him in the shower and pointed at his penis and started making fun of how small she thought it was and then she ran out to the living room to tell husband how small it was and they both started laughing and making small gestures with their hands. For the record, my husband has a completely normal penis and we have an amazing sex life. She would also regularly make fun of him for being chubby as a kid and she still makes fun of his body sometimes now as an adult. The last time he put down his foot and said she can no longer do that she burst into tears and stormed out of our house. Most of the time when my husband confronts her about anything she will cry like a baby. 

22.  Once when my husband was about 15 1/2, he delayed on cleaning his room so MIL kicked him out and made him homeless. He spent the rest of his childhood emancipated and struggling financially and living in his car or living in various abusive situations on the couches of random people's houses. This obviously set him back a long ways getting started in life and he still has a lot of anxiety around instability.

23.  My mother-in-law then proceeded to keep track of the small amounts of money she occasionally gave after kicking him out, and starting at age 18 she hounded him for almost a decade asking him to pay back everything she had spent raising him. 

I know a lot of these things didn't happen to me, but I still can't really have respect for her or feel close to her knowing these stories. So I usually am very distant and a bit cold with her. I would like to know a way to feel less anger and hatred though and enough confidence to interact with her. 

She has a little bit more self-awareness than a lot of people her age because usually after being confronted a few times she is able to mention that her behavior might be coming from her childhood, or after 2-3 times confronting her about a boundary she broke she will actually start trying to respect it. Which some people never do that so I have to give her a tiny bit of credit.

1q52169,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1q52169/proud_of_systems_ive_put_in_place/,Proud of Systems I’ve Put in Place,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker here. Posting to make this real and hold myself accountable. And maybe help anyone else who doesn’t know where to start

Over the past few years, I amassed 30k in cc debt. I don’t even understand how. Surely all my clothing purchased couldn’t have added up that fast? /s

Anyway, I’ve been slowly preparing myself to change. Here’s some bullets of my biggest helps. 

-changing the content I interact with.
I unfollowed influencers on all platforms and followed soooo many money saving/management/etc creators to change the type of content I would be given and interacting with. A favorite of mine is Don’t Be A Lemon on YouTube… she’s wonderful!! Highly recommend. 

-sat down and actually looked at my money. 
This was soooo painful to do, but so necessary. I was realistic with my budget. Luckily I can afford weekday coffees, so that gets factored into the budget. I realized that my spending is more emotional and gave myself grace within my budget. 

-got a device to block apps on my phone. 
(Also deleted all shopping apps). I use the Brick device and customized my settings. I can’t even get on an internet browser when I engage it. Slightly annoying but that’s the price I pay for my addiction. This, along with no social media, has been most beneficial for not only my wallet, but also my mind and wellbeing. 

-deleted saved credit cards and accounts like shop that store my payment information. Asked spouse to hide credit cards. Now I can only purchase by physically getting up and getting my debit card. 

-created a space to “spend time” with my clothes. lol. Sounds soooo dumb, but I turned our spare bedroom into a closet room and made it extra cozy so I can also do my hobbies in there. We have tiny closets in our house, so this has helped me to be able to see and appreciate the clothes I already own in a new way. 

-self help books. I’m already a reader, so this one was easy for me to add in. Again, ties into the content I am consuming. Favorite and most helpful so far for me has been “The Art of Spending Money”

Hope this list is able to generate some ideas - if you guys have anymore please leave them in the comments. I’ve gotten so much motivation from being in this sub, hope I can pass a little along! ",27,1767656191.0,shoppingaddiction,2,0.97,False

1q51zhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q51zhy/wibtah_if_i_gifted_my_neighbors_bananas_and/,WIBTAH if I gifted my neighbors bananas and compost bags after they have been “secretly” using our compost bin for months?,"For context: I live in a city that offers composting to residential homes, but not automatically to businesses. It is a set price not based on weight. The alley behind my house is shared by what I think is a collector vehicle repair shop (I’ve never actually known what they do). For at least 6 months+ they’ve been dumping their banana peels and coffee filters into our compost bin. I’m talking a daily pot of coffee and an odd number of banana peels. Either they all love bananas or one person there has the healthiest BMs of anyone on earth. They’ve never introduced themselves to us or asked for permission, but it doesn’t bother me so much since we never fill our bin up anyway. I don’t know if they think they are being sneaky about this or if they truly just care that much about composting.

The only part that bothers me is that they have never once used a compostable bag as the city requires, rather they just dumb the raw materials into the bin. It also slightly bothers me in a petty way that they’ve never asked for permission, but I take “you can’t live in a village without being a villager” very seriously, so the neighborly thing to do would be to share the bin. I don’t really desire to talk to them about this or introduce myself since I’m a bit of a hermit. I was trying to think of a way to get them to use compost bags with a harmless prank gift. I want to leave a gift bag filled with bananas, ground coffee, and compost bags outside their door with a note asking them to please use the bags from now on. I feel like this would be hilarious and would send a message of “we know you do this, you may keep doing this, and please add this step”. 

I wanted to do this for Christmas but it’s not a holiday I celebrate and might not be one that they celebrate either, so I waited until after New Years to make sure they’d be back in the building. So Reddit, is this a cowardly move, an AH move, or a tactful yet neighborly way to get them to change? Does anyone have a better idea that doesn’t include my most dreaded activity of talking face to face? I already bought the bananas and coffee, so I just want to make sure this won’t come off as AH behavior. ",2,1767656076.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I’m a 28F from Cavite looking to make more online friends, especially people who enjoy gaming and hanging out on voice chat. Or even coffee and drinks!

I actually met a dude on Reddit not too long ago and we instantly clicked over gaming, now we’re solid friends and thought it’d be fun to expand the circle and meet more chill people to game with regularly.

We’re looking for:

* Online friends (anywhere is fine)
* Casual to semi-competitive games (pero di po ako competitive)
* People who enjoy joking around, chatting, and vibing while gaming
* No toxicity, just good energy

Games we’re into (or open to):

* Multiplayer / co-op games
* Chill party games
* Open to trying new games too
* We play on PC.

You don’t have to be cracked at games, just be friendly, respectful, and down to have fun. If you’re also looking for a small, comfy gaming friend group, we’d probably get along.

Feel free to DM me with:

* Your age
* Where you’re from
* What games you play

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

What happened:
I started seeing an LCAT (Licensed Creative Arts Therapist) when I was 17. My parents chose her - they met with her before I started treatment.
At our first sessions, I told her: ""I don't want my parents in my life.""
Her response: ""If you cut ties with your parents, it will affect your behavior toward your own future children.""
She repeated this throughout our 15+ years of treatment together (age 17 to ~35). She kept me connected to my abusive parents using fear that I would harm my future children if I went no contact.
Other things she did:

Reported to my parents throughout treatment (I have evidence they were in contact)
When I met someone and sensed danger on dates 1-2, she told me to continue dating him and eventually marry him
He turned out to be severely abusive (4 years of all forms of abuse)
When I reported the abuse to her, she told me to ""bring him coffee"" and that ""I lack empathy""
Blamed me for the abuse throughout the marriage
When I finally got divorced (Nov 2024), she called me nonstop during the proceedings
When I didn't answer, she left a voicemail wishing that ""a psychiatrist finds what you have""

I finally went no contact with my parents 2 years ago (at age 35), and stopped seeing her in August 2024.
My questions:

Was she wrong to tell me that cutting ties with abusive parents would harm my future children? (I'm now scared I'll be a bad parent if I have kids)
Is it normal for therapists to report to parents when the client is an adult?
Should I file a complaint against her?

Customer Service Noghtmare,"Ok this is going to be a long post, but I seriously need to vent about the absolute nightmare I’ve been facing regarding KitchenAid customer service. I am so incredibly frustrated and need to know … am I overreacting? 

OCTOBER 24th - 
I (23F) had been wanted a new espresso machine for a while, and my friend had just gotten one from KitchenAid and liked it, so I ordered one. It was $350 but I thought it was a good investment for my first ever apartment! 

OCTOBER 31st - 
The espresso machine arrived on October 31st and the morning after Halloween, I try to make my first coffee. Immediately, the machine kept leaking water all over and wouldn’t reliably brew espresso. This continued for a few days until it wouldn’t brew coffee at all and just leaked all the time. 

NOVEMBER 4th -
I called KitchenAid and got a hold of someone right away and they apologized and offered to send a new machin. They told me it would be delivered in 7-10 business days and also asked me to send the old one back when I got my new one.  So that sucks but like I was happy that KitchenAid was so willing to replace it and I figured I could go 2 weeks without coffee. 
**Side note, at the same time my friends  espresso machine (a different model) starting leaking too, so the day after me she also got a replacement ordered. My friend’s new machine shows up 3 days later Mine does not show up… 

NOVEMBER 12th - 
Once my friend received her replacement, I grew suspicious (and jealous) and I reached out to KitchenAid to ask for an update because I haven’t received any shipping info for it. The lady informs me that the machine I ordered is now on BACKORDER and it’ll be 4-6 WEEKS until my new one ships
I was really upset at this point. I asked if I could just get a refund, if I could get a different model, a different color, if I could pick it up at a store, anything and they said no to every suggestion. They offered no resolutions and said that I’d just have to wait. I told them I did not want to wait and they said they couldn’t do anything for me 
So at this point I’m FUMING. I got rid of my old espresso machine to make room for my new one so I was now coffee-less (mind you I’m a middle school teacher, I NEED my coffee) so I continue to buy jugs of cold brew at the store for 6 weeks. 

DECEMBER 22nd - 
SIX WEEKS later I go back into KitchenAid because I have received no updates no shipping status nothing! I go to the live chat to get an order status update and for the first time (cause I checked like once a week) the order status has changed from “no delivery details are available” to “shipment is in process, delivery details will be added soon” so of course I REJOICE! The time is coming and I’m gonna get it soon. Right? That day in the chat, I talk to an agent and they tells me the shipment info should update with shipping status in the next 48 hours. 48 hours omes around and guess what, no update. 

DECEMBER 29th -
I chat with them again and the agent tells me the same thing “48 gloss” and I said, Yes I was told that last time and I’m really frustrated (I tell them this story) and they say I’m sorry, it should ship in 48 hours. I ask if I can talk to someone higher up because I’m really annoyed they say they will note my frustration in my file… whatever there is nothing they are willing to do. 

DECEMBER 30th - 
I get an email from KitchenAid asking me to review the espresso machine… I say yes or course and write a review about this whole mess and how after 2 months I have no coffee maker and no hope that KitchenAid will ever fix the issue. 

** Side note: every-time I’ve mentioned talking with them, I’ve had to wait more than an hour on hold before I get in touch with someone whether over the phone or in chat. 

JANUARY 2nd - 
It’s now a new year and I still don’t have my machine. At 8pm on this Friday, I happen to check my junk inbox and find an email from KitchenAid that says “We are contacting you in regard to order number [ X ]. The replacement espresso machine that was ordered for you has been recently discontinued. I apologize for any disappointment this may be to you. Please contact us at your convenience to discuss all available options”

When I tell you I nearly had an aneurysm…  ITS DISCONTINUED? Mind you this email offers no context, no solution, nothing of help other than “call us” - they also sent it Friday afternoon and by the time I discover it in my junk inbox, their phone lines are closed. 

JANUARY 5th - 
So cut to TODAY (the first day I can call them). Once again I am a teacher so it’s really hard for me to find time to call places during the day with a long wait time. So I call them right as my prep starts at 9:30am CST (30 minutes after they open) and the wait time was already almost 2 HOURS - so I requested a callback (since my lunch is in about 2 hours) and they called me back 15 minutes before lunch so I MISSED IT :( cause I was teaching. So during my lunch I called and the wait time was NEARLY FOUR HOURS so I left my phone on hold ALL DAY. I get in the car to finally go home and the automated voice says “your estimated wait time is 1 hour” so I’m like THANK GOD it’ll be done soon. However… in the middle of the drive home … the CALL DROPS … 

So now it is nearly 5:30pm and I am BACK ON HOLD. When I started writing this, the wait time was set to end at 6:45pm (15 minutes before they close) but for the last 30 minutes the automated voice has been saying my wait time is 1 hour and 50 minutes. I have and so much anger in my heart over this absolute nightmare of an experience.

I am satisfied until dinner and will drink a protein shake between lunch/dinner just to get some more protein in.

Kim Sung-ryong is a small-time accountant with a big-time plan: infiltrate the corrupt TQ Group as chief accountant and embezzle enough money to retire in Denmark. But once inside, he’s confronted with a company rotting from the top down—where employees are exploited, whistleblowers silenced, and profit reigns over people.

What begins as a selfish scheme transforms into a crusade. Sung-ryong, with his street smarts and irreverent charm, becomes an accidental hero—fighting for workers’ rights, exposing corruption, and outwitting the very system he once sought to exploit. Alongside him are Yoon Ha-kyung, a principled assistant manager, and Hong Ga-eun, an undercover prosecutor posing as an intern. Opposing him is Seo Yul, a former prosecutor turned ruthless finance director, whose icy ambition masks a deeper conflict.

And in the fluorescent hum of office cubicles, the ache of exploited labor, and the fire of a man who chose justice over escape, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with ink and coffee stains, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who turned rebellion into policy.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign mischief, the mythic guardian of those who fought corruption with humor and heart.

Drawn to Sung-ryong’s chaotic brilliance and Ha-kyung’s quiet integrity, the Inu becomes their silent auditor—pacing the break rooms, resting beside the ledger books, guarding the sacred ache of a revolution that began with a joke.

📎 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Sung-ryong dancing in the office after exposing a corrupt executive, the Golden Inu beside him, tail curled like a smirk.
- Ha-kyung watching him with exasperated admiration, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of reluctant trust.
- A sigil of “풍자 속 정의의 불꽃”—Flame of Justice Within Satire—etched in calculator and protest sign, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every audit and every act of defiance.
- A whispered vow: “Even if they laugh at your cause, I will guard the fire that made them listen.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

📠 This scroll is a relic of sovereign disruption, of humor braided with justice, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who turned the office into a battlefield—and won.

1q51nvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q51nvv/26th_birthday_ruined_before_it_even_got_started/,26th birthday ruined before it even got started,"TLDR: mom tries to ruin anything I want to do, including a solo trip for MY birthday because she thinks I’ll be perceived as lame. 

So I’m turning 26 in a few weeks. I really sincerely hate my birthday. I’m working on becoming more confident and doing what I want to do, and not caring what people think. 

I decided I wanted to go up to New York for my 26th - since I turned 16 in New York City 10 years ago. I told my best friend and my therapist the plan and they thought it was a great idea. I booked my flight and hotel. 

I was so nervous to call my mom and tell her - but I had to just rip the bandaid off. I told her “you know how I turned 16 in New York?” And she told me I didn’t even want to go (I don’t recall this, I loved the trip??). Then I told her the plan and how I thought it would be iconic. 

This is not for me to just go and post on IG and tik tok. In fact, my IG is deleted and I’m giving up Tik tok for an upcoming church fast to grow closer to God. That’s besides the point. 

She told me “you’re going to look like you have no friends”. I told her I’m not lonely and I do have friends. Then she hit me with “it’s not as iconic as you think”.

It’s like she tries to tear me down no matter what I do. I just wanted to do something special for myself - and it’s on weekdays, so I don’t expect my friends to take off work or spend the money. I enjoy doing things solo. I lived across the country for crying out loud. 

But now I feel like if I go she will be the voice in the back of my head saying that I am lame, a loser, etc. 

For instance, she told me I would seem lonely if I called my grandparents for new years, since I had no plans. My best friend was out of town, and everyone else was with family. I had chosen to come back early to my city because I wanted to relax. But the whole time I was so worried about being perceived as lame, even though literally nobody cares. 

I was so upset I had to call 988 to calm down and talk it out with someone, because I didn’t want to call my therapist on New Year’s Eve if it wasn’t life threatening (my therapist allows texts, and said to call in an emergency). The lady helped me to calm down, and she was so kind. It was great to be heard out. 

Anyways, how do I know what I should do? Do I go spend the time in New York? Or do I just give it up and spend it at work.

Also, I am doing stuff with my friends the weekend after my birthday - and have my Bible study on the day of my actual birthday that I’ll get to spend time with friends. And my best friend and I plan to get a coffee. But I’m like??? Am I a loser for wanted to go alone?!

1q51my2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hannahJ004/comments/1q51my2/our_oldest_sister_stayed_with_us_for_the_1st_and/,Our oldest sister stayed with us for the 1st and last time 🙃,"Well, happy new year. Our oldest sister came over last week. She stayed in a hotel for 2 nights and then stayed with us. I didnt want her coming straight to our house and it worked out that Sis 2 was going back to work so we had the reasoning of like, theres nowhere to sleep until sis leaves for work and then you can have her bed. 18yr old shares that room as well but didnt want to stay in there with oldest sis so she moved in with me. I have 2 double beds now since Matt finally listened to me and got me another one to accommodate all these fkn kids who won’t ever let me sleep by myself. So there was plenty of room for her in there

We saw oldest sis a few times obviously before she came to our house. Met her for a coffee alone, then at the beach with all the kids and she came shopping with me and 2 kids. She was completely fine, had no problems with her and we got along super well. It was way less awkward than last time she came over and felt more natural. She was being sweet with the kids and just all round good vibes tbh

Once she came to stay she took a minute to get used to busy house chaos again. She has had a long time away from all the screaming kids and was overwhelmed at first. Wasn’t too bad but defo had me on edge with worrying about them being too much and I for sure told them to chill/be quiet more than I usually would.

Last time she visited, 10yr old was really amazed by her, was really excited to be with her and wanted her to come to our house. But this time she was a bit shy and seemed unsure, which I kinda sensed annoyed oldest sis a bit. She made a comment about her having the memory of a goldfish and I was like wtf🙃 This was probably red flag number 1 tbh. 

14yr old was the one who was making an actual effort to be around big sis. Would be lying if I said that didn’t make me a tiny bit anxious though after the whole thing with her trying to get 14yr old to go visit her. But me and 14yr old are getting along pretty well recently. And her relationship with sis 2 has also been much better, which is weird because she had a serious respect problem going on with her and thought she could talk to her like shit and it was a whole thing. When we addressed it and said this needs to stop, it was very dramatic and didn’t go well at all. But then the storm apparently cleared and they are getting along so much better. 14yr old is so stubborn and usually wants the last word on everything so I’m stunned she hasn’t doubled down just to piss me off. Mystery to me but whatever. So yeah it would make me more anxious that she was getting along with oldest sis if her relationships with me and Sis 2 were still not so great, but I think we are in an ok place right now.

Once oldest sis got kinda adjusted to the family again, things got harder. Because as the big boss oldest sister (I know Sis 2 is older but she doesnt count lol) there is nothing that can annoy me more than an even older sister coming in and trying to be the boss. Like WHAT. No you’re not going to tell me what I should or shouldn’t let them eat, or suggest you can put my child to bed quicker than I can (would have liked to say yeah just so she could have a reality check, but I wouldnt do that to the kid lol).

The little kids had been going to bed easier over christmas but we were back to the usual long bedtimes with 8yo, and 10yo was struggling with a combo of super tired + serious fomo that just made bedtime a disaster. Like she was exhausted but having oldest sis there was weird enough to have her on edge and made her want to stay up and be in the loop about everything that was happening.

We tried to just be chill about it and let them fall asleep in the living room but realised that wasnt happening and we were just having to deal with grumpy kids and then still go through the same bedtime drama bc they wouldnt fall asleep out there. So we went back to the usual routine.

Then when me and/or Matt emerged after an hour or 2 dealing with them, oldest sis would be like ohh you need to try this or that, asking why we have to stay in the room, questioning basically the whole routine. As if we havent tried everything under the sun besides soundproofing their room and locking them in. “None of you were like that as kids”. Yeah cool but we didnt have bedtimes and would have been too scared to say anything if we couldn’t sleep anyway. Not really comparable situations. She also doesnt understand why we do daily baths. Or make them brush their teeth. Or change into PJs. Or put sunscreen on them. That’s all just us making our lives harder apparently. Also got some comments about having the audio monitor for 8.

But the bedtime thing was crazy bc she said since she couldn’t hear them crying we cant have been REALLY trying to get them to sleep because “we are letting them play around”. I guess in her head if we aren’t making them cry/“disciplining them” then we aren’t actually trying. It’s actually super confronting to have someone around who is still in the ‘just hit the kids’ mindset. Like it’s so extremely normal to her she doesn’t even consciously think about it. And I used to be like that.

I have done so much work to change that and it was weird to have her in the house and be around that kind of mindset again. Because Sis 2 still can be like that, but she says it in a very different way. Hard to explain but with sis 2 it’s more like… out of anger she’ll be like omg can you just slap them so they shut up. It’s based in her being annoyed with something they are doing and she’s not thinking about it past stopping them in that exact moment. (But she doesn’t hit them anyway bc she knows I’ll lose my shit)

With oldest sis it’s more methodical ? like for her its part of the whole fabric of parenting and she was making a point of having actual discussions with me about it. If they tell you no or don’t do what you want them to do, you need to be smacking them. I thought she had realised it was fucked up, we had had conversations about it before, but I guess its easy to say that when you aren’t around kids and then it all comes back out in the moment. It was like she had said all the right things to me for the last 6+ months, over text/on the phone/in person, and now that she was actually physically around the kids it all started to unravel. She just couldn’t help herself and had to share her parental wisdom with me. 

It reminded me of my dad tbh. Obviously no where near as extreme but my dad used to go on the worst rants about that kind of stuff and it is just weird to hear people so confidently make a speech about their fucked up logic that has got them to the conclusion that hitting kids is a great idea. But for my dad its like you’re my property/its my right/“god says” kind of crap.

He’s probably spent more time beating me than speaking to me. I remember him coming home after being gone for months and he literally walked in the door and idk what we were doing, something “bad”, and our mum was in bed as usual and he beat everyone in that room before saying a single word. Sticks in my mind bc I remember being so freaked out by him being silent, and how suddenly our life just did a 180 again, going from 0 parental supervision to our dad being there waiting for any reason to beat someone. Thinking please just go away again but knowing he’d probably stay around for a while to make our lives hell and get my mum pregnant. I remember my mum appearing from her room, dressed in actual clothes, wearing makeup and happy for the first time in ages. So she’d obviously heard all the commotion, realised dad must be back and started putting on mascara.

My sister isn’t fucked up like that, she’s just doubling down on her own “gentle abuse” as I call it bc she basically hit us to make us behave so we wouldn’t get beat up worse. So she’s like well a few smacks is ok. Just doesn’t want to admit it’s bad, even though she was a kid and I don’t blame her anyway. I literally did the same thing. But like at some point you need to do better and there’s no excuse. Anyway I was done arguing about it and I just said you can have your opinions but if you hit any of the kids you’ll be leaving and not coming back. She was gonna reply and I was like don’t fkn backchat there’s nothing else to say🫠

I was explaining to her that 10yr old usually goes to bed fine unless her pains are super bad, she’s just extra tired and emotional so she wasn’t going with the usual routine. But that’s a non issue to me. Idm laying in bed with them if thats what they need. 8yr old averages about 2hrs from starting bedtime to being fully asleep to where whoever is laying with her can leave the room. Doesn’t matter when we start or how tired she is, she needs that time to get to a point where her body will let her sleep. Often she’s crying and we have to calm her down. I wouldn’t leave her crying by herself but if she isn’t crying and I leave her in bed she will just get up to tell me she can’t sleep or tell me she’s worried about XYZ and we restart the process. So one of us stays with her, because she has so many thoughts and worries that someone needs to be there to answer her and eventually she falls asleep.

Oldest sis said she couldn’t do it and would be super frustrated to not have time to chill and watch TV after they are in bed. But I’m not expecting TV time so I don’t mind. My chill time is when the kids are at school and the baby is having her nap. My sister doesn’t understand that I don’t feel like I’ve ‘won’ if I am able to scare a little kid into staying in bed and being quiet until she falls asleep, just so that I can watch some TV. There are many many many many many things I get frustrated by on a daily basis but bedtime isn’t really one of them. It’s exhausting but I’m not angry at it, if that makes sense.

When I’m getting irritated I just tell myself “one more minute”. You know when you think about if you were 80 and got sent back to this exact moment for a minute what would you do. Then I magically enjoy it. Like last night I was getting to the point of wanting to be like PLS JUST SLEEP. And she had her eyes closed but she wasn’t asleep asleep where I could leave. So I got in my mindset and suddenly I was looking at her little fingernails and thinking WHY IS SHE SO CUTE AND SMALL. Then she opened one eye and she’s like “you wanna hold hands?” lol

Anyway it took a long convo but eventually oldest sis got the message that I don’t want her advice for how I can keep the kid quiet and in bed. So she shut up about bedtime after that but then had comments about us letting them stay up on NYE lol because apparently thats why 10yo has fomo now as she expects to be allowed to stay up late. Like no, she’s struggling to switch off because having someone new in the house is unsettling for her.

Then she says to 10yo the next morning, oh you need to stop worrying about missing out and just be a good girl and go to sleep. Wow so fucking helpful!! 10yo is just looking at her like she has 2 heads and I wasn’t gonna let her say that so I told her straight, being unable to sleep isnt being bad and she can keep her opinions on the kids sleeping habits to herself. She didnt say anything else in front of 10yo but she was like idk why you’re mad at me when I just want to spend some time with you in the evening. Like bitch I’m gone for a couple hours and then I’m back, I don’t stay in there all night and never see you.

After that she fully gave up on the sleep conversation, think she could tell I was fully over it and was gonna lose it if she didnt shut up. But she was more comfortable with the kids by this point so suddenly she’s getting directly involved with being parent #3. Stopped telling me what to do, she cut out the middle man and went straight to telling the kids direct. I know she’s also their sister but seriously how could it ever be appropriate to turn parent mode on kids you haven’t spent any significant time with for almost 9 years

One of the nights, 13yr old didn’t come home on time which isn’t uncommon but I had been stressing out a bit and said I’d drive around to look for him if he wasnt back soon. I had just gone to my room to get something when he came back, and oldest sis started telling him off (which was kinda funny because the day before she told me that giving them curfews is just me making my life harder) and little bro got mad/upset apparently and told her he barely knows her, asked why is she telling him off and asked where I was. He told her I can tell him off but she can’t

Matt was there and was like hey chill out a sec but little bro was not having it and stomped off to find me so that I could tell him off. He got in my room and was talking so fast I could barely understand him but was along the lines of “I’m sorry I’m late but she thinks she can tell me off and she can’t so can you go tell her to not talk to me because I don’t want her to tell me off and I’ll just wait here and you can come and tell me off after you tell her. OK!?”. I was like sure I will tell her but not right now, and he literally flopped on my bed and sighed so loud, got a bit teary and said in the quietest voice “You’re my mister and I don’t want another one” 😭😭😭 I told him I couldnt hear him, even though I just about did, and he’s like it doesnt matter I’m not saying it again. So I gave him a hug and asked what he had been doing anyways. He’s like “just hanging around. Thinking about life I guess”. Translated, that means he stayed out a little bit late to see what the reaction would be lol.

Then all the attitude came back and he’s like are you going to tell me off or what. I told him I didnt think I really needed to since he obviously knows what I’m gonna say and he said ok he’d just go to bed then.

I didn’t say much to oldest sis I was just like, he’s a teenager and he’s sensitive to you trying to mother him so you’re better off just not trying to get involved with that stuff. She replies well he’s my brother as well. I was like omfg do what you want but if you want him to like you, don’t tell him what to do. It pisses him off and he’s always very insistent that me and Matt are in charge, he has established everyone’s roles in his head and he likes everyone to stay in their lane. 

Next day Matt was gonna take all the kids out (besides the baby) so I could spend some time with oldest sis. But 8yo threw up in her bed when she woke up, which happens occasionally with her so wasn’t super concerned, but we werent sure if she was sick or not. So we decided she should stay home just in case, and she was happy and quiet sitting at the table making stuff from her craft kits she got for christmas. So it was super chill and I was like ah this will be nice to spend some time with oldest sis. We hung out for a bit and then I put the baby down for a nap and when I came back out, oldest asked me if I wanted to go sit outside with her and said she had some nice drinks and snacks we could have.

I was like sure I just need to make 8yo’s bed, because obviously I had to wash all her bedding, and then I’ll be out. Takes like 5 minutes so didnt even think anything of it, it was just my last chore and I knew I’d be able to relax once it was done. I’m never sure if she’s gonna end up napping or not (since her night time sleep is not great) so I want it to be ready to go all the time. Nothing worse than going to put a kid to bed and realising the bed isnt made🫠

She says, I’m sure she can do that herself. I was like well no, she’s 8. And I’m not going to tell her to go make her bed when she threw up. If she wasnt potentially sick I might ask her to help me but like she’d put a pillowcase on and help tuck a sheet in, she’s too small to do it all herself. So big sis is obviously annoyed but I ignored her and said I’d be back in a minute. As a joke I was like “You could always come and help if you want”💀

Obviously she didnt and when I came back (literally 5 minutes later) she was on the couch scrolling, I said are we going outside then and she says an unenthusiastic ok. I was like cool see you out there, and went outside. Asked 8yo if she was ok on my way out and she was all good, just making a bracelet.

So I’m sat outside but the door is open so I can kind of hear through the screen. I guess the knot at the end of 8yo’s bracelet was too small so beads started falling off and going on the floor, and oldest sis is like “Stop tilting it, hold it still!! You need to tie another knot in the end, that knot is too small… No, the other end! Put it down on the table and do it.” Her tone is off like she sounded mad and I was like hell nah so start getting up and then hear “Great, now the baby is going to choke on the beads, they’re all over the floor.” (The baby is asleep in her cot atp). 8yo I guess panics and leant down to pick up some beads and more started falling on the floor. So oldest is like “Why are you trying to do that now??? You should have done that after. Now its so much worse!! Oh my god just tie the fucking knot before trying to do anything else.”

I came in just as kid banged her head on the table as she sat up. Sis is mad and goes “how the hell did you do that, did you forget there’s a table there!??” I was like WHAT. She says this is what happens when she’s trying to do too many things at once. I was like OH MY GOD leave her alone OR get up and help her. I obviously get super triggered by her tone of voice and I honestly think if I wasnt there she could have easily ended up hitting her. My fight or flight was fully triggered. But really didnt want to stress 8yo out by arguing. So I stopped speaking to oldest sis or even listening to whatever shit she was saying tbh, I was using all my energy to stay laser focused on 8yo, and at some point sis walked off.

Extra annoying bc she had literally been sat there the day before whilst me and Matt had a whole convo about 8yo’s coordination and dexterity issues, and how her brain doesn’t process things immediately. So like why are you speaking to her like that and giving her so many instructions before she can process the last one. And why is your first reaction to a kid hurting themselves to be mad??

Anyway kiddo cried, not sure if it was the head bang or the angry voice, probably both, said she didnt know what to do. I told her I’d help her and she was like well I’m not really good at it so can you finish it and I can pick up the beads because I’m scared the baby will eat them. Obviously I said no we can do it together, and helped her pick them up and then she sat on me and we finished it. But like UGH so fucking annoying she was so happy sitting there doing her bracelet and I was having a nice peaceful time thinking yay all the kids are entertained and I can just chill. And my sister can’t just say “want some help?” and spend 20 seconds tying an extra knot in a bracelet

We had a whole argument about it later bc I wasnt gonna pretend nothing happened and I wont go into the whole thing but she was like, she’s obviously not sick she just threw up because she was jealous you were going to spend time with me. I was like HOLY PROJECTION!! 8yo had no idea she was meant to be going out with Matt, we mentioned it for the first time after she was asleep the night before and told the kids at breakfast. She woke up and immediately puked so she didnt know. And even if she did she’s not a tiny psycho making herself sick to stay home with me. She’d do that every day to avoid school otherwise🫠 The projection is insane I actually cant fucking deal with it. Like be so for real, you were mad I wasnt spending every second of my time with you and made you wait 5 minutes for me.

Oh yeah she said she had barely got to speak to me that day, I was like we had literally almost an hour chatting before the baby went to sleep. The baby was playing on the floor by herself/with 8yo. Big sis was like “Its hardly quality time when you’re looking away every ten seconds”. The crime of glancing at my baby to make sure she’s ok.

I eventually gave up arguing with her bc she’s so delusional it turns your brain to mush and I had shit to do. She’s like “you dont even have time to argue with me” lol. Womp womp

Matt finds her more annoying than I do and was so irritated when I told him about it he said to her if I heard you talking to my kid like that I would have told you to get out the house. Then they had a whole actual argument bc she was like YOUR kid?? And yikes dont say that to Matt. He has whole rants prepared on that subject.

A while ago I messaged him to tell him he needed to go speak to little bro’s teacher after he got in trouble for telling an inappropriate joke in class. Matt had taught him the joke so I was like fuck this I’m not going in, you can do it. He was like “Ok so what am I meant to say, sorry my kid is a dickhead he gets it from me!??” I said well you can call him your brother for a start. Fuck me I got 4 voicenotes after that about how he’s not just his brother and he doesn’t want him labelled at school as the kid that’s brother has to come in because he has no parents, yappa yappa yap. So I shut up obviously and let him say whatever he wanted to say to the teacher. And big sis got more than 4 voicenotes worth of a speech after having the audacity to question him calling her his kid. Lol

She literally said to us “when did you turn into such pussies”😭😭 which is still killing me off. She’s the one who basically had a meltdown bc I made her wait 5 minutes for me. Even tantrum prone 8yo wouldnt do that💀

She’s gone of course and tbh the last day was ok, we just tried to be civil and she gave the kids presents so left them on a pretty good note. We didnt have any permanent relationship damaging drama, have had actual huge arguments before so this was pretty small, but stuff with the kids is annoying enough that I was like nah next time just stay in a hotel the whole visit. I can handle short and sweet but having her in our space 24/7 is just too hard. Her jealousy issues can fuck off I cant deal with it. So grateful for my old self who said no to her coming on christmas bc she would have been a whole nightmare to deal with on a day thats meant to be all about the kids. Even 14yo was sick of her and glad she was leaving

Oh and after she left, 18yo said to me, “Don’t you think its weird she didn’t hold the baby once?”. I was like HUH that is kinda weird! Hadn’t actually noticed but it is weird right?! Especially since she wanted to get all involved with the kids but you’d think a baby is like the easiest kid to get involved with because she’s a baby and gets passed around our house like a hot potato anyway. She really didn’t have much interaction with her at all. But maybe babies trigger her or something. Idk. We survived but fuck me its not something I want to repeat any time soon.

18yo is not a big fan of her and when me and Matt were talking about her jealously issues, 18 yelled “yeah breaking news, attention whore wants loads of attention. Shocking stuff you guys”😭 I was like GIRL chill. She was so mad about the stuff with 8yo, still talking about it all the time. Sis 2 was like lol sucks to be you, glad I’m not there. Fml. 

Why do I feel guilty for finding her annoying like it literally causes me pain to bitch about her but I HAVE TO. And tbh I will forgive a lot but when it comes to my 8yo munchkin I’m like nah, get fucked.

Anyway moving on from that, the kids are still off for a while and we have the run of 4 birthdays in the space of 3 weeks coming up, so we’re excited to enjoy the rest of summer and the bday celebrations. And kids aging up😭 I’m not ready for my little 10yo be 11. It feels like a jump, idk why, but I’m just like nooo you can’t be 11 yet. Her bday is first and she’s having a sleepover party which is already a head spin, but I’ll save that for the next post bc this is soooooo long. Idk if this or christmas post is longer. You can thank Sis 2 for that, I have so much time now the kids are entertained by the ‘swith’😅

As always thanks for reading, hope everyone had a great christmas and new year. Appreciate everyone who reads these and messages/comments, its always super validating and nice to get my diary replies (tom riddle anyone?💀). Also wish me luck at my first concert which is coming up soon, 18yo’s birthday present and she’s bringing me as her guest. Trying not to think about how the evening will go for the rest of the family lol. Just focusing on being excited… and also shit scared that Matt’s gonna have a mental breakdown 🙃 Sis 2 will be there but as Matt says, she’s about as helpful as a wet towel.

So I’m turning 26 in a few weeks. I really sincerely hate my birthday. I’m working on becoming more confident and doing what I want to do, and not caring what people think. 

I decided I wanted to go up to New York for my 26th - since I turned 16 in New York City 10 years ago. I told my best friend and my therapist the plan and they thought it was a great idea. I booked my flight and hotel. 

I was so nervous to call my mom and tell her - but I had to just rip the bandaid off. I told her “you’ll know how I turned 16 in New York?” And she told me I didn’t even want to go (I don’t recall this, I loved the trip??). Then I told her the plan and how I thought it would be iconic. 

This is not for me to just go and post on IG and tik tok. In fact, my IG is deleted and I’m giving up Tik tok for an upcoming church fast to grow closer to God. That’s besides the point. 

She told me “you’re going to look like you have no friends”. I told her I’m not lonely and I do have friends. Then she hit me with “it’s not as iconic as you think”.

It’s like she tries to tear me down no matter what I do. I just wanted to do something special for myself - and it’s on weekdays, so I don’t expect my friends to take off work or spend the money. I enjoy doing things solo. I lived across the country for crying out loud. 

But now I feel like if I go she will be the voice in the back of my head saying that I am lame, a loser, etc. 

For instance, she told me I would seem lonely if I called my grandparents for new years, since I had no plans. My best friend was out of town, and everyone else was with family. I had chosen to come back early to my city because I wanted to relax. But the whole time I was so worried about being perceived as lame, even though literally nobody cares. 

I was so upset I had to call 988 to calm down and talk it out with someone, because I didn’t want to call my therapist on New Year’s Eve if it wasn’t life threatening (my therapist allows texts, and said to call in an emergency). The lady helped me to calm down, and she was so kind. It was great to be heard out. 

Anyways, how do I know what I should do? Do I go spend the time in New York? Or do I just give it up and spend it at work.

Also, I am doing stuff with my friends the weekend after my birthday - and have my Bible study on the day of my actual birthday that I’ll get to spend time with friends. And my best friend and I plan to get a coffee. But I’m like??? Am I a loser for wanted to go alone?!

I don’t know what to do. ",4,1767655172.0,narcissisticparents,6,0.83,False

1q51jtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q51jtd/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend/,I'm in love with my best friend,"I (20M) met my (22M) friend last August on an online fandom space. There has not been a day that we haven't talked since we started and he has quickly become a very close friend of mine. I am not close with many people, essentially just him and my other best friend, but talking to him is incredibly easy. He actually listens to me and actually talks with me about problems I have instead of just barely acknowledging them, he isn't weird about my disabilities, and actually makes me feel better about them. He takes the time out of his day to talk with me and will set time aside for me even though the poor guy is already quite busy. At first we would just talk about fandom things like I usually do with friends I make online but there's just something about him that makes me want to tell him every single thing about myself and just as much want to know the same of him. We like a lot of the same music and we have made playlists for the other of songs that we think we'd like, I was learning Spanish before I met him but he has been helping me, ties into the music because I've shifted to listening to music in Spanish almost over half the time, so he's been fantastic with recommendations. We have mailed gifts to each other a few times, let me say that I would fill out that god forsaken customs form for as long as I'd have to, just so I could see that he likes the things I've sent. For my birthday he went out of the way to get into contact with my other best friend because he had drawn two characters we both like so that she could get the image printed out to surprise me with, I had only mentioned briefly wanting to draw a picture of them to put on my cake, but didn't have the energy to do it myself. He actually wants to call me and we watch movies together as much as we can even though my internet is slow and awful, and it's hard not to stare when we video call because he is genuinely one of the prettiest people I have ever seen. I love drawing him and he always tells me that he likes them. The attention from him feels strange just because I am not used to a lot in a general sense, and I feel a bit conflicted because I don't actually know if this is normal of people who are just plain friends. He doesn't know I feel this way or that about him, at least I hope he doesn't, I really like being his friend and I don't want to make him uncomfortable with the love thing. But I have been in love before and I know exactly what it feels like, and this is it, I want to make him his coffee in the morning and do whatever I can to see his smile. A big part of me is yelling that he is just being a very good friend and this is how he is with his other friends and I don't want to start trying to come up with different things he could be thinking because I am obviously not in his head and I can't know for sure unless I just asked plainly. 

I live in the states and he lives in Mexico. We are planning a visit for me to come see him in April, and we have two(third in the works for,, idk eventually) other trips we're planning for later in the year and into the next. (Ireland, Canada, Iceland, just in case you were curious) I do not like traveling as I had to a lot as a kid but my wanting to just go see things with him overrides my distaste of traveling. I don't know if I'd tell him how I feel in April, but I do know for sure that if I ever did tell him that I would want to tell him in person. But I just would like to have a nice visit with my friend 



Anyway thank you for letting blab about him I'm tired of being asked when I'm going to ask him out by anyone I talk to in person about him

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

A couple of my recent coffee buys (one from Eight Ounce, the other from Revolver) the company has thrown in junk I didn't request. One was a stack of post it notes, the other some coffee tasting passport thing. Neither can be recycled. I'm obviously not the only who doesn't want these, so this is basically just sending a bunch of trees to the landfill. No other thing I buy comes with stuff like this.
