According to their staff it's been emptying almost as fast as people donate these days. 

They run a suspended food program. Basically you pay for bread, pastries or coffee and it's written up on their board and anyone can come and get something no questions asked. 

I know times are tight for a lot so if you are in need you can go and see if they have bread you can get for free. 

If you can afford it consider throwing some money their way. I finished a bunch of paid knit repairs this week so I threw that money at them. 

You don't even need to do it in person. You can buy suspended food through their website. 

And if you want to buy bread for yourself their bread is really good. I picked up Sourdough, Pain au Lait and a focaccia for this week. 

I know Moo Shu ice cream also offers a suspended scoop program as well.",1,1739419960.0,ottawa,0,1.0,False

She was wearing a half sleeve shirt with tight skinny jeans. I was wearing a loose sleeveless pink slip dress with a white sweater over it.

She asked me whether she became a pediatrician. I said no, even better - I work with kids all day as a teacher.

She asked me whether she married her first lab partner - that agnostic Muslim boy she always had a crush on. I said no, we parted ways (as friends) in 2017 and I have been single since a long time.

She asked me whether I am still doing chores for my mom and paying bills for my dad. I said no, I live with my bros and they are relaxed about bills and chores.

She asked me whether I love Code Geass as much as I did before. I said no, I prefer Your lie in April now but Code Geass was cool too.

She kept talking about food and reading Nature Articles. I wanted to talk about how I am learning to swim, my ideals about my classroom and French.

She ordered an iced coffee. I ordered an iced coffee (some things never change lol)

She awkwardly smiled at me and said ""goodbye"", whereas I hugged her tightly and said ""Au revoir""",1,1739419865.0,u_kawaii-oceane,0,1.0,False

One thing preknown but solidified after the breakup was my lack of friends outside of them. That being said, honorable mention to my seester, roommate in college, energy matcher, coffee date, ya love her. She keeps me from being too lonely. Second mention to my discord friend(s). We only talk a handful of times every couple months for reasons that will go unmentioned. They’re a blast, great company, usually funny, love them too.   
By a boyfriend but NOT a boyfriend I mean a new socializing individual who is most likely a guy just cuz I tend to get along and relate to dudes more. Someone who is committed, and has decent response time. Dead inside but funny. Sarcastic and sweet. Someone who can have fun and be weird or dark but also knows when to be mature and adult a bit. Maybe only some of this I don’t know I’m not tryna build someone just be yourself. I text a lot and I spam if I’m bored.   
Few problems though. 
1. I energy match so you gotta bring the energy or ima be awkward as fuck. I don’t mind leading the conversation but you gotta put yourself out there a bit too or this is going no where.
2. I get bored easily so if nothings happening in like a week I don’t want to waste my time (refer to problem 1)
3. I have a tendency to not click with people, find them annoying idk I do better with people who do things that catch me off guard, like calling me out, saying the unexpected etc. I apologize in advance but it’s true. I like real things, deep talks, late night calls (one I know you)
4. I’m very sarcastic. I like dark humor. I cope with humor. I shit talk a lot. Had one person where all we did was insult each other, I learned nothing about them ever but it was fun. That’s not everyone’s thing and that’s ok! Just means I might upset you by accident if we talk long enough for me to get past my introvert stage.  
I’m gonna end it there cuz I have said a lot and I want people to message because they vibed with something I said not because I said I like ATLA or baking cookies. 17-19yo please, older than that is pushing it.  
REMEMBER: P L A T O N I C and if you’ve read this far thank you! Might as well message cuz something probably intrigued you. If we don’t click so sorry but thanks for stopping by! If you don’t message that’s ok, have a good day! :)

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Met my younger self for a coffee today. 
She showed up 20 minutes early 
I showed up 30 mins late because I was debating on cancelling 
 
She ordered a Pepsi max because she’s scared she’ll need a shit if she drinks dairy outside of home 
I ordered a caramel frappe because I’m going home after this and can just use the toilet there. I also don’t like Pepsi max anymore 

She’s just came from the club with no sleep
I’ve just woke up from a 9 hour sleep because I have no reason to wake up these days 
 
I asked her about her life she says she’s never at home because she has so many friends and plans all the time whilst juggling that with college and a job, she barely had time to sleep. 
I just told her that I barely leave the house now due to anxiety and I don’t even work anymore. I’m waiting for an autism assessment, and hopefully one day the reason why we’re so different will make sense. 

I told her to learn how to drive while she can and has the spare money, I would tell her to go to uni and do anything she wants, it doesn’t have to relate to your college course.

Hey everyone, thanks so much for all your advice and support on my original post. I was really torn about reconnecting with my mom, but after a lot of back and forth, I decided to meet her for coffee. I thought maybe, just maybe, seeing her face-to-face could help me figure out where I stand.

So we met at a local café, and honestly, from the moment I sat down, I could tell things weren’t going to go how I hoped. She started off by talking about how much she’s changed, how she’s been working on herself in therapy, and how sorry she was for what happened in the past. I was hesitant, but I tried to listen, at least.

Then things quickly took a turn. She began talking about how “difficult” I was to deal with growing up, how “unstable” I was, and that she tried so hard to give me a good life, but I just pushed her away. I was in shock because I had gone in hoping for an apology, but instead, it felt like she was flipping the narrative and trying to paint me as the one who was always difficult and ungrateful. She even said, “I tried my best, but you just couldn’t see that,” and kept going on about how “hard” it was for her.

At this point, I tried to calmly remind her of the things she’d done to me—how she had belittled me, emotionally abused me, and how that had impacted my mental health. I was expecting her to take some accountability, but she just kept deflecting and saying things like, “You were always so sensitive,” or “I did what I had to do to toughen you up.” It felt like she was completely ignoring my feelings and instead trying to make it seem like I was the problem.

It got to the point where I had to walk out. I was upset, angry, and disappointed. I didn’t want to get into a screaming match in public, but I honestly don’t know what I expected from that conversation. I don’t feel like I got the closure I needed, just more of the same gaslighting and manipulation.

I haven’t contacted her since, and I’m feeling more certain than ever that cutting her out of my life was the right choice. I’m grateful I tried, but I’m also relieved that I didn’t let myself fall for her attempts to rewrite history.

Thank you all again for the advice, and I’ll be focusing on moving forward with my life. This chapter is closed for good.

This update shows your mom trying to manipulate the situation and make you feel like the problem, reinforcing why you made the choice to distance yourself from her in the first place.

1ioa9y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ioa9y4/not_all_poltergeists_are_benign/,Not All Poltergeists Are Benign,"We moved from Westbury to Launceston after we sold the farm, the one Robert had inherited when he was 28.

His back injury had worsened and the boys had gone other directions, so it made sense. We'd made our money, and I was over the upkeep.

May as well.

Launceston was where Jacob and Mikey were both studying, too. And we loved our boys. More than enough to cramp them from a close distance.

So we bought a big house in Trevallyn, just beyond the Cataract Gorge. 

Old Victorian, it was. Two stories, both with balconies overlooking the city, with a renovated flat down below.

But old places like this, poor Robert. 

He'd been raised a believer and his superstitions often got the best of him. So the purchase of an older house in need of repair had been my choice, which I made because, well, it's a very fine view.

But, poor Robert. 

The first thing was his model trains being rearranged. He couldn't blame his memory, but he tried his best. 

Sounds in the night were the kicker. Creaking doors, footsteps, wind through a window he was sure that he'd shut.

The sorry sod was losing his marbles after a few months. And there was no reprieve, either, unfortunately. 

It only kept getting worse. 

He was drinking coffee on the balcony one morning when he heard the crash. It was the vase that his mother had passed down, smashed to smithereens on the floorboards. I was out for a walk, and so, alone, he couldn't grasp the situation very well.

Should have seen the state he was in when I got back. 

The man could barely speak.

And it only made matters worse that he and I were quite different, in that way. I was raised Catholic to the extent that I up and quit before 18. And so ghosts didn't interest me much, either.

I mean, really. Billions of galaxies out there, and we've got these trapped spectres moonlighting about for no discernible reason. Much easier to believe we go back to the stars, if you ask me.

Rob had to get therapy, in the end. 

But that didn't help, either. Nor did things get any better for him at home.

The final insult was when he woke in the flat downstairs. 

Tied to a chair, gagged, so afraid that he practically shat himself.

When he saw Jacob walk through the door with the crowbar, I think that's when his mind finally broke.

Moments before a gleeful Jacob broke his body.

See, giving birth to a psychopath like myself had more going for it than expected.

Robert's downfall had begun when Jacob was a teenager, telling his girlfriend all kinds of nasty things so that she'd leave him. 

Not the kind of thing a psychopath tends to forgive very easily.

Personally, I had no issue with Robert. The money was good, the sex was more or less passable. 

And what a fine view this big house has.

She'll put one barista on full drive and then get irritated when DTO isn't answered right away: but then even she won't ever be able to answer DTO in the one-second window that she expects everyone else to. She threatened to send me home over a mistake I made while panicking the other day: LSS someone ordered a bacon sausage wrap in drive, there were none in the fridges up front and I hesitated to go to the back to check and say something over the headset because I've been ""coached"" for both of those things in the past. Bacon sausage wraps in the back still had frost on the wrappers and so we had to apologize to the customer and they ordered a double smoked at the window instead.

I finally ended up getting some new Phormula-1 CTC... the last time I bought some it I got 2 containers and so last week I finally ended up getting a new order which had the *new* formulation.

Full disclosure: I am a 1P Employee... but this isn't a paid promotional or anything. Nobody asked me to do this. I just... REALLY like CTC in my coffee!

I've said before that I [like](https://www.reddit.com/r/1stphorm/comments/sra8ag/comment/hxz00st/) [CTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/1stphorm/comments/syauty/comment/hxyzsms/) in coffee. Like... 90% of my coffee intake is CTC + French Vanilla collagen. I always make my iced coffee the same way: Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla, Ice, [French Vanilla Collagen](https://1stphorm.com/products/collagen-with-dermaval?variant=33413867765846), and [Phormula-1 CTC](https://1stphorm.com/products/phormula-1?variant=31157376286806&a_aid=f7076c74&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=shopping&utm_content=Pure+Whey+Protein+Isolate+Powder+%7C+CTC+%7C+Post-Workout+Drink+%7C+32+Servings+%7C+Phormula-1+%7C+Nutritional+Supplements+by+1st+Phorm&a_aid=f7076c74&chan=143245504974&tw_source=google&tw_campaign=11304424524&utm_source=GooglePLA&utm_campaign=quattro&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=11304424524_143245504974_4270_US_9027404&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs7Hh3Ny_iwMVKivUAR3fQhRkEAQYASABEgLQfvD_BwE). (Unless I don't have any, then I'll use Cinnamon Cookie Batter Level-1, which... maybe has been discontinued, I'll have to check).

Anyway, here's my hot take on the ""new CTC"" after having it the last 3 days: **It's excellent.**

The taste is slightly different. Maybe a little more ""cinnamony"". I feel like this would be the taste if you were to actually take a box of cinnamon toast crunch cereal, and put all the ""dust"" into milk. My initial reaction was that it was *better* than the original. Maybe it isn't distinctly better, but I do feel like the taste is more pronounced.

As far as the mixing, I use a standard 1P shaker bottle. For CTC it's always worked and this is no different. And I always use the French Vanilla Collagen... which I don't think has had a formula change. So yeah, it mixes well. No complaints.

The only real significant change has been the look. Before the formula change the *look* of the coffee was very much like something you'd see at Starbucks or a coffee shop. It looked like it had more creamer in it. The new variation... it's darker. It's like adding 2% milk rather than heavy cream to coffee. Again—taste is great, but it does look visually different.

[I wish I had a picture of the CTC of old—alas I didn't get a clear shaker bottle until recently.](https://preview.redd.it/3n7bzayavtie1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=095dd8f4ea0ef5aac6e7970cd75e194955bdccb8)",2,1739418212.0,1stphorm,0,1.0,False

1ioa6te,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1ioa6te/i_reviewed_a_ton_of_summer_student_resumes_this/,I reviewed a ton of summer student resumes this week - here are a few tips,"This week I had the pleasure of reviewing about 200 resumes for a 4 month summer student position in my department at an oil and gas company. Usually these are culled by HR so I don’t see everything, but this time I got the entire folder. Thought I’d share some of my observations for student job seekers - note that these are my observations only.

This position is located in Calgary, but about 40% of the resumes were from out of province (mostly Ontario). Most summer student jobs do not pay relocation so if you are applying from out of province be aware that you would have to fund your move here. About 15 were from students that are new to Canada. Five were students that will graduate before the job starts (which is ok for us but some companies require you to be going back to school in the fall).


- The format of your resume doesn’t matter as long as you give some detail about what you accomplished in previous jobs/volunteer work/projects. You’re a student and your experience may be in customer service type roles or volunteer activities - that’s ok and you will have gained valuable experience from it. Explain what that valuable experience is and how it translates into skills that would be useful for this type of job.

- Minor grammar and spelling mistakes are fine, but some resumes had pretty significant grammatical errors, which makes me worry about your written communication skills.

- One applicant clearly cut and pasted their resume from ChatGPT and forgot to take out the ChatGPT prompts. 😬

- On that, it is ABUNDANTLY CLEAR when you use ChatGPT to write your cover letter. It’s fine to use it to get started, but you have to personalize it and take out the superfluous language it tend to insert. Even a bit of extra effort here goes a long way.

- Cover letters are a must. Bonus points if you bothered to look up a bit of info on the company and include it somehow in your cover letter. Make sure if you’re applying to multiple jobs you carefully check that you’ve fully removed/replaced the company name. One guy was also applying to Petronas according to his cover letter to us 😉

- Some applicants attached their full transcripts. You don’t need to do that, and personally I don’t care about GPA either. I always recommend not including it in your resume but YMMV.


Hope that helps one or two people in their job hunt. It is very competitive out there so a bit of extra effort can give you the edge you need.

Also, I get students and new grads reaching out to me on LinkedIn fairly often. This is totally fine and I actively encourage it. I always have time for a coffee with young people entering the workforce and the majority of my colleagues feel the same.

I recently signed a 10-year lease for a coffee shop in a commercial building. At the time of signing, there was no mention of flood zone concerns. However, my SBA lender has informed me that we need flood insurance to close the loan because the building is considered to be in a flood zone.

I spoke with the landlord, who claims that while one side of the building is in a flood zone, the side that our store located is not, as it is situated on higher ground. Despite this, the SBA lender is basing their assessment on FEMA reports, which classify the building as being in a flood zone.

Given that we were not made aware of this issue when signing the lease, I'm wondering if it’s reasonable to ask the landlord to either cover the cost of flood insurance or provide a discount equivalent to that cost. The landlord insists that since our store is not in a flood zone, we should not be required to have flood insurance.

If anyone has experience with commercial property rentals and can offer guidance on how to approach this issue with the landlord, I would greatly appreciate it.

Early 40's professional originally from Seattle and current 10 year resident of Boston. Single, no kids and no pets. I work in technology and from home. 

In Boston I could spend anywhere from 1900 to 3600 for a 1 or 2bd  with 1 or maybe 2 bath.  Price is based on the neighborhood and how modern the unit is.  Rent generally includes most utilities and services. 

For Nashville, I am looking to find a apartment or home to rent which is located in OR close to a mixed use residential neighborhood. 

I want to be able to walk out my door and around the corner or across the street and be able to:

\-Grab a coffee (Local place preferred)  
\-Hit the Gym (There should be a variety of options from Boxing to Pilates)  
\-Get my hair, skin and nails etc taken care of  
\-Eat lunch / diner  (Want to be able to grab a slice or a fancy steak and everything in between)  
\-Go grocery shopping / butcher / wine & cheese shops / local brewery.

Community should be welcoming to all but should not be party central.  Most of the above businesses should be closed by 8 and the restaurants should be closed by 10 and everyone is back home and getting ready for school or work the next day.  Not looking for silence just respect.

Ever since I was a kid, I was constantly scolded by both of my parents. I remember running away from my home with a kitty suitcase of mine filled with my dolls when I was 5 because I couldn't able to put with constant harrassment from them. You might probably think that's because I am a troubled child but I swear it's the opposite. Everyone out there likes me except for my parents. 

As I grew up, I realised that my parents tried for a boy and ended up having me. Although I have a brother now, It's just they didn't want me in the first place. My dad straight up told me this. I remember praying to God to turn me into a boy when I was a kid back then thinking its possible and I would also be loved more if that happens. When I think about that, I not only find cringe but also furious for making me have such thoughts at the age where I should be playing with the neighborhood kids. Trust me, almost 99% of my problems would be solved if I was born as a biological male. I am not even kidding. My family is my problem. 

Like 10 mins ago, I got a big lecture from my mom about how useless I am because everyone kept their drank coffee cups at different parts of the house and apparently I didn't bring it to the kitchen. My brother doesn't even lift his finger and he is just a couple of years younger than me while I will be scolded out of blue for anything and everything. 

Lately, I am literally living in this constant fear wondering when and what reason they gonna use to scold me everyday. It gets worse. My mental health is down in he drain. Whenever they call my name, my heart pounds as if I am in a exam hall. 

I legit wish I was aborted since my dad told me outright he wanted that too and apparently I am a liability to them. It hurted at that time but now I feel perhaps, they are right. I would have been better off dying in the womb than dying everyday mentally. 

No one around me has any idea about this since they put out this drama of how beautiful of a family we are. We are better than bollywood serial dramas. I can bet on that. So, yeah, just a rant to get it off my chest. 

TLDR : My parents hates me because I am a girl and they wanted a boy. I have a brother, though but they still wanted to get rid of me and treats me like a slave and a vent bag to show all their frustrations. ",22,1739416777.0,AskIndia,21,0.81,False

My boyfriend (29) I are looking for some friends in New Jersey. What can I say about us? I’m the quiet friend in the group that will send you memes he hopes will make you smile, pretty art, movies to watch or send his evil liberal ideology on loving others. Bf will send shitposts, restaurant ideas and comedy specials. 

We like playing video games. I’m currently into Pokémon Unite, but I love Dead by Daylight. He’s playing Ghost of Tsushima as i type this. Fighting games are cool although we suck at both of them. Still, we try, fail and enjoy.

We’re watching Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Fruits Basket (reboot), Charmed (OG) but I want a scary anime. I’m slowly getting into horror movies, and he is slowly losing his mind because of it. He’s dumb and loves Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure for the actual plot. He won’t watch it with me anymore because I complain how gay it is XD but I truly do love the fashion of it. 

We’d like to go out more if time permits. Maybe go to New York, maybe find a cute little coffee shop hidden away, help me convince him to go to shopping so I can get lost in the aisle and find shit I don’t need. 

I would type more, but I suck at introducing myself XD introverted and all. 

Overall, we’re just looking for people to connect with and have something meaningful. A friendship, is like any other relationship: you need to sit and care for it, make sure everyone’s happy and feels safe, hold each other accountable and grow together. That’s how you find people that care for you that can be comfortable to fall back on you when you need it.

They’re kinda dry. But I feel like if I could taste them, they’d be kinda good? 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’ll just pop them into the freezer until I’m 💯 and then try one again. I think they’d be a great texture for dipping in coffee!!

Would you try ammonia cookies?? Ok fine. I’ll admit that I waited for my husband to taste it before I took a bite. 🫣

The 4 year old asks for breakfast. I help her with the tv and to get everything situated. Jump on my 2nd work call. My 9 year old comes down. I go upstairs and make the bed, tidy up, bring down laundry. My 9 year old gets himself food but then they start arguing over the tv. I deal with that. While there’s about 10 minutes until my next call, I notice the piled up dishes in the sink. (The “kitchen” is supposed to be my SOs job but he waits until midday to empty the dishwasher from THE DAY BEFORE and then load it with last nights dishes and whatever else is left over from the day before). The sheet pan still had remnants from the dinner I made last night. So I empty the dishwasher, load it, CLEAN THE SINK and counters which he NEVER does. Start my next work call. Then make myself a coffee. Clean up the kids breakfast stuff. Let the dogs out and back in at random times. Help the kids with whatever they need. Set up my 9 year old for his virtual learning. Set my 4 year olds “school” up for her (she practices her letters in a workbook). Etc etc etc. 

And that was just the morning through early afternoon. 

I did all of that while my SO sat in front of his desk watching podcasts on YouTube on his phone. It’s all he does. Idk how he gets paid at work because he barely works. Literally. It’s insane. 

He’s just another person I have to pick up after. I cook every single night. I constantly am cleaning and picking up to make sure the house isn’t a disaster. And he just…sits around on his phone. 

He literally does the dishwasher and takes the trash out once a week. He tells me all I have to do is ask and he will do whatever. WHY DO I NEED TO ASK? No one tells me what to do. I am an adult and I know what needs done. 

Then tonight he has the nerve to ask “What’s wrong with you?” like sorry, I didn’t get to just chill out watching videos on my fucking phone all day! ",12,1739416015.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

**Original Post - February 9th 2025**

I (31F) am at my wit's end with my husband's (32M) coworker Sarah (30F), and his complete inability to see what's happening. I'm not usually one for reddit, but I need to know if I'm going crazy here.

Where do I even start? Three years ago, my husband Mark started working with Sarah. At first, I tried to be welcoming. I invited her to our BBQs, included her in group outings, and genuinely tried to be friendly. Big mistake. She spent the entire time making backhanded comments about everything from my career (""Oh, you're just a yoga instructor? How... peaceful."") to my cooking (""I guess not everyone can master basic seasoning."").

The real problem is that Mark thinks she's ""just being funny."" Last month, she literally threw away the anniversary mug I gave him because it ""clashed with the office aesthetic."" When I got upset, Mark said I was being too sensitive and that ""Sarah just has high standards for office decor."" IT WAS A MUG WITH OUR WEDDING PHOTO ON IT.

Some greatest hits from Sarah: - She scheduled a ""mandatory"" work dinner on our anniversary - She convinced Mark not to take a promotion because it would mean working with a different team - She posts daily photos of them together with hashtags like #WorkPowerCouple and #WorkSpouse - She tells everyone at their office that she ""takes better care of him than I do"" - She changed his coffee order and now tells everyone she ""trained him right""

The worst part? My husband is completely blind to all of this. Yesterday, he actually told me about how Sarah said our new house (which we spent months searching for) was ""charming, in a starter home kind of way."" He repeated this while LAUGHING.

I tried talking to him about it, but Sarah has convinced him I'm ""just insecure."" She's managed to insert herself into every aspect of our lives. They text constantly - even on weekends. She knows his schedule better than I do. She rearranged his entire desk and office wardrobe because his style was ""too suburban husband."" THAT'S WHAT HE IS!

Last week, I suggested marriage counseling. He looked genuinely confused. He of course went and talked to Sarah about it I found out from another coworker that she's been telling people that Mark and I are ""going through a rough patch"" and that she's ""just being a good friend by giving him someone to talk to."" We weren't going through anything until she started this nonsense!

The breaking point? I stopped by his office to surprise him with lunch (I know, I know, but it was his birthday and Sarah was supposedly out sick). Guess who was there? Sarah. She'd ""miraculously recovered"" and bought him a cake that said ""To my work hubby"" with a photo of them from the office holiday party. She saw me and said, ""Oh, Amy! You came too... how nice. Mark, you didn't tell me your real wife was coming!""

I'm not crazy, right? This woman is trying to destroy my marriage while my husband stands there grinning like it's all some big joke. What do I do? Divorce seems extreme, but I'm running out of options here.

TL;DR: My husband's ""work wife"" is actively trying to sabotage our marriage while he remains completely oblivious to her obvious manipulation.

ETA: I should have stated that the promotion wasn't one that would increase his salary but his title. It would give him more leadership experience. It still blows my mind that he turned it down just so he could stay on the same team as her.

ETA: I should have told the mug story in its entirety. She ""accidentally"" broke the mug. I noticed it was gone when I was visiting him one day and I asked him about it. He said she accidentally knocked it over and then later he repeated a ""joke""she made about how it didn't fit the office aesthetic.

**Update - February 13th, 2025, 4 days later**

Hi! I (31 F) posted a few days ago. I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did. I got so overwhelmed by all the comments that I haven't responded to any. I want to address everyone who says it's fake - I understand why you think that, but this is my personal hell. I only listen to Reddit stories on TikTok, but when this reached its boiling point, I just needed a place to talk. So I made an account and tried to yell into the void. Well, the void turned out to be less empty than I thought!

Now, to why everyone is here - the update: Before I talked to my husband (32M), I decided to do some investigation. I started with his phone and read all the messages between him and Sarah. She bad-mouthed me a few times (he did nothing to defend me but didn't engage either). She was flirty; he wasn't really flirty back. They talked a lot, and he praised her frequently for her work ethic and intelligence. I didn't see anything about cheating. I checked his email - nothing. I checked his work email - nothing. I looked through our other devices - nothing. I searched high and low for a second phone - nothing. Everything I found was always dancing that line. Nothing was outright cheating, but here are the things I found that did hurt my feelings:

• He has lunch with her, and only her, every day in the office. They don't really like anyone else, so they'll criticize others and say, ""Let's talk more at lunch, they're serving xyz today.""

• He'd say things like ""I'm sure if you were a wife, you would xyz."" He always kept it as ""a wife"" and not ""my wife,"" but it still upset me.

• She admitted to breaking the mug on purpose. He didn't get upset with her, just said, ""Yeah, the photo gifts are kind of corny.""

I confronted him. I laid it all out, and while he wasn't upset, he did try to brush things off. He said I was being sensitive and overreacting. I told him if we didn't have a real conversation about this, I would file for divorce. That got his attention, and he sat down with me.

He admitted that at first, he found it odd that Sarah was trying so hard - he saw her trying hard with all the men in the office. The more attention she gave him, the more he enjoyed it, and the more he responded, the more attention she gave, until she just had her sights on him. He knew some of the other men were envious, and he liked that too. He admitted that eventually, he just got too deep. He said he knew it was wrong but had gotten addicted to the attention and didn't want her to move on to another man. So he indulged her sometimes at my expense. He said it was just nice to have two women in the two major parts of his life, stating that he knew we'd rarely see one another, so what was the harm? He reiterated that he never EVER physically cheated with her but admitted it could be called an emotional affair.

It was painful, I won't hide that. I mean REALLY painful - like I wasn't enough. I told him from this point on, he needed to stop communicating with Sarah and ask to be transferred or switch jobs altogether. Now folks, I mean it when I tell you this:

He. Lost. His. Shit.

He began raising his voice, saying things like he never cheated, it was all above board, and I couldn't control who he talked with at work. He called me a narcissist and a control freak. He told me I had no idea how hard it was, how much stress he had in the office, and that his personal relationship with Sarah helps a lot - taking it away would just damage his mental health. It got so bad that I started crying. I couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave. I packed a small bag and called my MIL - she's the only family I have here. I gave her a rundown of what was going on, and she offered her home to me. I'm staying here and just hoping my husband calms down so we can revisit this. I want to work it out; I love him more than anything.

I will try harder to answer comments on this post, and I will definitely update if something new happens. This has been really therapeutic and makes me feel less alone.

TLDR: I confronted my husband about his work wife, and he lost it on me. Now I'm staying with my MIL.

 **u/Different_Ad383**

>*Welp, I kind of figured he wasn’t that clueless. This is a full blown emotional affair. From experience, things will only escalate they are in bed together. Protect your peace, because he sure doesn’t give a damn about your feelings. Stay strong.*

**u/TogarSucks**

>*Jumped right from “admitted it could be called an emotional affair” to “he began raising his voice, saying things like he never cheated”.*

>*OP made a valiant effort, but it doesn’t seem like this marriage can be saved.*

 **Additional comments from OOP about her MIL**

My MIL is on my side and told me point blank that he is wrong. However, she said she doesn't want to get in the middle bc she doesn't want to damage the relationship with either one of us. She told me I'm welcome as long as I need but she won't bring anything up to her son until he brings it up to her.

My MIL agrees his actions are wrong but doesn't want things to escalate or to damage her relationship with either one of us so she is staying out of it unless he contacts her.

As for my husband he has tried to reach out. He's called left message texted. I let him know I was safe and left it at that. He will message or call every few hours but we haven't talked.",466,1739415623.0,BORUpdates,56,0.97,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1io9esp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1io9esp/lack_of_empathy_where_should_i_look/,Lack of Empathy. Where should I look?,"Hello Everyone. I struggle with empathy. I mask it to avoid awkward moments and shame being brought upon me. Here are some examples.   
  
TLDR: I lack empathy and I know I need to change that but I don't think I have to heart to. I am more concerned with people inconveniencing me than anything.   
  
1. (just now) My father cried to me about a legal situation he's facing. I felt annoyed by this. I wanted to just sit alone and have no one bother me. I knew that the solution to this problem was simple. In fact, the person that would have to solve that problem would be me. Why was he crying?  
  
2.  One of my ""friends"" cried to me about their problems with substance use. I masked empathy and told them everything was going to be okay. I knew what to say to them to make them feel better. But I really just felt annoyed that they interrupted my sleep. I didn't care.   
  
3. Any mentions of someone close to my circle dying, falling severely/terminally ill, or any severe unfortunate event, do not induce a sense of sadness or empathy for those afflicted. For example: My past teachers mother developed a horrible cancer. In the back of my head all I could say to myself was ""I really don't F\*\*\*ing care man...my coffee and pastries are getting cold and I really want to enjoy them in the sun and listen to some philip glass."" But I had to mask empathy, say how sorry I felt about his situation. I masked my empathy so that my (ex)girlfriend didn't get the idea I was heartless.

4. Every time a homeless person asks me for money. I curse them inside my head and wish that they'd be dead and away from me. I sometimes imagine brutally killing them. I still give them a considerable amount of money or give them my food. I'd say 80-90% of the time. It's not the fact that they're asking for my money or food. It's the fact that they interrupt my peaceful walk with their crying and disgusting smell and appearance. I still give them money because not giving them money only adds to the problem. Sometimes giving them money gets them away from my presence faster. I also don't want enemies since some of the homeless people I encounter live close to my office and place of living. 

5. Lastly, when something very good happens to other people - I also don't care. One of my close friends received a good job offer. I was accused of being jealous for my lack of emotion and happiness, but I really just forgot to mask empathy. When I congratulated him, I was smiling and said that he truly deserves it and that I was proud of him. But I really didn't mean it...since I didn't care. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad, but I'm more concerned about finding some time to sleep or be alone with some good coffee.

In action, I am a good person. But my thoughts and lack of empathy prove that I am a bad person. I work hard for my family, I still give money to the homeless whenever I can, and I still force myself to do good things even if they inconvenience me.  Whenever something bad happens, I focus on the solution and on what I can control instead of addressing people's emotions.   
  
Can anyone help me understand why I lack empathy? Am I ""Meursault"" (from the stranger)? Could I just be tired from working all the time that I don't have the bandwidth to be empathetic?   
My therapist has considered a sociopathy diagnosis but is still unsure for now.   
I am on SSRI's and on Ritalin if that helps.

A woman from the US Attorney's office arrives and asks for Lisbon, saying that a warrant is being issued for her brother Jimmy, who is a material witness in the murder of a judge's son and he fled when they attempted to contact him. Lisbon calls her other brother Stan, trying to figure things out. Lisbon tells Jane that Jimmy would probably go back to their old house. Abbott comes into the breakroom and says he's the oldest of five, and the two of them joke about wanting to strangle their siblings. He gives her leave to take care of things. Jane asks Lisbon if she wants him to go with her, and after some prodding, she admits that she would really like it if he did, so he agrees they'll go together.

Title relevance: Lisbon's childhood home is a house with faded yellow paint.

Notable guest stars: Robert Belushi (host of Get a Clue, and I had no idea until today that he's Jim Belushi's son!), Tom Gallop (from Will & Grace), Derek Philips (from Friday Night Lights), Jeremy Ratchford (from Cold Case)

Location: Chicago, Austin, Dallas


Notable scenes: 
- Lisbon and Jane arrive at her childhood home, which she says her parents bought when she was three, but that she hasn't been to it since her dad died. Jane mentions he's a little envious because he never lived in a house growing up. She goes to make a call, and Jane looks around, spotting a photo of her as a teenager along with a clipping of an article about her being student of the week. He goes up to her old bedroom and looks around, smiling at crayon drawings on the closet wall. Hearing footsteps behind him, he says he loves her artwork, but when he turns around, he's shocked to discover it's a man. They struggle briefly, but when Lisbon hears and rushes upstairs, the man flees.
- They head to Stan's house and meet him and his wife Karen, though Lisbon makes a mistake about which kid she's holding. Stan immediately brings up Woody Squire, and Lisbon changes the subject to Jimmy. Stan tells Jane about Woody anyway, and how he wore eyeliner and a lip ring, pierced himself before prom, and swelled up like a tennis ball. They tell him about the man at the house, and he tells Lisbon that Jimmy is playing poker again. Jane senses he's lying and asks about Stan's business, irritating Lisbon. Stan invites Lisbon to his baby's christening, and they have a tense conversation when he accuses her of never coming to family things.
- Wylie fills Lisbon in on the murder, and afterward, Jane takes the phone and asks Wylie to search for the man who attacked him, giving him a long list of details.
- They head to a bar to look for Jimmy, but instead they find TJ Mullins, and Jane immediately takes his phone right out of his hand and pockets it without TJ realizing. TJ tells Jane that Lisbon used to babysit him, that he once locked her out of the house, so she threw a brick into the basement window to get back in, but she still paid for the broken window. When asked if he's heard from Jimmy, he says no, and Jane tells him he seems nice but that he's a terrible liar and takes out his phone, seeing that he talked to Jimmy that morning. TJ says that he said he was going fishing.
- Lisbon finds Jimmy fishing at a park and they argue, with him saying she only comes around to criticize him. Jane asks to talk to Jimmy in private, and he offers Jimmy a deal. He tells him that if he comes back to Austin with them, he'll make sure he never has to testify by solving the case. He tells Jimmy that he cares a lot about Teresa and the people she cares about. They shake hands, and he goes back to Texas with them.
- Jimmy tells Lisbon about a high-stakes poker game he attended with the victim, Nathan. He mentions George Holiday was there, and Cho describes him as a ""mobster in cowboy boots."" Jane says Holiday isn't their guy and that it was one of the other players. Abbott arrives and says the US attorney is upset Jimmy's there, but Abbott bought them seventy-two hours to solve the case.
- Cho and Jane sit at a bar watching football and try to hook Holiday, but Jane notices that it's not going to work but that Holiday is drawn to the ladies. They try again with Lisbon in a short leather skirt (and the bartender is the same actor who played a CBI agent a few times!), and this time they secure an invite to the game.
- Wylie and Vega go undercover as an engaged couple and are shown around a hotel suite. Vega starts ranting at him in Spanish, making the hotel worker so uncomfortable that he leaves them alone, and they install cameras.
- Karen calls Lisbon and tells her that Stan got beat up. She talks to Stan via video and he tries to get her to not say anything to Jimmy. She asks Jimmy, and he tells her that Stan is 30k in debt with loan sharks. They argue again, and she said that she had to take charge. He says that yes, she was in charge, but then she left. Lisbon insists that she's going to be part of the sting to keep an eye on Jimmy, who starts networking to try to get all the same players back in a game with Holiday.
- Jane and Lisbon get ready in the Airstream. Jane notices that she's upset and tells her that her brothers don't hate her, that they just miss her.
- Lisbon and Jane arrive at the suite, and they begin playing Texas Hold'em. Wylie and Vega watch, observing what Jane is doing to learn their tells. They move to Phase 2, and Lisbon begins a psychic act, saying she senses something disturbing. She says the killer is in the room, and the killer is the one who has the ace. Jane has them reveal their cards, but since he was the dealer, they're all holding aces. McInnis displays his tell, and they realize they all have aces and laugh. 
- Jane fixes it so that McInnis begins winning. McInnis goes to the bathroom, then Jane pretends to discover the hidden camera, convincing the others McInnis has been cheating. Cho waits in the bathroom for McInnis and offers him protection. He accepts and confesses to killing Nathan because he thought he was having an affair with his fiancée Heidi, but Cho lets him know that Nathan was only wearing the shirt because Heidi loaned it to him when she spilled coffee on him. 
- Jane and Lisbon go back to Chicago to attend Stan's baby's christening. She offers to help with his debt, saying she's the only one who gets to punch him. Stan and Jimmy tell her that they talked about Patrick and that they like him and that she better not mess it up. They watch Jane playing with a baby.
- Jane and Lisbon sit together on a picnic table, and Lisbon stammers, saying she's not sure she's said it, then admits she hasn't, that she isn't sure she needs to, but would he be surprised if she said, ""I love you."" He says he would be moved, and she tells him she loves him. They both grin, and he says he is indeed surprised.

In 1980 and 1986, two treaties were signed between East Germany and Vietnam, whereby East Germany provided the necessary equipment and machinery for production, increased the area of coffee plantations from 600 to 8,600 hectares (1,500 to 21,300 acres), and trained the local population in cultivation techniques.

In particular, East Germany provided trucks, machinery, and irrigation systems for the newly founded Kombinat Việt-Đức, as well as spending approximately $20 million on a hydropower plant. East Germany also built housing, hospitals, and shops for the 10,000 people who were relocated to the area for coffee production. Against this investment, East Germany was scheduled to receive half of the coffee harvest for the next 20 years. However, coffee takes eight years from planting until the first usable harvest, which occurred in 1990; at which point the East German state had already ceased to exist.

I’ve spent years building **direct response funnels** for eCommerce brands. These aren’t your typical marketing sites—**they’re built to sell immediately**. They focus on speed, clarity, and conversion, running separately on **subdomains** while the main site handles branding.

Over time, what happens? These **subdomain funnels** start driving **the majority of traffic and revenue** for brands.

A great example is **Javy Coffee**. One of the funnels I built for them, [this one](https://try.javycoffee.com/co43), got **800K visits last month alone**. And they’re not the only ones. Tons of DTC brands now rely on direct response pages because:  
✅ They eliminate distractions.  
✅ They optimize every pixel for conversion.  
✅ They turn traffic into buyers **right away**.

# Why Webflow for Direct Response?

I originally built everything in **Webflow** because it makes launching **insanely fast**:  
⚡ **Speed to market** – No need to wait on dev cycles, you can launch in hours.  
🔄 **Easy to split-test** – Duplicate and test different versions **on the same link** without backend headaches.  
📈 **No performance trade-offs** – You get full design flexibility **without sacrificing speed**.

Since Webflow makes everything so fast, I built a **direct response component library** to speed up the process even more: [**Pageblock**](https://pageblock.io/library/sections). It includes **reusable sections, scripts, and layouts** designed for **one goal: more conversions**.

# Now I’m Expanding Beyond Webflow—Where Should I Go Next?

I’m in the **final phase** of developing a **converter** that will bring these components to **other platforms**.

So my big question is: **Which platform would you want these components on?**

Some ideas:  
🔹 Shopify (Sections + Liquid)  
🔹 Framer  
🔹 React-based landing pages  
🔹 Something else?

If you’ve worked on **direct response funnels outside Webflow**, how did you handle reusable components?

*Grinder 1zpresso K ultra*

*Brewing methods employed: Traditional Cupping, Aeropress and V60 for all comparisons, with consistent weight measurememts of beans and water across all brewing methods for fair evaluation*

*I don't take cues or mention the flavor notes mentioned by the Seller, rarely have I found them to be accurate and the flavor vocabulary of each Individual is different. I am a strict adherent of the faith that there is no perfect cup of coffee and each individual has their own flavour preferences which are mutable and bound to evolve with time and experience. Be open to experimentation and trial, there are no bad cups, just different ones. I find it of utmost importance to keep nuance out of my flavor description, keeping it to simple jargons such as sour, bitter and sweet. The points I make note of when covering flavor are:*

*Separation of flavours; some varieties inherently allow you to distinguish tastes of sourness, bitterness and that slight sweetness specific to coffee and I will mention this as high seperation while others allow for a more mixed and emergent taste which I'd mark as low separation, while at times you will have something where flavors are distinguishable at the beginning of the sip while merge later to give an emergent aftertaste, such cases will be marked as medium seperation.*

*Taste travel; When you freshly brew your coffee and right around the time you can taste past the feeling of hotness, each coffee changes its taste as it approaches room temperature. For some entire separation of flavor order is changed as in if you were tasting bitterness first and then the sour flavors, if the taste travel is huge after a few minutes you may altogether miss on the bitterness and a new aftertaste might develop, or the intensity of Individual flavors might change. For such cases I mark them as High Taste travel, while if the intensity of flavours change with drop in temperature I will call that low taste travel. As some coffees give you different order of flavors as they cool down, most have a mere change in intensity of flavor which has nothing to do with the coffee bean but is a resultant effect of temperature itself.*

|Micro Climate|Medium Roast|Natural|Baankubedda|260-265m|



**Packaging: Ziplock not included, Hard to tear**

This does not incur any special cost to the Seller and given their packaging being designed by [SwissPac pvt ltd](https://www.swisspack.co.in/), this goes to show the sellers intention of cross selling and intentionally poor end use design, for all the fluff and certifications the seller certainly does not care about you the end user. To this day 250gm Packaging from [KaapiKottai](https://kapikottai.coffee/) is the Gold Standard in Coffee packaging.

**Roasting Profile: Uneven**

The coffee in each bag was roasted unevenly, within the same bag I could find a Light medium and Dark roasted beans. I found this oddity to be even across all the four varieties ordered.

*Processing img l80ug21pjqie1...*



**Processing reflected in cup:** **No**

The packaging itself has conflicting information for all variants save Micro climate. Quite hard to place this.

**Should you buy it**

The coffee offered by Araku do not meet the expectation set by their price, low quality control and bad packaging stand out like a sore thumb, You're on your luck if your particular batch has uneven roasting or not. These are by no standards speciality coffees given the high density of quaker beans in each packet. I would recommend these only and only if you're up for some experimentation. They have no sampler packs as on date, maybe this changes. Each bag did have a unique flavor so no complaints there.

**Ethics**

This being the major buzzword in third wave coffee movement, while Araku Coffee has an impressive list of certification, these just make money for the certifying agencies. I didn't find the effort, care and love in my bag. Their [Arakunomics](https://linktr.ee/araku6) model cannot be verified given the 'please wait...' greeting you at the annual returns page.

Dark roasting to coffee is quite like spicing is to curry, something to hide the defects of your produce behind. The Roasts marked as medium by the seller still erred on the dark side.  As a general rule of thumb if a Seller offers you high number of light roast you can rely on the fact that the beans are in fact good.  I find nothing special with Araku as a Coffee seller and even less as a coffee roaster. I hope their quality control improves as the beans they offer do have distinct flavors. Till then treat it as another credentialist peddler on the block. ",11,1739415025.0,IndiaCoffee,5,1.0,False

1io940x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1io940x/something_beyond_the_firebreak_part_1/,Something Beyond the Firebreak [Part 1],"I remember the day we left our small town of a couple thousand like it was yesterday. Our family had always known the comfort of familiarity—neighbors who waved, very few streets where every face was recognized. One day, my family finally saved enough money to build a home further out of town. The day eventually came to move and we drove twenty minutes out of town. There were no neighbors in sight—only endless, towering trees and a single, road that seldom saw another car. The isolation was immediate, and the silence of the woods was both eerie and absolute.

Back in town, I’d spent my days riding bikes with friends, racing along sunlit streets, and filling the air with laughter. That life was abruptly left behind. The woods, vast and inscrutable, offered no playground, no friendly banter—just the slow, relentless march of time amid towering pines and gnarled old oaks.

At first, the woods seemed mundane—just a mass of trees and undergrowth. When we first arrived, the woods were alive with movement. I recall the constant scurry of squirrels and the erratic flutters of bats in the twilight as if the forest itself were celebrating its new inhabitants. But within a year, everything changed. The lively chatter of small creatures faded into a deafening silence. It wasn’t as if the animals had simply left—they seemed to vanish entirely, leaving behind an eerie void where life once teemed. Even now, long after that summer, I can’t recall hearing the rustle of a squirrel or the flutter of bat wings. The absence of these familiar sounds was a silence so profound it made the woods feel less like nature and more like a carefully staged ghost town.

For most of the year, school and routine kept me indoors, and I soon forgot what the wild unknown felt like. My parents were caught up with work, leaving me alone in a house that echoed with silence. Without the distraction of a game system or even a modest phone to keep me occupied, boredom eventually drove me outside. Summer bled slowly into autumn, and with the cooling air came new, unsettling signs that the forest was more than it seemed. Even as the vibrant hues of fall transformed the landscape, I couldn’t shake the feeling that every rustling leaf and every shifting shadow was part of an ongoing, silent conversation—a dialogue meant for no one but the woods themselves.

I remember the day I stumbled upon the firebreak as if it were a relic of a forgotten world. Winding its way through the dense, shadowed forest, the firebreak was a narrow strip of land that had once been deliberately cleared of trees—a barrier meant to slow or stop the spread of wildfires. Decades had passed since anyone maintained it, and nature had begun to reclaim the space. Wild grasses and unruly vines now tangled together, yet the absence of trees along this path was unmistakable.

It lay there like a faded scar against the living, breathing forest—a trail once meant to be a line of defense, now transformed into an eerie reminder of human intervention. The overgrowth made it look almost otherworldly, as if it were a threshold between two different realms: the orderly, intentional clear space and the chaotic, wild woods beyond. For a moment, I paused to take in the scene, feeling the weight of history and mystery that the abandoned fire break seemed to whisper.

It had been about a week since I first found the fire break, and curiosity had drawn me back again and again. Something haunting about that path—its forgotten purpose, its unnatural emptiness—was the overgrowth whispering in the breeze. Every so often, I found myself wondering just how long it had been since anyone had walked this stretch of land.

That’s why, when I finally noticed them, I wasn’t sure if my mind was playing tricks on me. The footprints were faint, nearly swallowed by the creeping underbrush, but they were there—subtle impressions in the dirt, their shape unmistakably human. The spacing was deliberate, the depth too defined to be mere erosion or a trick of the light. They didn’t belong here.

I stood frozen, my mind racing through possibilities. Had someone else been out here? But who? And when? This was our land, deep in the woods. The fire break itself was long forgotten—overgrown and untouched for what looked like decades. So how could there be footprints?

An uneasy chill crawled up my spine, and suddenly, the quiet around me felt suffocating. I turned on my heels and made my way back to the house, my pulse thrumming in my ears. I didn’t want to be out there alone anymore.

For the rest of the day, I waited for my dad to get home, pacing near the back door, and glancing out the window toward the tree line. As soon as he walked in, I blurted it out—what I had seen, how clear they were, the way they seemed fresh. He listened, his expression unreadable, before letting out a heavy sigh.

“Quit freaking yourself out man,” he said, shaking his head. “This is our land. No one should be out here. Haven’t been for years son, I’ve scoured every square inch of this property before purchasing this place! I’ve seen everything out there, there’s nothing.”

That was the answer. Simple. Rational. No one should have been out there. But as I sat with his words, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been. And whether they were still out there—or if they ever really left at all—was a question I wasn’t sure I wanted answered.

As the days passed, I convinced myself that I had simply been mistaken about the footprints. Maybe it had been old erosion, maybe an animal had shifted the soil just right, or maybe my mind had twisted an ordinary pattern into something unnatural. Either way, I let it go. My dad was right—this was our land. No one should be out here.

Still, that lingering unease never quite faded, and though I continued to explore the woods, I stuck to the fire break. It was the closest thing to a trail I had, a path that at least felt structured in the midst of the overwhelming wild. I never strayed too far from it.

It was on one of those afternoons, walking along the break, that I saw something strange tangled in the branches ahead. At first, it was just a single strand—thin, dark, and swaying gently in the breeze. I stepped closer, my brows furrowing as I reached out. It wasn’t moss or a vine. It was hair. Long, black, and dry, like it had been there for months.

I stood there for a long moment, holding the strand between my fingers, my brain trying to rationalize it. Maybe it was animal fur? Some kind of weird plant fiber? But no, it felt like hair, unmistakably so.

Then I spotted another strand, caught on a different branch a few feet away. And another. My stomach twisted as I looked up and saw even more—scattered throughout the trees, hanging limply from the branches above me. The wind shifted, making the strands sway, and an inexplicable chill crawled up my spine.

I had no explanation. No rational way to process what I was looking at. Who would leave something like this here? And why?

I wanted to tell my dad, but I already knew how that conversation would go. He would wave it off, tell me I was making things up, maybe even accuse me of trying to get attention. So I never mentioned it.

Instead, I simply turned around and walked back home, forcing myself not to look over my shoulder, trying to ignore the feeling that whatever had left those strands behind was still out there, watching me from the trees.

At the time of moving, we had a cat and a dog. Our backyard, a small, fenced-in area, was the designated playground for our dog—a place she’d frequent to do her business, safely contained by a sturdy barrier. It was customary for her to return to the back door, clawing at it insistently, signaling that she was done and needed to come back inside.

That afternoon, I let Molly—our miniature Schnauzer—out through the back door as usual. She trotted off into the fenced yard, disappearing among the familiar grasses and dappled sunlight. Typically, I’d hear the reassuring sound of her claws scraping at the door once she’d finished. But that day, as the minutes slipped by—15, then 20—I heard nothing.

Just as I began to wonder if perhaps she was simply enjoying an extended sunbath, the home phone rang. Glancing at the caller ID, I saw it was my mom. I answered, and her voice on the other end was thick with anger and disbelief. “Miss Mary down the way says Molly is at her house,” she barked, leaving me baffled. Miss Mary was an elderly woman who lived four to five miles away on a dusty, seldom-traveled road. The idea that Molly had somehow made it there was unthinkable.

I bolted to the back door, heart pounding, expecting to find some clue—a broken fence, disturbed soil, or even a telltale sign of a jump. Instead, the yard was undisturbed. Molly was simply gone. There were no claw marks, no trampled grass, nothing that could explain how she’d left the secure confines of our yard.

My family had managed to retrieve Molly from Miss Mary’s house. When they brought her back, she was a shadow of her usual self—she looked hungry, almost as if she hadn’t eaten in days. I couldn’t fathom how she could have traveled miles through the woods without any sign of forced escape or natural detours, and my mom’s furious disbelief only deepened my confusion and frustration.

After Molly disappeared and we brought her back, I thought maybe things would settle. Maybe that would be the end of the strange, unexplainable things happening around here. But my parents' frustration—especially my mom’s—lingered far longer than the event itself.

No matter how much I tried to tell them that I had just let Molly outside, that the fence was still intact, and that there was no possible way she could’ve gotten five miles away on her own, they wouldn’t hear it. My dad was firm in his belief that I was overreacting, letting my imagination run wild. My mom was just outright mad. To them, there had to be an explanation. Maybe I had left the gate open. Maybe I wasn’t paying attention. Maybe I was just making excuses.

It didn’t matter what I said. They weren’t going to listen.

So, I gave up.

That evening, I shut myself away in my room, frustration burning deep in my chest. It wasn’t just about Molly. It was everything—the footprints, the hair, the eerie quiet in the woods, all of it. It all felt so wrong, but no one else seemed to notice, or worse, they refused to believe me. I was alone in this, stuck in a house surrounded by endless trees, trapped with thoughts that no one else would take seriously.

And then, like she always did, Ginny came padding into my room.

She hopped up onto the bed without hesitation, curling into my side like she belonged there. She didn’t demand attention, didn’t ask for anything—she just was. Constant. Steady. Unconcerned with the strange mysteries that consumed my thoughts.

I let out a slow breath and rested my hand against her soft fur. The warmth of her body, the steady rhythm of her quiet purring, was enough to pull me away from the frustration, the fear, the loneliness. I didn’t have to explain anything to her. She just knew.

As the evening stretched into night, my eyes grew heavy, and for the first time in what felt like forever, my thoughts settled. The woods, the footprints, the missing animals—none of it mattered in that moment. Ginny was here, and the weight of her presence was enough to anchor me to something familiar, something safe.

And as I drifted off to sleep, I let it all go—just for a little while.

The next morning, I woke up feeling… normal.

For the first time in a while, my mind felt clear, and the weight of frustration and unease lifted. Maybe it was because I had finally let go of all the thoughts that had been clawing at me. Maybe it was because I had slept well for once, Ginny still curled up beside me as the sunlight streamed through my window. Whatever the reason, I felt reset—more grounded than I had in a long time.

With that clarity came a sense of guilt. My parents had been angry, sure, but they were also stressed. They worked hard, and the last thing they needed was me making things worse with stories about footprints and vanishing dogs. So, before the doubt could creep back in, I decided to face them.

I found them in the kitchen, my dad already dressed for work, my mom standing by the counter with her morning coffee. The tension from yesterday still lingered in the air, but I wasn’t going to let it sit there unspoken.

“I’m sorry about what happened with Molly,” I said, my voice steady. “I should’ve been paying more attention. I won’t let it happen again.”

My mom let out a breath, clearly still frustrated, but she nodded. “Just be more responsible. We can’t be worrying about this kind of thing all the time.”

My dad gave a small grunt of approval. “Good. Just keep an eye on her.”

And that was that. No lingering arguments, no rehashing of the details. I had apologized, and now the expectation was set—I wouldn’t let something like that happen again.

From that morning on, I became strict about Molly’s routine. Whenever I let her outside, I went with her. I didn’t just open the door and wait for her to scratch at it—I stood outside, watching her, making sure she stayed where she was supposed to. If she wandered too far in the yard, I called her back immediately.

It was simple. It was routine.

It gave me control.

And for a little while, I let myself believe that control meant that nothing strange could happen again.

Every once in a while, my brother would arrive to shake up my time alone.  

My older brother only visited every other weekend. We were half-siblings and we didn’t share the same father. He was fifteen—practically an adult in my eyes—but he still had enough of a kid streak to laugh at stupid jokes, throw rocks at trees for no reason, and mess around outside.

He liked the woods way more than I did. His other side of the family was into hunting, fishing, and survival stuff—things I wasn’t interested in at the time. I barely knew how to tie a proper knot, and here he was talking about tracking deer by hoof prints like it was normal.

His visits were short, just a couple of days before he went back to his real home. And since my weekdays were spent alone, that meant any wandering I did in the woods had to be in secret. If my parents found out, they’d lose their minds.

He didn’t see most of what I did, since he was only here once every couple of weeks.

And even if he had, I wasn’t sure he’d believe me.

Over the next week, things settled down. The stress that had once clung to me like a second skin slowly faded, and I started convincing myself that I had been overreacting. The footprints, the hair in the trees, Molly’s disappearance—it was all just a series of coincidences, strange but explainable. My dad was right. This was our land. No one was out here.

With that mindset, I decided it was time to go back out.

I told myself I needed to stop letting my imagination get the best of me. The woods weren’t scary. They were just woods. The fire break was still there, still stretching through the trees like an open path made just for me. So one afternoon, I took a deep breath, pushed down the lingering unease in my chest, and stepped back onto the trail.

I followed it like I had before, watching how it stretched on and on, farther than I had ever gone. But this time, I wasn’t afraid. I wasn’t even being cautious. I was intrigued.

The fire break seemed endless, cutting through the forest in a way that felt unnatural. At first, it moved in a straight line, but then I came upon a large bend. It wasn’t a gradual curve following the land—it was sharp, intentional. It bent at an angle that didn’t match the natural landscape.

Then it bent again.

And again.

A winding, snake-like path that twisted through the trees with no rhyme or reason.

I should’ve felt unnerved, but I didn’t. If anything, I thought it was cool. How long had this been here? How deep into the woods did it go? It almost felt like I was unraveling some forgotten road, a path to somewhere. My thoughts were filled with curiosity rather than fear.

And then I heard it.

It cut through the air like a razor, sharp and shrill, piercing the silence so violently that it made my entire body lock up.

A scream.

Not quite a woman, but close. Not quite an animal, but close. A sound so unnatural that my mind couldn't fit it into anything real.

The force of it rattled through the trees, echoing in my ears, bouncing off the branches like it was coming from everywhere at once. It sounded distant—maybe a hundred, two hundred yards away—but the intensity of it made it feel closer. Too close.

I stood frozen, my breath caught in my throat.

What the hell was that?

Was it an animal? Was it a person? Was someone hurt?

No one should be out here.

I swallowed hard, forcing my voice to work. “…Hello?”

Silence.

Not even the sound of the wind through the trees. No rustling leaves. No birds. The entire forest held its breath.

A cold prickle crawled up the back of my neck. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

I tried again, louder this time. “Hello?! Is anyone there?”

Nothing.

The absolute, deafening quiet of the woods pressed in around me.

I needed to leave. I needed to leave.

I turned around, ready to make my way back home, already convincing myself that I was just hearing things.

And then—

SCREEEEEAAAM!

The same sound, only this time it was closer. Much, much closer.

I whipped around, but there was nothing. No movement. No shadow. Just trees. Thick, dark trees stretching endlessly in every direction.

I ran.

I didn’t think. I didn’t hesitate. My body moved before my mind could even catch up, tearing through the fire break, kicking up dirt and leaves as I sprinted as fast as my legs would carry me.

But the screaming didn’t stop.

It followed me.

Not directly behind me, not like footsteps chasing through the brush, but somewhere just out of reach. It rang through the trees, getting louder, as if whatever was making it was closing the distance.

I didn’t look back.

I couldn’t look back.

I burst through the tree line, my backyard fence coming into view. A flood of relief and terror rushed over me.

The scream came one last time. Loudest yet. Closer than ever.

I nearly tripped as I lunged at the fence, scrambling over it so fast that I almost ate it on the other side. My feet barely touched the ground before I bolted up the back steps, flung the door open, and slammed it shut behind me so hard the entire frame rattled.

My hands fumbled with the lock, twisting it, securing it, my chest heaving with breathless terror.

Then, silence.

I turned around, my back pressed to the door, and saw my pets—Molly, and Ginny—standing in the middle of the room.

Their eyes were wide.

Their ears were perked.

They were staring at me with expressions I had never seen before.

Not fear. Not curiosity.

But recognition.

As if they had heard it too.

The weeks that followed were different. I wasn’t the same after what had happened in the woods. I refused to be outside alone anymore—especially near the tree line.

The only time I’d step foot in the yard was if my dad needed me to help with something, or if I was simply spending time with him. That was the only time I felt safe. Something about having him there made everything feel normal again as if his presence alone was enough to keep the woods at bay.

But even then, just walking outside with Molly for her daily routine unsettled me. Every rustling leaf, every shifting shadow felt wrong. The fire break still existed just beyond the yard, winding deeper into the trees, but I never went near it again. I didn’t want to. I couldn’t.

Time passed, and while I never saw or heard anything strange when I was with my dad, the fear never truly faded. It just settled, buried deep beneath the surface. I told myself that as long as I wasn’t alone, nothing bad could happen.

Then, one day, we got a new neighbor.

About half a mile down the dirt road, a new family moved in. I don’t remember much about the parents, but I remember their son—his name was Kevin. He was around my age, and since there was no one else out here, we naturally became friends.

The first time I went over to his house, I was blown away. He had everything I didn’t—posters covering his walls, crazy Lego builds that looked like something out of a movie, and best of all, a gaming console. I didn’t care about the posters or the Legos as much, but the gaming system? That was something I had wanted for a long time.

We spent hours playing, switching between different games, and for the first time in a long while, I actually felt like a normal kid again. No stress, no fear, no woods creeping at the edges of my mind.

We started hanging out regularly, and eventually, I even spent the night at his place. It was the first time in a long time that I wasn’t constantly thinking about the fire break, the footprints, the hair, or the thing that had screamed in the woods.

But one night, after we had been playing games for hours, lying on the floor in the glow of the TV screen, I finally brought it up.

“Have you ever seen anything weird out here?” I asked, keeping my voice low like I didn’t want to hear the answer. “Like… anything in the woods?”

Kevin groaned. “Dude, stop. I hate scary stuff. I get nightmares.”

“I’m serious,” I said, rolling onto my side to look at him. “I’ve seen stuff, man. Weird stuff.”

He shook his head quickly. “Nope. Never. And I don’t want to. So stop talking about it.”

I frowned, staring at the ceiling. Part of me wanted to keep pushing, to see if he really hadn’t noticed anything, or if he just didn’t want to. But his reaction made it clear—he didn’t believe me. He thought I was just trying to scare him.

Maybe he was right.

Maybe I was just scaring myself.

So I let it go. I stopped bringing it up. Stopped thinking about it.

And then summer faded, the air grew colder, and the weeks crept toward Christmas.

That Christmas morning, I woke up to find something waiting for me under the tree—something that changed everything.

A brand new gaming console.

Finally.

Finally, I had an excuse to stay inside.

I didn’t have to go outside anymore. I didn’t have to risk being alone near the woods. I didn’t have to think about whatever the hell was out there.

Because now, I had a reason to stay safe.

That gaming console became my entire world.

It was my escape, my distraction, my excuse to stay inside. My parents didn’t have much money, so I only had one game, but I didn’t care. I played it over and over, beating it countless times, memorizing every level, every enemy, every hidden secret. It became second nature, a repetitive cycle that kept me entertained—but only for so long.

By the time spring rolled around, my birthday had passed. I was ten years old now. A big boy. At least, that’s what I told myself.

I felt like I was growing up, changing, becoming older. More mature. The things I used to enjoy didn’t seem as fun anymore.

Including my friendship with Kevin.

We had spent a lot of time together over the past year, but as I got older, I started feeling… different. Kevin still played with Legos in his room, building elaborate castles and spaceships, while I sat there thinking, this is for little kids. I told myself that I was past that. I was practically an adult now, and Legos were just toys for children.

Slowly, we started drifting apart. We didn’t have much in common anymore, and our friendship faded without either of us acknowledging it.

So I stayed home more. I played my game, over and over again, until the repetition started wearing thin. It wasn’t fun anymore—it was just something to do.

School came and went, forcing me to make the long journey into town every morning. I didn’t care for it. I wasn’t interested in my classes, and honestly, I wasn’t interested in much of anything anymore.

The only thing I looked forward to was seeing my old friends, the ones I had left behind when we moved out into the woods. But even that felt… off. We weren’t as close as we used to be. The distance between us wasn’t just physical anymore—it was real. They had their own lives, their inside jokes, their own experiences that I wasn’t a part of anymore.

So every afternoon, when school let out, I rode back home, shut myself in my room, and went right back to my game.

Back to my routine.

Back to Ginny, who would always curl up beside me, warm and constant.

And I let the world pass me by.

Eventually, school ended, and summer break began.

Just like the year before, my parents had to work, which meant I was back to my own secluded world—alone in the house, day after day. At first, I welcomed the break. No more school, no more boring classes, no more long trips into town. Just me, my game, and Ginny.

But within the first week, the novelty of unlimited free time wore off.

The game, the one I had played so many times before, had lost its grip on me. It felt empty, and repetitive, like I was just going through the motions. I would boot it up, play for a little while, and then shut it off, feeling… bored. The worst possible thing for a kid stuck in the middle of nowhere.

I started pacing the house, looking for anything to do. Something new. Something different. But the house was small, and there was nothing left inside that I hadn’t already explored.

And then, my eyes drifted to the window.

The woods stared back at me.

At first, I felt nothing. No fear. No worry. No stress. Just curiosity.

I had convinced myself that everything that happened before—the footprints, the hair, the screaming—was just my imagination. There was no way any of it was real. It was just the woods.

And besides, I was ten years old now. I was a big boy. Whatever had happened before, whatever weird, creepy nonsense I had let get to me, it wouldn’t happen again. Not to me.

I had all this confidence built up, all this new independence. I had spent time with my dad, learning how to do manly things, how to work outside, and how to take care of myself.

I was untouchable.

So, I made my decision.

I grabbed my shoes, took one last glance at the house, and stepped outside.

And I walked straight back towards the fire break.",3,1739414652.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

We were talking nonstop eye contact, even as I was driving off, we were looking at each other and smiling. We talk a little bit on social media and l even gave her my phone number. This was about five days ago and I haven't heard anything yet. We worked together today and once again, super communication, vibung, telling me her life goals, we work in the beauty industry, and I gave her a sample of something and I said not that you need it because you're already beautiful and she turned red and giggled and blushed. We seem like we have the same values and I'm definitely interested in her. But I just don't know if she's interested in me. She did have a boyfriend most recently who she was dating. They are now broken up. But just her whole vibe and the way she dresses, The career she's getting into is very male dominated grew up in sports and literally any of my coworkers that don't know much about her think that she is gay as well so l'm just a little bit confused. Again, we never had anything to do with each other until she found out that I was a lesbian and now the communication is increasing and I just wanna ask her out so bad but I don't want to be offputting especially since we work together even though my work is super lenient we wouldn't get in trouble or anything, but I just don't want it to be awkward please help me figure this girl out 🙏🙌🏻🙃",2,1739414122.0,LesbianActually,2,0.75,False

It's getting really repetitive and I need ideas for more interesting things to do outside of like hiking and nature stuff.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Today, I woke up at 6am. Took my usual coffee at 7 because the thought of food didn't seem appealing. I then got some hunger around 8am but was doing something and it went away quick. It then came back a little bit around 10 but dissapeared when I was ready to eat again. I then waited for my hunger to come back and I FINALLY ate at 12pm ( mind you, I am a BIG breakfast person, I am always hungry in the morning so this was unusal that my first meal is that late). 

I then ate an orange, 2 rice cake with pb and like maybe 1/3 cup greek yogurt with like a handful of berries, 3 halves of walnut and some honey. I then didn't get hungry until bedtime. I went to bed and couldn't fall asleep and was thinking about food but it didn't ""excite"" me like normal when I am hungry. I decided to then go try to eat, I ate some cucumber, half an avocado with a small piece of salmon, a fiber one brownie and a kashi bar. Nothing else seemed appetizing. I then felt satisfied and went to bed and NOW I feel like I can fall alseep. 

Is this normal? Does hunger ever dissapear even tho we NEED to eat? Like clearly, I think I needed to eat before bed because I couldn't fall alseep no matter how hard I tried. Now I feel like I will sleep like a baby.

Let’s say someone didn’t realize coffee had caffeine. They just liked starting their day with something warm to drink. So they developed a habit of drinking coffee daily for while, then stopped drinking it. They go through the caffeine withdrawal symptoms but they have no idea that not receiving the caffeine from their coffee was the cause of the symptoms. Would those symptoms be lessened by the person being unaware of what was causing them to feel bad? 

I would almost expect that knowing what could alleviate symptoms (in this case coffee) would make the psychological/chemical impact worse. I’m curious if anyone has knowledge to drop.

Today I went to give blood and unfortunately couldn't donate as my pulse would only fall as low as 106. I didn't really receive any guidance about coming back. I know it's a much more ephemeral metric than the others for them to advise on; the phlebotomist was sorry to turn me away and she and I both acknowledged it would likely fall into the appropriate range within a few hours of me leaving. So if this has happened to you and then you were able to successfully donate again, did you just try again in the next few days? Have you had better results from letting some time pass?
