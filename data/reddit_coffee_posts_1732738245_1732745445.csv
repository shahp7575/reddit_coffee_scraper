1h1gao7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1gao7,Donations needed for rescue Clemmons North Carolina ,"Original post below

Yearly utilities for my little rescue:
$21 monthly for gas = $252, $189 monthly for electricity = $2268, water monthly $68 = $816 totals $3336 yearly. 

Vet bills for the past 12 months (rescue dogs only) were $4983
Food (rescues only) $3792
Building payments $10,000, Fence payments $6000

Incoming donations for the past 12 months were less than $8000.

 I will not survive another year like this without enough donations to pay the bills. Thank you in advance for any amount you can give. Monthly donations are also appreciated! Phoenix, our little man, had his 6-month visit with his cardiologist Wednesday. The radiographs show his heart is a tad larger and he has a bit of crackling on his right side. Lil man is on a heart pill, Lasics and another pill to go with it. We also had him tested for allergies and after getting the results have ordered drops specially formulated for his specific allergies.  In less than a month, we've spent 
$125 (monthly) on Hills Science Diet hydrolized food, $268 allergy testing, $275 for speciality drops, $200 for X-rays, $800 cardiology visit, $100 onthly heart meds, and $50 for lasics and the companion pill. 
Any donations will help, even $5 adds up. Thank you in advance.

1h1ga78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1h1ga78/god_bless_you_all/,God bless you all,"I just wanted to say to anyone out there that’s missing family this season, God sees you and hears you and I know even when He feels the farthest away He sees you and remembers your pain wants and needs. Though not all prayers are answered He knows what you are facing this season and I believe with all my heart. He will provide you the peace you need this season. So enjoy a cup of tea or coffee if you have it and sit back and just talk to Him and listen for the still small voice. He’s  waiting out there and down here all around the earth looking for righteous prayers. So pray for peace! Pray for leadership and pray for the ones who are afar off due to circumstances and while you may be facing turmoil from your job or relationships I just wanted to be here to say sit back and relax and be at peace and if you have to work. Go with purpose remembering that even though right now is rough you are important and you matter. I don’t believe God goes without hearing your prayers and even if you are afar off from Him in this season remember He is there waiting for your prayers waiting to hear from you. Pray for peace and pray for your family without ceasing that He would prepare their hearts for them and don’t ask me how I know this but I do.

Jesus once told me for the ones who are afar off due to lack of faith  that if they will simply call on Him He will accept them. 

I remember the day I met Him I felt that by looking into his eyes He knew everything. He knew my transgressions and there was nothing  hidden but there was still mercy found in him. Still love in his eyes. And I know that no matter how far off you feel He is there though we can’t see Him


And know this 


No one has all the answers, life is always gonna be unfair but you can take heart to know that God is real and He will repay you each accordingly. So whatever presently is ailing you or bothering you just give it to God and know He hears you and is listening to your prayers 


He says to you as He did to me 



“If I hold the universe in my hands 

Why are you worried?” 




He said that to me in a dream and He taught me that all the other stuff life has to offer pales in comparison to His Majesty and plan for our connection to Him..


He truly is the alpha and the omega and though He doesn’t intercede in all of our lives at all times just know He is there and is real and wants a genuine connection to us all. 

I believe that He can use even the least of us to do His will so whenever you feel little or unappreciated just know you are important here!


So smile at others as you pass by them


Tip your hat and bless your friends family and others you meet.



And if you can’t do these things 



Pray pray pray 


The world needs more mercy and uplifted hearts 

And it needs men who love Jesus and women who love Jesus and would commit themselves to Him


So whenever that sin pops up try to push it out of the way and say lord I need you 


Scream in the secret place if you need to in your mind the name 



Jesus !



He will be there to answer you and lift you up.


He will speak to you in due time



Listen for dreams and the still small voice 



Wait for Him patiently 



He is there and is waiting 



For now give thanks as it is thanksgiving for the things you’ve had 



Both good and bad 



..

You wouldn’t be the person you are now if it wasn’t for all the other things you experienced

You are loved you are heard and you are seen


And if you feel like you are far from Him due to sins


Just pray for mercy. Pray pray pray!



Don’t think for a moment that God takes pleasure in anyone’s suffering..


Remember Jesus’s words 



I require mercy not sacrifice 



And the two commandments the lord our God gave us 




Love the lord your God with all your heart all your soul and all your mind 


And the second is like unto it 



Love thy neighbor as yourself




This world needs love and not confusion 




No fighting in the comments please 


If you disagree with what I’ve said 


I hope that you get to feeling better soon



All the world’s  pain and anger wounds my heart but Christ heals it.


Life’s not easy but it’s not supposed to be.



But Jesus Christ is easy to know and His burden is light. 


Carry the light in you dear brothers and sisters.

I am so anxious and worrying about everything and anything. I’m 14 weeks but I’m not really finding the anxiety is related to baby, more so everything else around me such as work and then random ‘what if’ things that would probably never happen in a million years. An example was, while travelling, convincing myself the plane would go down, the boat would get taken over by pirates, what if the captain had a cardiac arrest etc etc. Looking back now it’s ridiculous, but at the time I was so anxious. 

I started NHS CBT a month or so ago as I was struggling with bad hyperemesis making me feel quite low, but I stopped it as the guy didn’t seem to understand at all and gave me goals to leave the house/go for coffee/to a restaurant for 20 minutes a week. I wasn’t scared to go out, I was just throwing up constantly and COULDN’T go lol. 

I am under the perinatal team for bipolar, but I don’t see the doctor for another few weeks. Funny thing is, I’m actually a mental health nurse myself! So I’m not really sure what I’m trying to achieve with this post, just to see if anyone else has experienced the same or if this is common at this stage of pregnancy. I hope I’m not alone.

It’s been mostly amicable and ultimately I understand that we’ve grown apart. Hes been emotionally unavailable for a long time now. 

We’ve been discussing this for a while, have a preliminary agreement in place and are filing final papers in January. We have talked about being each others best friend and trying to know that part of the relationship, continuing to support each other, have coffee on the weekends, etc.

Last week, I found out that he has met a woman on instagram, asked for her number and has been texting her. When I confronted him about this, he lied, told me I was being “retarded” and then ultimately admitted it later in the evening after I tearfully told him to didn’t believe him. Then he said it wasn’t what I thought but also refused to show me the messages. 

I’m not proud to say I blew up. I cried and yelled, told him I thought we were playing by the same rules until the marriage was over, he was a cliche and an asshole for lying to me and calling me names when I was right all along, etc. I feel bad for some of the things I said and I wish I had been more rational, but after 20 years and with only a few weeks left to go, I just feel betrayed and it’s making me question my marriage, his ethics and just lots of things. He listened to me at first but now thinks I’m being ridiculous because I find it hard to look at him and tear up about it randomly.  Obviously we were already planning to divorce and both of us moving on is a real possibility, but I just can’t get over it for some reason. AIO?",1,1732745023.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

**THE PROBLEM**

I feel like the current layout of my living room isn't the best. It creates division in the room, but for me the sofa set up ruins the flow and I don't really like having my back to the rest of the room/the TV when I'm on my PC. Has anyone got an idea of how they would organise this furniture please?

It's a living room/dining room, but I use it like a massive living room atm. The desk has a monitor set up for my PC and Xbox and I work from home here too.

**WHAT I'VE TRIED**

I once positioned the sofa (1) so it had its back against the wall and facing the window (16). I then moved the accent chair (7) to where the sofa currently is, and turned the coffee table (2) around.

Even though my back was still to the room whilst using my PC, I still loved the flow like this and it gave me a great feeling walking into the room when it was positioned this way, but it killed me having to sit awkwardly to watch TV.

**WHAT I'D LIKE**

The ultimate layout would make the overall room feel comfortable and inviting with a flow. Room for a very small dining table would be ideal, but I would definitely sacrifice a table for a elite layout.

I can't describe what it was, but the feeling I got when walking into the room with the '*What I've tried'* set up was amazing. Every time I entered the room I got a 'damn look at this nice place I've earned and put together' feeling. Also felt way more welcoming and inviting.

**Other notes**

* Room size: 6.87m width x 3.39m length.
* Furniture dimensions noted in image (can post if needed).
* Height is no issue as ceiling is over 3M.
* Windows are floor to ceiling, so plenty of light would come in, even if furniture was there.

1h1g4ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriting/comments/1h1g4ko/scales_chapter_1/,Scales chapter 1,"The Three Kings




“In a realm divided by vast and enchanting landscapes, three kings presided over their respective domains. The kingdoms were known as Oceanian, an underwater realm teeming with mermaids and vibrant marine life; Solaris, the fiery kingdom that cradled the dragon's lair in the north and charming villages in the south; and Lunaris, the kingdom bathed in moonlight, where enigmatic creatures were said to wander.




Long before these sovereigns donned their crowns, a decision had been made to maintain the separation of their peoples. Each king, devoted to the welfare of his own kingdom, enacted laws that, while well-intentioned, often overlooked the repercussions they might have on the others. As a result, the delicate balance of Oceanian began to falter. The waters, once a sanctuary, grew perilous as the land kingdoms of Solaris and Lunaris overfished the seas and ravaged the coral reefs.




Tragedy struck when a member of Oceanian was discovered, a spear cruelly embedded in their body, left to perish in the depths. In response to this grievous act, the king of Oceanian summoned the first-ever assembly of the three rulers. With a heavy heart, he implored his fellow kings to unite in safeguarding their realms.




The King of Solaris, recognizing the urgency of the situation, was receptive to collaboration. However, the King of Lunaris remained obstinate, unwilling to entertain any interference in his governance. He harbored suspicions that the other two kings conspired against him, seeking to encroach upon his territory. Unable to sway him, the two kings watched as Lunaris departed, vowing to retaliate against what he perceived as an affront.




Undeterred, the kings of Oceanian and Solaris forged a pact. They agreed to respect each other's sovereignty while the King of Oceanian would send young scholars to Solaris, fostering an exchange of knowledge that both believed was essential for their survival. Thus, The Exchange was born.




From that day forth, each year, the King of Oceanian would bring a group of young students to the surface, granting them the extraordinary opportunity to dwell on land temporarily. These students were welcomed into the homes of local Solarians, where they lived and learned together, forging bonds that transcended their differences. The Exchange became a cherished tradition, celebrated by the inhabitants of both kingdoms.




Yet, the success of this initiative only deepened the paranoia of the King of Lunaris. He continued to issue threats against both kingdoms, convinced that their unity posed a threat to his reign. Thus, the delicate tapestry of their world remained fraught with tension, as the three kings navigated the complexities  of their intertwined fates.”




Fawn places the worn book back in its place on the shelf. In her childhood her father had read  to her “The Three Kings” so many times she was surprised the book still held together. She used to imagine the beautiful, colorful underwater kingdom and wished she could visit it. Now she was 19 and even though she still liked to get lost in the fantasy lands of her books she recognized them for what they were, tales to teach about right and wrong, good and bad, love and light. She knew the Great War that happened 20 years ago was real  but she was now a little old to believe the children’s tale. There had been 20 years of peace since King Hyland of Lunaris attacked the  kingdom of Solaria. They were safe now.




Outside, Fawn’s parents sat together on the swing overlooking the ocean cliff. It was a cloudy, misty day. A breeze was blowing the high grasses but the ocean was calm. Fawn could smell the salt air from her room. Her parents were always together like this. They never missed an opportunity to sit together, just the two of them. They were loving parents, and the three of them, plus their cat Percy, completed their family. 




“Time for some breakfast Perce.” she sighs as she lets the fluffy orange cat out into the kitchen. The smell of fresh baked bread and coffee fill her head. The fairies have outdone themselves again. Her favorite cinnamon bread as well as eggs and an assortment of meats and cheeses is already set out for the family, and a bowl of cream for Percy.  Although the fairies who provide for the family are never seen, they always make sure the family’s every need is anticipated. She is sure they know today is a special day. 




Today the young merfolk that come to the surface every summer are returning and with them Asher, Fawns best, and only friend. He has come to the surface every summer since he was a child as a part of The Exchange.  Her own mother had once been one of the merfolk to come and visit. She then fell in love with her father and somehow convinced Fawn’s grandfather, the king of Oceanian, to grant her permission to live permanently in Solara. The underwater king’s magic is the only of its kind allowing the merfolk to live on land. 




Her mother taught her alot about  Oceanian. How it was a peaceful kingdom full of the most interesting people, the beautiful places she saw on adventures with her three older sisters. Being a half mermaid, Fawn could swim underwater much longer than most. Her legs transformed to a beautiful tail of gold when she entered deep enough water. The transformation lasted long enough for her to explore the lagoon by her home often enough but she had never ventured where she could see any of the things her mother had described to her. Fawn also inherited her scale markings from her mother. The gold scales that adorn the sides of her face match her tail. There would be no doubt to anyone that she is part mermaid. Her coloring though she got from her father, her golden skin and blond hair with red highlights. 




Asher and her mother often bonded over their similar upbringings underwater. Scarlet, being a princess, grew up with Asher’s father, a member of the court. This year marked Asher’s last year coming to the surface. He was turning 20 and would soon be assigned a station in Oceanian. Fawn isnt sure they will ever see each other again and she wants to make the most of their last summer together. 




“Is that coffee I smell?” Fawn’s mother sings as she walks with her father in the back door that leads right to the kitchen. “As long as I live here I will never get used to this.” she says as she picks up the carafe and pours herself a cup. 

“I remember when Roman and I first told you about the fairies, you didn’t believe us for weeks. Thought we were trying to bamboozle you.” Fawn’s father jokes. 

“Well what would you have thought? You said yourself you have never seen one and even though Roman is king of these lands he never missed an opportunity to tease me.” 

Fawn’s father gave her mother a mischievous wink.




The magic of the realm is mysterious. It is connected to the land. As long as the land is healthy the magic thrives. The magic in Solaria and Oceanian is plentiful. The abundance of fairies and the Dragon’s Nest in the north of Solaria are proof of this. This is the main reason King Hylan wants land in Solaria. His kingdom of Lunaris has been depleted of magic.  King Hylan has used his reign to pull magic from the land and use it for himself. The subjects of Lunaris are known to be ruthless monsters. It is rumored that the lack of magic has transformed them into creatures with wings and teeth and claws. Fawn’s father does not believe this though. He has taught Fawn of the tribes of people who are native to Lunaris. 




“That reminds me, Everett”, Fawn’s mother says as she pushes her bright red hair off her shoulders. “Yesterday when I was at the market I ran into the Blackstone’s. They asked if you would escort Asher to their place when he arrives. They will be out for the afternoon and with sightings of the Sylvangaurd they want to make sure he gets there safely.” 

Fawn’s father scowls. 

“What’s wrong? I didn’t think that would be a problem. I already told them you would be happy to escort him home.”

“Not that, of course I will escort Asher to the Blackstone’s. I am just wondering why you were at the market yesterday and didn’t get me any toffees. I ran out over a week ago.”

“Oh you are too much.” Fawn’s mother says while swatting at her father. 

“I’ll believe the Sylvangaurd is here when I see them with my own eyes.” her father says his light blue eyes narrowing suspiciously. “Roman just wouldn’t allow that to happen.”

“There have been many sightings, father. They are hard creatures to mistake with their black and gold feathered wings.”

The Sylvangaurd resides in Lunaris under King Hylan’s rule. In the Great War they fought against Solaris. Their sightings have caused much fear throughout the kingdom in recent weeks. 



“Fawn, after breakfast lets get some of your studies out of the way so that once your grandfather arrives you will have the rest of your day to yourself.” her father says. 

“ Yes, actually with the sightings of the Sylvanguard I have been doing a lot of rereading about Lunaris and I have some questions for you.” Fawn replies. 



After breakfast Fawn met her father in the study. Everett loved history and he was very passionate about teaching Fawn about all of the lands and people of the realm. Fawn shared her father’s appreciation for the different ways the people lived and used their lands resources to thrive. Fawn picked up the notes she had with questions for her father after her readings. 

“Father, are the Sylvangaurd the only remaining native tribe of Lunaris? Or are they just the only tribe that fought for Lunaris in the war?” she asked.

“Well, no one is really sure.” he answered running his hands through his blond/red hair. “The other tribes haven’t been seen. Many were turned into creatures by King Hyland. The Dendrons for example who lived mostly in the treetops were turned to mindless creatures. They were very skilled at archery and when they were turned used those talents against us. Solaria lost a lot of great soldiers to their arrows, but they didn’t know what they were doing. Their eyes had turned a milky white and they would look right through you. The destruction of their tribe is a great loss to Lunaris. They were a peaceful people who were very connected with nature and animals. They could speak with birds you know.” 

“How did they survive living in the trees?”

“They lived in tree houses and had built a series of interconnected rope bridges to take them from place to place. Roman and I saw one once, when we were children, before they were turned, on our visit to Lunaris. They were very tall and thin with the kindest eyes, like they could look at you and know you. They could climb the tallest tree in the blink of an eye. Amazing people.” her father answered. “Such a shame to see them years later, mindless and crazed.” her father said solemnly. 

“Then there is the Frostborn. They lived closest to King Hylan’s castle so I wouldn’t be surprised if they really were all gone. They lived in the colder regions in the mountains. They were fierce, I suppose you had to be to live in their climate, but they were also a peaceful race before they were turned.”

“Did you meet one when you were in Lunaris as well?” Fawn asked.

“No. Their climate wasn’t exactly conducive for King Roman, or Prince Roman back then. Had he known what was to come he may have though. Now he wouldn’t even know where to look for them. Hiding in the mountains they would never be found if they didn’t want to be. That is enough for today though, leave me the rest of your questions and I’ll take a look at them, I believe your mother is waiting for you in the garden.”



The only thing Fawn loved more than learning about the realm with her father was working in the garden with her mother. They had created quite an impressive array of herbs, vegetables, fruits and flowers. Fawn knew every plant that grew in Solaria. She also studied the ones only found in Oceanian and Lunaris. She longed to see the ones that didn’t thrive in Solaria’s sun and heat, although she was able to get some dried plants from Oceanian thanks to her grandfather. She knew he would have a package for her when he arrived with the Exchange today. 



“Hi sweetie!” Fawn’s mother called, brushing sweat off her forehead with the back of her gloved hand. Her bright green eyes sparkled in the sunshine. Her skirt was covered in soil, and she looked vibrant. Fawn always thought her mother seemed the happiest when she was working in their garden. “I’ve watered the Foxglove already could you harvest the Belladonna?” 

Many of the plants in the garden had multiple uses. Fawn and her mother would create creams and tinctures which they sold to a shopkeeper at the market. There were also some not so common uses for many of the plants and they created those orders at special request. Fawn had asked her mother when she was younger why she did this. She explained that the women of Solaris needed to feel safe and her presence in the market as an option helped to create that. Fawn couldn’t imagine using any of those special tinctures but figured someone must be left desperate to resort to needing them and continued to help her mother. 

“Are you excited for today?” her mother asked. “Oh I am so excited to see grandfather!” Fawn answered.

“Just grandfather? No one else?” 

Fawn stopped picking the Belladonna berries to look up at her mother. “What do you mean? she asked, her cheeks starting to heat. 

“What I mean, daughter, is that Asher will be back for his last season with us. Are you also excited to see him?”

“I wouldn’t say excited, but I am happy to see him again.” She answered shyly. 

“Is that all? Just happy to see him? I would have thought after that kiss last year you would be quite a bit more than happy he is coming back.” Her mother prodded. 

“What? How did you? I don’t know what you mean.” Fawn’s faced flushed as she went back to picking the berries. She wasn’t sure how her mother had known about the kiss Asher and her shared last season. She hadn’t told anyone, and it was just her and Asher that night in the garden. 

“The Foxglove!” she exclaimed. “It was the Foxglove that told you wasn’t it?” she asked as her mother laughed. “That silly plant, has it got nothing better to do than to gossip about me?” 

“You try never leaving this one patch of land. I assure you it was the most interesting thing to happen near it in years.” her mother explained. 

Her mother had more than just a way with plants. They “spoke” with her. Fawn didn’t quite understand it but they plants could tell her what they needed or how to make certain concoctions with them. Some, though, had their own interests to talk about and apparently Fawn was one of those interests. 

“But forget the plants. Why didn’t you tell me? Asher is a nice boy and it’s only natural you would have feelings for each other. You have been friends almost your entire lives. Your father and I were much more than friends at 19 I assure you there is nothing to be embarrassed of dear.”

“You and father, or your and the king?” Fawn asked and regretting the words as soon as they left her tongue. 

“Yes, well that is quite the question, isn’t it?” Her mother answered going back to her watering. 

There had always been a bit of mystery with the relationship between Scarlet, Fawn’s mother, her father, and King Roman. All three had been friends at one time. The rumor was that Scarlett and the King were in love but that her mother left the king for father, the kings best friend. Fawn assumed this was the real reason they no longer spoke but her parents would never talk to her about it. Fawn wanted to apologize to her mother for the way she spoke but just then the clouds seem to part and sunlight spread over the entire garden. Fawn looked up to see the ocean sparkle. 



“Grandfather!” She runs outside down the rocky hills to the lagoon, the saltwater air making her hair stick to her face, her skirts picking up sand along the hem. As she gets to the shore she sees her grandfather. King Ormand, surrounded by young merfolk. As the young merpeople make their way out of the water their shimmering tails of every color turn to legs. The king’s magic also providing fashionable clothing. They would mix right in with any of Solaris’s citizens. She spots Asher right away. He towers over everyone but the king. She runs into the water to her grandfather and throws her arms around him. 

“Fawn, my dearest! I have missed you.” he says, wrapping his arms around her as well. 

Fawn breathes in her grandfather's familiar scent. Seaweed, lilies, and tobacco, just how she remembers. “You are so much taller, and a beauty just like your mother.” he says as he looks up and gives a wave to Fawn’s mother and father on the shore. 

“Oh, I almost forgot. I have a gift for you.” The king hands Fawn a wooden box. It is intricately carved with markings she has never seen before. It's beautiful, definitely crafted by a skilled citizen of Oceanian. 

“What is it, grandfather?” she asks. 

“Well, I don’t actually know.” he tells her. “It was found in one of the deepest parts of the ocean. No one has been able to open it. I thought maybe the two of you could see what you can figure out with your last summer together.”

“I’m always up for an adventure.” Asher says from behind Fawn. 

She turns and smiles at him. He picks her up and spins her around into a hug. Her skirts wet from the ocean spraying water around. 

“It’s so good to see you.” Fawn says to him when he finally puts her down. “You have grown 4 inches!”

“Just two.” he says back. 

“Well, I will leave you two to your summer.” The king places a kiss on Fawn’s fareheard and dives back into the water. 

Asher grabs Fawns hand and walks her out of the water onto the shore where her parents are waiting. 

“Asher, my boy, it’s good to see you.” Fawn’s father says with a hand on Asher’s shoulder. 

“How are your parents dear?” her mother asks. 

“Everyone is well. It is nice to see you all again.” Asher responds. 

“Have you received your court assignment yet, any idea where you will be stationed?” Her father asks. 

“Not yet, but I am hoping to be stationed in the North Sea where my brother is.”

The North Sea is leagues away from the coast where the cottage sits. Fawn tries not to let the disappointment show on her face. 

As they reach the cottage Scarlet asks Asher “Would you like to come in for some breakfast.”

“I would love to, but the Blackstone's might worry. I would hate to keep them waiting on me. Thank you for the offer.”

“That reminds me, I will be escorting you, some interesting things have been going on lately. I’ll fill you in on the way.” her father says to Asher.

Asher takes Fawn's hands into his.

“Fawn, I have so much to tell you. I really do have to get to the Blackstone's though. Can we meet up in the morning?”

“Of course. You know where to find me.” Fawn says blushing from all of his attention set only on her. “I'll see what I can find out about this box. Maybe we will have a lead by morning.”

“If anyone can, it's you. I will see you tomorrow then.” Asher kisses her forehead and walks away through the high grasses toward the hill with Fawn’s father to the city. Fawn watches until she can no longer see him past the hill. 

That afternoon and evening Fawn pours over some of her mother's old school books trying to decipher the markings on the box. Despite her best efforts she has not been able to translate even one of the markings. 

Just then there is a soft knock on Fawn's bedroom door. Her mother walks in with a tray of tea and biscuits Percy following closely behind. “I thought a little snack might be in order.” She sits the tray down on the desk. “Would you mind me taking a look? I know it's been a long time since I studied in Oceanian but maybe I could be of some help?

“Please. I haven’t found anything.” Fawn says, sliding the box over to her mother. 

Scarlet takes a few minutes reviewing the markings on the box.

“Do you see this mark? It is the mark of Tyra. That is a reference to an area of the sea back when it was divided into territories and not just one kingdom. There was much fighting among the lords of each territory back then. The territory Lord Tyra ruled is an area of Oceanian just off the coast of Solara, by the castle.  This box must be very old. The kingdom was formed over 200 years ago.”

Fawn had never been to the castle but she often pretended, when she was younger, of attending a ball there. Twirling around in a fancy dress, eating the most amazing foods and making conversation with interesting people. She knew both her mother and father had grown up there with the King but they had not been back. 

That night Fawn dreamed she was swimming in waters so dark she could barely see where she was going. It wasn't a frightening dream, she felt as if she was gliding, being steered by something or someone else who knew exactly where they were going.

1h1g3r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1h1g3r1/i_cant_get_rid_of_my_refractory_gerd/,I can't get rid of my refractory GERD,"After time and time again of scrolling and reading others' posts, I have decided to come on here and see if I could get any advice as well as relate to anyone on here suffering.

I was diagnosed with GERD about 2-3 years ago when I was living in Oregon for school (after getting an endoscopy). Hesitant to go on medication from all of the negative connotations around it, I started 20mg Omeprazole to see if it would treat it. It didn't, and I was put on 40mg instead. After a few weeks of using it, I felt like my symptoms went away indefinitely. I took it every morning every day for about a year or 2 and never really had any complaints. I then decided to ween off of it and take it every other day to a few times a week to none at all and I was totally fine. I even was able to eat just about anything I wanted with the occasional reflux into my throat that I would resolve with some TUMS.

Fast forward to March of this year (2024) - I moved down to Orange County and got settled in. I noticed my reflux was slightly picking up so I went back onto my Omeprazole and found that it didn't seem to be as effective. So I made a GI appointment and the Dr. had me start a different medication, Nexium (Esomeprazole Magnesium DR 40mg). I took that and found that it somewhat helped but still didn't get rid of my GERD and was getting frequent reflux. So the Dr. said he wanted to perform an endoscopy. So I did that and he found H. Pylori and said my LES was not properly working which I believe I heard from my previous GI. I want to say that I got screened for H. Pylori a year before I went to Oregon and it was negative so this must've been something new I contracted. I stopped all of my reflux medication and took a 12 day antibiotic and to be honest I didn't have terrible GERD being off the med. But there still was SOME reflux I was getting. So after getting off the antibiotics, the Dr. asked me if I was still getting reflux and I said yes, so he put me on a new med, Pantoprazole Sodium Ec 40mg. And to my surprise /s, it didn't work well for me. So then the Dr. decided to switch me over to Voquenza 20mg. And while doing this, I severely changed up my diet. I eat all of the recommended types of foods one with GERD eats. I avoid MOST foods you shouldn't eat - I still drink black coffee every morning because its been hard for me to give up and I have intensely cut back on drinking (I used to have a beer or 2 every day and now I have maybe a beer or 2 over the entire weekend). In addition to this, I sleep with a wedge pillow, I regularly go on walks after dinner, I don't sleep until at least 3 hours from my meals, and I drink ginger tea after meals. I even started taking shots of aloe vera juice before my dinners and I snack on papaya. I want to say for the most part lately, its not as bad as it was a few weeks ago where I was constantly clearing acid out of my throat. I feel it more in my diaphram/lungs lately than directly in my throat and I get that gross white phlegm still but the reflux its not as severe. But, regardless its still not completely gone. I still deal with symptoms whether extremely light or a short period of time every day. And what's worse, I also have started to get chronic anal fissures ever since it started picking up living in OC and I can't seem to get rid of those either despite trying multiple methods and ointments.

I have decided today to go off my Voquenza because I feel like I have extremely heightened anxiety, high blood pressure, head aches, short temper, and my stomach constantly feels like its turned inside out. I want to go back on my Omeprazole and see if combining this with my better eating will make a difference since it was the only medication I found true results in my experience with GERD (despite it not being very effective a few months ago).  I also want to look for a different GI because this one seems to just want to throw medications at me without any other types of advice or support. Even on my third appointment, he told me maybe I am getting reflux from stress and I am like the reflux is causing me stress not the other way around. I also want to point out that I get reflux sometimes randomly like maybe an hour after I wake up and there's times where I eat certain foods and get no reaction at all and other times the same foods are coupled up with a reaction.

To conclude on all of this, I feel so overwhelmed and emotionally tired from not being able to get this fully under control. I am definitely a hypersensitive person. I hope to see if anyone has any suggestions on what to do next, what to include in my diet that I maybe haven't already, a recommendation for a GI in OC, or just a relatable experience from someone else with refractory GERD. I hope this wasn't too unbearable to read.

Edit: I got rid of the 'C' word to protect from getting this post deleted. I was just stating that its a fear of mine but rather safe than sorry including it

1h1g3l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h1g3l5/idk_how_to_deal_but_im_trying/,Idk how to deal but I’m trying,"Idek if there’s a point to posting this but I need to get this out and I can’t afford my therapist anymore. 3 years ago, I (F, 44) moved into the 3rd floor apt of my parent’s house, with my bxtch of a sister (F, 45), her daughter (F, 7) and her husband (M, 40). I’ve always had problems with my mom but I always assumed that my mom just didn’t like me. Turns out, my sister is so incredibly jealous and resentful of me (for what, I have no clue), that she’s been gaslighting my mom and filling my mom’s head with lies about me for years! Fxcking bxtch is the entire reason my mom treats me like someone she puts up but doesn’t like at all. I’ve known that my sister’s been jealous and resentful since we were teenagers and stopped hanging out with her since then.. like, I knew we’d never be friends and that was ok, and I just moved on with my life. We seemed cool with each other in front of others, but we’ve never hung out since our teenage years and have never shared the same friends group since back then. I never liked her, never trusted her, but I never knew she was evil until now. Apparently, I’m too nice.. everyone says this about me. I’m quick to blame myself when someone bad happens, and my sister is VERY quick to blame others for EVERY SINGLE THING that happens in her life. So I was blaming myself for everything bad happening around me. It made me want to end things for myself. I had a therapist for 1 year, 3 years ago.. and she listened to my sister curse my niece out once and then heard me talk about a few things about my sister.. my therapist told me that my sister is a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. It blew my mind. I didn’t even know wtf a narcissist was. Turns out I’ve been allowing myself to be manipulated by narcissists for a long axx time. Including this bxtch of a sister.. bad things ALWAYS happen to her. Her life is the worst. She’s a 45 year old evil narcissist, who lives off of her 68 and 70 year old parents, her child’s disability check, and me. She smokes weed and drinks coffee all day, but tells everyone how HARD she works all day taking care of her autistic, Type 1 diabetic daughter.. she’s so tired all the time and gets no help from anyone.. no one questions this bxtch.. everyone knows the bxtch doesn’t work.. everyone knows my niece is at school all day.. so wtf is this bxtch so busy doing. If you hear her tell it, she does absolutely EVERYTHING.. while the apt is always a mess, my niece hardly eats decent food, I have to feed the cats and clean their cat litter bc if not, they get old disgusting food, and they’ve gotten infections from using the same dirty cat litter day after day. Today’s rant is how even though she gets to sit on her axx and do nothing, she makes sure she runs to the bathroom or kitchen when I need to use it, always when I have a small break from work. I’ve been looking for low-income apts bc that’s all I can afford. I’ve always been able to ignore this stupid bxtch but I have a deaf pittie, Blanca, 4 years old, who my sister psychologically abuses and I think has physically abused, but I have no proof. Blanca is reactive bc of the ways my sister messes with her and the only way I can reverse it is if I’m no longer living with this evil bxtch. Some guy stole $3200 from me last year, promising me a 1-bedroom apt for me and Blanca, and just never came up with anything, and hasn’t given me my money back. Idk what to do or how to get out of this situation I put me and Blanca in. I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and can barely pay the minimum on everything I owe. I took out $2500 off one of my credit cards to help a friend pay a debt, and she hasn’t paid me back anything in almost 4 months. I really thought, when I moved here 3 years ago, that I was getting a chance to build something with my fxkin sister, that we’d upkeep the house, and help my parents. I thought I finally have a home for life and don’t have to worry about being kicked out or forced to pay exorbitant rent. Instead she just wanted me here, to live off of me. The utility bills that I pay here are the most expensive I’ve ever paid in my life. I can barely keep up. I have everything on payment plans. She kicked her husband out shortly after I moved in bc he’s abusive and I wasn’t putting up with it. Her abuse was much quieter and I didn’t catch on to how evil she is until a year a half of living here. She goes through my stuff to steal. She “played” with my dog and then all of a sudden my dog had a torn ACL.. I have no proof, but I know she did that to my baby. I had my grandmother’s telephone from 1970s .. that bxtch actually stole it and sold it.. it wasn’t even worth much, she just did it bc she knew my grandparents didn’t like her and loved me. (My grandmother always knew she was evil, I realize that now.) I found the same phone on eBay and bought it for like $95.. it’s not the same as having my grandparents phone, but it’s close.. you should’ve seen the bxtch’s face when she saw the phone.. she was in shock and sputtering about oh, wow, you still have the phone. Her and her husband stole my DSLR camera and sold it. I have to hide food in my room bc she uses every fxking thing and, even though the bxtch gets over $500 in food stamps, god forbid she buys back the stuff she stuffs into her fat face. She barely showers. She doesn’t shower my niece unless my niece has school. My niece’s hair gets so matted and disgusting before she washes it, and my mom has to yell at her to wash my niece’s hair. My 7-year old niece still wears diapers.. this bxtch lies and tells ppl it’s bc my niece is autistic and has type 1 diabetes and can’t control being able to pee. It’s a fxkin lie. She continues to give my niece a bottle of milk in the morning and at night, and has her in diapers, at 7, so she can infantilize my niece.. so my niece can be more dependent on her. My niece is highly intelligent, reads well for her age.. her autism is like Sheldon on big bang theory.. she’s not a genius, she’s just not good with social stuff. She kinda repeats things you tell her over and over .. like the main character in Atypical. That’s it. Absolutely no reason for the girl to be in diapers. I HATE my sister. Just being next to her, every time she steps in my room, I can feel the evil coming off of her. 

This fucking bitch. My cousin came here to stay for Saturday and Sunday night, and then left on Monday to take the Amtrak to see his dad in PA.. apparently, my cousin left a bracelet on the bed where he was sleeping.. my sister is wearing the fucking bracelet .. and tells me to tell the cousin that she has his bracelet and if he doesn’t want it back, she’ll keep it. What kind of fucking bullshit world do I actually live in. She actually thinks it’s ok to just put someone’s stuff on, and then ASSUME they don’t want it back, and act like SHE’S DOING THEM A FAVOR BY KEEPING THEIR SHIT. It’s not enough that she lives off of everyone in this house, but she has to steal from other ppl too. 

I’m trying so hard, every day, to keep my patience and not say anything back to her, bc I know she’ll take it out on Blanca when I’m not around. Somehow Blanca always has a shxt and pee accident or vomits when I’m not home. But when I’m home, Blanca is perfectly fine. And I know this bxtch does stuff to her to create anxiety or stress or maybe feed her stuff she shouldn’t. This is like 1% of the stuff she does. I’m not even touching on the things she tells my mom. Basically she wants my mom to write me out of the will so she can solely own the house. When she was pregnant with my niece, I overheard her and her husband saying that they hope something is wrong with the baby so they can get disability. My mom refused to believe me when I told her. She likes living in cuckoo-land 🙄. 

It’s so hard to mentally deal with her every single day. My room is a mess bc every time I clean, this fxkin bxtch comes in and starts going through my stuff. When my room is a little clean, I start finding stuff missing. I can’t have any-from-thing. Deodorant. Body spray. Lotion. I buy expensive, organic stuff for myself. Buy your own fxkn shyte. Everything she uses gets finished quickly bc she doesn’t have to buy anything back. I use my stuff sparingly so it lasts me as long as possible. I stopped cooking bc the fxkn bitch eats everything and will leave crumbs and act like she did nothing wrong. When I tell you I hate her with everything in me, I mean it. 

I have a friend with a 2-bedroom apt and he’s thinking of letting me temporarily rent a room from him.. he’s been thinking about it for like 2 months now and I’m praying he’ll let me and Blanca stay there until I can save up to move out, or I can get one of these low-income apts. If I’m living with him, I would no longer have these huge utilities to pay. My mom would deal with it bc apparently they have no problem with her living off them. I can’t believe I came here to help them and just ended up getting abused by this bxtch and watching her abuse them. And they’re letting it. Absolutely crazy.

Not only does it come with the gauge, it comes with a magentic guide for your refriderator, a sticker and a plastic pouch.

I did some test grinding with some old beans to see how well the guide works and as you can see you can get a real good feel for how your grind falls and the recommended parameters for different brewing/espresso.

This will definitely be useful for when I tear down the grinder for cleaning and reassemble and recalibrate for my starting grind setting.

I remember that Levi ran a coffee shop and also Kenny was a pretty big part of it and I think he faked his death at some point. I think it starts with someone mistaking either Y/N or her friend for a target and attacking them and that's how they meet Levi. It ends with Y/N trying to escape a psych ward with the help of Kenny and Levi I'm pretty sure?

At one point, he didn’t respond to me for like a day and a half but all was fine there. 

Yesterday, we went on a great date. We went for coffee and we sat on a bench outside of the coffee shop. He placed his hand on my leg for a large duration of the date, I put my hand on top of his, and he kissed me twice, and both were instances pretty lengthy. Before we were leaving, he said we should go to dinner after Thanksgiving, and since we live about 45 minutes away from each other, he was asking for recommendations in my neighborhood or he said I could come up to his area. Then he walked me to my car and kissed me on my cheek, he told me to text him when I got home. 

He ended up texting me first (I wasn’t playing games, I just genuinely hadn’t made it home yet) and said “I’m glad we made it out of the app and into real life”. I texted him back thanking him for showing me a good time and highlighted a few points that we discussed, including something he was doing that evening, and now no response!

Im just an assistant for a social service, but interact w the public and a lot and a lot of police and lawyers. So last year i matched on bumble w a cute guy, but slowly realized I recognize him, hes one of the lawyers from my work. We talked back and forth for a bit I asked about his job he asked about mine, I kept it vague bc I didnt know how to say; I know you from work but you dont know me. So I let it fizzle and didnt reply to him for like a week. I went back with confidence to just say it...but he unmatched me.

Since then I saw him in elevator etc but never a face to face interaction. I felt regret bc he was cute and now he works w my brother (also a lawyer) and I have heard hes rly funny kind smart etc all the good things. We would have a lot in common just from dealing w all the same ppl at work. A girl at my work is also friends w him. So... last week we came face to face for like a 10 second interaction but he was kinda staring at me w closed mouth smile..i thought mayba he recognized me finally. his coworker spoke with me he didnt say anything. there wasnt rly an opportunity for normal social talk. They dont even know my name, but I know theirs as Im expecting them. So anyway, I let them in for their meeting and thats that.

Next day, I see him back on bumble he just redownloaded an account. I thought to myself maybe he saw me and wanted to reconnect. Wrong. I swiped right and he didnt and its been a week. So I guess I got my rejection. Cant help but feel he saw me IRL and wasnt interested. I def feel like I missed an opportunity to get to know someone. I find myself hoping to run into him a lot but IDK what im hoping for. he isnt interested. He doesnt have social media. So I know just enough about him to be into him without knowing enough to make him like a real person. When I see him out and about like in front of the builidng or at a coffee shop he doesnt rly look at me. I also feel too nervous/ intimidated by him to make eye contact honestly. So I am giving a closed off energy too. He is best friends w a guy who I also matched on an app (we all just happen to be the same age and single I guess). and that guy always looks at me when I walk by. This guy has a more comforting energy. Its as if he may recognize me but my LO doesn't.

How may I move on? This is delusional and also making me feel very mad at myself, depressed, and low self image. I miss the times before I knew who he was. Theres tons of attractive men at my work but I am only obsessed w this guy, who doesnt care/maybe know who I am.",1,1732743428.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

First month I lost 14 lbs. For how much weight I am trying to lose in total I think this was a little fast. Not that I'm complaining! I just think I need to focus maybe on eating more to slow it down a bit, especially eating more protein. I want to be sure I am not undernourished or deficient in anything while losing. I have experienced significant reduction in food noise. Now I sort of have to focus on ensuring I eat, and that it's actual healthy food, not just a handful of chips. Making this choice is easy now though, I just have to intentionally make a small meal a few times a day otherwise I would skip it entirely without noticing.

First few weeks I had some side effects, a little gagging upon drinking coffee in the morning, some general acid reflux later in the day. The third shot hit me the hardest, but I have leveled out since then and almost all side effects have gone away now. I would say I have some very mild lethargy/fatigue, but it is manageable.

Took my 5th shot last night, and opted to stay at the 0.25 dose against my doctor's advice. She advised moving up, but I just really didn't want to while 0.25 seems to be working well. I was feeling nervous about increased side effects or losing appetite to the point of not even eating at all.

I am focusing a lot on healthy changes. I have been a yoyo dieter in the past and it only ever lead to gradual increases in my weight because the changes were likely too extreme and I couldn't stick with it. Every diet I've ever started backfired into binge eating before. Once I lose the weight I intend to slowly ween off of the meds. 

I am so SO grateful for these medications to help jumpstart and see some results. I hope (fingers crossed) that maintaining will feel easier when there isn't such a mountain to climb to even get started.

It's strange how it all happened looking back. She kept so many things from me like being married before (she told me 2 years into our relationship when we had to declare it for a visa).

Her abuse wasn't physical, though she did push me one time. It just creeped in so slowly? It became harder and harder to see friends and family, she always thought I was checking women out. I remember one time sitting in a coffee shop and I just felt like I couldn't look anywhere, it was almost painful.

I tried to get her on board with couples therapy and I foolishly just figured she was insecure and I could make it work if I supported her until she wasn't as insecure.

The arguments were cyclical, I felt like I was going insane, she attacked my memory, stretched my finances thin. She wouldn't work or even leave the house it felt like I was looking after a dependent.

One night we went to cambridge for a mini holiday, she wasn't happy that I woke up and wanted to do some programming before our adventure into cambridge. We were in an Airbnb, she got upset with me, I got upset, arguing ensued. She then says to me ""If you ignore me, I'll scream for help"". It was the one of the worst experiences of my life. It felt like the scene from Get Out where he falls into his own body. I just cried but I couldn't move. I was paralysed. She apologised when she realised what she had done.

  
4 days later I asked for a divorce and she went back to Japan a week after that.

1h1ffbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1h1ffbh/anticonsumption_work_trip/,Anticonsumption Work Trip,"I posted in a handful of comments here that I had a work trip to a red state, and I wanted to use that as a pilot for anticonsumption in my life. I promised that I'd come back here to post, and I'm here to fulfill that promise.

# Travel

**Did I spend money on travel? Yes.** My office paid for my flights, and I paid for my hotel room, but I will be reimbursed. I also took public transit round trip, which is also reimbursable. My airline allowed for one free checked bag and a carry on bag. In my conference feedback form, I got preachy about how my office advised travelers to take rideshare between the hotel and airport despite having a cheap, direct route on the metro run by unionized workers. I also think not having time before my early departing flight was not ideal because I didn't have enough time for coffee, which I paid for at my terminal.

# Food

**Did I spend any money on food? No.** This, IMO, is my biggest accomplishment. Breakfast and lunches for the majority of my work trip were provided. This meant that I was on my own for dinners and food during travel days. Two nights before I left I cooked a large stirfry, heavy on vegan protein and fibrous veggies to keep me full. I portioned out a few servings, packed sliced apples and carrots, and also brought jars of almonds and blueberries for snacks. I packed protein powder and a shaker because I knew I wouldn't always be able to access the food I brought with me. I rinsed my dishes, protein shaker, french press, and water bottle in the hotel sink and brought my own silverware.

My travel times were relatively short, but because I was flying, I was not able to bring an ice pack through security. I kept everything in the fridge as long as possible and packed my carry on right before I left. YMMV with food safety. My hotel room came with a fridge but no microwave, so I ate my meals cold. I'm not gonna lie, I also squirreled away evening tea and snacks from the conference because I failed to bring cravings-specific food, like chips and sweets.

I specifically planned my meals with airport security in mind. I had zero issues on my first flight, likely because the airport wasn't yet busy with holiday travelers and I pay for expedited security. On my returning flight my backpack was flagged for extra security. I was asked what I had in my bag and where I was traveling. The agent took a quick peek inside my lunchbox and opened my container with protein powder, but also saw the shaker and put 2 and 2 together. I was careful to remember to pour out all my water bottles and not keep anything in my pockets to minimize security issues. If I could change one thing about my strategy, it would have been to use plastic containers, as the glass containers seemed to be the trigger for additional screening. I just don't keep a lot of plastic at the house, esp for snack-sized portions.

# Entertainment

**Did I make it through the trip without purchasing any entertainment? Yes.** I'm cheating a bit here because I've traveled to this city repeatedly, and it's not my favorite. It's sprawling, it's dirty, and I've already seen a lot of what I wanted to. 

Most of my ""free"" time was occupied with working on my presentations. I also spent some time in the hotel's gym, which was free for guests and, honestly, pretty good. I would have normally spent a lot of time and money in restaurants, bars, and museums. I went to one museum on my last day, but it was free and I walked to and from it. I brought one book from a little free library and another from my actual library to read. I took advantage of having cable TV late at night in my room, only to be reminded of how awful cable TV is. I walked to a park that I hadn't been to before. I took a tour of a weird themed restaurant.

Honestly, the trip was boring, and I probably would have struggled with that a lot more if I were in a city I actually liked.

# Socializing

**Did I spend money while socializing? Yes.** I minimized the impact here by bringing my own coffee grounds and travel french press so I wasn't tempted to socialize over bad hotel chain coffee. I carved out an exemption to catch up with two people who live nearby (but was ultimately unable to make either work). I could have grabbed dinner and kept the cost under my per diem, but that's not the point.

Here's where I failed: we had a networking happy hour, and after the open bar closed, I joined a group at the hotel bar. I was hired during COVID quarantine and have had extremely limited opportunities to connect with my colleagues, which has held my career back significantly. I had some good conversations and got some face time with colleagues that I have not been able to have for years. I did mess up by being less mindful about my consumption, especially in a crazy expensive hotel bar, but I was asked so many times who I worked for by my own freaking coworkers during this conference that I did what I needed to do to prioritize my career. I also bought $5 in candy for my coworker's kid's fundraiser. No ragrets.

# TL;DR: 

I had some advantages going in: I knew the city well enough that I wouldn't get FOMO by not exploring, I travel often so I can plan better than someone less experienced and have more travel gear already, I have a lot of reimbursable expenses and a per diem, and I gave myself permission to have a degree of flexibility as needed. This was still hard and frequently boring. I had some awkward but ultimately fruitful conversations with my closer colleagues about why I wasn't getting dinner with them, and I did my best to persuade others to minimize their footprint by relying on the metro. I wasn't 100% successful, but I did my best--way better than I have on any other work trip--and I'm okay with that. Progress, not perfection.

1h1fess,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobbedinStorage/comments/1h1fess/they_stole_my_fathers_ashes/,They Stole My Father's Ashes,"I visited my storage unit \[Seattle area\] last March, and my key didn’t open my lock. Many of you will know what happened next. The kids running the front desk said I “may have bent my key.” They drilled out the lock, and of course, I had been robbed. The kids just stood there looking at me. No apologies. No hint of surprise. I called the police, and the kids walked back to the office without a word. The cop who arrived didn’t do much. I told him what I could, and he left. That was it. 

At first look, about a third of my belongings were gone. Please understand, it was not my idea to store my things there. I had no choice. I spent almost a year homeless. Not sleeping under bridges or anything that desperate, but I had no place of my own. I visited my storage unit every week, and made every payment in person. Once I’d found an acceptable living situation, I returned to clear out. That’s when I found the robbery. 

With the help of a friend, I spent the weekend digging through the remains. Under an overturned cabinet, I found my original lock. It had been drilled, exactly the way those heartless kids in the office had done. The thieves had bought an identical replacement right there at the front desk. They even left the plastic package on the floor. 

When we unpacked my tall shelves, we found the thieves had torn down the metal barriers separating my unit from the one on the other side. I walked around and looked. It had a red company lock on it. There had been something suspicious going on in there, bad enough for the staff to lock it. Those kids knew. THEY KNEW. 

As for the things taken, it’s a mystery what the thieves were thinking. They took my backup computer, but none of my external hard drives. They took my two decorative chairs, but not the Korean coffee table. They took every comic book and every vinyl record, but no CDs or DVDs. They took the antique video game consoles and every game cartridge, but no posters or original art. 

They took a lunchbox I’d had since I was three years old. They took a large fluffy puppet a friend of mine built in the 1980s. 

They took no family photos or recordings, but they took my father’s ashes. 

THEY TOOK MY FATHER’S ASHES. 

They also took their time. My unit was tightly packed, like a Rubik’s cube. They disassembled everything, then put it all back, and cleaned up after. They had no fear of being found out, fully confident that the staff would cover for them. This was not a simple smash-and-grab. This was a well-planned and extended act of HATE. I am certain they intended to return for the rest, but my visit spoiled their fun. 

Here is where my story differs from many others. I documented everything. I had photos of the packed unit, plus photos and/or receipts for almost every item. I received a large insurance payout almost immediately, which has helped more than I can tell you, but it was less than half of the dollar value of the stolen items. 

I went further. I requested police records, and I found they’ve been called to that address almost 100 times in the last two years, mostly for burglary. The very cop who met with me had been there the day before, and a different cop was there the day before that. They felt no need to tell me this. 

I have met with other victims, and their stories are identical. Worse, even. Most of them were cleaned out, ruined. Counting the few I’ve met, the amount of loss was easily $100,000 total. Furthermore, some of them were told they had no insurance when they know they have been paying for it.

There are multiple crimes happening here. Organized crimes. The notion that every theft is unrelated, that a different thief is entering the property every day and acting on his own, is ridiculous. The company has removed all obstacles, made the units and locks easy to damage, and made certain that no video cameras will capture any evidence, making it impossible to blame the company. The staff are taught a script, designed to distract and deceive the victims. The thieves know they will not be hindered or even seen, and not in any way pursued or investigated by the police. 

I used the term “organized crime,” and I meant just that. Every person involved knows this is happening and makes a job of clearing the way for it. I suspect they even know WHO is doing the stealing. Given these circumstances, how could I NOT suspect it? 

When I bring this up in public, there is always someone who says “The same thing happened to me!” And again, their stories are identical. Look online for yourself. Read the reviews of any storage company. You will find my story everywhere you look. These are not rare cases. It is STANDARD for the industry. It is part of the business. The customer gets robbed, and everybody else stands back and watches. 

So here I am, left alone to carry the burden of loss. People tell me to “move on.” Why? Why must I alone live with the consequences? The thieves are facing no consequences. Neither are the office staff. I do not accept this. 

For the right attorney (and every private investigator in earshot), there is a lucrative class-action case here. MASSIVE.

1h1fdxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1h1fdxj/feeling_lost/,Feeling Lost,"I'm 41 years old and I was diagnosed seven years ago but, after experiencing extreme burnout and mental breakdown, I had an autism mentor who has helped me to make sense of my experiences in the workplace and understand the nature of my diagnosis. Everything suddenly became clear  and I am working on unmasking and being true to myself. Obviously, I understand some elements of masking will still be needed but I've learned to say no to nights out and events that terrify me. I am far more aware of what makes me uncomfortable and I'm no longer afraid of asking for support.

For my mental wellbeing, I am embracing life as an autistic person, but this has also left me feeling quite lost and lonely. I am realising my entire life (apart from immediate family) wasn't real. I wasn't real. Now I'm learning to say no to things, I rarely see my friends, I would love to spend time with them going for walks or a coffee but they all work full time and they prefer evenings. I don't mind making the effort, occasionally, but I feel like I just can't do big events anymore, like becoming my true self has unleashed a lot of social anxiety that I used to be able to supress. I would dread going out, not really enjoy it, but I think I enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing I did it and got through it. Now I'm loving not having the constant worry of socialising in big groups, but I feel I've lost a sense of accomplishment and now sit at home, bored.

Since I've taken life at a slower pace my daily functioning levels have dropped and I'm finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything. I'm living in my head a lot. I used to hate the fast paced life, but now I'm feeling lost without it. It's like my whole masking life was a lie but my unmasking life is lonely and boring. I really don't know who I am. I can't go back to that pace again, but I need something to replace it. I'm just not sure what. Anyone else felt like this?",3,1732742728.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

* Silver Jet
* Vapour Trails
* Escape Is at Hand for the Travellin’ Man
* Looking for a Place to Happen
* At the Hundredth Merdian

I'm sure there are more songs. I've listened to Phantom Power for the first time recently and I wonder what songs would fit the bill since Vapour Trails would have been the third song to fit the bill.

I've always loved the groove of Let's Stay Engaged and the lyric ""You got me to the gate with time for a coffee  
It's getting late, sounds like a departure."" They obviously have several songs related to travel and location. The last three are a bit looser, because I'm looking for specifically for tracks related to thematically related commercial air travel - the excitement of boarding a plane and going someplace new or the contrast of the feeling of a long business trip or vacation and getting on a plane knowing you're going to be sleeping in your own bed that night.",3,1732742720.0,TragicallyHip,0,1.0,False

At that time it was easy to get matches, and if I used boosts then during half and hour I could get high double digit matches. Now, I deleted the App around 1-1,5 years ago and got back on it a few days ago. (I would say I am decent looking guy, but no Mr. Olympics).

First of all, it went imo the awful way of all the other apps, of profiles describing every little, tincy, aspect of their lifes. Beginning from what kind of coffee they drink, to if they have any kink. That was one of the things I loved, the simple interface of the app. Plus, where is the mystery? Where is the fun of exploring?

Secondly, the prices are beyond crazy. 4.99 was the price of a monthly pro subscription. Now you have to pay more for a weekly price. 

Thirdly, I do not get basically any matches at all. I even tried buying a boost and subscribing to the paid model, to see if it affects the algorithm, in a proportional way (more money, more matches) and yes, i feel the needle moves, but maybe 3-5 more matches cumulatively (never worth the money).

Now, I now that pandemic Tinder and now Tinder cannot be compared in terms of outcomes, and I do not think that my attractiveness has suffered that bad in only few years.

I’m thrilled to share that I’m in the process of setting up an import/export business in the U.S., building on my already-established operation in Ethiopia. My focus is on sourcing premium Ethiopian specialty coffee, and I currently have green beans from the **Kembata region**—renowned for its unique and exquisite coffee profile.

If you’re a roaster, coffee enthusiast, or business looking for high-quality green coffee beans, I’d love to connect! I can provide samples of the green beans for you to evaluate and discuss potential partnerships.

I aim to be a reliable supplier and help bring this exceptional coffee to a wider audience in the U.S.

Feel free to DM me if you’re interested or have any questions! Let’s chat about how we can work together to share the magic of Ethiopian coffee.

Cheers

1h1f2a5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1f2a5,:BEs Coffee - Praça da Árvore,"Agora sim avaliação do meu café favorito. Terceira vez que voltamos e tudo o que comi vale a pena. 

Croissant - 16 reais - enorme, mas leve, gostinho maravilhoso de manteiga. Se pegar na hora certa ainda vem quentinho do forno. Usam manteiga francesa e farinha italiana. Tem muito carinho no produto final. O pain au chocolat também segue a mesma linha. De longe o melhor que já comi no Brasil. 

Choux Cream - 16-18 reais - sabe aquele docinho bonito e sem graça? Não é esse! Pedi sem expectativa nenhuma porque toda choux que comi antes foi uma decepção. Mas essa daqui, meu amigo, crocante por fora com uma massa finíssima. Recheios experimentados: baunilha, pistache e chocolate com caramelo salgado. Todas incríveis com destaque para esse último sabor. 

Bolo dark de chocolate - 18 reais - visualmente parecia que viria um brownie. Não poderia estar mais errado. A massa é areada mas com sabor intenso de chocolate, muito equilibrada e sem exagero de doce. 

Tartelete de pistache - 26 reais - visualmente incrível. Uma obra de arte. Sabor complexo e bem construído. Entretanto, pelo preço, recomendo experimentar os outros itens antes que valem mais a pena. 

Café drip - 16 reais- gosto de café, porém conheço pouco para fazer uma análise mais complexa. 250mL e dividimos em duas pessoas. Acompanha bem os docinhos. 

Ainda não experimentamos os doces com matcha por não ser uma preferência de paladar. Como tudo que comemos foi incrível, vamos dar uma chance pra eles na próxima. Ambiente climatizado que é uma benção nesses dias de 32 graus em São Paulo. 

PS: choux cream de baunilha comida em casa depois que minha bebê agrediu a choux de chocolate e derrubou metade no chão.

1h1f0ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1h1f0ng/does_he_like_me_or_did_he_realise_i_like_him_as/,does he like me or did he realise I like him as is trying to hint politely that he is not into me,"A bit of background info:I've (F) recently started a job at a new company, and one of the coworkers was friendly with me since the beginning. But he is a nice person and is very joyful/bubbly with a lot of people in our office, he kinda has a reputation for being bubbly/cheerful. We sit next to eachother so we often used to have small talk, and we started to get along quite well.

The turning point for me was one time when us two stayed overtime to finish a project and small talk evolved into more philosophical/personal talk - among other things, he told me about how he's feeling blue and that he's considering going to a therapist. I realised then how the ""happy-go-lucky"" hides something deeper inside and it moved me. I gave him a small hug then (very HR-appropriate, half hug). We left but this stuck with me so after an hour or so I left him a message about my experience with life struggles and gave him some advice and tried to comfort him. He responded very positively and the next day he was much nicer/closer to me - you could tell that was a bonding moment. We got lunch together and talked a lot about deep stuff and it was wholesome.

After that we kinda became closer/friendlier, and I started to have a mini crush on him. I'm not sure if he likes/liked me too, but we've been microflirting for a while now - lots of eye contact, he kept remembering very small details about me, accidentally touching my hand while reaching for the mouse (that looked very accidental but it happened multiple times). Also LOTS of teasing, pretty brutal, but I'm into banter so I would exchange it back and we would joke. I am pretty sure we were both flirting. (though in hindsight maybe I'm delusional?)

So anyway, on a team night out for drinks, I was a bit tipsy and got courageous so I sat next him at the table, and very slowly spread my leg until my knee touched his. He didn't move his for a while, then moved it, then put it there again, then got up. This whole time we would make conversation with our other coworkers but at least to me the sexual tension was there, but we were behaving like nothing was happening (maybe I'm overplaying this in my head and he actually didn't even notice we were touching? idk)

Then I noticed him staring at me - I would look at him and notice he is already looking at me. This happened a lot, sometimes he would very quickly look away, and then other times he would hold eye contact for 1-2 seconds with a blank face then look away. I took this as a sign and started being a bit more intentional with my eye contact aka doing the same/letting myself be caught looking at him, but not in a sexual way. The nicest one was when I was out smoking on the balcony and saw him looking towards my direction, so I was staring back trying to figure out if he can see me through the window or if he's looking at something in his part of the glass that happens to be in my direction. We were staring at eachother for 4-5 seconds, then he let out the sweetest smile and then I realised je was actually staring at ME the whole time, and I smiled back and blushed.

It got a bit weird after - when he started making jokes like ""I know you want me to come to the kitchen to have coffee with you but I'm busy"". A lot of jokes like this that to me seemed like he is insinuating that he knows I like him. And often times that ""he knows I like him but he is teasingly rejecting me"". I got shy cause I didn't want him to think I like him without being sure of his intentions so I tried backing down/making myself a bit more scarce.

Then I started to feel that something changed - it's no longer just playful flirting, it feels more awkward now, and I'm scared that I made it awkward by being too much. I feel like now he is being more cautious with his flirting because he knows I like him and he doesn't like me back. He now sometimes waits a bit when I leave the office so that we don't leave at the same time. Also at the latest team night out, he sat in a different part of the room, even though there was a chair empty next to me. I took this as signs that he is not interested and that I should move on. But then, I would still notice him staring at me from across the room,  or he would drop me a nonchalant message about random crap that was totally unnecessary, unless he wanted to get my attention.

Now I am trying to play it cool and give him space, but I notice hom staring at me all the time. But then, why does he try to keep distance? Is he trying to signal to me that he's not interested? Is he staring at me to see if I'm staring at him because he knows I like him? Does he actually like me and got shy? For the life of me I can't figure it out.",4,1732741746.0,bodylanguage,7,1.0,False

I have gotten my MRI Brain, EEG, ECG and everything is fine. Also no case of anxiety or anything especially this issue is since childhood so of course a child doesn't have anxiety...so it's physiological. Gymming and shoulder workouts with controlled gradual movements is helping me develop isometric strength and reducing the tremors but not completely.

Things are looking up and there are signs of better things to come. We have a few daily green candles going and the community sentiment has shifted there are more workers grinding for their bags than there were at ATH's if this doesn't show conviction in a project idk what does.

The sellers will run out of tokens eventually no matter the wallet size it's about preparing for that time so once we start to move more people will know the name and know what we are doing. 

* We are leading the space on IRL content including paintings, sticker bombing places, jumping out of planes and shilling to people IRL. We have plans for bigger and better things to do IRL.
* We are leading the space in IRL brand assets we have had community members make stickers, energy drinks, coffee and hot sauce is in development.

The more workers we have the more the general crypto population sees this and the more we are primed so that when we start to gain traction the more people will ape.

Our Dev has doxxed at the bottom when sentiment was the worst showing true conviction in the project and securing the fact he will stay here through the tough times. I don't see any other coins dev doxxing at the bottom or even at all they will just launch a new coin next week if the one they launched last week fails.

Our 90% retracement from ATH has seen so much redistribution and many of the snipers/early investors taking profits and dropping their bag sizes 730B has been sold by wallets which bought before 9 may (aka first time we went above 30m). If we don't include CEX's this means we have the most decentralised token right now so no one can dump the chart once we start moving. We have seen this in other coins like $GIGA which had 1 wallet destroy the chart from $600m mc to $200m mc in one sell.

HODLing can be a difficult game especially when trading with emotion but I have never been more bullish on a coin that's down 90% I think Murad's comment is so good about these times. If the coin survives this (which it has) it has only the real ones left and they are running it up.

Started working part-time at 17 while in college, and have only worked full time jobs since I graduated college at age 20. 

A few months ago I got laid off by a company. Job search hasn’t been going well, the best offer I have gotten is my current job. The hourly rate is good, but the job itself is part-time and there is no guaranteed hours. I could be working 20 hours this week and only have 5-10 hours next week. During the busy season of the year (around 3-4 months in the middle of the year) I may get full time hours and even overtime. This unstable income pattern is not ideal, but I took it due to 1) the benefits (same benefits as full time employee) 2) the sign-on bonus and 3) I think bringing in some income is better than none. 

What would you do if you were in my position? When I worked part-time in college, it was mostly retail and I enjoyed preparing coffee beverage so I thought about working as a part-time barista, but then during the busy season at my “main job” I can’t keep up with the hours. And I’ll be honest, the local coffee shops I applied to rejected me. I haven’t had retail experience for years since I started working full time.

I thought about trading stocks to make some money in the meantime. I used to work in a brokerage firm and have some knowledge, but my capital is not big enough to bring in significant income from this. 

Another idea I had was to start a business (drive-thru coffee shop). With no experience as a business owner, I wanted to start a franchise first but I don’t have enough liquid capital to apply. I have always thought about this but my plan was always to start when I am in my mid-30’s. I believe I would have more savings and financial stability by then.

I still see my part-time job as a blessing, I am grateful to have a job in this economy and job market. Part-time income is not sustainable but I believe this can be an opportunity to explore something else. Any thoughts/ideas are highly appreciated. Thanks!",1,1732741106.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

Welcome to the wild world of crypto! 🐊 Here, fortunes are made, memes are born, and every transaction feels like a high-stakes adventure.

# Why QR Codes Rule the Crypto Kingdom

First things first: why do QR codes matter in crypto? Think of them as your digital treasure maps. Instead of typing in those *ridiculously long* Bitcoin addresses (seriously, who designed those?), you scan a QR code. Easy-peasy.

QR codes are fast, secure, and practically foolproof. Plus, they scream *""I’m living in the future!""* at anyone watching. But generating these magical codes used to be a hassle—until the Bitcoin QR Generator Alligator App splashed onto the scene.

# Meet the Alligator App: Your Crypto BFF

4. **Secure as a Fort Knox Swamp** 🔒🐊 Your Bitcoin addresses are handled with the utmost care. The app doesn’t store your data—it’s like an alligator that bites but doesn’t hold on. Safety first, always.

# Scenario 1: The Lightning-Quick Payment

You’re at a Bitcoin-friendly coffee shop, craving a latte. The barista gives you their Bitcoin address, but you’re not about to type out 34 random characters in front of the whole line. Instead, you whip out your Bitcoin QR Generator Alligator App, scan their QR code, and pay like a pro.

# Why “Alligator”? A Crypto Metaphor

Okay, let’s address the elephant—or rather, the alligator—in the room. Why an alligator?

Because crypto is a jungle. It’s thrilling but filled with risks, from phishing scams to human errors in transactions. The Bitcoin QR Generator Alligator App is like your trusty guide, chomping through the underbrush and making sure you navigate safely.

Have wrote a few stories over the years, but never published anything. This isn't necessarily for the competition, as I didn't fully read the rules, but loved the idea/theme of Christmas so figured I'd give it a shot. Have got a lot of inspiration from CW's stories, so if anything seems taken from it, i apologize in advanced. I'll certainly be writing a chapter 2, i mean we haven't even met Sara yet.

  
December 24, Christmas Eve, the jolliest time of the year. Or whatever the hell they say, that sure isn’t the case for a poor old cuckold like me. No instead Christmas brings on a whole wave of emotions, making me think back to times where I got to be part of the festivities and enjoy myself, now a days I’m just hired help – with none of the pay or respect.

I arrived at 7:30 am, knocking on the door of Brad’s Parents house. Let’s not miss any details, Brad is the man my wife cheated on me with for many years. He is Tall, rude and Muscular, about the opposite of my Short, Submissive weak build.

Linda, Brad’s mother, opens the door in her Night dress and walks away without saying a word. I know the drill, I do weekly cleanings of the house, she will have a list of my “Chores” on the table, which I’m expected to complete. If she needs anything, that will be the only time she talks to me.

I go to the Kitchen, Brad’s Father Alan is sitting at the table sipping on a coffee, browsing something on his iPad. He looks over at me and smirks when they first found out that Brad was moving in with my darling Sara and I would remain in their life as a Lackey, he couldn’t help but laugh. He’s a hardworking mechanic, who has always been his way or the highway type guy, which I’d imagine is exactly where Brad got it from.

“Hey prick, I see you’re here nice and early, good to hear Linda has a list and a half for you to do, but before you do that I need you to go grab my softball gear out of my truck and give it a wash, my cleats a clean and a polish for our Christmas Eve Softball Tournament” Great the fun begins – I should have expected this, I was up until 2:00 am polishing Brads shoes last night.

I reply, “Yes Sir”, but he is already looking back at his iPad, he knows what he says will be done. I run to his truck and find his old softball bag, taking the bag to the laundry room and open it up. Ughhh it stinks, a bit from sweat, a bit from sitting in the truck and whatever else builds up in that bag. I take out his white socks, well once white but muddy and dirty.

Now to give you some back story about Brad, is he loves to make up rules that I’m to follow. They don’t always make sense, they aren’t always fair, and truthfully, they get on my nerves.  But that isn’t for me to choose, the rule for doing Laundry, is I’m expected to “Pre-soak” any socks prior to putting them into the washing machine. Easy enough right? Well… Pre-soaking involves me putting the sock in my mouth, and sucking, ensuring the full thing gets wet.

Do you think a wimp like me is going to look at these gross socks, that likely have been sitting in the bag for weeks, and pretend I pre-soaked and lie to my superiors if they even bothered to ask? I wish I could tell you I did, but I put those gross soaks in my mouth, I won’t get to know the taste in detail, but it sure wasn’t good. After doing my ritual, in goes the socks, shorts, shirt and hat into the laundry machine, now to deal with the cleans….

I’m sure you can guess it, but I don’t get to just take a cloth and cleats, no that would make to much sense… It’s time for the “Pre-soak”, looking at the cleats, I’m already gagging, Dirt, Grass, and whatever that yellow thing stuck to it is stuck to the bottom. Well, it’s got to be done, I pull that size 12 shoe to my face and start licking, swallowing any grime, gunk or whatever else seems to be hiding amongst.

After cleaning the cleats, and throwing the laundry into the dryer, I know it’s time to start on Linda’s list. With the taste of failure in my mouth, I go grab the list from the kitchen calendar. And wow… I was expecting it to be a busy day, but I wasn’t expecting a list like this. I’ve went ahead and attached the list below, you can read it or skip on by.

·         Clean Garage fridge

·         Clean all 3 bathrooms

·         Dust full house

·         Mop all floors in house

·         Take garbage out

·         Laundry basket in guest bathroom (Handwash all Hosery!)

·         Wash all dishes

·         Put extension in Dining room table

·         Go to attic and find Christmas tablecloth, set up table for 6

·         Run to beer store and get beer, wine and vodka

·         Drop off packages in entry way

Sounds like a fun Christmas Eve, and I’m sure this is just list one of many that will be created. I guess I better get started on it all.

While I’m doing my chores, I hear Alan giving me a call “Yo bitch, where the fuck is my Softball stuff I’m about to go, can’t you do anything right.” Ahh…. “Sorry sir, the laundry has 15 minutes left in it, but it may be dry now” I reply, timidly knowing that pissing Alan off would not go in my favour. “I need to leave now, get it for me” Alan responds. Thankfully it was all dry, I put it in his bag and ran it to him.

Linda and Alan were in the entry way, Linda points at her Blundstones and says “Put them on we have to go” I put the boots on, they walk out the door, not another word said

I continue with my tasks, knowing that this evening I will get to see my Darling Sara, which makes all of this treatment worth it all. She rarely has any interest in my anymore, and if Brad wasn’t so messy, likely wouldn’t even keep me around, as she was always a clean one. But I know one day, she will get frustrated with it all, and she will remember all the good thing I did for her and take me back. But for now, I’ll be scrubbing toilets.",3,1732740646.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

ANXIETY.","I’m 21 M, I recently got food poisoning and was forced to not vape or drink coffee, obv. didn’t wanna watch porn either. I’ve been doing all three on and off for 5+ years.

Brain Fog, Anxiety:
The first two days I had experienced EXTREME brain fog! It was so horrible it put me in a constant state of stress and anxiety. If you experienced the same you’re not alone and you are gonna survive. The brain fog went away after about 2 days for me. 

Stress, Burnout:
Prior to this, I started vaping again so I could complete college assignments easier and now that I’ve stopped I’ve also experienced an extreme burnout.

Depression, Apathy:
The feelings of depression and apathy were very strong on the first two days as well. I thought my brain would never repair itself but I kept focusing on “tomorrow will be a little better.”

How I have coped:
What really helped me was researching similar stories to mine. Setting daily goals and staying busy. Being truthful with my family and friends and spending as much time with family as possible. And not staying in my room unless I’m sleeping or cleaning. Eating nutritious foods and taking multivitamins. Getting sunlight exposure. Exercising as much as possible. Taking cold showers. 

Other:
It’s day 4 of my detox. On day 1 and 2 I did hit my vape once or twice in the entire day to quit somewhat slow-turkey. I never want to be dependent on my vape again or experience these withdrawals which is why I know I will never vape again. 

The weird thing is I’m not even craving my vape. The worst thing right now is depression, apathy and stress. But it’s getting a little better everyday.

* \-Water is disbursed intermittently
* \-The interval between pours varies randomly from 5 to 30 seconds.
* \- The longer the intermissions, the more water is disbursed—following a proprietary chaos algorithm that also prevents the cone from overflowing.
* \- Water temperature fluctuates unpredictably between 175°F/80°C and 205°F/95°C
* \- The beep signaling the end of brewing is delayed anywhere from 3 to 211  seconds

Why did Christopher Tolkien omit the small details about Idril’s actions during the fall of Gondolin in the published Silmarillion?

In the Book of Lost Tales she arrays herself and Earendil in chainmail at the onset of the attack. 

She fights “like a tigress” against Maeglin when he takes her and Earendil captive. 

She insists on waiting for Tuor with minimal guards while sending Earendil to safety through the Secret Way with the bulk of her guards. 

And then she goes about the city rescuing elves and smiting bands of orcs with her small band “and could not be dissuaded from bearing a sword”. 

In the Silmarillion I believe she is just rescued from Maeglin by Tuor and they then flee down the Secret Way. It’s not an egregious omission but it is curious. Including it wouldn’t contradict anything else in the published Silmarillion and would just add to her characterization. ",6,1732740336.0,TheSilmarillion,8,0.88,False

1h1eehb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1h1eehb/feeling_hopeless_after_cheating_on_someone_i_love/,Feeling hopeless after cheating on someone I love.,"Me and my boyfriend had been together for 10 years. A month before my our 10 year anniversary, so on my birthday he came from California to break up with me. We met in university when we were 18. We were still kids. We both finished our bachelors, and did our masters. It took me more time to complete my masters degree and by the time I completed it, he already had a job in Toronto. I have been struggling to find work for 1.75 years now since completing my masters. It also doesnt help that I have been incredibly depressed these 1.75 years since that is when he took the job to move to California. We were both from Toronto. When he first told me about his job offer that he had worked extremely hard for, I was not supporting or enthusiastic like the rest of his friends were. He was very hurt by that. I honestly did try to put on a smile but him moving out there just terrified me. It meant that the only way I could be with him was to find a job in my field out there in California. Not only is it hard enough to get accepted at all to one of the companies there but it's even harder still because I am Canadian and im sure they would all give priority to hiring Americans.

Ok so now I have been struggling to find a job for over two years and only gotten one interview at the company he works at in California. I have been applying everywhere though, including Toronto and other parts of Canada -- and that interview is only thanks to him. 

Fast forward to just a couple months ago, it's my birthday. He visits Toronto from California for the 10th time over the past 2 years. He says this is going to be his absolute last time. He has stopped saying ""I love you"" for a year now and he even sat down and talked to me and told me that he sees so future with me as a romantic partner. None at all. This was a year before my birthday breakup and hearing this from his absolutely shattered me but we kept on going through the motions. I guess we just could not let each other go. So now this birthday breakup has been a year coming, and we both feel this is it. So he visits Toronto for 10 days, we spend the last day of those 10 doing whatever I wanted because he wanted to make me feel like it was still a special day because it was my birthday. Now my birthday is over, we come home later at 2am after hanging out with our friends. He has his flight at 6am. We quickly pack his things, make sure he didnt forget anything, and I drive him to the airport. We say goodbye at the car and I get out of the car and hug him. I don't want to ever let him go. He is crying as well. We say goodbye. He says I love you to me for the first time in I can't even remember how long. I say I love you to him too. And that's it. He says we can still stay in contact. 

Now around 3 weeks after this my friend convinces me to download some dating app because I am feeling really depressed and heartbroken about him still and I can't even function. I can't even look for jobs anymore or go about my daily life. The weather is shit in Toronto too and dark and cloudy and rainy all the time and I don't even step outside for days on end. So my friend downloads the app on my phone. She says she will make my profile, I just need to help her pick the pics. I am hesitant but say ok. We start swiping and I feel extremely uncomfortable. But she says ""it's no big deal. just see it as a game. youre just going to talk to people anyways. you dont have to meet anyone""

So I end up getting a bunch of matches over the next week or so and I narrow it down to a few and then the week after I have a few dates lined up. My ex still had my location at this point and he tracks me on the second date I went on - with this guy lets call him S. My ex calls me up when I get home from the date and is completely a wreck. having a total breakdown and sobbing so so much.I only kissed S in his car after the coffee date (I also bring him back up to my place and we cuddle on the couch)  and I lie and tell my ex my first date with this second guy, S,  is my first date ever since him. He is visibly upset but I am still trying to move on and get over him because he doesn’t want to commit to me just yet so I tell him I have a few more dates lined up this week and I won’t get physical with them because it feels wrong to do that with someone else. I genuinely mean this at the time. The day after this he send me a list of all the things he wants me to fix myself before we can be back together and honestly it’s just things that I should want to better myself anyways(make a more open relationship with my parents, get therapy, get my physical health in order and go to the gym more, get mental health in order and find motivation to look for jobs again). He says to send him a list like this for things about himself and once we both have our lists we will commit to each other and start working on our relationship together. I say ok but give me a week.

 

Then a few days after this is our anniversary, we have FaceTime sex. And a two days after that I have a date with a guy (let’s call him E) who I find really attractive but he looks the exact opposite of my ex. We go to a restaurant. I have one drink and some fries, he had 4 drinks no food. After we stay in the restaurant for a while and he kisses me while we are there and then we say let’s head out. We go back to my car  (I had driven us from the first spot which was closed when we got there to this second spot, he used transit to get to the first spot and I drove) and we talk about if we should go anywhere next. We end up just making out for 15 minutes in the car. He tries to touch me between the thighs but I am wearing a LOT of layers so he doesn’t really reach anything that I can feel at least. I touch him above the pants. He touches me below my shirt. Things get steamy and he says he wants to fuck me in the backseat right now but I say no and drive him home. The next day we are sending flirty texts back and forth, and I see E again. We have sex late that night. He stays over and we have sex again in the morning and he leaves quickly because he says he is getting late for church. (My first date with him was Friday and then he comes over Saturday night to have sex.)

At this point my ex is saying that he want to make things work between us I tell him I have deleted the app. I tell him this in the morning but I delete the app later that day after going on a quick ice cream date that afternoon. I had zero connection with this ice cream guy btw. I just mainly held onto the ice cream date because I felt bad cancelling last minute and I wanted a sweet treat. The ice cream date comes and goes. There is 0 connection with this guy. My ex still has my location and asks me what I was doing when he saw me at the ice cream place. I lied and said I was just chilling by myself.

A few days after this I talk to my ex and tell him I had sex with E but I told him it was a one time thing and we did in the car after the restaurant and I never saw him again — which is a lie.  When I am telling him all this he keeps very calm but then later that night he says its too much for him and he wants to go no contact with me now. I try to convince him to still talk to him and he eventually says ok. The thing is that in those few moments when he said he was gonna go no contact I was so so super upset that I called up that guy E again WHILE I was begging my ex to not go no contact with me. E was waiting for me downstairs and I let him up the second after my ex said he was not gonna go no contact with me. I was also texting him “I can’t lose you” “You have me” “I am crazy for you” I am such a terrible person. At this point I had my ex, from his side he was all I with me and I was sending him messages that implied I was all in with him and he is the only person I have ever wanted anyways.  I have no reason or explanation  for what I did.

I have been faithful to him the entire 10 years and never even looked at other guys as physical people. Literally always just saw them as friendship shaped blobs. The only reason I can think of why I let him up is that part of me didnt completely trust my ex and thought he was gonna hurt me again like he had been doing for over a year, since he told me he didnt love me anymore and continued to string me along.  I could have just told E to leave at that point but I also felt bad to send him away if he had came all the way to my place. 10 min uber ride away. So I bring him up, we have sex again.

The day after that, I have another date with the same guy from Sunday, S. We go to the park and watch the sunset. Then he drops me at home. I am not too attracted to this guy. But he seems like a really friendly nice person. The only thing he’s got going for him is that he is tall. He doesn’t come inside this time, this is the last time I see him. After hanging out in the park, we chill in his car and make out. I feel his dick, it is teeny tiny. I’m so turned off after that. I tell him to drop me home and I don’t see him again.

Two nights later, I am feeling really lonely and down and go for a long 2 hr walk around my city. I don’t talk to my ex this day because he is currently in BC. He flew there the day before to talk to his mom and tell her that he thinks I am the one for him. I have met his mom before and she knows about our relationship and how long it’s been but she doesnt like me. She says she gets bad vibes from me because I dont have a good relationship with my parents and am not the same religion as their family. I thought the reason he flew there was because he was so heartbroken about hearing I had sex in the car with E that one time and he needed to be around family to cope with it. He has no support system in Cali. All his friends and family are in Canada and he is very lonely down there. 

I did not know he went over there to try to convince his mom about us. She does come around because she seems how much he loves me and says that she will support us. I don’t know about this at the time and I am busy trying to text E to see if he wants to hang out tonight. I’m texting him on my walk and thinking that if I am to see this guy again I want him to take me out to dinner cause we only met in public that one time and it feels like he doesnt want to spend money on me. I ask him out to dinner at 8 and he says yeah. He flakes and messaged me later saying sorry hes at a family friends place right outside of Toronto. I ask him how he got there cause he doesnt have a car. He said he ubered and will Uber to my  place when hes free. I say ok. It is gets late or anything we can go to a tacos spot I. Know thats open til 2am by my house. He said ok. He reaches my place eventually super late. He doesn’t even tell me when he gets in the uber otherwise I could have told him “hey it’s late, just go home” but he didnt. 

So he showed up to my place at 1am. He is waiting on the street outside my lobby. I tell him he could have waited inside and said he felt weird waiting inside. I can tell he is a bit drunk. It is so late now that everything is closed except bars and I have already eaten. I dont want dinner at 1:30am I can tell he is already drunk. Every time I meet him he has previously had 4 drinks. I tell him, let’s just go for a short walk because I dont feel completely right bringing him up. We walk for 5 minutes and complains about the cold… ugh. Its Canada. Wear a jacket. He says he doesnt want to walk and asks if we can chill at my place I say ok and don’t expect us to have sex or anything. I just want to cuddle because at this point my feelings for my ex are coming back. 

We sit on the couch, put on a movie and cuddle. But then he starts undressing me. I don’t say no. He was very nice the first time we did it and asked for consent with every single thing he removed off me. But this time he didnt ask at all. Maybe it’s because he was drunk or he thought we were getting familiar enough. So we have sex on the couch. Then move to the bed to sleep. Before we sleep I say to him “maybe you should not have come. It is so late now and I need to get to sleep” he said “yeah maybe I should not have” 

This is the last time I meet him. I continue to talk to him and ask if we can go to dinner sometime. He says yeah and he will let me know. He never lets me know. I don’t want to bring this guy up to my place again but it seems like he does not want to take me to dinner. One day he asks me what’s my plan and I tell him im going to see a movie alone and hes welcome to join me. He says no. but it wasn’t a true invitation anyways, I wanted to flake on him like he had flaked on me. This is a super romantic movie and I see it and immediately call my ex and tell him I want him back. 

I book a flight to California and I delete his messages. I change his name in my phone to something else and go to California and try to forget about everything I did with him. I can’t recall if I blocked him at this point but I tell E that I am gonna be out of town and not to message me until a specific date, which is the date I get back. He messages me the day after I get back asking if he can come drop off some food at my place. I was surprised to see his messages because I thought I had blocked him. Apparently not. I say “sure :)” with 100% intention of flaking on him last minute like he has done to me many times. He messages me 5 hrs later asking when to drop off the food and I say “ sorry I have dinner plans” and I block him. Seems like this guy will do anything to avoid taking me to a nice dinner. 

This trip to California made me really see how much my ex was all in with me again and I was with him too now. We spent a lot of time talking and crying together on this short 3 day trip. After I go back to toronto I feel like things are good between us again finally after such a long time and I book a longer 2 week  trip to California. On this trip my ex looks through my deleted messages (I didnt know you have to delete iMessages twice for them to actually go away) and finally the entire truth comes out about E and it is so so so much worse than what I told him. I told him we only had sex in the car on that one night. He is so freaking broken. I have never seen him in so much pain. He immediately  gets on FaceTime with his toronto friends in front of me and tells them what happened. They are super shocked and call me a lying cheating bitch and all sorts of names. I cant lie. I definitely deserve  it. Then he calls his mom and tells her everything. He puts me on the video call with her too and she talks to me and tells me I have to completely eradicate him from my life and never talk to him again. I have hurt him more than  I ever thought I could. Even I did not know I was capable of this. It’s unfathomable. I am still committed to making it work between us whatever that may mean. He knows I have struggled with suicidal thoughts but this is the first time he told me he wanted to kill himself too. He did not want to live. Just be asleep all the time every day cause thats when he feels no pain. He is currently in BC with his family and I am in Toronto. I feel so ashamed about what I did and I only told my closest friend who says she feels like there is hope for us only if I give it my all.",5,1732740146.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone, I’m a 19-year-old from Berlin who’s passionate about making the world a better place and always looking to connect with people who share similar values.

I spend a lot of my time involved in activism, whether it’s for feminism, climate action, climate justice, or social issues. I’m also big on having meaningful conversations about the world we live in—how we can challenge norms, dismantle systems of oppression, and create real change.

When I’m not at protests or organizing something, you’ll probably find me reading, working on creative projects, or just wandering through Berlin’s parks and coffee spots. I love diving into books that make me think (bell hooks, Angela Davis, Audre Lorde, etc.), making zines, or journaling about whatever’s on my mind.

I’m looking for friends who are open-minded, thoughtful, and maybe a little fiery like me! Whether you’re an activist yourself or just curious about these topics, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s chat! ✨

I'm currently unemployed, I freelance (unpaid) for a digital magazine and want to make a career in art journalism. I'm aware it is next to impossible given the circumstances. My father was a journalist and is now retired. He has spoken to almost a dozen people who are currently working in the field, and has arranged meetings but every single one of them has told me ""there is no job, you don't have anything to give, you should struggle."" My father, his ex colleague and I were having coffee one day and the moment he sat the first thing that came out of his mouth was ""I have no knowledge of journalism, I don't know anything"", this guy writes for The New Yorker. He told my father ""let her struggle for a bit"" right in front of my face. All of the people who I have reached out to are not willing to give any advice, let alone any referral. 

Are well established journalists generally like this? If I can't get any advice from them about the field then how can I move forward? I do apply here and there but constantly get rejected. ",1,1732740022.0,Journalism,14,1.0,False

As explained above, I am in the process of buying a 2 bed flat in zone 2 west London. It is not a new build, the building has about 25 years and is a share of a freehold.

Me and my partner just had a baby and are just wondering if there is a better use of the £284k deposit, which is part of our inheritance money.

We are both foreigners working under visas, there might be some limits to what we can do in terms of buy to let property and all. we’re also first time buyers.

The flat is nice and spacious and built to a very nice standard, but wonder if we could instead buy two cheaper properties and rent one of the two instead? I’m just unsure what to do.

If we went for it, we’d be left with somewhat of a tight budget, but could make it work if we adjust some of our habits (like buying coffees out or eating out regularly or less holidays).

Would appreciate any recommendations/advice.

1h1eb2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/biltrewards/comments/1h1eb2k/loyalty_program_basics/,Loyalty Program Basics ,"Hey all - My name is Richard Kerr and I’m the VP of Travel here at Bilt. If you don’t know my background, I came to Bilt over 3.5 years ago from a career first in the Navy where I honed my points and miles skills and then as a writer and editor in a variety of media jobs and finally at The Points Guy. Coming from the media/points power user side to the business side has been an incredibly enjoyable, challenging and educating experience to really understand how loyalty programs work from the mechanics and finance side. 

I still read Boarding Area, Flyertalk, Reddit, etc every morning over coffee and from the perspective I have now, it’s really obvious how much of a misunderstanding I used to have and that many people still have on how these programs work. There are of course many of you who are savvy in these things and appreciate y’all jumping in to correct when bad information is espoused in these forums. 

I thought it may be interesting from time to time to hop in here and just explain some basic and some complex things to really try and educate the member base and help our members understand the decisions we have to make every day and to elicit feedback. 

I’ll say one of my biggest challenges personally at Bilt is constantly balancing the public’s expectations and the high bar we’ve set for ourselves from a promotion and program perspective while also ensuring we make margin on everything we do - its also of course one of the most fun parts of the job to throw ideas up on a white board that we know have never been done before and figure out how to execute them. I am routinely the dumbest person in the room here at Bilt - which is a great spot to be in when it comes time to execute and market these benefits I may conjure up. I also firmly believe if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. 

Today I’ll cover the very basic framework of what it costs to run a loyalty currency and arguably the most important metric a program can track, which is CPP or Cost Per Point. ***All of the following numbers are made up and not representative of our business.*** 

The cost per point is a blended average of the way every single Bilt Point is redeemed. Every redemption option in our program has a real cost to it. We either negotiate rates with partners (airlines, hotels, Amazon, etc) or set a rate for Bilt proprietary redemption avenues (cover rent, statement credit, The Collection). Fulfilling these redemptions either requires us pay for member’s rent, statement credit,etc or cut a partner a check. 

For travel partners, based on the monthly transfer volume, I get a very real invoice every month that is # of points transferred by Bilt members x negotiated rate.  For domestic partners an additional 7% excise tax is added. Bilt pays this on behalf of all of you, some other banks that rhyme with Baberican Mexpress pass that on to members. 

Example: In January Bilt members transfer 10 million Bilt Points to United and say we pay United 1.5 cents per mile. I would get in invoice in February for 10mill x .015 x 1.07 = $160,500. 

For a wholistic month's view, if in January, Bilt members redeemed 40 million points for rent at 0.9 cents per point, transfer 10 mill points to united at 1.5 cents per point, transfer 20 million points to Hyatt at 2 cents per point and redeem 5 million points for home decor in our collect at 0.8 cents per point, the blended CPP of our program for January would be:

1. Let's calculate the total cost for each redemption type:
   * Rent: 40M points × $0.009 = $360,000
   * United: 10M points × $0.015 = $150,000
   * Hyatt: 20M points × $0.02 = $400,000
   * Home decor: 5M points × $0.008 = $40,000
2. Calculate total cost:
   * $360,000 + $150,000 + $400,000 + $40,000 = $950,000
3. Calculate total points redeemed:
   * 40M + 10M + 20M + 5M = 75M points
4. Calculate blended cost per point:
   * $950,000 ÷ 75M points = $0.0127 per point

Therefore, the blended cost per point redeemed is 1.27 cents per point. (Would actually be a little higher given the 7% excise tax)

To offset a hypothetical 1.27 CPP, Bilt has to generate enough revenue per point issued for us to make a profit on our program. A reminder, the Bilt Mastercard represents only 15% of our member base and we generate revenue many many other ways now besides just the cobrand card. 

As you can all imagine, promotions get really expensive and can drastically swing our CPP and put our margins for the month at risk. You can likely make several conclusions yourselves on why we do some of the things we do, and then hopefully you scratch your head and wonder how we’ve pulled off some of the things we have. CPP is at the top of our key program metrics every day and something every loyalty program constantly tries to manage. 

Hope this is helpful - will do more of these in the near future, let me know any topics you’d like me to cover or questions. - Kerr ",33,1732739901.0,biltrewards,3,0.92,False

And for the dresses, I was able to try on both (except for the Mastermind, I could only try this on in Black).

Hi all,

I’m coming to this community to say I met someone amazing. My GF (25), is smart, kind, compassionate, funny and supportive. We’ve been dating for a few months and she has shown me a profound love I’ve never felt before with anyone else. 

Shes confided in me that she struggles with her weight due to her eating disorder. She’s 5’1”. I can see her spine and her ribs. She doesn’t eat very often, and when she does she is very selective of her meals. She only eats chicken on low carb wraps, with maybe a side of potatoes. She drinks coffee almost all day. She avoids dairy products and any heavy carbohydrate altogether. She will almost never tell me she is hungry, and then get upset with me when I don’t eat, because if I don’t eat, she won’t either. No sweets. No fruits. No vegetables. Incredibly picky. She drinks alcohol on occasion and smokes marijuana regularly. 

She has also had bulimic tendencies, where I have caught her stashing junk food in her cabinet. It disappeared one day and she confessed she ate it all and then threw it up. She is afraid to meet my family because she fears they will say she is too skinny. She asks me repeatedly if I still find her attractive. She gets cold very easily. She loses a significant amount of hair when she brushes it, and avoids seeing her friends and family (I believe because of this disorder). She always talks about getting back to a “healthy weight” and she is very aware she has a problem. She also insists that this is “her thing” and I shouldn’t ask about it because it’s something she feels she needs to overcome on her own. My best guess is she won’t. It’s a sensitive topic when I bring it up.

I don’t want to walk away from her. I care about her deeply and want to help her. She is an incredible girl with so much to offer and so much potential. I’m coming here to see what steps I can take to try and help her. Does she need medical help? Can I encourage her enough to eat on her own? How can I get to the root of the problem? I can’t stand to see her continue to do this to herself.

Any help is appreciated. ",1,1732739345.0,bulimia,0,1.0,False

I filed a police report.

Police encouraged me to fence the property-line side and put up a sign, which helps them in getting the neighbor for trespassing. My husband is back and organizing that. 

I got a Formal Notice written up by a lawyer too.

I put up signs I got from Amazon next to my front door. And I saved one for the fence.

We have thought about a dog and some people suggested that — we love dogs but both travel too much to put a dog through that, especially a bigger dog that can’t travel with us easily. 

The neighbor has not tried approaching my door since the coffee incident in my other post, but she does try yelling for me from her porch as I am leaving my house a few times a week. ""Hey, can we talk?!"" Stuff like that. I just ignore her.

She approached my husband in our drive a few days back, while he was outside grabbing something from his vehicle. She talked to him normally as if none of the previous events happened. She was going on about how she hit a raccoon at night on the weekend (I'm assuming.. to warn him to be careful, or maybe for sympathy) and he cut her off to say 'Stop talking. I don't care. Don't approach me or my wife. Get off my property'. As he was heading back inside the house she told him 'your wife is cheating on you!'.

The only other major incident that occurred was she called police on us yesterday, saying she heard loud yelling and screaming coming from our place and was worried about there being domestic violence in the home. This is totally made up. My husband and I go to sleep early and when the police came .. we were knocked out in bed. Also dealing with the police is such a mentally draining and kind of traumatic feeling when they are visiting you under the pretence that your husband is a threat. He didn’t get arrested or anything, but I’m still feeling so unsettled from the accusation and subsequent interrogation (that’s what it felt like). 

It has to have been her because the police said it was “a neighbor” who made the call.

1h1dz13,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1h1dz13/roast_profiler_20/,Roast Profiler 2.0,"Hey everyone! about a month ago I [posted here about creating a Roast Profiler ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1g6qye4/built_a_roast_profile_generator/). Today, I wanted to share that I have since upgraded it by adding a user interface and improving its usability. 

# Description 

The Roast Profiler brings together all of your roasts, beans, and custom business logic to produce unique, customer-friendly webpages for each roast. These webpages can be shared with your customers to give them unparalleled insights into what they're drinking.

Currently, the Roast Profiler works exclusively with RoastTime. However, I've purposely designed the integration layer to be easily extensible, so it can support other roasting software and roasters in the future.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Roast Profiler, there are two requirements:

1. **Same Computer as RoastTime**: Install the Roast Profiler on the same computer where you use RoastTime, as it relies on RoastTime’s cached data.
2. **AWS S3 Bucket**: You’ll need a valid AWS account with an S3 bucket configured. All roast profiles will be deployed to this bucket. After setting it up in AWS, enter your access key and secret key in the Roast Profiler. **You will not be able to create roast profiles without configuring S3 first.**

For **Mac** uers, simply download the zip file [here](https://github.com/AntSan813/roastime-collector/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha)

To download the app on **Linux** or **Windows**

* [Clone the project on GitHub](https://github.com/AntSan813/roastime-collector/)
* Execute the following in the projects command line: ""python3 run.py""



Once the app is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

    http://127.0.0.1:5077/

# Demo

On a fresh install, the beans and roasts are automatically scraped from RoastTime's cache:

[All Roasts are automatically scraped from RoastTime's cache. To see any new roasts, you will need to refresh this screen. NOTE: you can only create roast profiles for roasts that are tied to a valid bean. ](https://preview.redd.it/r30ypag51i3e1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f3e13e3da58c9dba725133d6a181d1d6e87925)

[The beans here are also automatically scrapped from RoastTime's cache. RoastTime's bean data is limited so to fill in the remaining details you will need to manually add information for each bean. To add new beans, you will first need to add them on RoastTime and then reload this page.](https://preview.redd.it/gpq35zla1i3e1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54a10524669f59cee8cd78c3189b5172dd3aa8b)

# Additional notes

  
**Roast Profiles are Static:** Once a roast profile is created, it won't automatically update if you change the bean information or roast settings later on. If you've made changes and want them reflected in the roast profile, you'll need to regenerate it. This can be done anytime after the profile has been generated.

**QR Codes:** You can download a QR code for each roast profile after it's created. The QR code URL is unique and doesn't change, even if you regenerate the roast profile. This means you won't need to download a new QR code if you make updates.",2,1732739021.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

1h1dwhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1h1dwhn/help_us_raise_500_to_buy_500_packs_of_wet_wipes/,Help us raise $500 to buy 500 packs of wet wipes for a military hospital,"Hello ! We at [Sustain](http://reddit.com/r/sustainukraine) [Ukraine ](https://sustainukraine.org/)are running our second Reddit fundraiser to buy 500 packs of wet wipes for a hospital in Lviv. This is a hospital one of our members has volunteered with and they are constantly asking for wet wipes. They have a lot of amputees who are not able to bathe/shower and wet wipes help keep them clean.

We have a few options to accept donations, the easiest for us is to donate to our Ukrainian in Lviv, Bohdan Prodan. You can send your donation via PayPal ([bogdan.prodan.j@gmail.com](mailto:bogdan.prodan.j@gmail.com)) or [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/bigbo4ek).

Alternatively, you can donate directly to the Sustain Ukraine [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=P3CCCNZB2HLXA). If you take this route please include your mailing address (or send it to us in a DM along with a screenshot of your donation) so we stay compliant with US rules for charity donations.

We will be passing on this donation to Natalya Arestova, the lead volunteer at the hospital. She has been volunteering there since 2022. You can check out her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/natalibakun) to see all of the work she does.

If anyone has leads on discounted high quality wet wipes within Ukraine, or could help out with a donation of wet wipes themselves, please let us know! These are a highly requested item not just at hospitals but for soldiers who are actively fighting.",36,1732738842.0,ukraine,2,0.95,False

Hey guys! I've been living in London for over a year and it’s been lonely lately so I’m just looking for people that I can talk to. Normally the people I meet here ends up not replying after a few days or weeks, so I’m hoping it’s different this time. 

I'm into horror movies, love walking around London and discover new streets and places. I have a thing for watching people passing by while having my coffee. I do like hiking and I've been doing martial arts. 

Idk what to say anymore tbh but feel free to hit me up if you guys want to ask something or just want to have a conversation :)

What Are Your Best Thanksgiving Day Tips?","We’re almost there, folks. The turkey’s (hopefully) thawed, the pies are prepped at the minimum the crust is resting, and the sweat pants are ready to go. 

Face the facts; in the kitchen Thanksgiving Day can be its own kind of chaos.

What are your best tips for making it through tomorrow without losing your mind or burning the rolls? Do you have a secret hack for keeping the turkey juicy, a way to keep the sides and main warm for serving, or just a foolproof plan to keep the kids and nosy relatives out of the food before dinner? 

For me, I make sure to double up on coffee in the morning then double up on the gravy by dinner. Priorities!! 

Honestly though; Brine the bird, rest the bird, and it will be juicy!! Eat a big breakfast so it will carry you till dinner! Always give yourself the same grace you give others!

I just spent the night with this guy and we thrifted all day and he got me coffee and lunch. Idk I don’t want to be too hopeful but he made me feel like a woman like I’ve never really felt before. And of course I am a woman and I am transitioning but he just solidified it, he made me feel beautiful and special. This was a really good experience especially at the beginning of my transition. Anyway I just wanted to talk about it because who else will let me gush over this guy.",7,1732738306.0,MtF,1,0.9,False

We are headed to the cove and are very excited to experience the resort but know it comes with a lot of added expenses. 

My hubby is playing in the poker tournament and gets lunch and dinner covered for him but I’ll be flying solo for these meals. 

We have a few questions that I’m hoping for answers :

- best price and quality for breakfast/ coffee spot? 
- can we make/ bring our own drinks? Is it acceptable to walk around with a Stanley?
- which stores close by (walking preferred) can I buy snacks?
- are the trolleys regular to get around?
- if we wanted to leave to go visit friends (what are shuttle prices?  We know they get free to us but what about to them? Ex Warwick)
- margaritaville or senõr frogs for a night out? 

Thank you! ",1,1732738294.0,bahamas,0,0.67,False
