1g1g8kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/country/comments/1g1g8kw/debut_album_songs_outta_my_head/,"Debut Album - ""Songs Outta My Head""","“Songs Outta My Head” is a collection of 12 songs written about life experienced in Rural America down in the Deep South.  Where life experience is delineated with heartbreak, newfound love, death, moonshine and moonlight.   Where summertime’s sweltering heat in the dog days can leave you begging for forgiveness and laden with journeys that require foot travel for long distances…for your sake and the public’s sake. Where your family can love you to death and drive you crazy.   A life where legends of the past inspire the future.  A life that acknowledges grace is required for us ALL to progress.

My music consists of life experiences….some of those experiences are my own…some are characters based on people in my travels or home community.  Art is about taking our combined lived experiences and sharing them with the world.  I think all of the songs on this album are all stories worth telling and worth your time to hear them.  I hope my music, my art, is a bridge that connects otherwise strange bedfellows and I hope my art is a force for promoting positivity.

What are my music goals?  Make sense from the sounds in my head.  The things I wanna say, the things I have to say, and the things that just come from the ether.  When they overlap, sometimes it’s harmonic, sometimes it's dissonance.  It’s sorting and structuring and expounding and editing and editing and more editing.  Polish the good and compost the rest.  Rinse and repeat.  That is all just my process to write the [song.My](http://song.My) goal is to make my art/my music to my standard.  I don’t think success is defined by views or likes or dollars.  Sure, positive reinforcement is great, but some bird dogs are gonna point, even if nobody is watching or cares.  I’ve been writing songs for well over 20 years and am going to continue regardless if my album has one listen or one billion.  I am not expectant nor reticent, positive or negative.  I know who I am, I am coooooooooooooool with that.

Long story short, I do hope you give my album a listen.  I hope you put it on while drinking coffee, or doing laundry or when meditating.  I hope you crank it up while sunbathing on the beach or put it on your earbuds while mowing the grass.  I hope you blast 'em while having a party with your community.  I hope you enjoy it while watching a magnificent sunset with your loved one.I hope you feel the positivity and good vibrations that music has provided me with over my life experience.  It has been proven repeatedly in my life that music enhances everything.  Good music can be the cherry on top when things are good, it can be a salve when you are broken, and a crutch when you need something to lean on. 

 Most of all, I hope my music makes your life better.

1g1g6j5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1g6j5,Baratza Encore Grinder is not BIFL,"So after months of reading reviews and watching YouTube videos and reading posts about grinders on here and in other subs I finally decided to purchase the Baratza Encore grinder because the coffee grinder at our local Costco stopped working. I’ve had the grinder for less than a month and have only used it a few times, it hasn’t even ground a pound of coffee beans. I contacted the company I bought the grinder through (ECS Canada) and Baratza and both told me to check for a missing paddle wheel but the coffee grinds are so badly caked into the machine I can’t even get access to look for a paddle wheel. I’ve followed the steps Baratza suggested to unclog it and I’ve even tried taking a knife to it and nothing is working. Baratza told me the best they can do is offer me a refurbished machine as a replacement because clogs are not covered under warranty. How is it that a brand new machine that has only been used a handful of times not be covered under warranty? Im so upset, for $200 I expected the machine to last a long time. I’ve spent hours trying to clean this out.

For those who might ask:
- I ground coffee on the 15 and 12 settings (V60 pour over)
- only used medium roast beans, so not beans that are sticky.

I got him when he was a few weeks old and I established a tight bond with him. 

Fast forward to a last week, My best friend came over with her boyfriend and Yuki has NEVER met her and he doesn’t really like anyone in my family because they yell at him and my brothers would scare him and chase him but he loves me and has always been by my side 24/7. But anyways my best friend arrives and she meets Yuki he’s doesn’t look very fond of her and he doesn’t like when people hold him (besides me) with anyone else he escapes like he did with her. He did under the bed pretty much the whole time she was there until we left. Usually he waits for me until I get home and he’s fast asleep in my bed waiting for me or when he hears me at the front door he comes running and tries jumping on me. But when I came home he didn’t do anything, he was hiding under our coffee table and I tried getting him but he ran away and wouldn’t really let me touch him. 

He loves being around me but after he met her everything he used to do he doesn’t do it anymore and it’s making me really frustrated and sad. I don’t know why he’s randomly changed in his behavior and I don’t know what to do, he’s very loving towards me and my other friends have came over and he’s never reacted this way. He doesn’t meow at my door anymore to come sleep with me,he puts his body down to the ground whenever I pet him and it feels like he’s just scared of me. 

Has anyone had this happen? If so did their behavior go back to normal & is there anything I can do? 

P.S I bought some treats thinking he would change cause he really loves treats. Now he won’t even eat them after I gave them to him twice. ",1,1728669945.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

1g1g0o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g1g0o8/ot_beneath_the_surface/,[OT] BENEATH THE SURFACE,"Beneath the surface  
  
Chapter 1  
  
Beneath the surface is only the unknown.  
  
You don't know what or who lies there, and whatever dwells there don't know about you either.  
  
If you for a moment let yourself, you can almost see it. Something with a mind, just like yours.  
  
However, you are still worlds apart.  
  
Forever separated. Forever alone.  
  
""Ashley, it time to go"" my uncle shouts from downstairs,  
  
I wake from my daydreaming and realize it's time for our weekly fishing hour.  
  
""im ready"" I responded, while putting on my fishing gear.  
  
The sun is shining through the Window in my room, illuminating the bookshelves and medical equipment. My room is on the 2nd floor of the cabin, so the view over the ocean is quite pleasant.  
  
We go outside and head to the quay where Uncle's fishing boat is.  
  
The Wind is blowing, but the ocean is rather still.  
  
On our way to the boat we hear the seagulls above and greet the fishermen in the area.  
  
I ask my uncle where he thinks we should go. ""I think the place near the cave is good this time of year"" he says.  
  
I'm visiting him in his place at the sea-side town for the summer, and despite seeing fishing as a boys-thing he lets me go with him when he's fishing. My dad said it was fine, as long as we don't go too far out shore. As much as i like the city, i quite like the seaside town, as it helps me relax and i feel at peace very much. Plus I love doing my morning jogs on the beach.  
  
After going to the place that we decided we take out our fishing rods and settle down.  
  
A few minutes we just sit there, looking out, thinking about anything our minds wander to.  
  
Suddenly I felt a strong pull on my rod. It is stronger than any fish I have caught before, almost as there was a human on the other end. ""This must be a big one"" i think to myself as i continue to struggle""  
  
I try to reel it in, but it is too strong and I have to let it go. Uncle says it's no problem, and we decide to go back to land. ""We can try again some time,"" i think to myself.  
  
As we are leaving I see something move under the surface. I assume it's just a large fish, but something about it looks?odd. It almost looks like?a human.  
  
Before i can make out what it is, its gone, having vanishes into the depth.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
We get home and uncle decided to make some tea for us.  
  
I decided to change clothes due to them getting soaked. As i do i recall what i saw and wonder what I could have been.  
  
""Hey uncle"" I say in a quiet voice, ""are there any legends of sea creatures around this area?""  
  
""huh?you mean like giant squids or sharks or whatever"" my uncle responds.  
  
""I dunno..the thing i caught today seemed rather large and heavy"" i say.  
  
I think about the human like shape i saw swimming away and wonder..what could it have been, and is it still out there.  
  
""Well..there have happened a few times before, fishermens and sailors spotting strange beings under the surface..and sometimes feeling strong struggles in their nets and hooks', this area has larger fishes then most but I'm not sure what else it could be"".  
  
I take in what he said. ""Maybe that was it??oh well"".  
  
""I think i'm going to bed now"" i say, wanting time to think for myself.  
  
""Sounds good..good night Ashley"" uncle says in a calm and understanding tone.  
  
Even though he can be hard headed sometimes I do really like my uncle, he's the one part of my family i feel truly comfortable with talking to about anything.  
  
I enter my room and start putting on my night dress. I spot blood on it and immediately rush to the bathroom.  
  
A few minutes later I am in bed and am trying to fall asleep.  
  
Despite not doing a lot today, I feel exhausted and tired and it doesn't take a long time before I feel my eyelids feeling heavy.  
  
""It was probably nothing under the surface"" I think and wonder what I will do tomorrow.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In my dreams I am on the beach,looking out over the horizon.  
  
It appears to be night time, and the moon is in full view.  
  
I dip my feet in the water, it is cold but pleasant.  
  
The air is still and not a sound can be heard.  
  
Not a person in Sight.  
  
When I look down, I see a string of red seeping through the water.  
  
I then hear a scream coming from the water.  
  
I look out and see someone drowning.  
  
I start swimming towards them, but no matter how much i swim i can't get near them  
  
When I finally get there the person has lost consciousness and I have to grab their hand to stop them from being submerged in water.  
  
I look up to the sky, only to see a full moon staring down at me  
  
""You aren't meant to be""  
  
I hear these in my mind, but I can't tell who said it.  
  
Everything goes dark, and I feel cold.  
  
I awake in a cold sweat, and spend the rest of the night sleepless.  
  
""What was that dream about"".  
  
Chapter 4  
  
I go down to the kitchen to make myself some morning coffee.  
  
While I prefer tea, coffee is easily the best way for me to have a good start.  
  
I brush my teeth, water the plants, and write in my dairy of what happened yesterday as I forgot about that.  
  
I compliment going on a walk to shake off what has happened the last few days.  
  
I put on my shoes and my uncle's jacket and baseball cap with fishermen tags on it, as my own is in the dryer, and head out for the morning walk along the beachside, which is my favorite thing to do here. The calmness and silence of the sea is a great change of pace from the noise of everyday life. I especially enjoy having the wind tug at my long, hazelnut brown hair.  
  
I look out over the sea and think about the dream I had last night.  
  
""I wonder what that was about,"" I thought to myself, as I often believe dreams have some sort of meaning.  
  
Many times i've dreamed of something that has happened in real life, so this might be the same.  
  
But maybe it was just about what I saw while fishing.  
  
When I'm lost in thought I hear something.  
  
A small, barely audible panting noise, like that of a wounded animal, and on occasion a small whimper of pain.  
  
Strangely enough, while people usually don't go to this part of the beach, outside from myself, the noises sound oddly human.  
  
""It may be someone who was hurt swimming on one of those sea urchins"" I think, and rushed over trying to find them.  
  
I track down where the noise comes from and it leads me to a small cave opening.  
  
I've seen this cave a few times before, but never ventured into it.  
  
Outside I spot a few red spots in the sand, and realize this person must be hurt.  
  
""Hello, is anyone there?"" I shouted into the cave.  
  
No response.  
  
It's cold and dark, so I take out a small flashlight in my pocket,and Shine a light in front of me to see where I'm going.  
  
""I'm coming in there now, ok?"" shout and start walking into the darkness.  
  
As the darkness grows stronger, my light starts to fade but I can still see but only barely.  
  
I'm starting to want to go back and get someone else to help, but I decided to atleast check on the person who's injured.  
  
I hear the noises even louder now and go around a large rock to finally see its source  
  
What I see is going to change my life forever.  
  
  
  
Chapter 5  
  
It is a girl. A relatively normal looking girl.  
  
She has medium length dirty-blonde hair, dark green eyes, and is wearing a T-shirt with red and white rose petals on them. She is quite skinny, especially compared to my more well-toned build, and her skin is pale , but with an odd hint of gray.  
  
If you saw her while out on town, you wouldn't think much of her.  
  
She really appears as just a normal girl, around my age i would even say.  
  
What is not normal however, is what is below her waist. Instead of having legs and feet, she has a long, blue colored fishtail with a fin in the shape of a heart.  
  
I recognize what she is almost immediately, a creature I have heard several stories of as a young girl.  
  
She is a mermaid.  
  
I kneel down and try to reach out to her to touch her cheek. She draws back, whimpering in fear and pain. I look at her tail and see she is injured and one of her scales is missing, seemingly from a hook of some kind.  
  
I think back on what happened yesterday with the fishing. ""oh god..did i do that..no it seems more recent"", i think to myself.  
  
""Doesn't matter right now anyways""  
  
The mermaid strat quivering even more  
  
""Hey,hey,it's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you"" I whisper. It looks like she understands me and stops shaking.  
  
I rip off a part of my shirt and use it to cover her wound.  
  
""There, that should do it for now, i,ll be back later with some food okay"" a say to her  
  
She nods as I exit the cave.  
  
Chapter 6  
  
On my way home, I go to the grocery store to pick some food.  
  
I decided to go with rice balls ,pears, and ice tea.  
  
I consider sushi, but realize it may be weird for a mermaid to eat.  
  
When I get home I pack it in a backpack which I hide in my room and take out my jacket from the dryer.  
  
""what happened to your shirt?"" Uncle asks when he sees my ripped-off sleeve.  
  
""Oh no ... .forgot about that"" i think to myself.  
  
""Oh, I just..stumbled into a bush and branches tore them off"" I lied to avoid suspicion.  
  
""Umm ... .alright then, be careful next time, alright"" he responds.  
  
I figure it's best to keep my new friends a secret for now, just in case.  
  
Who knows how he will react, even though I do trust him.  
  
I remember what he told me about fishermans seeing unusual shapes and thinking it might have been her.  
  
""I just look out for her until she's ready to be on her Own again"".  
  
The next day I head back to the cave, now with food and a live.aid kit to patch up her wound better. And sure enough she is still there, wanting for me.  
  
Chapter 7  
  
""My name is Jessica by the way, thanks for saving me before"" says the mermaid while we share the food I brought.  
  
She has a very gentle voice, and it's quite pleasant to listen to.  
  
""Sure, no problem,"" I responded.  
  
I'm not very good at conversation with people I don't know, but she strikes me as the quiet type, so I don't feel pressured to speak.  
  
We sit in the cave for several hours and look out over the sea. I learned that despite being a mermaid, she actually is not very different from me in terms of lifestyle. She likes clothing brands,going to stores, and reading. Mermaids seem to have a society of their own, in some way.  
  
She is really nice to be around and I enjoy every second. This is the first time in a while i've just hung out with another girl my age, and it's quite fun.  
  
But there is a question I have to ask her. Something that has been bugging me since i found her yesterday and want to get off my chest.  
  
""Do you like?don't like humans?hate them even?"" Even though I hesitated at first.  
  
""What do you mean?"" She asks, her eyes showing a bit of concern.  
  
""When i found you you seemed to be scared of me, as if you thought i would hurt you in some way"" i say. ""Though that might have been just a instinctual reaction""  
  
She looks away for a second, with a glimt of sadness in her eyes and a serious expression before saying in a solemn tone.  
  
""Well, you see, us mermaids dont have the best history with humans, and i have been thought to be very careful around them""  
  
When she sees my worried expression she quickly apologizes  
  
""I don't hold it against you of course, you saved my life after all, and i can tell you are a good person""  
  
""I think i should go home now, i'll check up from time to time from now on, okay?"" i say, noticing it's getting late, and feeling I need time alone to think.  
  
""Sure, sounds good"" she says.  
  
When i get home im worried about what she said.  
  
Can we truly be friends after all, or are we destined to forever be apart.  
  
If mermaids and humans are enemies then are our individual feelings important, or not.  
  
Nevertheless I need to take care of her until she is ready to be on her own again.  
  
After that she can make the decision.  
  
  
  
Chapter 8  
  
The weeks pass by and I continue checking up on Jessica every few days.  
  
It has almost become a routine of Mine.  
  
I bring her food, patch her up, talk with her for a bit, and repeat.  
  
I'm still worried about what she said about humans but I try not to think about it.  
  
It's not important, and I just need to care for her until she has healed up.  
  
My uncle has yet to suspect anything..or at least he hasn't said anything about it to me.  
  
Things are going well, and I feel it's going to work out.  
  
One day, when I came into the cave she seemed paler than usual.  
  
I quickly run over to hold her as she can barely sit up on her own.  
  
When I ask her about it, she said she was sorry.  
  
""It seemed as though,despite your efforts,I might not make it"" she says between her coughs.  
  
""What?why?what have i done wrong i,..i don't"" i stutterd, being confused, worried and upset at the same time.  
  
""shhhhh.you havent done anything wrong Ashley..but i think i lost to much blood, once a mermaid loses one of it scales you see, the blood the lose, even if not much, can be lethal, the only thing that could save me was blood from another, but i can't ask that much of yo..where did she go""  
  
Im already running along the shore, wiping tears from my eyes  
  
She can't be dying..she just can't.  
  
I was supposed to look after her until she could contione on her own, and i Will do what I must to save her.  
  
I simply just have to.  
  
I remember a blood transfusion device uncle had in his medical care room.  
  
He has a history of working as the towns doctor, and have even though me a few things about it.  
  
I will take it in order to save her. Give her as much blood as she has to have, even if I myself die.  
  
A human and a mermaid may not be able to be friends, but two teenage girls who happen to like each-other can.  
  
Chapter 9  
  
I sneak into the room, and pick up the pole the transfer is attached to.  
  
Uncle is currently asleep, and probably won't notice anything.  
  
""I'm sorry uncle, I have to borrow this, promise I will return it"". I think to myself.  
  
I don't like having to take something belonging to him without permission, but this situation is desperate, and i Will return it afterwards.  
  
I pray this Will go well, or else I don't know what to do.  
  
I go into the cave and Jessica is there waiting for me, looking like she did before.  
  
I tell her in detail what I'm about to do.  
  
""Are you sure?"" she says several times, ""you have done enough as it is..and besides..we aren't supposed to even be friends"".  
  
""I don't care,"" I say.  
  
""You are my friend and i will save you"", ""because you are one of the few people ive met that i genuinely like being around.  
  
I pierce my arm with the needle. The pain is bad but I push through it.  
  
Jessica is at first hesitant but does the same with the other needle, whimpering in pain.

If they do, it's to create unnecessary drama and make me doubt my self.

The issue I have is that the rubber plunger smells more and more like stale coffee the more I use it which is only about twice a week.  It is cleaned within 15 minutes of use. Normal washing with soap and degreaser does little. Aggressive washing with vinegar then baking soda then Dawn helps somewhat but not completely. I have not tried citric acid/Cafiza on it yet because I was worried it would make the rubber even more pourous and smelly in the long run.  The plunger rarely if ever touches the liquid I will be drinking and does not seem to have a negative effect on taste but as a scientist it still bothers me to have contaminated gear.

Does everyone just live with this?  Is there a secret cleaning method? Would cleaning it immediately after pressing alleviate this? I find it way messier to remove the used puck if done immediately as opposed to waiting a few minutes when I can usually pop out the entire puck and sometimes filter without even having to touch it. 

I had purchased and returned a Hario Switch before becaust the rubber base smelled of coffee after one use. It was unacceptabble as far as I was concerned.

This may not be new (first time I've seen it) but I wanted to provide a heads-up to all about this. The execution of this is so terribly bad, it's almost comical. I almost did a coffee spit take reading this.

The email is (allegedly) from the ""New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development"". They are informing me that there is an issue with my ""unemployment benefits"" and I need to click the link and log in to my ""account"" find out what's going on. Here's a screen grab of the email:

https://preview.redd.it/fc6avks7x5ud1.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bb4250b3ccd80df637eae81015df647aa9d359

Let us count the stupidity. First, the return email address is...well, it's from Wix. Next, the logo to the left indicates their ""site"" was created in Wix, and the ""developer"" forgot to make sure that logo was removed.

The biggest clown-show indicator here is the URL in the middle of the page. ""mass.gov"" is the main domain for the ~~state~~ Commonwealth of *Massachusetts,* and as far as I know, the state of New Jersey is not handing off it's UI benefits management to a completely different state. 

I decided to grab the fake link and have a peek at the page safely. Amazingly, Massachusetts has magically figured out a way to have me click on *their* state link while sending me *back* to New Jersey (see fake form screenshot):  


https://preview.redd.it/hryg9owzy5ud1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=478d10ce19c94c0df88374d67cf50c939b5db7ec

Incredibly, they managed to do all this while neglecting to remove the WIX website builder ad from the top of the page. We all know that extremely large state governments use advanced and secure site builders like WIX to reach their millions of citizens. Right? I guess they realized that Geocities didn't exist anymore. 

I manually found and visited both states' genuine websites and, of course, they're not even remotely close to this garbage. That logo on the ""login"" page, for example, isn't present anywhere on New Jersey's site that I can find. 

There's additional *personal* hilarity in this one. I did grow up in that region - on Long Island, in New York, which is between these two states. I *was* unemployed - in New York, for three months, in 1976. But I've lived in Florida for nearly 40 years now, and I'm not unemployed here, either - I'm happily retired. 

My guess is that this was created outside the United States, by people who don't seem to understand that we have *different* states and state governments. They also don't know how to create a convincing fake website.

At 47, he felt like he was losing control of his health. The relentless march of time had brought challenges he never anticipated: weight gain, sluggishness, and a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes. Tom's days often began with a battle against fatigue, and as he struggled to manage his blood sugar levels, he yearned for a solution that could bring back the vibrant life he once enjoyed.

One sunny afternoon, while scrolling through his phone, Tom stumbled upon a post about a dietary supplement called Gluco Freedom. The testimonials were compelling, filled with stories of people who had regained their health and vitality. Intrigued, he decided to delve deeper.

**Discovering Gluco Freedom**

Tom learned that Gluco Freedom is designed to support healthy blood sugar levels and aid in weight management. It promised to help users combat the effects of ""diabetogens"" — harmful substances that accumulate in our bodies from the environment, food, and water, especially as we age. The product's formula was made with natural ingredients, including Gymnema Sylvestre and Bitter Melon, all known for their blood sugar-lowering properties.

Feeling hopeful, Tom placed his order, excited to see if Gluco Freedom could truly help him reclaim his life. When the package arrived, he was impressed by the sleek design and clear labeling that outlined the benefits of the supplement. The fact that it was manufactured in an FDA-approved facility in the USA reassured him about its quality.

**Taking the First Steps**

Tom committed to incorporating Gluco Freedom into his daily routine. He followed the directions meticulously, taking two capsules each day, and paired it with healthier eating habits. The first few days felt like any other; he was hopeful yet cautious. But as the weeks rolled on, he began to notice subtle changes.

[Gluco Freedom](https://preview.redd.it/cjq3jg51s2ud1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f0f6cf8695a96dd5731c4e489eede2f9b74f81)

His energy levels started to stabilize, and for the first time in years, he experienced fewer spikes and crashes in his blood sugar. Mornings became less about struggling to wake up and more about enjoying a cup of coffee while watching the sunrise. He could finally engage with his kids, Emily and Jake, without feeling winded after a short game of basketball in the driveway.

**The Turning Point**

One evening, as Tom sat down with his family for dinner, he couldn’t help but share his progress. “I think this supplement is really helping me,” he said, a newfound excitement lighting up his face. His wife, Sarah, who had been worried about his health for years, smiled and encouraged him to keep it up.

It was during a weekend family outing at the beach that Tom realized just how far he had come. While he watched Emily and Jake run around in the sand, he felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. He was no longer sidelined by his health struggles; he was a part of the action.

As Tom continued taking Gluco Freedom, he also began to notice a reduction in cravings for sugary snacks. He swapped out dessert for fresh fruits, and with every small choice, he felt empowered. With the support of Gluco Freedom, Tom was transforming not just his health but also his lifestyle.

**A Community of Support**

Curious about others' experiences, Tom took to social media to search for Gluco Freedom reviews. He was pleased to find countless stories from individuals like him—people who had faced similar struggles and emerged victorious. Each shared experience reinforced his belief in the product, creating a sense of community that he never knew he needed.

Tom's story isn’t just about a supplement; it’s about resilience, hope, and the transformative power of small, consistent changes. With Gluco Freedom, he didn’t just manage his diabetes; he reclaimed his life.

**Final Thoughts**

As he reflects on his journey, Tom feels empowered by his choices. Gluco Freedom has become more than just a supplement for him; it’s a symbol of his commitment to his health and his family's well-being.

**If you’re reading this and battling similar challenges, take it from Tom—consider giving Gluco Freedom a try. It may just be the turning point you need to reclaim control over your health, one small step at a time.** [**https://glucofreedom.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/GlucoFreedom.html)",1,1728669430.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

Now... she's becoming a beast.  

2 months ago, I posted asking about how long couples stay out to play, sort of complaining about how it seemed I was the one wanting to play while my wife was like ""meh, it was fun for a bit, but I'm ready to go"". One guy called me insufferable just for my rambling story, lol. (Sorry.  It's what i do.)

Update 2 months later: My wife is hooked and, relatively speaking, is getting very good; especially for someone with no racquet sports background- or any sports, really- ever.  90% of the time she is the one asking ""hey are we playing today/tonight/tomorrow morning?"" while she's still driving home from work.  Or she's come in to wake me up on the weekend with a cup of coffee, and ""ok, let's get over to X park for a few games.""  

At her own request, she is taking a set of some private instruction b/c she's still very hard on herself. And because sometimes, she needs instruction from.... NOT me, lol. (Husbands, amiright? lol)  But then I work with her to drill the material she's learning.

She shows great aptitude for the game and is doing well.  In our one local spot, our wins now outnumber our losses on most days; even against a few pairs of the regulars we didn't think we could handle.  And we're getting better as a pair.  At our other, overall more competitive local spot...  we won a few against equal level players, but also lost a few respectfully against the spot regulars, and were whole ass skunked for the first time.  It's a much higher level spot over all, and I've heard that some folks stay away just because of this.  

In fact, one Saturday when the morning crew left our first spot and there was no one else to play, she said ""let's get over to the other (harder playing) spot for a few games"" LOL.  So we did.  (That's where we got creamed, lol.  But whatever).

The biggest compliment I hear is when she tells an opponent how long she's been playing and they're usually surprised.  She gets self-depreciating, but I feel good FOR her when she gets those compliments.

So while I was hoping it would be something she'd like to do with me (clearly, it is)... I never thought she'd take to it like this, but here we are...  

PS. Shout out for the Friday Challenger paddle.  Got them on sale when someone allowed the red color scheme to go out without the ""USPA approved"" stamp or something, and so they dropped them from $80 something to $50.  Someone on here said that Friday punches far above its price point, and even some high level people like them.  So I tried them out.  I'm now a Friday fan.  They are great paddles.

Although things are sometimes slow, I feel very satisfied when I see every detail being perfected. Every day is full of hard work and growth. Occasionally take a break from the busyness. Occasionally get together with friends to chat about life. Although it is not special, I enjoy this kind of happiness in the ordinary. I like to cook some meals at home in the evening and enjoy the rhythm I control. Simple happiness is in these details. These little rituals in life make me feel fulfilled.",1,1728669055.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Civil defense and related stuff. And arranging grassroots stuff to help.

I just realized today I have done nothing, at all, for fun. The way our shifts work now in war is we stay as long as we want as long as we can, then we go take a few days off. Some people last 5 days in a row. Some people do 2 days in a row.

But basically the only ""fun"" I've had is when I spent time alone to recover, physically and mentally.

But I haven't so much as had a walk with a friend having a cup of tea or coffee.

How about you guys? I am really trying, but other than there is no time or energy, ma fi nafs lal hal shi.

I wonder, should I make it a point to create these opportunities? Or is it a time for all hands on deck until the war ends?

But don't worry, as I said, I'm doing self-care, taking the time of I need, recovering.

It's just I used to always be and about, with some days left for my introversion. But always out and about

Then went for extreme hermithood for a few years and then became my old self again.

I miss the friends. I miss the hanging out. I miss the doing things with close friends in group settings. I miss the one on one intimate chats with a friend or colleague.

How about you? What have you been up to since the pager attack? And genuinely a serious question.

As I am told there are parts in Lebanon even now where life continues totally normally.

I am wondering if that's true, and again how you guys have been coping.

How can I bring this up?,"We’ve been together since I was 16. I recently found this website and was reading other peoples posts and it made me think about my own relationship. He is nice sometimes and things are okay overall but sometimes we have fights. Sometimes I’m just not in a good mood, or I show him attitude, or he shows me attitude, or he comes home later than he told me. Or if I tell him I need money to buy something. If the kids are too loud it makes him angry. To be honest sometimes he hits me but it’s not all the time. The last time was like 4 months ago because my old friend from high school texted me and said we should see each other for coffee. I wasn’t actually going because I have 2 kids and I don’t have a car but I said yes to him. I didn’t mean it I just said yes to be nice but my boyfriend saw it and he thought I wanted to cheat on him and he went crazy and started hitting me for it and made me text him that I can’t see him ever and he took my phone away for like a month and one of my tooth fell out. He said he would kick me out next time and he’d keep the children and it scared me. That was the worst fight we had. But the next day he told me he was just scared. One time he was trying to take a nap and my kids were playing and he slapped me because he said I wasn’t telling them to be quiet but I tried telling them to stop making too much noise. But we live in a 1 bedroom in his parents house they gave us their basement but there’s not a lot of space. It’s not bad and it’s fine for us. But the last time was 4 months ago. He used to be more romantic but now there’s nothing. But for my birthday he still buys me flowers. 

Sometimes when we’re having a fight he tells me I ruined his life and he wishes he never met me. When I got pregnant with my first he said he didn’t want an abortion and he promised he wanted to have a family and be together and everything. It’s like when I’m pregnant he’s really happy but when the baby comes everything is different because stuff is expensive and the baby cries and it’s more work. He says he hates the kids too. But other times he’s really nice to them and plays with them and it just depends on his mood. It makes me sad because they love him so much. He wanted a second kid and now he always talks about a third. 

Right now things are okay. But he’s not a bad man. He works every day to provide for us and I know he’s tired. Maybe if I really tell him I want things to be different or better. I told him before that he’s mean to me or I miss having a car and he just says he’s sorry or he’ll get me a car soon. He doesn’t take me seriously. He’s like that with everything. I tried telling him my son is sick and needs to go to the ER and he kept saying I was overreacting and then something happened and he believed me after that. Or even small things like I kept telling him I need diapers and he’ll only buy it when I have 1 left. I feel like he’s in a good mood lately so maybe I can talk to him about my car. I had a car but he crashed his so he started using mine and now it’s his because he needs it for work. I found one online that maybe we can buy and it seems like a good price. 

I think he’s just insecure. His friend was complimenting my cooking and he said my boyfriend is so lucky he has me because I can cook well and I have children and still have a good figure. Maybe that part about my figure was weird but he was just being nice. Afterwards my boyfriend got so mad at me and asked if I was speaking to his friend or if I talked bad about him. He got really mad but I don’t even know his friend.

This whole day he has been picking on me, shouting and screaming at me and pretty much annoying me for no reason. He comes to my workplace, sips his coffee, looks at his phone and goes back to annoying me. Due to the nature of my position at the factory, I get ample time to relax. (I load stuff into a machine, and when it empties I do it again.) I pretty much get around 10-20 minutes between loads and due to this, I have just enough time to go down to lunch, get food and go back to my workplace and continue working. I prepare the next load during the time I wait so I never run late or have an issue so once I do that, I pretty much have nothing to do if nobody else asks for help or asks me to do something. They usually don't or so far have not yet including today. However, this supervisor, even though he knows the relax and laidback nature of this position decided to come and bully me. At first it was because I had nothing to do, then he came to just scream and shout at me again for not being accurate with placing scrap wires (wires you cut out from the workplace) (I place them in a way that suits me the best as it is my workplace and everyone has told me to find my own method.) Then he just randomly came to complain about me to another coworker and then shouted at me once again for sitting down and having a smoke between loads. This went on until the final 45 of my shift where I clean the workplace for the next person. I had maybe 5 minutes of work left and he was complaining at first that I was taking it slow. Then he started screaming at me again for not mopping the floor the way he does it and do it in a way that fits me the best. (I have back problems so I cannot bend down that easily to mop) This is obvious from the way I move while bent down and me sweating due to the pain.) Then I got threatened with a phone call to my manager to tell him to cut my pay by 10% because it isn't done the way he likes it. At the end of the day, none of the other two supervisors complained as the job gets done either way in a proper fashion without shortcuts or dangerous tricks. Should I wait to see if he does it again, should i report him or should I keep it to myself and just avoid him? I would also like to apologise if I could not explain it properly. I am very tired.

I am asking in this subreddit because every country has laid out laws that differ from one another. I apologise if this is not suitable for this subreddit. I just had nowhere to ask and get opinions.

TLDR: My supervisor was pestering me for the whole day for no reason. Screaming, shouting and threatening with pay cuts even though the job gets done on time and without problems. Should I report him to HR, wait till he does it again or just keep it to myself?",1,1728668065.0,Ljubljana,9,1.0,False

1g1fbdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/circumcision/comments/1g1fbdr/day_0_post_op/,Day 0 post op,"Finally got circumcised with a frenulum removal this morning. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy the procedure actually ended up being. Here's some points on what it was like for anyone who may be curious or nervous on what to expect. 

- I was expecting the local anaesthetic to be the worst part, but it really wasn't. I honestly barely even felt the injections it really just felt like pressure. Less painful than a flu shot. The actual sensation of the numbness was a pretty strange feeling. 

- The most painful part was the electrocautery, but even then it was just a pinching sensation and didn't really hurt more than a 1-2/10. 

- The rest of the procedure like the actual cutting and the stitches and stuff i didn't feel at all. 

- I was able to get a coffee and lunch afterwards and didn't have an issue. 

- I did need to take some acetaminophen and an oxycodone when I got home as the local had worn off and it was stinging quite a bit. It's kicked in now and I have no pain at all now. 

- Peeing for the first time with a circumcised penis was strange, it kind of went everywhere because of the bandage, so I will probably have to sit to pee for a few days. So far there's not too much swelling though, and there's no bleeding. 

To summarise, it really wasn't that bad at all, it was honestly easier than going to the dentist. I was expecting to be bedridden for a long time afterwards but I'm doing pretty good at the moment. It is a good idea to take it easy for a bit, though.

I went through the usual procedures of flushing the new carbon filters so they wouldn't put black soot into my RO membrane etc. ... but noticed the output water had a horrible smell to it. 

I can best describe it like a very strong plastic-chemical smell, like Sharpie markers, or acetone. 

Trial and error troubleshooting revealed new output line as culprit. Even the outside reeked up-close (I didn't notice until I put my nose up to it). It got on everything it touched, too - my hands, my gloves, the plastic bag that I put it into, and almost certainly the water itself.

The water had gone into my water pitcher that way, when it was very strong. This becomes important later...

Anyway, I switched back to the old output line, and immediately the output water improved. I called the manufacturer and notified them of the situation. They promised to investigate their inventory. I haven't named them yet because I don't want to ruin their reputation - this is my 8th replacement carbon filter from them and I've never had this happen before.

I dumped out my glass water pitcher, blasted them out with cold water, then re-filled it.

The output water (remineralized) now smelled and tasted perfectly fine ... but later on, I got a mysterious day-long migraine after taking my morning medication and making coffee with it. The next (this) morning, instead of getting a headache, I got a low-grade fever after drinking it! 

Today I put 2 and 2 together, dumped the water pitcher again and re-filled it a second time, discarded a gallon out of the spout, refilled it, and then took another glass. Sure enough, got another headache within the hour, which lasted about 20-30 minutes. Less than before, but still.

Moral of the story folks, SNIFF YOUR TUBES BEFORE YOU INSTALL...

... Now I'm concerned:

1) Any ideas on what the heck this chemical was or how dangerous it is to long term health? Like what possibilities exist for what would cause this? It was flexible plastic tubing - has an almost vinyl-like texture to the outside. I might call them and ask...

2) Have any of you had this happen before?

3) How many times do you all think I should flush out my 3-gallon glass water tank before it's safe? ... I'd use a cleaner but without knowing what chemical I'm trying to remove I have no idea what cleaner would be effective or safe.

4) ... should I just throw out the water pitcher and coffeemaker and buy new ones just to be on the safe side?",1,1728667887.0,HydroHomies,0,1.0,False

Some might say the gloom seemed to eat up its surroundings, disguising its previous location as a blinding cloud of… mist? Is that what it is? When I looked closely, I could make out some shapes; leaves, indicative of plants. Phallic shapes that one would only assume were mushrooms, actually, and not genitalia sprouting from the ground. I stepped further into the gloom, allowing it to envelop me, adding me to the list of hidden items within its domain. As I wandered, I kept track of my observations, as though they were breadcrumbs for me to follow if I ever chose to leave the gloom. Splitting wood. Damp moss. Even a vine or a branch could be seen, if you were to squint. The spiderwebs were invisible within the gloom, but the feeling of them molding to my arms as I walked through them was easily identifiable. The grass and dirt were slightly damp underfoot – not squishy, not giving way to my weight, but I could tell by the texture of my steps that I’d need to hose these boots down before I went back inside. Suddenly I’m by the flowers and their brilliant colors, their gentle petal patterns almost imperceptible in these conditions.

Of course, none of this was truly a guessing game for me; I knew every plant that was here, the name of each occupant of every plot. I rubbed the waxy leaves to my right. I’d grown up here, in this garden. Watched my father carefully plan out, build out, and plant out every quadrant. I traced my hand over the rusted nails. He’d chosen good quality wood for his planting boxes; I’ve had to repair very little since he passed. The color had faded, there were dings and dents and tiny gnaw marks where ambitious creatures had let out their frustration. The wood was cool under my palms. My father used the soil as his outlet, his boredom and frustration and loneliness finding company in the relative wilds of our backyard. I’d helped him build this sanctuary – his sanctuary. I spin slowly, taking in every sector of the garden from where I stood in the center, ending with my feet facing north. He had no idea it had also become mine in the process, that it allowed me access to a piece of him, his inner world. He had no idea I ever wanted a piece of him. Now it holds the only piece of him left, and I can’t let it go.

Suddenly I was jerked out of my thoughts and self-pity as my wife called out from the edge of the gloom. She wasn’t willing to enter the garden on the gloomy days. Those were mine to wander alone. I supposed she needed me now. She only interrupts me in the gloom when I’m needed. I trudged back through the garden, leaving my boots on the back porch. The water dripping off my boots made them seem like a mirage next to his bone-dry pair to their left.

I found myself pulled into a rather morbid game of Spot-The-Difference. I wasn’t sure I could find twenty if I tried. They were the same brand, same model. The same burnt sienna boot laces winding through the same rust-resistant eyelets, the same brown soles worn down by similar use. But now mine were more worn, the arch making more of a mold to my foot than providing actual support. The stitching on my pair was fraying in spots that were near-pristine on his boots. Mine sported dark stains from puddles of liquids his had never touched. Mine held experiences he wasn’t here to share. Children are meant to bury their parents, though. And I’ve buried two.

Inside, I opened the blasted jar for her, and decided to stay. The gloom could wait until another day. So, we ate dinner, watched our nightly show, tangled together just likes the vines around the garden gate, filling the empty spaces between each other with ourselves. This was our normal nightly routine. I woke up in the mornings, had my coffee, downed a protein shake if I could tolerate the taste of substance. Headed to work, did my job, came home and gave her a kiss. Checked the garden. Appreciated the sunshine. Joined her while she made dinner, offered my help, knowing it would be declined. Tossed spare pieces of banter across our island counter from my place on the barstool.

I liked our little routine. It sped by. It kept me out of the gloom – at least, until something came along to spark the gloom once again.

 

“There’s a message on the machine. I think it’s too late to call back today.” I checked my watch. 5:13pm. I’d been in the garden longer than usual today. I had no doubt she’d remind me of the message again tomorrow: in fact, I was so sure of it that I almost didn’t bother to press play – until I saw a flicker of annoyance cross her face as she glanced at the light blinking on the machine.

I pressed the playback button. The machine clicked once. “Hi, this is Gerry, calling from Dr. Marsh’s office for Benton Bernard. You missed your 2:45pm appointment. I hope everything’s alright, please call us to reschedule when you get a chance, and be aware that you’ll see the cancellation charge on your card on file. Our hours are 8am to 4:30pm. Again, hope you’re alright! Have a good day.”

The machine beeped and announced the end of new messages before instructing us to press ‘2’ if we wanted to listen to saved messages.

The silence that followed the machine’s final click held heavy, threatening to layer the gloom over top of my world once again. I could see my wife shifting from foot to foot in my peripheral. She always avoided bringing him up. Either of my parents, really. I supposed today’s appointment had been his six-month neurologist check-up. In the early days after his diagnosis, he said he was lucky to have lived long enough to get dementia. If he had known then what the later days would look like, I think he would’ve called it his comeuppance, and insisted luck wasn’t a factor.

“Is that something you can handle?” Her voice interrupted my thoughts. A thinly veiled double entendre, a coward’s attempt to ask how I’m feeling. I answered the face-value question instead.

“Yeah, he gave me access and authority over his medical case after my mother. I’ll call in the morning, let them know he’ll be missing all future appointments, too.” It was meant as a joke, an attempt to lighten the mood, but as I heard the words leave my lips – the flat tone of my voice reverberating through the tension in the air – I knew the gloom was back. I kissed her forehead, turned heel, and stepped out into the gloomy air once more. At least the interlude was longer this time. I’d need to rinse my boots off again tonight. She tolerates my gloom, but not dirt on the freshly mopped floors.

 

The garden seemed different when the gloom was here. The obfuscation of all my efforts had an almost protective feeling, the mist and fog swirling around the fruits of my labor. Hidden from view. What was normally a bright, beautiful, peaceful refuge for animals and humans alike suddenly became unsettling, secretive – still peaceful, though.

I’m safe here. My fears are buried here, allowing me to visit them on my own terms. Laying them to rest in my own backyard meant I grieved on my own schedule. That was the thought, anyway. Of course, I could never have true control. The control is an illusion, no more tangible than the gloom that swarms my consciousness and envelops the world around me, dictating my actions, dictating my thoughts.

I tightened the last screw and gave the new garden bench a stiff tug. Seems solid. I stood back to examine my handiwork. It was fine. A sturdy place for my wife and I to sit was the only goal, and that’s the only function this bench had. The center of the garden wasn’t a particularly special place. Just a square of packed dirt, walkways leading from each corner, planting boxes and plots angling out from the sides. The only notable feature of the garden’s center was the boot prints implanted into the dirt – a set facing each cardinal direction. I carefully slid my feet into the deepest-set tracks, facing north. I’d placed the bench perfectly; if I popped a squat, my ass would meet seat.

I could just barely make out the jagged shape jutting from the ground a few yards ahead; if I were to sit, it’d be hidden behind shrubbery. I found myself immersed in the shadowed shape, examining the angle of each edge, meandering in its direction as though entranced. I hadn’t visited this plot in… how long had it been now? When my father first passed, I’d come to this plot weekly. I ran my hand across the rough surface as though the tree stump could tell me when I last visited. The only date this tree knew was the one recklessly carved into its bark. I had always intended to add more to it, something to honor him. The thought that I still could caused me to hesitate before I turned heel and walked out of the garden, mindful of where I placed my feet.

 

This time I just placed my boots right next to the hose to drip dry. My socked feet weaved their way across the screen porch towards the sliding glass door, where I peeled the dirtied socks off my feet and stepped inside. I was surrounded by the smell of fresh aromatics and the sizzling sound of a pan-seared protein. I could see potato slices roasting, the harsh oven light beating down on the crisping skins.

The clock read 6:57pm.

“You have time to shower before dinner, if you’d like.” She knows how important routine has been to me, and how routine is what keeps the gloom tolerable. The last thing I want to do in this moment is take care of myself, but I do for her. I’d do anything for her.

I pulled her into a bear hug, planted a firm kiss on the top of her head as my arms encased her. I looked down as she looked up. There was a faint smile on her lips that didn’t quite connect to her eyes. The thought that I don’t hold her enough passed through my mind as I head to the bathroom, but washed with the suds down the shower drain.

The table is set, drinks poured, food served by the time I sat down.

“Did you call them back?”

“Yep.”

“Did they ask any questions?”

“Nope.” I chewed slowly, hoping to keep my mouth busy for as long as possible. I savored the taste of the roasted potatoes, careful not to burn the roof of my mouth. To my surprise, my wife stays silent, too. I missed when she used to leave no silences in the household, filling our home with constant activity and vibrancy.

“I want to hear it from you, now.”

“We’ll sit out on the bench after dinner.” I owed her this. We made small talk through the rest of the meal. We talked of the weather (how the recent rains were ahead of the seasonal cycle) and the food (yes, I do like the new flavor profile she’s trying, yes, her food is delicious, yes, I’ve had enough to eat). We both offered to do the dishes even though we knew I would do them in the end, ‘winning’ (if you could call it that) with the logic that she cooked, so the dishes are my job. We made eye contact as I loaded the last dish into the dishwasher, as though the longer we lingered the more prepared we would be for this conversation to begin.

This was her first time wearing her boots. I laced them for her, careful to make them snug without squeezing her feet too tightly. We slipped our jackets on and our hands together, our fingers intertwining.

As she entered the gloom with me for the first time, her boot prints wore their own distinct path into the damp sod next to my long-worn tracks. We took our time, winding our way through the circular rows, quadrant to quadrant. I answered her various trivial questions.

“Is this an heirloom tomato or green zebra? Is that zucchini or cucumber? Is that the edible flower patch? Is the herb garden nearby?” They’re Santorini’s. Those are cucumbers, but both are grown here. That is the flower patch, and the herbs are set towards the outer southern edge in thick stone boxes, we passed them on the way in.

Her questions paved our pathway to the center, to the bench I just installed this afternoon. Silence fell after we sat. I looked down, where my boots filled the same heavily indented north-facing prints I’d been observing earlier. I could see the edge of her left boot without shifting my gaze. My eyes made their way from her boots to her braided hair, where her expression confirmed she’d seen the shadow of the stump. I began to talk.

 

I spoke of when my mother fell ill. A respiratory virus turned pneumonia turned organ damage. Exhaustion turned fatigue turned 18 hours of sleep a day. Discomfort turned pain turned agony. This part she knew.

I kept talking. Hope turned suffering turned… mercy. The garden was borne, starting with those stone-edged herb gardens lining the house’s side of the garden. Within those plant beds lie remedies for nausea, fever, muscle tension. She knew of the herb gardens, visible from the kitchen window.

I told her the history of the now-empty herb plot. It held a cure for any ailment – at least, that’s how my father described it to me back then. We’d include a few leaves in her evening salad every day. She kept sleeping, more and more. “It’ll help her feel better. The sleep means it’s working. It’s a miracle, a mercy,” he would say. Then one evening, she slept right through dinner. And the next day’s dinner. And the next.

After those three days I helped him bury her in his garden, underneath the tree they’d carved their initials into all those years ago.

And the years went on. The plot that had grown her mercy now laid empty, irredeemably contaminated by the very presence of the plant. We never spoke of it, of her. He expanded the garden from the herb boxes to her grave, channeling his grief into this land. I was his silent helper, until I left for college, where I met her, and oh well, she remembers how we met and how life followed on.

And the years went on. His dementia came, and we moved in as his caretakers. In the early days, he had a humor about him. The dementia seemed to eat that away alongside the memories it devoured. He came to believe his beloved wife had left him, the memories of the mercy he and I provided lost to him forever. One day, in a fit of grief and rage about how terribly his wife had betrayed him, he chopped down the tree that displayed their initials. Then, he had a moment of clarity that broke through the disease like an unwelcome headlight would through a residential window at 2am. I found him, knelt barefoot in front of the jagged stump, knees upon her grave. Broken, hollow, defeated. I grabbed the axe he had used. I thought he deserved a mercy.

I buried him at that tree stump – with her. Resting, together, forever in the garden. Built for her, nourished by him. The gloom came for the first time that day, settling over me like the dirt onto their grave.

 

My wife sat still, listening, absorbing every word. At some point, while I was lost in the whirlwind of context and timeline in my head, she placed her hand on my forearm. When I was done speaking, she held me, my tears slithering their way down her waterproof jacket as I sobbed into her shoulder. It was no longer my burden alone.

I had planned to carve their initials into the tree’s bark once again, even with the stump being dead long ago. We carved our own in silence instead. She returned to her seat on the bench, able to admire our handiwork engraving the wooden headstone. I returned to my seat next to her. The shrubbery blocked my view – but I was looking at my boots instead, noting how his boot prints were too big for me to fill.

1g1f9ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1g1f9ew/suddenly_lost_my_cat/,Suddenly lost my cat,"I lost my baby girl, Sasha, last night.  She was 9 years old.  She had been sick, not eating or drinking for a couple days. We took her to the vet, the vet told us to take her to the ER.  ER said she had massive fluid buildup around her lungs and ultrasound indicated late stage heart failure. Any treatment would be palliative and likely only prolong her life by weeks at most, so we made the decision to put her down.  She passed in my lap.  We took her home and buried her in the garden.

It's the morning after and I'm still sobbing because that cat was probably a solid third of my life. She was the reason I went to work, and spending time with her is what I looked forward to most after clocking out.  

She was such a lap cat, and we had our routine where I would wake up, and she would race me down the stairs and sit on the arm of my recliner while I made coffee, and then I'd sit and cuddle her while drinking coffee for the first hour of my day or so.  

This is my first cup of coffee without kitten time in ages and I'm crying so much I can't even drink it.

I'm finally latching my bedroom door, because I can't stand my brain tricking me into thinking she'll push her little nose through the door to come find me any minute.

Almost every activity I enjoyed doing at home would involve her tagging along and being there, so now I just can't bring myself to do anything but sit and think about how much I miss her.

And it's one of those shitty things where leading up to this, I was on a 10 day stretch at work so I was so exhausted those few days she before she got sick, I didn't spend as much time with her as I could have.  I'm lucky I got a picture of her curled up behind my head on Saturday, when she was still acting healthy and happy. I know hindsight is 20/20 but I'm still beating myself up about it.

I just want my baby girl back, and it hurts so much.

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a powdered supplement formulated to mix with your daily coffee. Its main function is to supercharge metabolism and accelerate fat-burning processes.

Java Burn includes a mix of natural compounds known for their fat-burning potential and ability to regulate blood sugar.

**How Does Java Burn Work?**

Java Burn works by increasing your metabolic rate. Combined with coffee, which naturally stimulates metabolism, the ingredients in Java Burn amplify this effect. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that boosts energy expenditure even when you're at rest, while other components in Java Burn aid in appetite suppression, fat oxidation, and better blood sugar control. Together, they help create a calorie deficit, the cornerstone of effective weight loss.

Raspberry Ketones: Helps in breaking down fat and supporting metabolism.

Chromium Picolinate: Regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb cravings.

L-Theanine: Found in green tea, it balances the jittery effects of caffeine and promotes relaxation.

**Benefits of Java Burn**

Boosts metabolism: Speeds up the body's calorie-burning processes, even when you're resting.

Enhances fat oxidation: Helps break down stored fat and utilize it as energy.

Reduces cravings: Appetite suppression makes it easier to maintain a calorie deficit.

Energy boost: Increased focus and physical energy, especially during workouts.

Balances blood sugar: Ingredients like chromium picolinate aid in maintaining stable sugar levels.

**Dosage Instructions**

Java Burn is designed to be mixed with one cup of coffee daily, preferably in the morning. Continued use over three to six months provides the best results for sustained fat loss and improved metabolism.

Pros and Cons of Java Burn

Day 1: Travel Day from KY

We stayed at Hotel Wailea. It really is as amazing as everyone says. Pictures don’t do it justice. We were absolutely blown away and thought how no other resort could ever compare! We were greeted with leis and a bottle of champagne in our suite. Spent some time walking around and then went out for an easy dinner. Went to Pita Paradise and sat at their quaint outdoor patio. Had a fun cocktail and shared some vegetarian appetizers. Love that the hotel offers complimentary shuttle service in the Wailea area! Early night as we get used to the 6 hour time difference. 

Day 2: Palauea Beach & Pool Day

Started off with breakfast at the hotel. We booked through Costco Travel which came with a great deal. $60 off breakfast daily, as well as $400 towards other food and drinks. $600 Costco giftcard at the end of our stay. 

Anyway, back to the good stuff. After breakfast we checked out a small farmers market. Bought some jams to take home. Then we were shuttled to Palauea Beach, or called White Rock Beach. This felt very secluded. There were maybe 5 other couples. It was quite windy this day, and sprinkled a bit. We didn’t stay too long here. But as you know the weather changes on a dime in Maui. By the time we made it back to the hotel pool, the sun was shining. We enjoyed some delicious cocktails by the pool. Can I mention how nice it was to stay at an adults only hotel! 

That evening we had a reservation at Monkeypod. Sat outside. Super fun vibe, great food. I will be a little controversial and say … the Mai Tai was tasty, but overhyped! 

Day 3: ROAD TO HANA

Big, long day. Booked with Valley Isle. Had no interest in driving ourselves and glad we didn’t. Our tour guide grew up in Hana and has been driving these tours for 19 years. The black sand beach was absolutely worth the drive. I had never seen anything like it before, and we had a great time swimming and using our underwater camera. Lots of laughter. Changed out of my bikini afterwards, and a ton of pebbles fell out. Too funny. 

We also got to swim under a waterfall. The water was “refreshing” meaning ICE COLD. Once in a lifetime experience, though. Got some great photos. The memories will last a lifetime. We stopped at Ho’okipa Beach and admired all of the turtles (from a distance). 

After our 12 hour day, we came back for a long hot shower. Then we went for pizza and beer at Manoli’s. 

Day 4: Chill Day + Maui Brewing

This was probably one of the best days on our honeymoon. We started with breakfast at Kihei Caffe. Flavored cold brew and the best breakfast by far … banana pumpkin bread french toast. Topped with all kinds of yumminess of coconut whipped cream, pineapple, lilikoi syrup, oh my. Loved the diner feel of the place and enjoyed people watching outside. 

Time to hit the beach. This time we tried out Po’olenalena, or what they called “Chang’s”. This was our favorite beach. Morning is the best time to go. Not kidding, maybe ten other people when we were there. Stunning views. Not one, but two sea turtles swam past us while we were wading in the water. Kind of jarring, not going to lie! Spent a few hours swimming, relaxing, reading. 

That afternoon we headed to Maui Brewing. Such a fun place! Got a seat at the bar and chatted up the people next to us. I always enjoy asking where people are from. We each got a flight of beer. My favorite was the Pineapple Wheat. Left with plenty of merch. 

Day 5: Snorkeling with Trilogy - Honolua Bay

Only FOURTEEN of us on this huge Trilogy boat!!! Couldn’t believe our luck. First time ever snorkeling. Took a little bit to get used to understanding that yes, I can put my face in the water and breathe! Funny. Saw 3 or 4 turtles. Favorite part was watching them come up for air and seeing their cute faces. Made sure to keep our distance and not scream/splash when we saw them like we saw some children do. Again, it was nice to go back to our adults only hotel :) 
On the way back they used the sails. Loved just relaxing in the sun admiring the views. 

On the way back we stopped at Leoda’s and tried both the chocolate macadamia and the apple crumble pies. Delicious. 

Back at the hotel we got dinner and drinks by the pool. I have to say, most of the best things we ate were poolside. It was the end of the day so we snagged a cabana. Didn’t matter, as we were the only ones there. Bliss. 

Day 6: Fun in the Sun

Breakfast at the hotel, complete with POG mimosas. Then straight to the beach. This time we checked out Maluaka. Stunning views. Today was Saturday, more locals and families. Enjoyed watching people boogie board and snorkel. Came back for a well deserved nap. 

Went to Ma’alaea for our sunset sail with Trilogy. Much more people this time, but once the drinks started flowing we all had an amazing time. I’m glad I researched before and dressed for the weather. That evening wind on the water is no joke! The music was … interesting! Nothing like being on a tropical vacation and hearing Nickelback’s “Photograph” blasting while drinking a Mai Tai. Hilarious. 
Day 7: Shopping & Maui Wine

First up was a complimentary canoe ride through our hotel. One hour along Wailea Beach. It was neat to see the other big resorts. The water was much warmer than snorkeling so we jumped out of the canoe for a little bit. Even saw a couple of turtles. 

After breakfast we headed to the Shops of Wailea. Skipped the high end stores and found cute teeshirts and other souvenirs at Whaler’s and Soha. Had the best frozen coffee I’ve ever had. Macadamia mocha. 

In the afternoon we made the curvy drive up to Maui Wine. Pulled off at the stops along the way and admired the views. We each tried a wine flight and got some cheese and crackers. Finished with a glass of cold pineapple wine. Yum. 

Dinner we went back to Pita Paradise to try the baklava ice cream cake. Best dessert of the trip … and maybe of all time! After dinner we went to a bar called Tikihau. Really fun place with interesting cocktails. Tried an espresso martini for the first time, and what made it better was the rum instead of vodka. Straight to bed after this. 

Day 8: Maui Surfer Girls! 

Best activity, hands down. Probably because I was a “natural” :) Small group of only 4 of us. Our instructor, Gina, was incredible. Bad ass! Love that they have a photographer. We left with some amazing pictures. Paddling is no joke. By the end of our time I was laying on the board, hoping the waves would just push me back to shore. Exhausting. Nothing like mexican food and a beer at 10am can’t fix. We went to Fred’s in Kiehi, because it was easy. Nothing special but can’t beat a Corona with the ocean view in the distance. 

After some relaxing time spent at the pool, we put on our resort wear and went to the Birdcage Bar. Breathtaking view, very romantic. Held hands and watched the sun go down. Skipped the food here and each had a couple of cocktails. Finished the day eating snacks and watching tv in bed. Didn’t take long to fall asleep. 

Day 9: Beach and Ocean Vodka

Went back to get that frozen coffee again, lol. Straight to the beach! Po’olenelena (Chang’s) again, as we decided it was our favorite. Spent about 3 hours swimming, relaxing, reading. The waves were stronger today. Once the wind picked up we headed back to get ready to leave for Ocean Vodka. Glad we did the tasting. Trying the different rums and learning more about them was a great experience, worth the money. 

Got some food and cocktails (which were just … okay) but the view and vibe made up for it by far. 

Day 10: Pa’ia before heading home

Last day, bummer. Started with breakfast at Nalu’s. Popular place, glad we arrived right when they opened. Got the corn flake crusted french toast. Best french toast I’ve ever had. Sat outside and had a good laugh at a waitress having to be on “chicken security”, spraying them with water as they got too close to the diners. We were told they get up on the tables. They are hungry! Funny. 

Hit the pool for an hour. Last time, sad. Had to get one last cocktail, of course.

Went to Kula Botanical Gardens. Quietly strolled around. Saw maybe 4 other people. Beautiful, but maybe the wrong time of year? Not a ton of things in bloom. Still enjoyed it.  

Went to Pa’ia to see what it’s all about. Did some shopping. Ate at a Tex-Mex restaurant before heading to the airport. Back to KY. 

Aloha, Maui. We will be back.

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a powdered supplement formulated to mix with your daily coffee. Its main function is to supercharge metabolism and accelerate fat-burning processes. The key differentiator is its compatibility with coffee—leveraging caffeine’s natural properties while adding a blend of weight-loss-enhancing ingredients. Java Burn includes a mix of natural compounds known for their fat-burning potential and ability to regulate blood sugar.

**How Does Java Burn Work?**

Java Burn works by increasing your metabolic rate. Combined with coffee, which naturally stimulates metabolism, the ingredients in Java Burn amplify this effect. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that boosts energy expenditure even when you're at rest, while other components in Java Burn aid in appetite suppression, fat oxidation, and better blood sugar control. Together, they help create a calorie deficit, the cornerstone of effective weight loss.

**Key Ingredients in Java Burn**

Green Coffee Bean Extract: Rich in chlorogenic acid, it boosts metabolism and limits carbohydrate absorption.

Garcinia Cambogia: Known for its appetite-suppressing properties and its ability to block fat production.

Green Tea Extract: High in antioxidants and enhances fat oxidation while providing a natural caffeine boost.

Raspberry Ketones: Helps in breaking down fat and supporting metabolism.

Chromium Picolinate: Regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb cravings.

L-Theanine: Found in green tea, it balances the jittery effects of caffeine and promotes relaxation.

**Benefits of Java Burn**

Boosts metabolism: Speeds up the body's calorie-burning processes, even when you're resting.

Enhances fat oxidation: Helps break down stored fat and utilize it as energy.

Reduces cravings: Appetite suppression makes it easier to maintain a calorie deficit.

Energy boost: Increased focus and physical energy, especially during workouts.

Balances blood sugar: Ingredients like chromium picolinate aid in maintaining stable sugar levels.

**Dosage Instructions**

Java Burn is designed to be mixed with one cup of coffee daily, preferably in the morning. Continued use over three to six months provides the best results for sustained fat loss and improved metabolism.

Pros and Cons of Java Burn

**Pros:**

Easy to incorporate into your daily coffee routine.

Natural, plant-based ingredients with proven fat-burning benefits.

Enhances both energy levels and metabolism.

Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility.

**Cons:**

Results may vary depending on individual metabolism.

Only available online.

Excess caffeine can lead to jitters if consumed in high quantities.

**Conclusion**

About 2.5 weeks ago went to doctor with my symptoms and was told its likely gastritis. Was given a prescription for a pill (pretty sure it's pantoprazole) that helps manage stomach acidity level. Been taking it every morning about 45min before breakfast. Been eating omelettes, cream of wheat, rice, chicken. Avoiding dairy, coffee, pricy stuff, pepper, etc. 

After a few days symptoms seems to have gone away.
However at the start of this week I started having symptoms again. Usually starting in the 2nd half of the day.
First half I have no problems. Then in 2nd half it starts with slight pain/pressure in top right corner of stomach, and eventually turns into a mild burning pain in general stomach area.

Haven't really changed my diet or anything, and been following the meds as ordered. Is it normal to just have it flair up for no reason like that?

Aside from the discomfort in the stomach I don't seem to have any other symptoms. No loss of appetite, no anything else.",1,1728666950.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for some assistance/advice on an issue I am having with my friends coffee machine. I said I would fix it for him as it's an old machine, I enjoy these things and also would be costly for him to send away to a company.

**The problem**
So, with the service door opened (used flat head to activate the closed door microswitch), the grinder works, puts coffee onto the infuser, infuser then moves over to the right, it then travels up to the top piston. As soon as it's at the top of its travel and reaches the top piston the grounds bin light and red triangle comes on. The infuser then comes back, dumps the dry grinder coffee and goes back to it's starting position.

**What I've done so far**
My friend told me that it was all working but wasn't getting water for the coffee. Stupid me decided to open the machine up before trying to make an espresso.

*Checked for any blockages, none.

*Took apart the top piston, cleaned it all, replaced seals and using food grade  lubricant.

*Took apart the infuser, cleaned it all, replaced seals and using food grade lubricant.

*Checked the grounds bin microswitch with a multimeter which seems fine. I'll use the terms ABC for connections, with button depressed AC is normally closed, fine. When button is pressed AB is now normally closed with no continuity to C, so the switch works fine.

I'm scratching my head now with what to do, I'm hoping someone has came across this before and sorted it but I'm thinking it may be a signal issue ?

Any help is greatly appreciated !

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the lemon zest and lemon juice.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.
5. Gently fold the flour-coated raspberries into the batter, being careful not to overmix.

**Step 2: Bake the Cake Layers**

1. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cake pans.
2. Bake for 20–25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
3. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Step 3: Make the Lemon Frosting**

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until creamy.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
3. Mix in the lemon juice, lemon zest, and heavy cream, and continue to beat until the frosting is light and fluffy. Adjust the consistency with more cream if needed.

**Step 4: Assemble the Cake**

1. Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a layer of lemon frosting on top.
2. Add the second cake layer and repeat with another layer of frosting.
3. Top with the final cake layer and frost the entire outside of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (crumb coat). Chill for 20 minutes to set.
4. Finish frosting the cake with the remaining lemon frosting, smoothing it out with a spatula.

**Tips for Making the Best Lemon Raspberry Cake**

1. **Coat the raspberries in flour:** Tossing the raspberries in flour before folding them into the batter helps to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake.
2. **Use fresh lemons:** Freshly squeezed lemon juice and zest will give your cake the best flavor, so avoid using bottled lemon juice if possible.
3. **Don’t overmix the batter:** Overmixing can make the cake dense. Mix until the ingredients are just combined for a light and fluffy texture.
4. **Chill before frosting:**ﾠChilling the cake layers before frosting helps prevent the frosting from melting and makes the assembly process easier.

**Why This Recipe Works**

This recipe uses buttermilk to create a tender, moist cake that pairs perfectly with the tartness of the lemon and raspberries. The lemon frosting adds a creamy, zesty finish that balances the sweetness of the cake. The fresh raspberries add bursts of juicy flavor in every bite, making this cake a refreshing dessert that’s ideal for any occasion.

**Serving Suggestions for Lemon Raspberry Cake**

* **For spring and summer gatherings:** This cake is a beautiful centerpiece for brunches, garden parties, and family get-togethers.
* **With tea or coffee:** Pair a slice of this cake with a cup of tea or coffee for a delightful afternoon treat.
* **Decorative garnish:** Top the cake with fresh raspberries, lemon slices, and mint leaves for an elegant presentation.

**Conclusion**

**Lemon Raspberry Cake** is a stunning and flavorful dessert that’s sure to impress with its bright, zesty flavors and elegant look. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply enjoying a treat, this cake offers the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Easy to make and full of fresh ingredients, it’s a dessert that everyone will love.",1,1728666281.0,Arecipe,0,1.0,False

For the people who had POTS BEFORE mono, how did your body respond/how was recovery? For reference, I'm 25 and have had POTS since 2011 or 2012.

  
A few weeks ago I had THE MOST painful sore throat ever to the point I couldn't even eat solid foods. I had a virtual doctors appointment because I was about 4 hours away from my PCP. She prescribed me antibiotics because I had a sinus infection, and if it happened to be strep then great, two for one. I didn't start the antibiotics til the next day but it's good I was prescribed them because I also ended up with a double ear infection, which I found out about when I went to urgent care for difficulty swallowing lol. During this time I also had lymph nodes so swollen you could see them through my skin. Although it didn't seem to be due to the antibiotics, my sore throat and lymph nodes eventually calmed down maybe about a week post these symptoms. Whole time I'm still thinking it's strep though. Fast forward, I noticed a slow trickle of other symptoms. One being that I was very tired. I'd gotten into a bad habit of going to bed late every night but then I started struggling to force myself to stay awake until 9 before sleeping. However, I assumed it was due to my prolonged poor sleep schedule or changing seasons or those random periods where you just experience fatigue or whatever for no real discernible reason. Then, I was due to travel from the northeast to Cali for a planned trip. The night before or so, I noticed that I felt a weird pressure in my upper left abdomen under my ribcage. It wasn't painful, it just sort of felt like something was pushing out my ribcage.

  
In California I was staying with a friend and kept saying things like ""man this jet lag go crazy"" and ""hey can I make another coffee? I normally try to only drink it once a day but I'm just so exhausted"" and ""man my body just must really hate west coast time."" So, the moment I stepped off the plane back home, I went to urgent care and my mono spot was positive lol.

  
So, I'm just wondering how other people with POTS recovered? I really didn't think it was mono because I assumed I would be much more sick as my body responds VERY poorly to viruses like covid, the flu, colds, etc. This time around I almost didn't feel sick, aside from that extremely painful sore throat and extremely painful lymph nodes - but I just didn't have that sick feeling if you know what I mean. But now I am moderately concerned about how long the fatigue will last and if it will perhaps impact my symptoms.",1,1728666056.0,POTS,4,1.0,False

# Introduction

[Amazon FBA](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-improve-amazon-fba-ads-creatives/) starts with an engaging storefront. Your brand needs a home and showcase window on Amazon. With millions of sellers vying for customer attention, simply listing products isn’t enough. An engaging Amazon storefront offers you a unique opportunity to stand out, showcase your brand identity, and create a seamless shopping experience that keeps customers coming back for more.

The storefront is the virtual home of your brand. It features an interactive space where you can communicate your story, display your product catalog, and highlight essential offerings. Why is this so important? In this blog, we will walk you through 10 compelling reasons why building a captivating storefront is essential for driving sales, fostering loyalty, and growing your brand on Amazon.

# 1. Brand Identity & Recognition

A well-designed Amazon storefront is the digital reflection of your brand, offering a cohesive space where your identity comes to life. The storefront allows you to maintain visual and thematic consistency. This consistency is crucial in building brand recognition as customers associate your unique style and voice with quality and trust. Sellers must provide a curated shopping experience that aligns with the overall branding—whether it is premium, eco-friendly, or customer-centric—it needs to create a lasting impression. It helps distinguish your brand from competitors and fosters familiarity, leading to increased customer loyalty and repeat purchases over time.

# 2. Enhanced Customer Experience

Amazon’s brand storefront is essential in improving the overall shopping experience by offering customers an organized, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface. When customers land on your storefront, they are greeted with a streamlined layout that allows them to explore products, promotions, and your brand story. Unlike traditional product pages, a storefront provides a cohesive shopping journey where customers can browse various categories, discover new products, and understand what your brand represents.

Moreover, an attractive storefront incorporates engaging content like videos, [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/portfolio), and customer reviews that help customers make more informed decisions. These elements add depth to the shopping experience, allowing customers to visualize how your products fit into their lives. This interactive and informative experience enhances customer satisfaction while building trust, as customers feel more confident in their purchases. Ultimately, a well-executed storefront transforms a standard Amazon visit into an immersive, brand-driven experience that leaves a lasting impression.

# 3. Increased Product Discoverability

An engaging Amazon storefront significantly boosts product discoverability by showcasing your entire catalog in an organized and visually compelling way. Instead of relying on customers to search for individual products, your storefront can display curated collections, best-sellers, or seasonal offerings on the landing page. This structure makes it easier for customers to browse through various categories, uncover new or related items, and explore the full range of what your brand offers. With strategically placed product grids and featured sections, you guide shoppers through a more personalized and intentional journey, increasing the chances of discovering additional products beyond their initial interest.

Additionally, Amazon storefronts allow you to leverage Amazon’s search and advertising features to drive traffic directly to your storefront rather than individual product listings. It creates more opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, as customers who land on your storefront are exposed to multiple products and collections. By increasing the visibility of your lesser-known products or new launches, you can boost overall sales and reduce dependency on individual product listings, giving your entire catalog a greater chance of being seen and purchased.

# 4. Boosts Customer Loyalty & Trust

Let us face it—customers are likely to stick around and buy from a brand they trust. An engaging Amazon storefront is like a digital handshake that makes customers feel welcome, secure, and valued. It provides a professional and polished space where shoppers can get a sense of who you are as a brand, from your mission to your product quality. Consistently showcasing your brand’s personality through cohesive design, strong messaging, and thoughtful product presentations helps build the all-important trust factor. Trust is the magic ingredient that transforms one-time shoppers into loyal, repeat customers.

On top of that, a well-crafted storefront sends a subtle but clear message: “We care about your experience!” When customers see the effort you have put into creating a seamless, visually appealing shopping environment, they know they are in good hands. You are not just another faceless seller; you are a brand that goes the extra mile. Customers love feeling like buying from a brand invested in their happiness. As a result, they are more likely to return, rave about their experience, and recommend your brand to others. It is like the online version of word-of-mouth—except instead of chatting over coffee, they are leaving five-star reviews.

# 5. Showcase Your Best-Selling Products

Every brand has shining stars, and your Amazon storefront is the perfect stage to show them off. Think of it as your very own “best-of” playlist, where you get to feature your top-selling products front and center. Why make customers dig through pages of listings when you can put your greatest hits on display? Whether it’s a hot new release or a customer favorite, your storefront lets you give these products the spotlight they deserve, making it easier for shoppers to find what everyone’s raving about. It’s like rolling out the red carpet for your best products—who wouldn’t want to grab what’s trending?

But wait, there’s more! Featuring best-sellers also creates a sense of trust and urgency. When customers see a product with a “#1 Best Seller” badge or rave reviews showcased on your storefront, it taps into their “I don’t want to miss out” instinct. Suddenly, your top products aren’t just another option—they’re *the* option. By highlighting your best-sellers, you’re not only boosting their visibility but also creating a halo effect for the rest of your product line. If your best stuff is that good, everything else must be worth checking out too, right? It’s a win-win situation for your brand and your customers.

# 6. Cross Promotions & Upselling

Your Amazon storefront is like having a savvy salesperson who knows when to say, “Oh, if you liked *this*, you’ll love *that*!” It helps you create natural cross-promotion opportunities by grouping complementary products together. If you are selling a camping chair, Why not suggest a cozy blanket or portable lantern next to it? With a well-structured storefront, you can showcase related items your customers didn’t even realize they needed—until they see them sitting side by side, practically begging to be bought together. It’s like the virtual version of an impulse buy at the checkout counter, but way more strategic.

Your Amazon storefront can gently nudge customers toward upgraded or premium versions of the products they’re already eyeing. Maybe they came for your basic coffee maker, but after browsing, they’re seriously considering the deluxe model with all the bells and whistles. By positioning higher-value products in prime spots, you can subtly steer customers toward purchases—without feeling pushy. It’s all about creating a smooth, guided experience where customers feel like they’re making smarter buying decisions (while you’re boosting your average order value). Everyone wins!

# 7. Optimized for Mobile Shopping

In today’s world, shopping on mobile devices isn’t just a trend—it’s the norm. Your Amazon storefront needs to shine on smaller screens, and luckily, Amazon storefronts are built with mobile users in mind. With a mobile-optimized storefront, your brand can offer a seamless experience for the on-the-go shopper who’s scrolling through Amazon during their lunch break or while waiting for their coffee. Instead of squinting at cluttered pages or getting lost in endless product lists, your mobile shoppers will enjoy a smooth, visually appealing experience that feels as professional as if they were shopping from a desktop. It’s all about convenience, and your mobile-friendly storefront delivers it right in its hands.

But here’s where the magic happens: a mobile-optimized storefront doesn’t just make things look pretty—it keeps customers engaged. People are more likely to browse, add items to their cart, and complete a purchase if the process feels easy and intuitive on their phones. No frustrating pinching and zooming, no broken layouts. Just a clean, responsive design that adapts perfectly to whatever device your customers are using. Since mobile shoppers make up a huge chunk of Amazon’s audience, giving them a flawless experience could make a massive difference in your conversion rates. Let’s say, when your storefront looks good on mobile, your sales might look even better.

# 8. Platform for Engaging Content

Your Amazon storefront isn’t just for people who happen to stumble upon your products—it’s a powerful tool for driving organic traffic and spreading brand awareness far beyond the Amazon ecosystem. Think of it as your brand’s HQ, where customers can get to know you better. our storefront outside of Amazon—through social media, blogs, or email campaigns—you can funnel curious shoppers directly to a space that showcases your entire catalog and brand personality. With Amazon’s built-in SEO features, your storefront can also appear in search results, helping you capture organic traffic from shoppers looking for products like yours.

# 9. Gains Insights with Storefront Analytics

Having an Amazon storefront isn’t just about showcasing your products; it also gives you a treasure trove of data through storefront analytics. These insights can be game-changers for your business, helping you understand customer behavior, preferences, and shopping patterns. Want to know which products are getting the most clicks? Curious about what content resonates best with your audience? Storefront Analytics has you covered. By tracking metrics like page views, click-through rates, and conversion rates, you can make data-driven decisions that enhance your storefront and optimize your marketing strategies.

With this valuable data in hand, you can identify trends and adjust your approach accordingly. Perhaps you notice that a particular collection is flying off the virtual shelves while others are gathering digital dust. Armed with this knowledge, you can promote your best-sellers even more or rethink your offerings. The beauty of storefront analytics is that it allows you to continually refine and improve your brand presence on Amazon. It’s like having a crystal ball that shows you what’s working and what’s not, enabling you to fine-tune your strategy for maximum impact. In the world of e-commerce, leveraging analytics can be the secret sauce that elevates your brand and drives sustained growth.

# Conclusion

In the competitive world of Amazon, having an engaging storefront is not just a nice-to-have; it’s essential for building a successful brand. From enhancing customer experience and boosting loyalty to driving organic traffic and providing valuable insights, a well-crafted storefront serves as a multifunctional tool that can transform casual shoppers into devoted customers. By showcasing your best products and utilizing engaging content, you create an inviting and memorable shopping environment that resonates with your audience.

As you invest time and resources into creating an appealing storefront, remember that it’s more than just a digital space; it’s an extension of your brand identity. A thoughtfully designed storefront can set you apart from competitors, foster trust, and elevate the shopping experience.

I’m a hard worker, rarely complain, deliver excellent service and am very patient. When I started a new manager also started (about 5 managers total at my work). We discovered we both worked at the same resturant in the past so I thought we were on somewhat friendly terms? 

Turns out she’s a massive bitch and I have no idea how I can continue to grit my teeth with her. I get along excellently with every other co worker, every other manager, kitchen worker. 

For instance, couple weeks ago we were short a host, and a server for a busy Sunday brunch shift. It was me and one other co worker who each had about 15 table sections. At my work in the mornings you make all your own coffees, lattes, cocktails etc as well. No food runners and no bussers. It’s BUSY when we have a host and 3 servers but with one less server it’s insane. 

My manager rarely does anything or help when she’s on the floor but when she came in she immediately said to me “these tables better be both bussed and reset by the time I’m back” and I just about lost it because I still had 8 tables, 3 that just sat and I had a laundry list of drinks to make. 

I manage to buss all the tables but I didn’t have time to reset them and when my manager came back 5 mins later she cornered me saying “you didn’t do anything did you?? I told you to reset these.” And I said “sorry (managers name) but I have a number of new tables and I’m focusing on their needs before resetting the tables since they have been waiting a bit for drinks” and she just scoffed rolled her eyes. I went back up to her and said “is this a problem? Please go back to the office and check the cameras, I have not stopped moving since I got here at 6:30 and it’s now 12.” And she stormed off.

I got very upset because it just felt like all that day I was left to the wolves to do way too much work and then instead of coming and supporting us by maybe helping to make some drinks/run food/ANYTHING. She just scrutinized me. I even had to go to her after this all and say “I don’t want any problems, I just want us to be able to communicate clearly and not be talked to rudely when you can see I’m doing my absolute best.” And she said “mhmmm well then I need to see you do your absolute best okay?” 

Following this she made a mass announcement to the entire server team that “due to recent events we really need to focus on resetting tables as soon as possible, ideally within a couple minutes of customers leaving”

I went to her and mentioned that maybe if that’s becoming a common problem we need a support worker in the mornings and she said in a real pissed off tone and her eyes were like a fucking snake, “you’re lucky you even get another server to help you. Don’t come to me with that again.” 

What a fucking joke. Also to give a better idea of how busy we get, on a breakfast shift I will easily sell $2000 which is absolutely nuts when it’s just eggs and coffee. 

Even more recently I worked an evening shift with her there and everything was smooth. She was not on the floor the entire night but I had to go find her to QSA a margarita that a customer complained was too sour. I told her that he found it too sour and perhaps the new recipe the bartender is trying might be a bit too sour for some people’s taste knowing that a number of servers received a similar complaint. My manager immediately went from 0-100 by saying “excuse me but this is absolutely not a (bartenders name) ISSUE! Don’t start drama” and I’m like excuse me???? When you comp someone’s food or drink you need to know WHY! So it doesn’t happen in the future???? The fuck. 

I’m just so over her and I don’t know how to deal with her anymore. Do I just ignore her??? Help please. ",6,1728665981.0,TalesFromYourServer,10,0.71,False

1g1eb90,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1g1eb90/had_my_first_migraine_with_aura_and_freaking_out/,had my first migraine with aura and freaking out about stroke risk.,"hi i’m in my early to mid-20s and just had my first migraine with aura a few days ago. and i’m honestly freaking out. i was feeling a bit tired after shopping so took a nap and when i woke up things got weird. i was cutting vegetables and watching a video when i realized i couldn’t read properly. like i could only see one letter at a time instead of full words. i thought maybe i was just tired but when i closed my eyes i saw this small zigzag rainbow pattern on the right side of my vision. i had no idea this was an aura because i’ve never experienced this before. i thought it's brain fog. after that i started getting pain behind both my eyes and in my whole head which had me thinking it might be a tension headache. but then the pain moved to just the left side of my head which made me think it could be a migraine. i googled it and saw that some people suggest drinking water so i did that. i was also very nauseous. then i saw mixed advice about coffee but i went ahead and had some anyway because i needed some instant help. surprisingly the coffee helped and the pain started fading. later when i was reading about migraines i found out what an aura actually is and that’s when i read about the increased risk of stroke in women under 40 who get migraines with aura. now i’m really scared. my mom and aunt both get migraines but they’ve never had the aura part, so they don’t really know what i’m dealing with.
has anyone else experienced this? how do you manage it? is there any way to reduce the stroke risk? should i be taking supplements or medication? i’m super anxious and would appreciate any advice on what i should do to prevent this from happening again or reduce my chances of getting a stroke. this is all really new to me and i’m struggling with it. this all I've been thinking about the past days. 

also kinda weird/irrelevant info but when i was really young  around 4 years old i used to get these really bad headaches that felt almost like attacks. suddenly i would start screaming, crying, and banging my head but they weren’t seizures. my parents took me to doctors multiple times but nobody could ever figure out what was happening. after 8- 10 months they went away and never came back. now, with this new experience of aura i’m scared i might have those weird attacks again. i don’t know if there’s a link between the two but it’s freaking me out.

1g1e909,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1g1e909/i_got_attached_to_my_hookup_of_three_weeks/,I got attached to my hookup of three weeks ,"Hi guys. It’s my first time to post here at Reddit. I just wanted to get this off my chest. (Bear with me if you can as it’s so long)



I’m not gonna grammar check or anything this as this is my raw story. From the heart. 



In these past weeks, I met someone from the Grindr App (yes, i’m gay). We were already talking on Bumble but I think I didn’t respond to his last message as it was an open-ended answer. (Tbh, I wasn’t really looking for anything serious that time.)





I usually go to Makati to get coffee and really just to chill and go to the gym afterwards. I’m from the south. (I think u r wondering why I go to makati just to get coffee it’s because i’m really bored. I work from home.)



One night I went to makati to go to the gym and I opened my app. I messaged him (not knowing it was him obviously because most of the profile there is faceless.)



 I sent my album and he sent his. (I didn’t really recognize him at first. He was using another photo not his bumble photos)





I asked him where he was and he told me that he was in the gym that I was about to go to. Fast forward, I didn’t see him in the gym and he didn’t respond hours after that so I didn’t really messaged him again. 



After my gym session, i opened my app and he messaged me and he invitee me to his place to sleep there. I was kinda hesitant at first because he might kill me (lol)



But I went to his place. It was a walking distance from the gym I and him went to. 



I went to his unit and showered. 



We layed on his bed. It was such a comfy bed. I felt nothing really at first because I know for a fact that it’s just a hook up. We cuddled and he wanted me to sleep there but cannot as I’m not comfortable and I need to attend to my car. 



I went home around 3am. Said my thank you and drove home. 





After that week, I went to makati again and he messaged me where I am and I replied and he asked me if I want to go to the gym with him. I said okay.  After the gym session, he asked me if I wanted to go to his unit again and I said okay. 





He asked me if I want to shower with him. I declined politely as i’m really shy. 





After he showered, I showered too. We exchanged numbers that night. He asked me to save his number and I did.  After that Went straight to the bed and cuddlee again with him. But for some reason, this some it felt nothing like our first encounter. As the minutes passed by, i feel like theres something different. Maybe I was overthinking because we went to the gym first before cuddling lol. So naive right? 





It was around 2:00am. I told him that if he wants me to go because he needs to go to work at around 8am and he plans to go the gym at around 7am. Also he was out for the whole day and I can feel that he was really sleepy. 



I asked him “do you want me to go home na so you can sleep na?” He said “no.” Then hugged me so tightly as if he wants me just to stay there. 



It moved me to be honest.  Until now whenever I think of it.



When I left his unit, it felt so different. Day and night difference from our first encounter. 



I went home and messaged him saying thank you. The usual. He replied in the morning saying “you’re welcome.”



As the days passes, the feeling that I felt that night didn’t dissipate. It grew into something. I kinda like/d him. I thought it was just something that I wont remember in the  next few days. I was wrong. 



A week after that we met again in the gym but we didn’t hang after the gym session. I was so happy to see him that night. He went home before me. He said goodbye and I said my goodbye as well. 



That night that I saw him. I couldn’t really understand the feeling that I was feeling that time. I thought of asking him for a date but in a very subtle way of asking. I’m really shy. I wasn’t able to sleep well that night. And finally, i decided to ask him for a cheesecake date. 



I mustered all my courage to ask him out that morning. i asked him he could go with me to eat my favourite cheesecake.  He replied “why are you messaging me here in grindr?” “You can just message me using my number i prefer it that way” “i’m gonna update you later if i’m able to go with you” i replied “ maybe you didn’t want me to message you using your number” “okay just update me and no pressure” 





Fast forward, i went to makati to get my favourite cheesecake. He told me that okay he’ll meet me there in the restaurant and i told him okay see you.



I saw him entering the restaurant. My heart started to pound. I felt happy when I saw him. We ordered one cheesecake only because the cheesecake is good for two people. We talked for like an hour and drove him to his friend’s place. I told him thanks for the time and said goodbye



It was such a short date but I really enjoyed every bit of bit. I felt my heart pounding that night. I messaged him that night and he didn’t reply and i felt so bad. Maybe i overlooked the signs. But he messaged me around 9pm asking me where I was. I didn’t tell hin where I was because I know for a fact that I was getting attached. 



Such a naive boy.



After that night, he messaged me “good morning” 

I replied “good morning” too long story short I confessed what I was feeling and he told me it’s still too early which it was really too early because we only met a couple of times. I agreed. He told me that we are gonna date and we’ll see where it goes from there. I felt happy to be honest that I was able to say what I really felt but also scared that I might get hurt again. 



That day, we met to jog and note that I don’t really jog but I joined him because I wanted to spend some quality time with him. Just for the record, he didn’t force me to jog with him. I invited myself. 



So we jogged at Ayala Triangle. I felt so happy and so tired because I don’t really jog and it’s been years. We jogged around 4K+ for 30 mins. I was so happy that time being able to do things outside the bedroom and think that we might stand a chance. I drove him back to his place. And he told me “see you next week”. Fuck i can still remember his voice saying that to me. I’m teary-eyed writing this. 



On the weekend, he went back to his province to accompany his auntie. Nothing much happened that weekend. He updated me whenever he can. 



My anxiety kicked in. I’m the type of person when I get serious with someone, I like being updated. I feel bad when I don’t. Yeah. It’s such a needy trait. 



Come Monday, he didn’t said good morning and i messaged him saying good morning. No reply. I messaged him again around 11am. I asked hin if he was still asleep. He replied quickly. “ i’m awake good morning” i replied back “did you just wake up?”

He replied “no i woke up around 9-10am sorry about that i did my meal prep and studied”



I felt kinda bad but I sucked it up. Said “no worries go do your thing” 



After few hours, he messaged me that he was going back to manila i replied “ okay be careful driving the road is wet”. 



He messages me around the after said that he’s in already. I asked him he was in the office already he replied “yes.”





Later that night he messaged me “ just done with work going to the gym now” i replied “okay be careful going to the gym” he asked me where I was. I said “ home but if you want me to go there i’ll go there” he told me that i should decide. I asked him one more time “You want or not”. He replied “go here if you want you shouldn’t wait for me to tell you. If you want go here”

I got pissed off and i don’t know why. I think i just wanted him to say that he wanted me to go see him. I didn’t replied for hours and I replied midnight. “Sorry, i just wasn’t in the mood” 



The morning after that, he didin’t reply oe said good morning and i didn’t too. The whole day we didn’t message. And that just might be one of my biggest regret. Maybe I had just replied back and message him that morning maybe i wouldn’t have wrote this. 



A day after that he message me saying goodbye. Basically, he thinks that we are not compatible and it crushed me. I cried but didn’t respond. I delete his contact and his message for me to control the urge to message him.



This is just a rant to really get this off my chest. I really regretted the way I acted. I feel so stupid but I learned. 

I learned that if you wang something say it and go for it. 



If ever you are reading this which 99.9% chance that you are not but if the .1% succeeded, this is what I want to say to you.



Dear J



I’m sorry for being a pain in the ass. I wished it ended differently. I wished I acted differently and be more upfront, and chill. If I can just change the outcome I will and still now I regret it. I’m so fucking into you. I hope you pass your exam for the states. I only wish the best for you and thank you for making me feel some emotions in our short-lived dating experience. 



You left a hole in my heart. 



All the best,



G

I currently have a Bambino Plus and a DF64 Gen 2 for my setup however, I’m looking to upgrade my machine. I’m on my 3rd Bambino Plus in under a year due to consistent steam issues. Breville has been amazing though I’m taking this as a sign to move on

I’m a milk drink kinda guy and switch it up between cortado, cappuccinos, and lattes. I will do straight shots for desserts, espresso martinis, espresso old fashioneds but never just to drink. I stick with medium/dark roasts for my coffee and am the only coffee drinker in the house. Typically only make 1-2 drinks a day  and occasionally play barista when we have company but, that’s only once a month or so. I also do all of my shot pulls and milk steaming manually and don’t use the automatic shot timer or milk steaming options. Just feel like I should mention that

So, what am I looking for? I’m still learning about machines so while I can’t tell you specific features, this is what I’m looking for.

- Budget around $2k or less
- Ability to pull shots and steam simultaneously 
- Aesthetics, I’m a sucker for the stereotypical espresso machine (Mara X, Apartamento, Bello+, etc)
- Maximum 30 minute warm up time
- Consistency in shot quality
- Quality, would like it to last a few years minimum

Even though I have my “wants”, I’m open to any/all suggestions. I know there’s tons of machines within my price range so as long as I’m getting the most bang for my buck, I’m happy. Thanks in advance!",3,1728664964.0,espresso,14,0.81,False

I see back and forth about calories counting, I know in this sub everyone believes calories count. That's fine and i will agree and so i am trying to start tracking calories. 
I feel great, I'm losing weight but very slowly and I thought probably I am eating an excess of calories and that's why it's so slow.
I started counting yesterday with the ""carb manager"" app. And now that i see the calories in everything I'm eating and the calorie goals I need to reach, I am trying to eat less, and i.am just hungry all day long. Before I was eating to satiety, I didnt think I was overeating by any means, but today and yesterday calorie counting, I'm realizing I eat little enough to fit the calorie count, I am just going to be hungry all the time.

I have done 1200 cal diets in the past and was soooo hungry. I feel I'm being modest with my deficit by shooting for 1600 now. 
Should I shoot for higher? Am I eating wrong?

My general diet is I have about 3 bulletproof coffees throughout the day
I usually eat about 4 eggs for breakfast with lots of butter and a little cheese
Afternoon I have a quarter to half pound beef with butter or cream cheese
Dinner I have eggs or beef or chicken with butter and maybe some cheese. 
I do not do many vegetables, because I have multiple autoimmune and other health issues and my inflammation and AID stuff flares majorly with most veggies. 
I will sometimes do fermented veg and that doesnt flare me so badly. 
Judge me for all the beef and butter and eggs if you must but give me some good ideas of what to eat to feel good and full that doesnt have greens or nightshades or brassica veg at the very least, please!

Went staight into the muggers fight and lost 16 health on that floor.

And saw the deck and relic combo's power when I beat Champ taking only 2 HP. Grabbed Slaver's Collar from him over Velvet Choker and I forget the 3rd option. 

Second floor in act 3, I managed to finally get some healing with Bandage up from an event and was able to fix up my chip damage from the act 3 fights. Unfortunately, on the last floor before the act boss, Nemesis knocked me down by 16 on the turn before he died. 

I had the Time Eater, who was probably the worst boss I could have gotten. It was getting late and the first time through, I biffed it at the end because it was late and I was tired and I got him down to 5 HP, but I played All Out Attack with 3 cards left and it discarded my other attack.

We’re officially in the **final stretch**, and we’re just **one month away** from something monumental. 

In November, voters in **Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon,** and **Washington, D.C.** will decide on bringing Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) to their elections. And if we win, it will be one of the ***largest leaps forward*** for fairer elections in U.S. history. Excited? You should be!

## We're on the verge of something huge

This isn’t just another election—it’s a chance to bring millions of voters into a system that’s more fair, more representative, and more empowering. We’ve been building toward this moment for years, and it’s finally here. All the conversations, the grassroots organizing, the outreach -- it’s paying off.

Imagine this: Right now, **1.6 million** people in Maine and Alaska have access to RCV. Not bad, right? But if these ballot measures pass in November, we’ll expand that number by more than **10 times**. **Colorado**, with a population of **5.8 million**, would become the most populous state to adopt RCV If they pass Proposition 131 ([and the polls are looking really encouraging!](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=qx6zorBzupI_pSG1GSKLFl3oTKfY4Zv4E6jcbzuDxuLSszM8p2QoYdGWhVlvCe8k345UCPuwRjcqMkdM7r1taGc1mBROJR1Mck00XSKcx7iUe887dp2hRUZoaHBRv8Mg&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=2)). Add in **Nevada** (3.2 million), **Oregon** (4.2 million), **Idaho** (1.9 million), and **Washington, D.C.** (0.7 million), and you’ve got nearly **16 million new RCV voters** ready to lead the way.

That means over **17 million people** \-- a group larger than the combined populations of **Los Angeles and Chicago** \-- could be voting with RCV in 2026! That’s how you make a movement **unstoppable**.

*Volunteers in Colorado unload the 213,000 signatures that got RCV on the November ballot.*

## We're One Month Away: Let's Bring it Home! 

With just a month left until Election Day, now’s the time to **make things happen**. Every action we take, every voter we reach, every conversation we have will help turn this vision into reality. We’ve done so much already, and the finish line is in sight.

The excitement is real, and we know you feel it too. But now it’s time to turn that energy into action. Here’s how **you** can make a difference in this final push:

**Help from Your Phone**: Grab your phone and let’s get to work! We're living in a digital world, and there are plenty of effective ways to reach voters in other states to ensure they know the power of RCV.

## This is Our Moment -- and We're Ready for it

In just a few weeks, we could be looking at the biggest expansion of Ranked Choice Voting in U.S. history. That’s what’s on the line this November. But here’s the good news: We’ve got the momentum, we’ve got the passion, and we’ve got the **people power** to make this happen.

This is no longer a question of **if**—it’s a question of **when**. We’ve seen what RCV can do in Maine and Alaska, and now it’s time to bring that to millions more. The finish line is in sight, and together, we’re going to cross it.

**Let’s make sure we leave it all on the field. This is the moment we’ve been waiting for, and together we can get it done.**

## From the Field

## Michigan

[**Michigan group plans statewide town hall tour to promote ranked choice voting for 2026**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=609jErWZbAAM9SqQN-Mylt3fsONYHFFnKS64m7iYHe6OB4KHQaM39PsKVgXzxWcTHEjLJcjl9JkJQAD5T9NYgUM38oYHEFgzxwnOkMVTHy2cl_XS_MBKKfOv9Hq8tr2vGUs-Qw8imk51LRp4IuDmEk92eHl6GOwL2U5gRls0DOo&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=24): “Starting Sunday, Rank MI Vote will host 40 town halls in 40 days in cities in metro Detroit, as well as Grand Rapids, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Marquette and Traverse City. Rank MI Vote is a nonprofit modeled after Voters Not Politician, the group that successfully led statewide ballot initiatives introducing Michigan’s independent redistricting commission in 2018 and backed expanded voting rights in 2022.”

## Nevada

[**Return the power to the people: Support Question 3**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=5ll4CkujkcyI-ubz0MmY5tMIENPXV0nbR6d3Re4c7AmF2f67wXYlf6osK63eaF3tX-FtbqB4CuEeQmPmVgucKPulHUG9MbKUmUD5FN0pWHucAxHjxqqnFCWS9_4GNdIuZF1JDIRt4kb8tZ1AvobwuQ&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=25): “I’m voting for Question 3 because I’d like to see my fellow Nevadans, regardless of political persuasion, participate in the election of candidates with the broadest appeal. Question 3, in concert with RCV, will reduce the likelihood of extreme candidacies benefiting from an inherently flawed voting system.” 

[**It’s nearly unanimous: The political elite don’t like ranked-choice voting**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=5ll4CkujkcyI-ubz0MmY5tMIENPXV0nbR6d3Re4c7AmF2f67wXYlf6osK63eaF3tBu6-WDqwjNexdcCuaHs1J5Egqr40S767pVVKC80DagFC8XNW7DZ3Q2ftEiQdGpSYBkxVJs7Bdx6qQYygYWxv_k8sRvU8yXF7ENG0-68SRoI&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=26): “The mere fact that both Democratic and Republican party establishments are largely opposed to the concept of ranked-choice voting (RCV) isn’t surprising, nor is it a persuasive reason to vote against Nevada’s Question 3.”

## Arizona

[**Arizona Supreme Court could still rob you of your vote to change elections**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=hq_hYiWvLBVvFKku4s9Odimf9wYd2Q_mlCk7wQA3uuzsofU0lTqe6SryhKFsqQYzx9Gg9JCg2Hu9ktZu-vdQebIpINrTSrjBSHNw_4GzQD952Y-BiRSeFwzabynaf9NVRyEwy9ovS4yclEm3phKGPyTnfkmQjZK7ytIJE4218I36f0oGQd0TncRbEWkHpMv2&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=27): “A lower court judge has ruled against a challenge to the Make Elections Fair Act, which is already on the ballot. It's now up to the Supreme Court.”

## Alaska

[**Alaska’s presidential election allows voters to rank up to eight candidates**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=2ozFAUub9r8kQf5HiG-wmmVrHPz05fgo8PiByjUPgzpKH_jN1Rsb6ZiyHrQC6o19yHHr07sA4mcWDQGyJnPk_jqwHVF51bblhwy56NC4nd2R09_EzT96DSALhza1dvUqLKjpfwo5fjZyZS4gPfWvrw&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=28): “Alaska’s first ranked choice presidential election will include eight candidates, according to the final roster approved by the Alaska Division of Elections. Because Alaska’s top-four primary election doesn’t apply to the presidential race, voters will be able to rank all eight options if they choose to do so.”

[**Native Leaders Organize to Defend Alaska’s Ranked Choice Voting System**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=PfmK0Ak-Cd-smG1ym4dh0DQxAOGR1mrDZUs-wmk-qAWZduZw2wvcDH4m-FZ0089LL4gVIKz2m29Vv77anR-iigFZLW-XylQ71oNz6jpi9GE&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=29): “As Alaskans consider this fall whether to repeal their new ranked-choice voting election system, leaders of the state’s Native tribes have emerged as key defenders of the system. They’re working to mobilize Alaska Natives, who make up roughly 20 percent of the state’s population, against repeal.”

[**Ranked choice voting and open primaries diminish political party control. That’s great for Alaska**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=U3nWnuBJymfn0ZDbWm8AGoMbUFBBwFkm94Bix2jZNvt0A8XnnQHnQ5qfoB2reorcQHBH1-tjFK3S8lZeGys5OuvpYc_d6-26tRuzNrnStvSyb2xU7r36tZagwNRNOXXafKJTaaFaDBntzyZyVc8pa7d_Fjo0S1i6HwbzbX1SHW13oob2Frefh9xP2AhQAkKCqLZON7xDLE0-4ItbGmahaA&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=30): “The fact that both private political organizations are opposed to open primaries and RCV should be a red flag for us all. Using predictable plays from their worn-out playbook, they use fear to shape emotions toward a more party-favorable outcome. Resist this fear. Be encouraged that, for the first time in many decades, we the voters have options beyond what is spoon-fed to us from the two parties.”

## Idaho

[**What would ranked choice voting look like in Idaho? This Boise election offers glimpse**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=NPKZdw_sa2Jkcotws2PLYMBhIbdTOfzVY8AIsjnh_ihKgLzGHZhv52eS2g_v-3zLmLu9o2ncN2a7z67xfuKuC1aMP5vEUeh8i3o0iBJOM857qfwbVFrlYbQBNJ2hxQ4c&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=31): “It is perhaps more instructive to look at ranked choice voting through the lens of a runoff election. And we have a recent example of how it would look: the 2019 Boise mayoral election.”

## In the News

[**There’s a fair way to ensure third-party candidates don’t ‘spoil’ the US election**](https://rankthevote.nationbuilder.com/r?u=B3b3Ypc8LQLn8fxtqK1VMuXk1N_DFkjhrfMuE16QIy8IdUP67ZDtR7LlkjA-53UGJBJByPIgnWyMygIOKc81dh2mobwBoNu3OrmSANLXVIDjksuYGrIdmSOvrOeNGuxrniVtE8c0sV5WD5dbIgICvA&e=30f1b854f1891565448f49d4f838985f&utm_source=rankthevote&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=october_newsletter_v1&n=32): “We need a modern fix that recognizes that third parties are here to stay, but also that a nation with a guiding principle of majority rule deserves winners who earn more than 50% of their fellow Americans’ votes. The best solution to the urgent ‘spoiler’ problem – which we’ve been exhaustingly debating since Ross Perot’s run in 1992 – is ranked-choice voting (RCV).”

Minor swearing, couple Home Depot trips, the usual DIY chaos.

Some time later, I realized one of the connections had a minor leak. Not a big deal, tightened it up and went on with life. Then it leaked again this week, and I didn't have time to futz with it, so I stuck a bucket under it until we could look closer this weekend.

Early today, I ran the dishwasher (before making my coffee...) And heard a awful LOT of water noise instead of smaller dripping. So I thought I should probably check on the bucket to make sure it hadn't gotten full. Which was a good call, the connection was getting looser and the bucket was about half full.

Since I didn't know how much more water the dishwasher would put out, I figured I should quickly empty the bucket in between drain cycles so it didn't fill up and overflow.

Where, friends, did your under-caffeinated heroine empty said bucket? Surely the bathtub, or toilet, or even outside - literally anywhere that wasn't the very leaky sink that was filling the bucket in the first place??

Of course, if I'd been that smart, you wouldn't be reading this story...

Nope, I grabbed the bucket, quickly stood up and emptied the whole dang thing at once right into the leaky sink. Which...leaked. A lot.

So now my weekend is plumbing AND washing half the towels in the house. 0/10 stars, do not recommend.

I usually go to the Lake District (being on my doorstep) but this time I fancied a change so I got a train to Bentham and headed out to the hills. I basically did the Yorkshire 3 Peaks with some extended bits and I did Wetherlam twice over the 2 days, also had to slog back to Bentham for the train. Actually knackered myself, my left knee got really sore and I twisted my right ankle a couple of times. I camped upon a well known summit (who shall remain nameless), I was expecting cold so I brought my Rab Neutrino bag not my quilt and I brought the XLite pad not the uberlite, base weight was 5kg and it was 6.5kg with food and a bit of water. Summer is defo over folks it was down to about 1C, hands got cold and the wind was fierce, it flushed my tent fly with humidity in the night. I shoulda pitched it right flush with the ground, a bit of condensation touched the 2nd wall in the extreme wind turbulence and got in onto my sleeping bag, not enough to make me cold but still, I avoid moisture on my down bag like the plague. I’ve learned my lesson, next time I’ll pitch in full winter mode. My titan ground anchors were put to the test by powerful gusty winds and they passed the test and held so my tent stayed up all night and sleep was decent. I brought a stove for the first time since spring and treated myself to some army ration meals.l a hot chocolate and coffee. I kept opening up to see of there was an aurora but I saw nothing. However in the morning I met someone who said it had been sighted in the night, so frustrating! I wanna see the aurora! Maybe next time. ",29,1728664127.0,wildcampingintheuk,6,1.0,False

1g1ds1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1g1ds1i/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_pawn_shop_something/,I work the Night Shift at a Pawn Shop . Something here is Watching me ..,"Working the night shift at a pawn shop wasn’t exactly my dream job, but the pay’s decent, and with bills piling up, I don’t really have the luxury of quitting.. The shop itself wasn’t anything special, just a cluttered place full of forgotten items . Old radios, tarnished jewelry, dusty tools. Still, something about it always felt a little off after dark. It was probably just my imagination, or the fact that the shop was located in a sketchy part of town. I tried not to think too much about it.

Tonight had been uneventful so far. The usual late-night stragglers had wandered in . Mostly people trying to sell off old electronics, a few desperate folks pawning jewelry for some quick cash. By 2 a.m., the shop was empty , nothing out of the ordinary. I hadn’t gotten much rest before the shift, so I figured watching some YouTube videos might help keep me distracted.

I was struggling to keep my eyes open when, all of a sudden, a man walked in .

The man looked nervous from the moment he stepped through the door. He was tall, with bags under his eyes like he hadn’t slept in days. His clothes were rumpled, and his hands fidgeted as he clutched a small wooden box under one arm. I hadn’t seen him before, and I’d been working here long enough to recognize most of the late-night customers.

I glanced up from the counter.  “Can I help you?” I asked..

He stepped forward, not saying much, just placed the box down carefully. It was a nice piece, I’ll admit , made of old wood, really detailed carvings. Probably one of those things you’d see in an antique store. I half-expected him to give me some long story about where it came from or how valuable it was, like most people did when they wanted to pawn off something that looked remotely fancy.

“I need to get rid of this,” he said, his voice quiet, a little shaky.

I raised an eyebrow, leaning back a bit. “Get rid of it? Not sell it?”

He shook his head quickly. “I don’t care what you give me for it. I just... don’t want it anymore.”

I couldn’t help but chuckle under my breath. “That bad, huh? What, does it play annoying music or something?”

He didn’t laugh. Just stood there, tense. “No. It’s... weird.”

I glanced at the box, not feeling anything off about it. Just wood, carved all fancy. “Weird how?”

The man rubbed the back of his neck, clearly struggling to put his thoughts into words. “I don’t know... strange things have been happening. At first, it was small stuff. I’d put it on a shelf, and the next morning, it would be in a different spot. Thought I was just imagining it, you know? But then, it got worse. I started hearing noises , scratching sounds . And at night, I’d smell this... this awful, metallic stench. I’ve cleaned my place top to bottom, but it’s like the smell is coming from the box.”

His eyes met mine, wide and haunted. “I don’t know what’s in it, and I don’t want to know. I just need it gone.”

People usually came in hoping to score a few extra bucks, especially with something that looked old and possibly valuable. But this guy just wanted it gone. “Okay,” I said slowly, trying to hide my skepticism. “I’ll take it off your hands.”

Before I could reach for the box, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, his grip surprisingly cold. “Don’t open it,” he said sharply. “Whatever you do, don’t open it.”

I raised my eyebrows, more amused than alarmed. “Sure. No problem.”

He let go of my wrist and stepped back, his shoulders relaxing slightly. “Good. I don’t care how much you give me for it. Just keep it.

He took the money I gave him and without another word, he turned and hurried out the door, the bell jingling softly as he disappeared into the night.

I shook my head and looked down at the box, still sitting on the counter. He’d seemed pretty worked up over it, but to me, it just looked like an old trinket box , nothing special.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over in my hands. The carvings were detailed, swirling patterns running along the surface. It had some weight to it, more than I expected for something so small. But other than that, it was just... a box. No scratching, no creepy smells, just wood.

I tucked it into a drawer under the counter, out of sight, and got back to work. There wasn’t much to do this late, just the usual inventory check and making sure the display cases were clean. But even as I tried to focus on the mundane tasks, my mind kept drifting back to that guy and the way he’d looked at the box.

Still, I shrugged it off. People bring all kinds of weird stories in here, hoping their stuff’s got some mystery value. This was probably just another one of those. I wiped down the counter, thinking about how nice it would be to close up and head home.

The hours ticked by, and the shop was as quiet as ever. That’s when I noticed it , a faint, almost metallic smell hanging in the air. I wrinkled my nose, trying to place where it was coming from. Maybe something in the back had gone bad. I checked the shelves, the back room, and even the trash, but everything seemed normal.

Weird.

When my shift finally ended, I was more than ready to leave. Locking up, I stepped out into the cool night air and tried to shake off the unease that had been creeping in all night. The walk home was quiet, the city mostly asleep, and by the time I got back to my apartment, I’d nearly forgotten about the box.

My apartment was small and cluttered, but it was mine. The moment I stepped through the door, I felt the tension in my shoulders ease. Home was safe. Normal.

I put the strange events of the night behind me and fell into bed, exhausted. As I drifted off to sleep, I couldn’t help but wonder what was inside that box and why the man had been so terrified of it.

Back at the shop the next night, I wasn’t expecting anything unusual. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, but the minute I did something felt ...different. As I walked the aisles, it seemed like some of the items had moved. Little things …like the keys hanging on the wall were now slightly askew, and the doll I hated, the one in the far corner, was now facing me, even though I was sure I’d turned it away yesterday. I stared at it for a second, convinced I must have just misremembered. Still, a shiver crawled down my spine.

I told myself it was nothing. But then, while I was restocking the glass case, I heard something...a faint sound, like scratching, coming from the drawer under the counter.

I froze, my hands hovering over the case. It was soft, barely audible, but it was there. Something was moving.

Slowly, I stepped toward the counter, heart pounding in my chest. I pulled open the drawer, and... nothing . The box, sitting just as I’d left it. Nothing unusual. No sign of movement.

I went back to my routine, forcing myself to focus on different things . And every now and then, I’d catch the faintest whisper of sound coming from the direction where the doll was .

By the time I locked up and left, my nerves were shot.

As I made my way home, I kept my head down, the cool night air biting at my skin. I felt on edge, unable to shake the creeping sensation that I was being followed, that something unseen was watching my every move. By the time I reached my apartment, I felt exhausted, both physically and mentally, but the unease from the shop still clung to me.

I locked the door behind me and went straight to bed, hoping that sleep would drown out the creeping dread. But as I lay there in the dark, something felt wrong. My apartment was too quiet, too still. I turned over, closing my eyes, willing myself to sleep.

Then I heard it . The unmistakable sound of the TV turning on in the living room.

I sat up, my heart pounding. The room was still dark, but the faint flicker of light from the TV cast shadows across the hallway. I hadn’t turned it on. I hesitated for a moment, listening to the low static humming from the other room.

Finally, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and crept toward the living room, every step feeling heavier than the last. As I rounded the corner, I saw the TV screen flickering, bathing the room in a pale, ghostly light. Static buzzed across the screen, but as I stood there, staring at it, I noticed something else.

I heard a low groan, like furniture being dragged across the floor , coming from the bedroom .

My blood froze, and I felt paralyzed with fear… I had been there just a moment ago...

I rushed to the bedroom and switched the lights on. There wasn't anybody there, but what I noticed made my skin crawl . The wardrobe had been dragged, leaving deep scratches in the floor, and its doors were slightly ajar, as if someone , or something had just stepped out.

Then, without warning, the static on the TV shifted. The screen flickered and switched to a news channel, the volume creeping up on its own. A woman's voice echoed through the room, but what she was saying froze the blood in my veins.

""... white caucasian male was found dead late last night after an apparent suicide. Police say the man, whose identity has not yet been released, jumped from the roof of a downtown building...""

A photo of the man appeared on the screen…the man from the pawn shop. His gaunt, haunted eyes stared back at me, a face I hadn’t been able to forget since he handed me that box. He was dead. The same man who’d practically begged me to take the box, who had warned me not to open it.

The camera panned to the building where he’d died, the anchor's voice continuing, but I could barely hear her over the sound of my own heartbeat. The room seemed to close in around me, the air thick with dread.

I sank onto the couch, trying to steady my breathing, but the whispers I had heard earlier were growing louder, circling me. I looked around the room, certain I was alone but unable to shake the feeling that something else was there ..

The man’s death, the box, the strange occurrences in the shop and my apartment ..it was all connected.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the news. The man…dead. Thrown himself off a building, just like that. His face on the TV kept flashing in my mind, those haunted eyes that had stared at me across the counter at the pawn shop.

The box was still at the shop. I hadn’t touched it since he left it there, but I could feel its pull. Something inside it wanted out, and the man had known that.

I knew I couldn’t stay in the house any longer , so I got dressed and left the apartment .

I wandered into a nearby café to grab a coffee, desperate to shake off the exhaustion that had been creeping over me after everything that had happened. At some point, I must have dozed off, because I was startled awake by one of the baristas, who told me I'd been out for almost an hour and they were worried something was wrong. Feeling a sudden, uneasy surge of energy, I tried to keep myself distracted for the remainder of the day . Walking aimlessly through the park, hopping from one café to another. But the exhaustion weighed on me, and I found myself nodding off here and there, barely holding on to any sense of sanity, trying to brace myself for the next night shift. I couldn’t stay like this . I knew something had to be done.

That evening, I walked into the pawn shop with dread twisting in my stomach. Everything felt wrong from the moment I stepped inside. The lights flickered in a way they hadn’t before…longer, darker, like something was hiding just beyond their glow. The air felt suffocating, thick and heavy, like a weight pressing down on my chest . Every sound, from the creak of the old floorboards to the hum of the ancient fridge in the back, was amplified, making me jump at the smallest noise.

I moved toward the back of the shop, where the shelves were lined with old toys, clocks, and other knickknacks. That’s when I saw it , the doll. The same one I had hated since the first day I laid eyes on it. It was always there, sitting on the shelf, staring straight ahead with those dead, glassy eyes.

But now, it wasn’t sitting.

It was standing.

At first, I thought I was seeing things, that my mind was playing tricks on me. But it was real. The doll stood there, its vacant eyes now locked on mine, as if it was watching my every move. It didn’t shift. It didn’t move. But something about it was horribly, unnervingly wrong.

I backed away slowly, my eyes never leaving the doll, my breath caught in my throat. It stayed there, unmoving, its eerie gaze fixed on me, as if daring me to make the first move. My heart pounded harder with each step as I edged toward the front of the shop, my body trembling.

Finally, I reached the counter, my back hitting the hard surface. My hands fumbled for the drawer, yanking it open with a sharp pull. My fingers curled around the box inside. I didn’t care about the man’s warnings anymore. I didn’t care what was inside.

All I knew was that I needed to get rid of it.

Without thinking, I stuffed the box into my bag and ran out of the shop, into the night. The air outside was cold, biting at my skin as I rushed down the street. I didn’t stop running until I reached the old river on the edge of town.

The water was dark, reflecting nothing but the night sky. I stood at the bank, panting, my breath forming clouds in the air as I stared at the box in my hands.

I threw the box as hard as I could, watching as it arced through the air and splashed into the river. For a moment, the water rippled, the box bobbing at the surface before it sank, disappearing into the depths.

I stood there, my breath finally slowing. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was gone. I’d done it.

But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye.

A shadow moved at the edge of the water, barely visible in the darkness. I froze, squinting into the night, but I couldn’t see anything. Just shadows. Just the trees swaying in the wind.

I shook my head and walked back to the pawn shop , telling myself it was over.

When I arrived back at the shop, I told myself I’d forget all about it. The box was gone. Everything was normal again. I had to believe that.

But the moment I walked through the door, my stomach dropped.

The drawer was open.

And the box was inside.

Dripping wet.

I stared at it, my heart pounding. How? I had thrown it in the river. I had seen it sink. There was no way it could be back. But there it was, sitting in the drawer like it had never left.

The whispers returned, louder this time, swirling around me like a storm. I felt panic clawing at my throat. There was no escaping it. The box wanted something, and until I figured out how to stop it, it would never leave me alone.

Desperation clung to me like a second skin as I left the shop, clutching the cursed box under my arm. The weight of it felt heavier than before, as though it had soaked up all the fear and dread I had been feeling since the man first left it with me. My mind raced, searching for any solution, any way to rid myself of the box once and for all. The river hadn’t worked. It had returned to me, wet and dripping, as if mocking my attempt.

I needed something else. I needed to destroy it completely.

An old, abandoned warehouse nearby was the only place I could think of . Forgotten and crumbling, with no one around to question why I was setting something on fire in the dead of night.

When I arrived, the warehouse loomed before me like a hulking corpse. Its roof had collapsed long ago, leaving its skeleton exposed to the elements. The place smelled of decay and rot, but it was quiet. Isolated.

I found some old, broken wooden furniture and piled it in the center of the open space. The moonlight trickled in through gaps in the roof, casting long, eerie shadows across the cracked concrete floor. With trembling fingers, I placed the box on top of the makeshift pyre. It sat there, small and innocent-looking, as though it hadn’t caused all this chaos.

But I knew better now.

I fumbled with the matches, striking them over and over until finally, a small flame sparked to life. I set the fire carefully, watching as the flames licked at the dry wood, the heat growing stronger with each passing second. The fire spread quickly, consuming the furniture, and I stepped back, holding my breath as the flames began to crawl toward the box.

For a moment, the box sat untouched, as though the fire refused to touch it. The flames danced around it, flickering and twisting unnaturally, casting grotesque shapes across the warehouse walls. Then, slowly, the edges of the box began to darken and curl.

But just as the fire caught, something changed. The flames shifted, turning an eerie shade of blue, then green…colors no fire should ever burn. The air around me grew thick, almost oppressive, like the weight of the entire warehouse was pressing down on me.

And then came the screams.

They started softly, like distant wails carried on the wind, but quickly grew louder, agonizing high-pitched, inhuman screams that pierced through the crackle of the fire and burrowed into my skull. It was as though whatever had been locked inside that box was now being released, its rage and pain pouring out into the world around me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but the screams only grew louder, more unbearable. They weren’t just coming from the fire; they were inside my head, scratching at the walls of my mind. I fell to my knees, gasping for air, my eyes squeezed shut as the noise drowned everything else out.

Amidst the overwhelming noise, another sound reached my ears.

Footsteps.

I opened my eyes and saw it.

The doll.

It was here, standing at the edge of the firelight, bathed in the unnatural glow of the flames. Its porcelain face, once blank and expressionless, was now twisted into something grotesque, a demonic grin spreading across its delicate features. Its glass eyes, once dull, were alive with malice, reflecting the strange, shifting colors of the fire.

The doll’s small, delicate feet scraped against the floor as it took one slow, deliberate step toward me. And then another.

Its limbs moved stiffly, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings, jerking with each step. But there was something else.

It held a knife in its hand , a small, rusted blade that gleamed in the firelight. The doll’s head tilted, as though it were studying me, savoring the moment. It took another step, faster this time, and then another, its feet tapping against the concrete in a rapid pace..

I stumbled backward, my pulse racing, my breath coming in short, panicked bursts. The screams from the fire were deafening now, swirling around me in a symphony of madness, and yet all I could focus on was the doll, its lifeless eyes locked on mine as it came closer and closer.

My back hit the wall, and the doll lunged.

I screamed, throwing my hands up to block it, but the cold sting of the knife came faster than I could react. The blade pierced through my palm, tearing through flesh and bone, stopping just inches from my eye. Pain exploded through my arm as I tried to push the doll away, but its strength was unnatural, inhuman. Its porcelain face was frozen in that wicked grin, its dead, glassy eyes locked on mine, and no matter how hard I fought, the doll pushed the knife closer to my face.

I gasped, the edge of the rusted blade grazing my cheek, my muscles burning as I fought to keep it from plunging into my eye. Blood dripped down my arm, and I felt my strength slipping. The doll’s grip tightened, relentless, as the blade inched forward. I could see nothing but that knife, feel nothing but the cold steel pressing closer and closer.

With a final, desperate surge of energy, I kicked out at the doll, my foot connecting with its stiff, fragile body. It flew backward, its small frame catching on the edge of the flames.

The fire roared to life, engulfing the doll in a wave of heat and light. For a split second, the doll froze, its grin faltering as the flames spread across its porcelain body. Then, as the fire surged higher, the doll crumbled, its delicate form disintegrating as it fell onto the box.

The flames twisted violently, burning in unnatural colors, swirling like a storm as the doll’s body was reduced to ash, scattering into the night like dust on the wind.

The fire consumed the box, the screams growing louder, more horrifying with each passing second, until they finally peaked in one last, shattering cry. And then, silence.

The fire died down to a smoldering pile of ashes. The air was thick with smoke, the only sound the faint crackling of burning wood. My arm throbbed in pain, blood still dripping from my wound, but the box was gone, destroyed.

I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, the weight of what had just happened sinking in. The box was gone. The damned doll and whispers were gone . It was finally over.

As I drove home in the early morning light, the sun just beginning to creep over the horizon, I felt a strange emptiness settle over me. I had survived. I had destroyed the box. But I would never forget the screams, or the way that doll had moved toward me, knife in hand.

I never knew what was inside the box. And I don’t ever want to know.

The only thing I know for sure is that whatever was inside that box was evil.

And I’ll spend the rest of my life hoping it’s gone [for good](https://youtu.be/CJER_3b22nk?si=FgW7JL3apFsVknZe).",2,1728663858.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

As I made my way home, I kept my head down, the cool night air biting at my skin. I felt on edge, unable to shake the creeping sensation that I was being followed, that something unseen was watching my every move. By the time I reached my apartment, I felt exhausted, both physically and mentally, but the unease from the shop still clung to me.

I locked the door behind me and went straight to bed, hoping that sleep would drown out the creeping dread. But as I lay there in the dark, something felt wrong. My apartment was too quiet, too still. I turned over, closing my eyes, willing myself to sleep.

Then I heard it . The unmistakable sound of the TV turning on in the living room.

I sat up, my heart pounding. The room was still dark, but the faint flicker of light from the TV cast shadows across the hallway. I hadn’t turned it on. I hesitated for a moment, listening to the low static humming from the other room.

Finally, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and crept toward the living room, every step feeling heavier than the last. As I rounded the corner, I saw the TV screen flickering, bathing the room in a pale, ghostly light. Static buzzed across the screen, but as I stood there, staring at it, I noticed something else.

I heard a low groan, like furniture being dragged across the floor , coming from the bedroom .

My blood froze, and I felt paralyzed with fear… I had been there just a moment ago...

I rushed to the bedroom and switched the lights on. There wasn't anybody there, but what I noticed made my skin crawl . The wardrobe had been dragged, leaving deep scratches in the floor, and its doors were slightly ajar, as if someone , or something had just stepped out.

Then, without warning, the static on the TV shifted. The screen flickered and switched to a news channel, the volume creeping up on its own. A woman's voice echoed through the room, but what she was saying froze the blood in my veins.

""... white caucasian male was found dead late last night after an apparent suicide. Police say the man, whose identity has not yet been released, jumped from the roof of a downtown building...""

A photo of the man appeared on the screen…the man from the pawn shop. His gaunt, haunted eyes stared back at me, a face I hadn’t been able to forget since he handed me that box. He was dead. The same man who’d practically begged me to take the box, who had warned me not to open it.

The camera panned to the building where he’d died, the anchor's voice continuing, but I could barely hear her over the sound of my own heartbeat. The room seemed to close in around me, the air thick with dread.

I sank onto the couch, trying to steady my breathing, but the whispers I had heard earlier were growing louder, circling me. I looked around the room, certain I was alone but unable to shake the feeling that something else was there ..

The man’s death, the box, the strange occurrences in the shop and my apartment ..it was all connected.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the news. The man…dead. Thrown himself off a building, just like that. His face on the TV kept flashing in my mind, those haunted eyes that had stared at me across the counter at the pawn shop.

The box was still at the shop. I hadn’t touched it since he left it there, but I could feel its pull. Something inside it wanted out, and the man had known that.

I knew I couldn’t stay in the house any longer , so I got dressed and left the apartment .

I wandered into a nearby café to grab a coffee, desperate to shake off the exhaustion that had been creeping over me after everything that had happened. At some point, I must have dozed off, because I was startled awake by one of the baristas, who told me I'd been out for almost an hour and they were worried something was wrong. Feeling a sudden, uneasy surge of energy, I tried to keep myself distracted for the remainder of the day . Walking aimlessly through the park, hopping from one café to another. But the exhaustion weighed on me, and I found myself nodding off here and there, barely holding on to any sense of sanity, trying to brace myself for the next night shift. I couldn’t stay like this . I knew something had to be done.

That evening, I walked into the pawn shop with dread twisting in my stomach. Everything felt wrong from the moment I stepped inside. The lights flickered in a way they hadn’t before…longer, darker, like something was hiding just beyond their glow. The air felt suffocating, thick and heavy, like a weight pressing down on my chest . Every sound, from the creak of the old floorboards to the hum of the ancient fridge in the back, was amplified, making me jump at the smallest noise.

I moved toward the back of the shop, where the shelves were lined with old toys, clocks, and other knickknacks. That’s when I saw it , the doll. The same one I had hated since the first day I laid eyes on it. It was always there, sitting on the shelf, staring straight ahead with those dead, glassy eyes.

But now, it wasn’t sitting.

It was standing.

At first, I thought I was seeing things, that my mind was playing tricks on me. But it was real. The doll stood there, its vacant eyes now locked on mine, as if it was watching my every move. It didn’t shift. It didn’t move. But something about it was horribly, unnervingly wrong.

I backed away slowly, my eyes never leaving the doll, my breath caught in my throat. It stayed there, unmoving, its eerie gaze fixed on me, as if daring me to make the first move. My heart pounded harder with each step as I edged toward the front of the shop, my body trembling.

Finally, I reached the counter, my back hitting the hard surface. My hands fumbled for the drawer, yanking it open with a sharp pull. My fingers curled around the box inside. I didn’t care about the man’s warnings anymore. I didn’t care what was inside.

All I knew was that I needed to get rid of it.

Without thinking, I stuffed the box into my bag and ran out of the shop, into the night. The air outside was cold, biting at my skin as I rushed down the street. I didn’t stop running until I reached the old river on the edge of town.

The water was dark, reflecting nothing but the night sky. I stood at the bank, panting, my breath forming clouds in the air as I stared at the box in my hands.

I threw the box as hard as I could, watching as it arced through the air and splashed into the river. For a moment, the water rippled, the box bobbing at the surface before it sank, disappearing into the depths.

I stood there, my breath finally slowing. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was gone. I’d done it.

But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye.

A shadow moved at the edge of the water, barely visible in the darkness. I froze, squinting into the night, but I couldn’t see anything. Just shadows. Just the trees swaying in the wind.

I shook my head and walked back to the pawn shop , telling myself it was over.

When I arrived back at the shop, I told myself I’d forget all about it. The box was gone. Everything was normal again. I had to believe that.

But the moment I walked through the door, my stomach dropped.

The drawer was open.

And the box was inside.

Dripping wet.

I stared at it, my heart pounding. How? I had thrown it in the river. I had seen it sink. There was no way it could be back. But there it was, sitting in the drawer like it had never left.

The whispers returned, louder this time, swirling around me like a storm. I felt panic clawing at my throat. There was no escaping it. The box wanted something, and until I figured out how to stop it, it would never leave me alone.

Desperation clung to me like a second skin as I left the shop, clutching the cursed box under my arm. The weight of it felt heavier than before, as though it had soaked up all the fear and dread I had been feeling since the man first left it with me. My mind raced, searching for any solution, any way to rid myself of the box once and for all. The river hadn’t worked. It had returned to me, wet and dripping, as if mocking my attempt.

I needed something else. I needed to destroy it completely.

An old, abandoned warehouse nearby was the only place I could think of . Forgotten and crumbling, with no one around to question why I was setting something on fire in the dead of night.

When I arrived, the warehouse loomed before me like a hulking corpse. Its roof had collapsed long ago, leaving its skeleton exposed to the elements. The place smelled of decay and rot, but it was quiet. Isolated.

I found some old, broken wooden furniture and piled it in the center of the open space. The moonlight trickled in through gaps in the roof, casting long, eerie shadows across the cracked concrete floor. With trembling fingers, I placed the box on top of the makeshift pyre. It sat there, small and innocent-looking, as though it hadn’t caused all this chaos.

But I knew better now.

I fumbled with the matches, striking them over and over until finally, a small flame sparked to life. I set the fire carefully, watching as the flames licked at the dry wood, the heat growing stronger with each passing second. The fire spread quickly, consuming the furniture, and I stepped back, holding my breath as the flames began to crawl toward the box.

For a moment, the box sat untouched, as though the fire refused to touch it. The flames danced around it, flickering and twisting unnaturally, casting grotesque shapes across the warehouse walls. Then, slowly, the edges of the box began to darken and curl.

But just as the fire caught, something changed. The flames shifted, turning an eerie shade of blue, then green…colors no fire should ever burn. The air around me grew thick, almost oppressive, like the weight of the entire warehouse was pressing down on me.

And then came the screams.

They started softly, like distant wails carried on the wind, but quickly grew louder, agonizing high-pitched, inhuman screams that pierced through the crackle of the fire and burrowed into my skull. It was as though whatever had been locked inside that box was now being released, its rage and pain pouring out into the world around me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but the screams only grew louder, more unbearable. They weren’t just coming from the fire; they were inside my head, scratching at the walls of my mind. I fell to my knees, gasping for air, my eyes squeezed shut as the noise drowned everything else out.

Amidst the overwhelming noise, another sound reached my ears.

Footsteps.

I opened my eyes and saw it.

The doll.

It was here, standing at the edge of the firelight, bathed in the unnatural glow of the flames. Its porcelain face, once blank and expressionless, was now twisted into something grotesque, a demonic grin spreading across its delicate features. Its glass eyes, once dull, were alive with malice, reflecting the strange, shifting colors of the fire.

The doll’s small, delicate feet scraped against the floor as it took one slow, deliberate step toward me. And then another.

Its limbs moved stiffly, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings, jerking with each step. But there was something else.

It held a knife in its hand , a small, rusted blade that gleamed in the firelight. The doll’s head tilted, as though it were studying me, savoring the moment. It took another step, faster this time, and then another, its feet tapping against the concrete in a rapid pace..

I stumbled backward, my pulse racing, my breath coming in short, panicked bursts. The screams from the fire were deafening now, swirling around me in a symphony of madness, and yet all I could focus on was the doll, its lifeless eyes locked on mine as it came closer and closer.

My back hit the wall, and the doll lunged.

I screamed, throwing my hands up to block it, but the cold sting of the knife came faster than I could react. The blade pierced through my palm, tearing through flesh and bone, stopping just inches from my eye. Pain exploded through my arm as I tried to push the doll away, but its strength was unnatural, inhuman. Its porcelain face was frozen in that wicked grin, its dead, glassy eyes locked on mine, and no matter how hard I fought, the doll pushed the knife closer to my face.

I gasped, the edge of the rusted blade grazing my cheek, my muscles burning as I fought to keep it from plunging into my eye. Blood dripped down my arm, and I felt my strength slipping. The doll’s grip tightened, relentless, as the blade inched forward. I could see nothing but that knife, feel nothing but the cold steel pressing closer and closer.

With a final, desperate surge of energy, I kicked out at the doll, my foot connecting with its stiff, fragile body. It flew backward, its small frame catching on the edge of the flames.

The fire roared to life, engulfing the doll in a wave of heat and light. For a split second, the doll froze, its grin faltering as the flames spread across its porcelain body. Then, as the fire surged higher, the doll crumbled, its delicate form disintegrating as it fell onto the box.

The flames twisted violently, burning in unnatural colors, swirling like a storm as the doll’s body was reduced to ash, scattering into the night like dust on the wind.

The fire consumed the box, the screams growing louder, more horrifying with each passing second, until they finally peaked in one last, shattering cry. And then, silence.

The fire died down to a smoldering pile of ashes. The air was thick with smoke, the only sound the faint crackling of burning wood. My arm throbbed in pain, blood still dripping from my wound, but the box was gone, destroyed.

I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, the weight of what had just happened sinking in. The box was gone. The damned doll and whispers were gone . It was finally over.

As I drove home in the early morning light, the sun just beginning to creep over the horizon, I felt a strange emptiness settle over me. I had survived. I had destroyed the box. But I would never forget the screams, or the way that doll had moved toward me, knife in hand.

I never knew what was inside the box. And I don’t ever want to know.

The only thing I know for sure is that whatever was inside that box was evil.

And I’ll spend the rest of my life hoping it’s gone [for good](https://youtu.be/CJER_3b22nk?si=FgW7JL3apFsVknZe).",2,1728663828.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Something here is Watching me ..,"Working the night shift at a pawn shop wasn’t exactly my dream job, but the pay’s decent, and with bills piling up, I don’t really have the luxury of quitting.. The shop itself wasn’t anything special, just a cluttered place full of forgotten items . Old radios, tarnished jewelry, dusty tools. Still, something about it always felt a little off after dark. It was probably just my imagination, or the fact that the shop was located in a sketchy part of town. I tried not to think too much about it.

Tonight had been uneventful so far. The usual late-night stragglers had wandered in . Mostly people trying to sell off old electronics, a few desperate folks pawning jewelry for some quick cash. By 2 a.m., the shop was empty , nothing out of the ordinary. I hadn’t gotten much rest before the shift, so I figured watching some YouTube videos might help keep me distracted.

I was struggling to keep my eyes open when, all of a sudden, a man walked in .

The man looked nervous from the moment he stepped through the door. He was tall, with bags under his eyes like he hadn’t slept in days. His clothes were rumpled, and his hands fidgeted as he clutched a small wooden box under one arm. I hadn’t seen him before, and I’d been working here long enough to recognize most of the late-night customers.

I glanced up from the counter.  “Can I help you?” I asked..

He stepped forward, not saying much, just placed the box down carefully. It was a nice piece, I’ll admit , made of old wood, really detailed carvings. Probably one of those things you’d see in an antique store. I half-expected him to give me some long story about where it came from or how valuable it was, like most people did when they wanted to pawn off something that looked remotely fancy.

“I need to get rid of this,” he said, his voice quiet, a little shaky.

I raised an eyebrow, leaning back a bit. “Get rid of it? Not sell it?”

He shook his head quickly. “I don’t care what you give me for it. I just... don’t want it anymore.”

I couldn’t help but chuckle under my breath. “That bad, huh? What, does it play annoying music or something?”

He didn’t laugh. Just stood there, tense. “No. It’s... weird.”

I glanced at the box, not feeling anything off about it. Just wood, carved all fancy. “Weird how?”

The man rubbed the back of his neck, clearly struggling to put his thoughts into words. “I don’t know... strange things have been happening. At first, it was small stuff. I’d put it on a shelf, and the next morning, it would be in a different spot. Thought I was just imagining it, you know? But then, it got worse. I started hearing noises , scratching sounds . And at night, I’d smell this... this awful, metallic stench. I’ve cleaned my place top to bottom, but it’s like the smell is coming from the box.”

His eyes met mine, wide and haunted. “I don’t know what’s in it, and I don’t want to know. I just need it gone.”

People usually came in hoping to score a few extra bucks, especially with something that looked old and possibly valuable. But this guy just wanted it gone. “Okay,” I said slowly, trying to hide my skepticism. “I’ll take it off your hands.”

Before I could reach for the box, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, his grip surprisingly cold. “Don’t open it,” he said sharply. “Whatever you do, don’t open it.”

I raised my eyebrows, more amused than alarmed. “Sure. No problem.”

He let go of my wrist and stepped back, his shoulders relaxing slightly. “Good. I don’t care how much you give me for it. Just keep it.

He took the money I gave him and without another word, he turned and hurried out the door, the bell jingling softly as he disappeared into the night.

I shook my head and looked down at the box, still sitting on the counter. He’d seemed pretty worked up over it, but to me, it just looked like an old trinket box , nothing special.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over in my hands. The carvings were detailed, swirling patterns running along the surface. It had some weight to it, more than I expected for something so small. But other than that, it was just... a box. No scratching, no creepy smells, just wood.

I tucked it into a drawer under the counter, out of sight, and got back to work. There wasn’t much to do this late, just the usual inventory check and making sure the display cases were clean. But even as I tried to focus on the mundane tasks, my mind kept drifting back to that guy and the way he’d looked at the box.

Still, I shrugged it off. People bring all kinds of weird stories in here, hoping their stuff’s got some mystery value. This was probably just another one of those. I wiped down the counter, thinking about how nice it would be to close up and head home.

The hours ticked by, and the shop was as quiet as ever. That’s when I noticed it , a faint, almost metallic smell hanging in the air. I wrinkled my nose, trying to place where it was coming from. Maybe something in the back had gone bad. I checked the shelves, the back room, and even the trash, but everything seemed normal.

Weird.

When my shift finally ended, I was more than ready to leave. Locking up, I stepped out into the cool night air and tried to shake off the unease that had been creeping in all night. The walk home was quiet, the city mostly asleep, and by the time I got back to my apartment, I’d nearly forgotten about the box.

My apartment was small and cluttered, but it was mine. The moment I stepped through the door, I felt the tension in my shoulders ease. Home was safe. Normal.

I put the strange events of the night behind me and fell into bed, exhausted. As I drifted off to sleep, I couldn’t help but wonder what was inside that box and why the man had been so terrified of it.

Back at the shop the next night, I wasn’t expecting anything unusual. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, but the minute I did something felt ...different. As I walked the aisles, it seemed like some of the items had moved. Little things …like the keys hanging on the wall were now slightly askew, and the doll I hated, the one in the far corner, was now facing me, even though I was sure I’d turned it away yesterday. I stared at it for a second, convinced I must have just misremembered. Still, a shiver crawled down my spine.

I told myself it was nothing. But then, while I was restocking the glass case, I heard something...a faint sound, like scratching, coming from the drawer under the counter.

I froze, my hands hovering over the case. It was soft, barely audible, but it was there. Something was moving.

Slowly, I stepped toward the counter, heart pounding in my chest. I pulled open the drawer, and... nothing . The box, sitting just as I’d left it. Nothing unusual. No sign of movement.

I went back to my routine, forcing myself to focus on different things . And every now and then, I’d catch the faintest whisper of sound coming from the direction where the doll was .

By the time I locked up and left, my nerves were shot.

As I made my way home, I kept my head down, the cool night air biting at my skin.

I screamed, throwing my hands up to block it, but the cold sting of the knife came faster than I could react. The blade pierced through my palm, tearing through flesh and bone, stopping just inches from my eye. Pain exploded through my arm as I tried to push the doll away, but its strength was unnatural, inhuman. Its porcelain face was frozen in that wicked grin, its dead, glassy eyes locked on mine, and no matter how hard I fought, the doll pushed the knife closer to my face.

I gasped, the edge of the rusted blade grazing my cheek, my muscles burning as I fought to keep it from plunging into my eye. Blood dripped down my arm, and I felt my strength slipping. The doll’s grip tightened, relentless, as the blade inched forward. I could see nothing but that knife, feel nothing but the cold steel pressing closer and closer.

With a final, desperate surge of energy, I kicked out at the doll, my foot connecting with its stiff, fragile body. It flew backward, its small frame catching on the edge of the flames.

The fire roared to life, engulfing the doll in a wave of heat and light. For a split second, the doll froze, its grin faltering as the flames spread across its porcelain body. Then, as the fire surged higher, the doll crumbled, its delicate form disintegrating as it fell onto the box.

The flames twisted violently, burning in unnatural colors, swirling like a storm as the doll’s body was reduced to ash, scattering into the night like dust on the wind.

The fire consumed the box, the screams growing louder, more horrifying with each passing second, until they finally peaked in one last, shattering cry. And then, silence.

The fire died down to a smoldering pile of ashes. The air was thick with smoke, the only sound the faint crackling of burning wood. My arm throbbed in pain, blood still dripping from my wound, but the box was gone, destroyed.

I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, the weight of what had just happened sinking in. The box was gone. The damned doll and whispers were gone . It was finally over.

As I drove home in the early morning light, the sun just beginning to creep over the horizon, I felt a strange emptiness settle over me. I had survived. I had destroyed the box. But I would never forget the screams, or the way that doll had moved toward me, knife in hand.

I never knew what was inside the box. And I don’t ever want to know.

The only thing I know for sure is that whatever was inside that box was evil.

And I’ll spend the rest of my life hoping it’s gone [for good](https://youtu.be/CJER_3b22nk?si=FgW7JL3apFsVknZe).",5,1728663778.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Something here is Watching me ..,"Working the night shift at a pawn shop wasn’t exactly my dream job, but the pay’s decent, and with bills piling up, I don’t really have the luxury of quitting.. The shop itself wasn’t anything special, just a cluttered place full of forgotten items . Old radios, tarnished jewelry, dusty tools. Still, something about it always felt a little off after dark. It was probably just my imagination, or the fact that the shop was located in a sketchy part of town. I tried not to think too much about it.

Tonight had been uneventful so far. The usual late-night stragglers had wandered in . Mostly people trying to sell off old electronics, a few desperate folks pawning jewelry for some quick cash. By 2 a.m., the shop was empty , nothing out of the ordinary. I hadn’t gotten much rest before the shift, so I figured watching some YouTube videos might help keep me distracted.

I was struggling to keep my eyes open when, all of a sudden, a man walked in .

The man looked nervous from the moment he stepped through the door. He was tall, with bags under his eyes like he hadn’t slept in days. His clothes were rumpled, and his hands fidgeted as he clutched a small wooden box under one arm. I hadn’t seen him before, and I’d been working here long enough to recognize most of the late-night customers.

I glanced up from the counter.  “Can I help you?” I asked..

He stepped forward, not saying much, just placed the box down carefully. It was a nice piece, I’ll admit , made of old wood, really detailed carvings. Probably one of those things you’d see in an antique store. I half-expected him to give me some long story about where it came from or how valuable it was, like most people did when they wanted to pawn off something that looked remotely fancy.

“I need to get rid of this,” he said, his voice quiet, a little shaky.

I raised an eyebrow, leaning back a bit. “Get rid of it? Not sell it?”

He shook his head quickly. “I don’t care what you give me for it. I just... don’t want it anymore.”

I couldn’t help but chuckle under my breath. “That bad, huh? What, does it play annoying music or something?”

He didn’t laugh. Just stood there, tense. “No. It’s... weird.”

I glanced at the box, not feeling anything off about it. Just wood, carved all fancy. “Weird how?”

The man rubbed the back of his neck, clearly struggling to put his thoughts into words. “I don’t know... strange things have been happening. At first, it was small stuff. I’d put it on a shelf, and the next morning, it would be in a different spot. Thought I was just imagining it, you know? But then, it got worse. I started hearing noises , scratching sounds . And at night, I’d smell this... this awful, metallic stench. I’ve cleaned my place top to bottom, but it’s like the smell is coming from the box.”

His eyes met mine, wide and haunted. “I don’t know what’s in it, and I don’t want to know. I just need it gone.”

People usually came in hoping to score a few extra bucks, especially with something that looked old and possibly valuable. But this guy just wanted it gone. “Okay,” I said slowly, trying to hide my skepticism. “I’ll take it off your hands.”

Before I could reach for the box, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, his grip surprisingly cold. “Don’t open it,” he said sharply. “Whatever you do, don’t open it.”

I raised my eyebrows, more amused than alarmed. “Sure. No problem.”

He let go of my wrist and stepped back, his shoulders relaxing slightly. “Good. I don’t care how much you give me for it. Just keep it.

He took the money I gave him and without another word, he turned and hurried out the door, the bell jingling softly as he disappeared into the night.

I shook my head and looked down at the box, still sitting on the counter. He’d seemed pretty worked up over it, but to me, it just looked like an old trinket box , nothing special.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over in my hands. The carvings were detailed, swirling patterns running along the surface. It had some weight to it, more than I expected for something so small. But other than that, it was just... a box. No scratching, no creepy smells, just wood.

I tucked it into a drawer under the counter, out of sight, and got back to work. There wasn’t much to do this late, just the usual inventory check and making sure the display cases were clean. But even as I tried to focus on the mundane tasks, my mind kept drifting back to that guy and the way he’d looked at the box.

Still, I shrugged it off. People bring all kinds of weird stories in here, hoping their stuff’s got some mystery value. This was probably just another one of those. I wiped down the counter, thinking about how nice it would be to close up and head home.

The hours ticked by, and the shop was as quiet as ever. That’s when I noticed it , a faint, almost metallic smell hanging in the air. I wrinkled my nose, trying to place where it was coming from. Maybe something in the back had gone bad. I checked the shelves, the back room, and even the trash, but everything seemed normal.

Weird.

When my shift finally ended, I was more than ready to leave. Locking up, I stepped out into the cool night air and tried to shake off the unease that had been creeping in all night. The walk home was quiet, the city mostly asleep, and by the time I got back to my apartment, I’d nearly forgotten about the box.

My apartment was small and cluttered, but it was mine. The moment I stepped through the door, I felt the tension in my shoulders ease. Home was safe. Normal.

I put the strange events of the night behind me and fell into bed, exhausted. As I drifted off to sleep, I couldn’t help but wonder what was inside that box and why the man had been so terrified of it.

Back at the shop the next night, I wasn’t expecting anything unusual. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, but the minute I did something felt ...different. As I walked the aisles, it seemed like some of the items had moved. Little things …like the keys hanging on the wall were now slightly askew, and the doll I hated, the one in the far corner, was now facing me, even though I was sure I’d turned it away yesterday. I stared at it for a second, convinced I must have just misremembered. Still, a shiver crawled down my spine.

I told myself it was nothing. But then, while I was restocking the glass case, I heard something...a faint sound, like scratching, coming from the drawer under the counter.

I froze, my hands hovering over the case. It was soft, barely audible, but it was there. Something was moving.

Slowly, I stepped toward the counter, heart pounding in my chest. I pulled open the drawer, and... nothing . The box, sitting just as I’d left it. Nothing unusual. No sign of movement.

I went back to my routine, forcing myself to focus on different things . And every now and then, I’d catch the faintest whisper of sound coming from the direction where the doll was .

By the time I locked up and left, my nerves were shot.

As I made my way home, I kept my head down, the cool night air biting at my skin. I felt on edge, unable to shake the creeping sensation that I was being followed, that something unseen was watching my every move. By the time I reached my apartment, I felt exhausted, both physically and mentally, but the unease from the shop still clung to me.

I locked the door behind me and went straight to bed, hoping that sleep would drown out the creeping dread. But as I lay there in the dark, something felt wrong. My apartment was too quiet, too still. I turned over, closing my eyes, willing myself to sleep.

Then I heard it . The unmistakable sound of the TV turning on in the living room.

I sat up, my heart pounding. The room was still dark, but the faint flicker of light from the TV cast shadows across the hallway. I hadn’t turned it on. I hesitated for a moment, listening to the low static humming from the other room.

Finally, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and crept toward the living room, every step feeling heavier than the last. As I rounded the corner, I saw the TV screen flickering, bathing the room in a pale, ghostly light. Static buzzed across the screen, but as I stood there, staring at it, I noticed something else.

I heard a low groan, like furniture being dragged across the floor , coming from the bedroom .

My blood froze, and I felt paralyzed with fear… I had been there just a moment ago...

I rushed to the bedroom and switched the lights on. There wasn't anybody there, but what I noticed made my skin crawl . The wardrobe had been dragged, leaving deep scratches in the floor, and its doors were slightly ajar, as if someone , or something had just stepped out.

Then, without warning, the static on the TV shifted. The screen flickered and switched to a news channel, the volume creeping up on its own. A woman's voice echoed through the room, but what she was saying froze the blood in my veins.

""... white caucasian male was found dead late last night after an apparent suicide. Police say the man, whose identity has not yet been released, jumped from the roof of a downtown building...""

A photo of the man appeared on the screen…the man from the pawn shop. His gaunt, haunted eyes stared back at me, a face I hadn’t been able to forget since he handed me that box. He was dead. The same man who’d practically begged me to take the box, who had warned me not to open it.

The camera panned to the building where he’d died, the anchor's voice continuing, but I could barely hear her over the sound of my own heartbeat. The room seemed to close in around me, the air thick with dread.

I sank onto the couch, trying to steady my breathing, but the whispers I had heard earlier were growing louder, circling me. I looked around the room, certain I was alone but unable to shake the feeling that something else was there ..

The man’s death, the box, the strange occurrences in the shop and my apartment ..it was all connected.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the news. The man…dead. Thrown himself off a building, just like that. His face on the TV kept flashing in my mind, those haunted eyes that had stared at me across the counter at the pawn shop.

The box was still at the shop. I hadn’t touched it since he left it there, but I could feel its pull. Something inside it wanted out, and the man had known that.

I knew I couldn’t stay in the house any longer , so I got dressed and left the apartment .

I wandered into a nearby café to grab a coffee, desperate to shake off the exhaustion that had been creeping over me after everything that had happened. At some point, I must have dozed off, because I was startled awake by one of the baristas, who told me I'd been out for almost an hour and they were worried something was wrong. Feeling a sudden, uneasy surge of energy, I tried to keep myself distracted for the remainder of the day . Walking aimlessly through the park, hopping from one café to another. But the exhaustion weighed on me, and I found myself nodding off here and there, barely holding on to any sense of sanity, trying to brace myself for the next night shift. I couldn’t stay like this . I knew something had to be done.

That evening, I walked into the pawn shop with dread twisting in my stomach. Everything felt wrong from the moment I stepped inside. The lights flickered in a way they hadn’t before…longer, darker, like something was hiding just beyond their glow. The air felt suffocating, thick and heavy, like a weight pressing down on my chest . Every sound, from the creak of the old floorboards to the hum of the ancient fridge in the back, was amplified, making me jump at the smallest noise.

I moved toward the back of the shop, where the shelves were lined with old toys, clocks, and other knickknacks. That’s when I saw it , the doll. The same one I had hated since the first day I laid eyes on it. It was always there, sitting on the shelf, staring straight ahead with those dead, glassy eyes.

But now, it wasn’t sitting.

It was standing.

At first, I thought I was seeing things, that my mind was playing tricks on me. But it was real. The doll stood there, its vacant eyes now locked on mine, as if it was watching my every move. It didn’t shift. It didn’t move. But something about it was horribly, unnervingly wrong.

I backed away slowly, my eyes never leaving the doll, my breath caught in my throat. It stayed there, unmoving, its eerie gaze fixed on me, as if daring me to make the first move. My heart pounded harder with each step as I edged toward the front of the shop, my body trembling.

Finally, I reached the counter, my back hitting the hard surface. My hands fumbled for the drawer, yanking it open with a sharp pull. My fingers curled around the box inside. I didn’t care about the man’s warnings anymore. I didn’t care what was inside.

All I knew was that I needed to get rid of it.

Without thinking, I stuffed the box into my bag and ran out of the shop, into the night. The air outside was cold, biting at my skin as I rushed down the street. I didn’t stop running until I reached the old river on the edge of town.

The water was dark, reflecting nothing but the night sky. I stood at the bank, panting, my breath forming clouds in the air as I stared at the box in my hands.

I threw the box as hard as I could, watching as it arced through the air and splashed into the river. For a moment, the water rippled, the box bobbing at the surface before it sank, disappearing into the depths.

I stood there, my breath finally slowing. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was gone. I’d done it.

But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye.

A shadow moved at the edge of the water, barely visible in the darkness. I froze, squinting into the night, but I couldn’t see anything. Just shadows. Just the trees swaying in the wind.

I shook my head and walked back to the pawn shop , telling myself it was over.

When I arrived back at the shop, I told myself I’d forget all about it. The box was gone. Everything was normal again. I had to believe that.

But the moment I walked through the door, my stomach dropped.

The drawer was open.

And the box was inside.

Dripping wet.

I stared at it, my heart pounding. How? I had thrown it in the river. I had seen it sink. There was no way it could be back. But there it was, sitting in the drawer like it had never left.

The whispers returned, louder this time, swirling around me like a storm. I felt panic clawing at my throat. There was no escaping it. The box wanted something, and until I figured out how to stop it, it would never leave me alone.

Desperation clung to me like a second skin as I left the shop, clutching the cursed box under my arm. The weight of it felt heavier than before, as though it had soaked up all the fear and dread I had been feeling since the man first left it with me. My mind raced, searching for any solution, any way to rid myself of the box once and for all. The river hadn’t worked. It had returned to me, wet and dripping, as if mocking my attempt.

I needed something else. I needed to destroy it completely.

An old, abandoned warehouse nearby was the only place I could think of . Forgotten and crumbling, with no one around to question why I was setting something on fire in the dead of night.

When I arrived, the warehouse loomed before me like a hulking corpse. Its roof had collapsed long ago, leaving its skeleton exposed to the elements. The place smelled of decay and rot, but it was quiet. Isolated.

I found some old, broken wooden furniture and piled it in the center of the open space. The moonlight trickled in through gaps in the roof, casting long, eerie shadows across the cracked concrete floor. With trembling fingers, I placed the box on top of the makeshift pyre. It sat there, small and innocent-looking, as though it hadn’t caused all this chaos.

But I knew better now.

I fumbled with the matches, striking them over and over until finally, a small flame sparked to life. I set the fire carefully, watching as the flames licked at the dry wood, the heat growing stronger with each passing second. The fire spread quickly, consuming the furniture, and I stepped back, holding my breath as the flames began to crawl toward the box.

For a moment, the box sat untouched, as though the fire refused to touch it. The flames danced around it, flickering and twisting unnaturally, casting grotesque shapes across the warehouse walls. Then, slowly, the edges of the box began to darken and curl.

But just as the fire caught, something changed. The flames shifted, turning an eerie shade of blue, then green…colors no fire should ever burn. The air around me grew thick, almost oppressive, like the weight of the entire warehouse was pressing down on me.

And then came the screams.

They started softly, like distant wails carried on the wind, but quickly grew louder, agonizing high-pitched, inhuman screams that pierced through the crackle of the fire and burrowed into my skull. It was as though whatever had been locked inside that box was now being released, its rage and pain pouring out into the world around me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but the screams only grew louder, more unbearable. They weren’t just coming from the fire; they were inside my head, scratching at the walls of my mind. I fell to my knees, gasping for air, my eyes squeezed shut as the noise drowned everything else out.

Amidst the overwhelming noise, another sound reached my ears.

Footsteps.

I opened my eyes and saw it.

The doll.

It was here, standing at the edge of the firelight, bathed in the unnatural glow of the flames. Its porcelain face, once blank and expressionless, was now twisted into something grotesque, a demonic grin spreading across its delicate features. Its glass eyes, once dull, were alive with malice, reflecting the strange, shifting colors of the fire.

The doll’s small, delicate feet scraped against the floor as it took one slow, deliberate step toward me. And then another.

Its limbs moved stiffly, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings, jerking with each step. But there was something else.

It held a knife in its hand , a small, rusted blade that gleamed in the firelight. The doll’s head tilted, as though it were studying me, savoring the moment. It took another step, faster this time, and then another, its feet tapping against the concrete in a rapid pace..

I stumbled backward, my pulse racing, my breath coming in short, panicked bursts. The screams from the fire were deafening now, swirling around me in a symphony of madness, and yet all I could focus on was the doll, its lifeless eyes locked on mine as it came closer and closer.

My back hit the wall, and the doll lunged.

I screamed, throwing my hands up to block it, but the cold sting of the knife came faster than I could react.

Then, without warning, the static on the TV shifted. The screen flickered and switched to a news channel, the volume creeping up on its own. A woman's voice echoed through the room, but what she was saying froze the blood in my veins.

""... white caucasian male was found dead late last night after an apparent suicide. Police say the man, whose identity has not yet been released, jumped from the roof of a downtown building...""

A photo of the man appeared on the screen…the man from the pawn shop. His gaunt, haunted eyes stared back at me, a face I hadn’t been able to forget since he handed me that box. He was dead. The same man who’d practically begged me to take the box, who had warned me not to open it.

The camera panned to the building where he’d died, the anchor's voice continuing, but I could barely hear her over the sound of my own heartbeat. The room seemed to close in around me, the air thick with dread.

I sank onto the couch, trying to steady my breathing, but the whispers I had heard earlier were growing louder, circling me. I looked around the room, certain I was alone but unable to shake the feeling that something else was there ..

The man’s death, the box, the strange occurrences in the shop and my apartment ..it was all connected.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the news. The man…dead. Thrown himself off a building, just like that. His face on the TV kept flashing in my mind, those haunted eyes that had stared at me across the counter at the pawn shop.

The box was still at the shop. I hadn’t touched it since he left it there, but I could feel its pull. Something inside it wanted out, and the man had known that.

I knew I couldn’t stay in the house any longer , so I got dressed and left the apartment .

I wandered into a nearby café to grab a coffee, desperate to shake off the exhaustion that had been creeping over me after everything that had happened. At some point, I must have dozed off, because I was startled awake by one of the baristas, who told me I'd been out for almost an hour and they were worried something was wrong. Feeling a sudden, uneasy surge of energy, I tried to keep myself distracted for the remainder of the day . Walking aimlessly through the park, hopping from one café to another. But the exhaustion weighed on me, and I found myself nodding off here and there, barely holding on to any sense of sanity, trying to brace myself for the next night shift. I couldn’t stay like this . I knew something had to be done.

That evening, I walked into the pawn shop with dread twisting in my stomach. Everything felt wrong from the moment I stepped inside. The lights flickered in a way they hadn’t before…longer, darker, like something was hiding just beyond their glow. The air felt suffocating, thick and heavy, like a weight pressing down on my chest . Every sound, from the creak of the old floorboards to the hum of the ancient fridge in the back, was amplified, making me jump at the smallest noise.

I moved toward the back of the shop, where the shelves were lined with old toys, clocks, and other knickknacks. That’s when I saw it , the doll. The same one I had hated since the first day I laid eyes on it. It was always there, sitting on the shelf, staring straight ahead with those dead, glassy eyes.

But now, it wasn’t sitting.

It was standing.

At first, I thought I was seeing things, that my mind was playing tricks on me. But it was real. The doll stood there, its vacant eyes now locked on mine, as if it was watching my every move. It didn’t shift. It didn’t move. But something about it was horribly, unnervingly wrong.

I backed away slowly, my eyes never leaving the doll, my breath caught in my throat. It stayed there, unmoving, its eerie gaze fixed on me, as if daring me to make the first move. My heart pounded harder with each step as I edged toward the front of the shop, my body trembling.

Finally, I reached the counter, my back hitting the hard surface. My hands fumbled for the drawer, yanking it open with a sharp pull. My fingers curled around the box inside. I didn’t care about the man’s warnings anymore. I didn’t care what was inside.

All I knew was that I needed to get rid of it.

Without thinking, I stuffed the box into my bag and ran out of the shop, into the night. The air outside was cold, biting at my skin as I rushed down the street. I didn’t stop running until I reached the old river on the edge of town.

The water was dark, reflecting nothing but the night sky. I stood at the bank, panting, my breath forming clouds in the air as I stared at the box in my hands.

I threw the box as hard as I could, watching as it arced through the air and splashed into the river. For a moment, the water rippled, the box bobbing at the surface before it sank, disappearing into the depths.

I stood there, my breath finally slowing. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was gone. I’d done it.

But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye.

A shadow moved at the edge of the water, barely visible in the darkness. I froze, squinting into the night, but I couldn’t see anything. Just shadows. Just the trees swaying in the wind.

I shook my head and walked back to the pawn shop , telling myself it was over.

When I arrived back at the shop, I told myself I’d forget all about it. The box was gone. Everything was normal again. I had to believe that.

But the moment I walked through the door, my stomach dropped.

The drawer was open.

And the box was inside.

Dripping wet.

I stared at it, my heart pounding. How? I had thrown it in the river. I had seen it sink. There was no way it could be back. But there it was, sitting in the drawer like it had never left.

The whispers returned, louder this time, swirling around me like a storm. I felt panic clawing at my throat. There was no escaping it. The box wanted something, and until I figured out how to stop it, it would never leave me alone.

Desperation clung to me like a second skin as I left the shop, clutching the cursed box under my arm. The weight of it felt heavier than before, as though it had soaked up all the fear and dread I had been feeling since the man first left it with me. My mind raced, searching for any solution, any way to rid myself of the box once and for all. The river hadn’t worked. It had returned to me, wet and dripping, as if mocking my attempt.

I needed something else. I needed to destroy it completely.

An old, abandoned warehouse nearby was the only place I could think of . Forgotten and crumbling, with no one around to question why I was setting something on fire in the dead of night.

When I arrived, the warehouse loomed before me like a hulking corpse. Its roof had collapsed long ago, leaving its skeleton exposed to the elements. The place smelled of decay and rot, but it was quiet. Isolated.

I found some old, broken wooden furniture and piled it in the center of the open space. The moonlight trickled in through gaps in the roof, casting long, eerie shadows across the cracked concrete floor. With trembling fingers, I placed the box on top of the makeshift pyre. It sat there, small and innocent-looking, as though it hadn’t caused all this chaos.

But I knew better now.

I fumbled with the matches, striking them over and over until finally, a small flame sparked to life. I set the fire carefully, watching as the flames licked at the dry wood, the heat growing stronger with each passing second. The fire spread quickly, consuming the furniture, and I stepped back, holding my breath as the flames began to crawl toward the box.

For a moment, the box sat untouched, as though the fire refused to touch it. The flames danced around it, flickering and twisting unnaturally, casting grotesque shapes across the warehouse walls. Then, slowly, the edges of the box began to darken and curl.

But just as the fire caught, something changed. The flames shifted, turning an eerie shade of blue, then green…colors no fire should ever burn. The air around me grew thick, almost oppressive, like the weight of the entire warehouse was pressing down on me.

And then came the screams.

They started softly, like distant wails carried on the wind, but quickly grew louder, agonizing high-pitched, inhuman screams that pierced through the crackle of the fire and burrowed into my skull. It was as though whatever had been locked inside that box was now being released, its rage and pain pouring out into the world around me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but the screams only grew louder, more unbearable. They weren’t just coming from the fire; they were inside my head, scratching at the walls of my mind. I fell to my knees, gasping for air, my eyes squeezed shut as the noise drowned everything else out.

Amidst the overwhelming noise, another sound reached my ears.

Footsteps.

I opened my eyes and saw it.

The doll.

It was here, standing at the edge of the firelight, bathed in the unnatural glow of the flames. Its porcelain face, once blank and expressionless, was now twisted into something grotesque, a demonic grin spreading across its delicate features. Its glass eyes, once dull, were alive with malice, reflecting the strange, shifting colors of the fire.

The doll’s small, delicate feet scraped against the floor as it took one slow, deliberate step toward me. And then another.

Its limbs moved stiffly, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings, jerking with each step. But there was something else.

It held a knife in its hand , a small, rusted blade that gleamed in the firelight. The doll’s head tilted, as though it were studying me, savoring the moment. It took another step, faster this time, and then another, its feet tapping against the concrete in a rapid pace..

I stumbled backward, my pulse racing, my breath coming in short, panicked bursts. The screams from the fire were deafening now, swirling around me in a symphony of madness, and yet all I could focus on was the doll, its lifeless eyes locked on mine as it came closer and closer.

My back hit the wall, and the doll lunged.

I screamed, throwing my hands up to block it, but the cold sting of the knife came faster than I could react. The blade pierced through my palm, tearing through flesh and bone, stopping just inches from my eye. Pain exploded through my arm as I tried to push the doll away, but its strength was unnatural, inhuman. Its porcelain face was frozen in that wicked grin, its dead, glassy eyes locked on mine, and no matter how hard I fought, the doll pushed the knife closer to my face.

I gasped, the edge of the rusted blade grazing my cheek, my muscles burning as I fought to keep it from plunging into my eye. Blood dripped down my arm, and I felt my strength slipping. The doll’s grip tightened, relentless, as the blade inched forward. I could see nothing but that knife, feel nothing but the cold steel pressing closer and closer.

With a final, desperate surge of energy, I kicked out at the doll, my foot connecting with its stiff, fragile body. It flew backward, its small frame catching on the edge of the flames.

The fire roared to life, engulfing the doll in a wave of heat and light. For a split second, the doll froze, its grin faltering as the flames spread across its porcelain body. Then, as the fire surged higher, the doll crumbled, its delicate form disintegrating as it fell onto the box.

The flames twisted violently, burning in unnatural colors, swirling like a storm as the doll’s body was reduced to ash, scattering into the night like dust on the wind.

The fire consumed the box, the screams growing louder, more horrifying with each passing second, until they finally peaked in one last, shattering cry. And then, silence.

The fire died down to a smoldering pile of ashes. The air was thick with smoke, the only sound the faint crackling of burning wood. My arm throbbed in pain, blood still dripping from my wound, but the box was gone, destroyed.

I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, the weight of what had just happened sinking in. The box was gone. The damned doll and whispers were gone . It was finally over.

As I drove home in the early morning light, the sun just beginning to creep over the horizon, I felt a strange emptiness settle over me. I had survived. I had destroyed the box. But I would never forget the screams, or the way that doll had moved toward me, knife in hand.

I never knew what was inside the box. And I don’t ever want to know.

The only thing I know for sure is that whatever was inside that box was evil.

And I’ll spend the rest of my life hoping it’s gone [for good](https://youtu.be/CJER_3b22nk?si=FgW7JL3apFsVknZe).

Fashion can be fleeting, but chic style is timeless. It’s about more than just wearing trendy clothes—chic style embodies simplicity, elegance, and a sense of effortless sophistication. From Hollywood icons to everyday fashion enthusiasts, this timeless look transcends generations, showing that you don't need to chase every passing trend to feel stylish. Chic women's clothing is about making deliberate, thoughtful choices that reflect who you are while embracing a look that remains classic, no matter the decade.

# What Defines Chic Women's Clothing?

Chic women's clothing is distinguished by a few key principles: elegance, simplicity, and attention to detail. Unlike fast fashion, which can be flashy or overly designed, chic style relies on clean lines, high-quality fabrics, and an overall minimalist approach. But don’t mistake simplicity for boring—chic outfits exude a refined sophistication that allows your personality to shine through without being overshadowed by your clothes.

So, what makes an outfit ""chic""? It often starts with timeless pieces, like a well-fitted blazer, tailored trousers, or a sleek midi dress. These elements can form the base of your wardrobe, allowing you to mix and match them with ease. High-quality fabrics like silk, wool, and linen add a layer of luxury and sophistication that is hard to replicate with cheaper materials.

# The Importance of a Well-Curated Wardrobe

Building a chic wardrobe doesn’t happen overnight, but it also doesn’t require a massive collection of clothes. In fact, the secret to chic style often lies in having fewer, high-quality items. Investing in timeless pieces that will last for years helps you avoid the clutter of fast fashion and ensures you always have something polished to wear.

Start by focusing on key essentials: a perfectly tailored black blazer, crisp white shirts, structured pants, and a versatile little black dress. These are the types of items that never go out of style and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.

# Building the Foundation: Wardrobe Essentials for a Chic Look

Every chic wardrobe is built on a solid foundation of essentials. Think of these as the backbone of your personal style—pieces you’ll reach for time and again, whether you’re heading to the office, meeting friends for coffee, or attending an evening event.

* **Blazers**: A tailored blazer instantly elevates any outfit, giving a polished, put-together vibe.
* **Crisp White Shirt**: The ultimate versatile piece, a white shirt can be paired with trousers for a business look or worn casually with jeans.
* **Tailored Trousers**: Well-fitted pants can make a world of difference in how chic your outfit looks. Opt for neutral shades like black, gray, or navy.
* **Little Black Dress**: An LBD is a wardrobe must-have. It’s simple, elegant, and can be styled in countless ways for day or night.

# The Power of Minimalism in Chic Fashion

Chic fashion often follows the philosophy of “less is more.” The idea is to create an outfit that looks sophisticated without being over-the-top. Minimalism isn’t just about wearing fewer colors or pieces—it’s about curating a look where each element serves a purpose and contributes to the overall elegance of your outfit.

For example, a neutral color palette consisting of blacks, whites, grays, and beiges allows you to mix and match easily, creating a cohesive and polished look. When your wardrobe revolves around high-quality staples, you’ll find that you need fewer items to achieve a multitude of outfits.

# How to Elevate Everyday Outfits

You don’t need a special occasion to dress chic. In fact, you can take everyday outfits and elevate them by focusing on small details that make a big difference. For instance, swapping out sneakers for a sleek pair of loafers can instantly give your casual look an edge of sophistication.

Adding a single statement piece—like a bold necklace or a standout handbag—can transform a simple jeans-and-tee combo into a stylish, pulled-together look. By focusing on quality over quantity, your wardrobe becomes a tool to elevate your daily style.

# Accessorizing the Chic Way

Accessories play a crucial role in completing your chic ensemble, but it’s important not to overdo it. The key to chic accessorizing is subtlety—opt for understated pieces that enhance your outfit rather than overshadow it. A classic leather handbag, a silk scarf, or a pair of timeless sunglasses can add an extra layer of sophistication without going overboard.

When it comes to jewelry, less is often more. Simple stud earrings, a delicate bracelet, or a minimalist necklace can make a strong impact without overwhelming your look. Remember, accessories should complement your outfit, not compete with it.

# Tailoring and Fit: The Unsung Hero of Chic Fashion

Fit is everything when it comes to chic women's clothing. You could be wearing the most expensive designer outfit, but if it doesn’t fit well, it won’t look chic. This is why tailoring is so important. Finding a good tailor can transform your wardrobe, allowing your clothes to fit you perfectly and giving even the simplest outfit a polished, custom-made feel.

A well-tailored blazer, dress, or pair of trousers will enhance your silhouette and make you look more put-together, even when wearing something as basic as jeans and a t-shirt.

# Dressing Chic on a Budget

Contrary to popular belief, dressing chic doesn’t have to break the bank. With smart shopping strategies, you can find timeless, high-quality pieces at affordable prices. Start by focusing on neutral, versatile staples that will give you more mileage in your wardrobe. Consider shopping during sales or at consignment stores, where you can often find designer pieces at a fraction of the cost.

Thrift shopping is another excellent way to build a chic wardrobe on a budget. Many thrift stores carry vintage items that never go out of style, from classic trench coats to elegant silk blouses. Plus, finding one-of-a-kind items can add a unique touch to your overall look.

# How to Transition from Day to Night with Chic Women's Clothing

One of the best things about chic style is its versatility. You can easily transition from day to night without needing a complete outfit change. For example, if you’re wearing tailored pants and a blouse to work, simply add a statement necklace and swap your flats for heels, and you’re ready for a night out.

Having a few key pieces, like a blazer or an elegant scarf, can help you make quick and easy adjustments to your outfit for different occasions. It’s all about layering and knowing how to mix elements to shift your look from professional to playful in minutes.

# Chic Clothing for Every Season

Chic fashion isn’t limited to any particular season. By carefully selecting seasonal staples, you can maintain a chic look year-round. For colder months, focus on layering with well-constructed coats, sweaters, and scarves. A classic trench coat, for instance, can keep you warm while maintaining a polished look.

In warmer months, opt for light, breathable fabrics like linen and cotton. A chic summer look might include a flowy dress, a wide-brimmed hat, and understated sandals. No matter the season, a well-curated wardrobe will always keep you looking stylish and comfortable.

# Incorporating Texture and Patterns into Chic Looks

While chic fashion often emphasizes simplicity, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid texture and patterns altogether. The key is to introduce them in a way that complements your outfit without overwhelming it. For instance, a tweed blazer or a silk blouse can add richness to an otherwise minimalist look.

If you’re experimenting with patterns, stick to classic designs like stripes, houndstooth, or subtle florals. Pairing patterned pieces with neutral basics ensures that your outfit remains balanced and sophisticated.

# Embracing Personal Style While Staying Chic

One of the great things about chic fashion is its adaptability. While there are certain staples and guidelines, chic style ultimately allows room for personal expression. Whether it’s a pop of color, a signature accessory, or a unique way of layering, there’s plenty of room to add your own flair while staying true to the chic aesthetic.

Don’t be afraid to experiment! Try mixing classic pieces with more daring ones, or play with proportions by pairing oversized tops with slim-fit bottoms. The key is to maintain a sense of balance and elegance, even when incorporating more personalized elements.

# The Role of Confidence in Wearing Chic Fashion

At the heart of chic fashion is confidence. No matter how stylish your outfit is, the way you carry yourself makes all the difference. Wearing chic clothing should make you feel empowered, confident, and ready to take on the world. When you feel good in what you’re wearing, it shows—and that’s the real secret to pulling off any look.

If you’re just starting to build your chic wardrobe, remember that confidence grows with practice. The more you wear clothes that make you feel powerful and beautiful, the more comfortable you’ll become in your style.

# Conclusion: Creating Your Own Chic Fashion Legacy

Chic women’s clothing isn’t about following fleeting trends or chasing the latest designer releases. It’s about cultivating a wardrobe that reflects your inner confidence and timeless elegance. By investing in key pieces, focusing on fit and quality, and always wearing your outfits with poise, you can create a chic style that endures for years to come.

In the end, chic fashion is about more than clothes—it’s a mindset. It’s about embracing simplicity, exuding confidence, and always looking put-together, no matter where you’re headed. So start curating your chic wardrobe today, and let your personal style speak volumes without saying a word.",1,1728663655.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1g1dnlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1g1dnlz/no_game_until_monday_yay_so_lets_remember_a/,"No game until Monday (yay!), so let's remember a forgotten Yankee: Paul Blair","> ""A mystique of history and heritage surrounds the New York Yankees. It's like the old days revived. We're loved and hated, but always in larger doses than any other team. We're the only team in any sport whose name and uniform and insignia are synonymous with their entire sport all over the world... the Yankees mean baseball to more people than all the other teams combined."" -- Paul Blair 
 
[Paul Blair](https://i.imgur.com/N7ffAuM.jpeg) is best remembered as an All-Star centerfielder with the Baltimore Orioles during their hey-day in the late 1960 and early 1970s, but he ended his career with the Yankees as a defensive replacement. On this date in 1977, the eight-time Gold Glove winner came through with his bat, delivering a game-winning single in the 12th inning of Game 1 of the World Series... two days after his ninth inning single started the go-ahead rally to win the American League pennant! 
 
[Here's his Game 1 walk-off hit](https://youtu.be/s7nUruLTrBs?si=ETAYIUu3DE0ssBkK), as called on ABC by Howard Cosell, Keith Jackson, and Tom Seaver!
 
[Paul L.D. Blair](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/blairpa01.shtml) -- his given middle name really was ""L.D."", and I can't find any explanation as to why -- was born February 1, 1944, in Cushing, Oklahoma, but as a child his family moved to Los Angeles, and he grew up a Dodger fan. He graduated from Manual Arts High School, where he lettered in baseball, track, and basketball. He tried out for the Dodgers, his favorite team, but they weren't interested; he was instead signed by the New York Mets for $2,000. 
 
Blair had been a shortstop in high school, but when he saw there were 13 guys on the roster fighting to be middle infielders and only one right fielder, Blair said he told the coaches he preferred playing outfield! He hit just .228 with 147 strikeouts in 122 games that first year in the minors. 
 
At the time, there was a First Year Player Draft, where a team could claim a first-year minor leaguer who hadn't reached the majors yet. The Orioles claimed Blair from the Mets and sent him to their A-ball team in Stockton, California. 
 
It was there that Blair got his nickname, ""Motormouth,"" from manager Harry Dunlop. Blair recalled that he and another player, Curt Motton, were playfully arguing about who was the better hitter -- Blair said they both were hitting around .320 at the time, but Blair had gone 4-for-4 the night before -- and Blair was doing a lot of rapid-fire trash talking. ""Blair's getting to be as bad as a motor, isn't he?"" Dunlop said. The ""Motormouth"" nickname stuck. 
 
The 20-year-old Blair got a cup of coffee with the Orioles in 1964, and the following year became the starting center fielder, a job he would hold for the next 11 seasons. Between 1967 and 1975, Blair won eight Gold Gloves -- seven in a row between 1969 and 1975 -- and that defense plus a .262/.316/.406 (106 OPS+) batting line between 1964 and 1974 earned him recognition as ""the American League's best center fielder"" by *The Sporting News* prior to the 1975 season. Blair reminded many of Willie Mays -- at least in the field -- because he played a shallow center to rob batters of bloop singles, but had the speed and instincts to run down balls hit over his head. 
 
> ""No one can explain what Paul Blair had that gave him the ability to run and run and then know exactly where the ball was coming down. That's something that can't be learned. Such players know where the ball is going long before it gets there. Watching them, it seems, it seems they know as soon as the ball leaves the bat. It can't be explained or taught."" -- Earl Weaver 
 
With the Orioles, he won two World Series rings (1966 and 1970) and played in two more, and was a two-time All-Star. His eight Gold Gloves were the record for an outfielder until Ken Griffey Jr. came along. 
 
But his bat faded quickly after age 31, and he hit just .218/.257/.300 (62 OPS+) in 1975 and .197/.245/.264 (54 OPS+) in 1976. Not even his glove could carry that bat, especially as one of the team's highest-paid players. 
 
Meanwhile, the Yankees had a problem of their own in Elliott Maddox. A fourth outfielder purchased from the Texas Rangers prior to the 1974 season, Maddox had an outstanding season, hitting .303/.395/.386 (127 OPS+) in 550 plate appearances and playing good enough defense that he took over as the starting center fielder in May, pushing veteran Bobby Murcer to right. But the following season Maddox tore up his knee on the wet grass at Shea Stadium -- the Yankees played their home games at Shea between 1974 and 1975 while Yankee Stadium was being renovated -- and only played in 55 games that season; the next year, only 18. Maddox had a second knee surgery after the 1976 season, reportedly against the advice of Yankee doctors. Maddox was already unpopular with some for speaking out against racism, and he had a long-running feud with Yankee manager Billy Martin dating back to their time together on the Texas Rangers. The unauthorized surgery was the last straw. 
 
So on January 20, 1977, the Yankees and Orioles swapped problems, Maddox and a minor leaguer for Blair. Blair's offensive shortcomings wouldn't be a problem in New York, where he was firmly the fifth outfielder behind Roy White, Mickey Rivers, Reggie Jackson, and Lou Piniella. Blair's job was to be a defensive replacement for Jackson and Rivers's backup in center field. 
 
But Blair hit .306/.337/.408 in 108 plate appearances over the first half, and on July 24, Billy Martin told the press Blair had earned more playing time. Maybe this was just a way for Martin to motivate Rivers, who had been criticized for loafing after balls in center field, or maybe it was because Blair hit just .197/.247/.379 over the second half, but in any event, Martin's idea of more playing time was just 74 plate appearances over the rest of the season. 
 
Blair also figured tangentially into one of the most infamous moments during the ""Bronx Zoo"" Yankee years, when Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin got into [a televised argument in the visitors dugout at Fenway Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw8ySODBnhU&t=53s) on [June 18, 1977](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197706180.shtml). 
 
In the sixth inning, with the Yankees down 7-4 and Fred Lynn on first base after a single,  Jim Rice hit a fly ball to right field that Reggie Jackson apparently misjudged and allowed to drop, then didn't hustle after it. Rice wound up on second base and Lynn on third. With one out in the inning, Martin then pulled starting pitcher Mike Torrez -- and Jackson, sending Blair out to right field to replace him. 
 
The camera lingered on Jackson's face for his stunned reaction to the sight of Blair running out of the dugout to the field. Reggie pointed at himself and mouthed the question ""Me?"" to the dugout, then stared at Blair incredulously. 
 
""You'll have to talk to Billy about it,"" Blair said sheepishly. 
 
The camera stayed on Jackson as he jogged off the field to the dugout. He and Martin immediately got into each other's faces. According to Ray Negron, the Yankees batboy, Martin snapped: ""Hey, you don't hustle, you don't play for me!"" 
 
As the argument escalated, Martin had to be restrained by coaches Elston Howard and Yogi Berra from going after Reggie. 
 
The following inning, it was Blair instead of Jackson coming to the plate with Willie Randolph on third base and two outs... and grounded out. He was on deck in the top of the ninth when Chris Chambliss flew out to end the 10-4 loss. 
 
A similar situation seemingly played out four months later in [Game 4 of the ALCS against the Kansas City Royals](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/KCA/KCA197710080.shtml). The Yankees, down two games to one, needed a win to force a decisive Game 5. Jackson struck out in the first inning, walked in the third, and grounded out in the fifth. 
 
In the seventh inning, with the Yankees up 5-4 -- scoring three runs in the second inning on consecutive hits from Willie Randolph, Bucky Dent, and Mickey Rivers -- Jackson came up with one out and grounded out to second base. He obviously wasn't busting it down the line. There were no fireworks in the dugout this time, but a scowling Martin sent Blair to play right field in the bottom of the inning. It's possible, with a one-run lead, Martin just wanted the better defense, but as it was only the seventh inning, Jackson was likely to get another at-bat. And Blair did come up in the top of the ninth, with the bases empty and two outs. Blair singled but Lou Piniella flew out to end the inning, and Sparky Lyle -- who, despite being the closer, had entered the game with one out in the fourth inning -- retired the Royals in order in the bottom of the ninth to preserve the victory. 
 
After the game, a reporter asked Martin why he took Jackson out of the game. ""To put Paul Blair in. Next question,"" Martin snapped. 
 
The following night, Blair got the start in right field over Jackson. Again, maybe the decision was more about strategy than sending a message -- the Royals started lefty Paul Splittorff, and Blair finished his career with an astounding .441/.472/.618 line against him in 34 at-bats -- but no doubt Reggie wasn't happy about starting the game on the bench. Blair, batting eighth, went 0-for-3 against Splittorff. With the Yankees down 3-2 in the ninth, Blair blooped a single off Dennis Leonard to open the inning, then scored on a Rivers single to tie the game. The Yankees tacked on two more runs courtesy of a Randolph sac fly and a George Brett error, and Lyle -- despite having thrown 54 pitches the day before -- got the final four outs to send the Yankees to the World Series for a second year in a row. 
 
The World Series, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, began 47 years ago today, on [October 11, 1977](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA197710110.shtml) -- just two days after the ALCS win over the Royals. (The league championship series was just five games until 1985.) [Previously forgotten Yankee Don Gullett](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1atui7w/no_game_until_saturday_so_lets_remember_a/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=u_sonofabutch&utm_content=t3_1dt2j7n) started Game 1 for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, and Don Sutton for the Dodgers. 
 
Blair began the game on the bench, and Jackson had a single, a pop out, a hit-by-pitch, and a walk. With the Yankees winning 3-2 in the top of the ninth, Blair went out to right field to replace Jackson for defensive purposes, without any drama this time. But Lee Lacy singled to left off Lyle -- who must have been exhausted after pitching 9 1/3 innings across four games in five days during the ALCS -- to knock in Dusty Baker for the tying run. Lyle got out of the inning without further damage. 
 
Blair came up in the bottom of the 10th with Thurman Munson on first base and tried to bunt him to second, but catcher Jerry Grote threw to second to force the Yankee captain. 
 
In the bottom of the 12th -- and with Lyle still on the mound, having retired 11 in a row after the game-ting single to Lacy -- it was still 3-3. Willie Randolph led off the inning with a double off Rick Rhoden to put the winning run in scoring position. Rhoden then walked Munson to go after Blair... and Blair delivered a single to knock in Willie for the game winner! 
 
> ""Paul Blair, who was so important in the Yankees winning the American League pennant, delivers the blow and he is the man of the moment as you look down on Yankee Stadium where the people are still standing almost in awe as to what they have just seen."" -- broadcaster Keith Jackson 
 
It was Blair's biggest moment as a Yankee. He wouldn't get another hit in the World Series, going 0-for-2; he entered as a defensive replacement in Games 3, 4, and 5. 
 
The following year, Blair was back with the Yankees in a reserve outfield role, and even got a handful of innings at second, short, and third. He hit just .176/.231/.264 in 136 plate appearances. 
 
In the ALCS, again against the Royals, Blair got into all four games as a sub and went 0-for-6 with a run scored. In that year's World Series, again against the Dodgers, he was a defensive replacement in Game 1, a pinch hitter in Game 2, a pinch runner in Game 3, a pinch runner in Game 5, and a defensive replacement in Game 6. In Game 4, he got the start in center field over Mickey Rivers against lefty Tommy John, and went 2-for-4 with a run scored. 
 
In 1979, Blair was released a week into the season and was claimed by the Reds. He hit .150 in 155 plate appearances. The following year, the Yankees signed him on May 28 as a free agent to strictly be a defensive replacement (he got into 12 games, but only had two at-bats). He was released on July 1 and retired. 
 
After that, Blair became an outfield instructor with the Yankees, then coached at Fordham for one season. He returned to professional baseball at age 45 in the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989, and then returned to coaching for high schools, colleges, and in the minors.  
 
On December 26, 2013, the 69-year-old Blair passed out at a charity bowling event. ""During a practice round, he threw two or three balls, then sat down and told a friend, 'I feel funny,' and kind of collapsed,"" his wife, Gloria, told the *Baltimore Sun.* Blair was pronounced dead on arrival at Sinai Hospital. 
 
**Blair Bits** 
 
* According to Jonathan Mahler's *Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning* (2005), Blair credited Thurman Munson with helping him hit outside pitches. Munson, who was often teased about his body shape -- his nicknames were ""Tugboat"", ""Squatty Body"", and ""The Walrus"" -- replied: ""Yeah, the beachball can't stir the fuckin' drink, but he can teach you how to hit."" Reggie Jackson, Munson's rival for leadership of the Yankees, had been quoted earlier that season as saying: ""Munson thinks he can be the straw that stirs the drink, but he can only stir it bad."" Jackson has always denied saying it. 
 
* And in the mini-series based on the book, which aired on ESPN in 2007, Blair is played by Seth Gilliam, who played Gabriel on *The Walking Dead*, Carver on *The Wire*, and Watkins in [Starship Troopers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuRjF9cn3SI).
 
* Yankee teammates credited the veteran Blair with being a calming influence in the chaotic Yankee clubhouse during the Billy Martin years, and a bridge between the various cliques. Blair said if he hadn't been in the clubhouse, Reggie Jackson would have gotten into a fight every day of the season! 
 
* Blair often made highlight reel catches because he played so shallow. He not only had blazing speed, but an amazing ability to read the ball off the bat. ""In the outfield I felt there was no ball I couldn’t get to,"" Blair said. ""I played the shallowest center field of anyone."" 
 
* Ken Singleton, the Orioles right fielder who later became a Yankee broadcaster, credited ""Motormouth"" as making him look good on defense. Kenny said he could play closer to the line because he knew Blair could run down anything in right-center. ""He was a gentleman with a booming voice standing behind us and he yelled out, 'Singleton, you're the luckiest right fielder in the American League!'"" 
 
* Blair's manager with the Orioles from 1964 to 1968 was the hard-nosed, hard-drinking Hank Bauer, a former Yankee who had earned seven World Series rings... and two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts as a Marine in the Pacific during World War II. Bauer was renowned as one of the Yankees team leaders, instilling in rookies the ""Yankee way."" ""Bauer taught me how to dress, how to talk, and how to drink,"" Mickey Mantle said. But Bauer had no patience for teammates who showed up unable to perform on game day. Whitey Ford recalled staggering into the clubhouse for a big game and sobering up quickly when Sergeant Bauer pinned him against the wall and snarled in his face, ""You're messing with my money!"" 
 
* In 1970, Blair was beaned by California Angels pitcher Ken Tatum on May 31, 1970. He had serious eye injuries, a broken cheek, and a broken nose, and missed the next three weeks of the season. 
 
* He said the beaning didn't affect him, but he later admitted he had developed the habit of jumping away from inside pitches from right-handed pitchers instead of pulling them for doubles and home runs. He even tried switch-hitting for a time, but gave it up. In June 1973, he started seeing a hypnotherapist, and I guess it worked -- he hit .291/.344/.430 over the rest of the season! 
 
* Blair and his agent went to arbitration with the Baltimore Orioles in 1974, and lost. He had to settle for the Orioles' offer of $60,000. The following year, Blair decided to handle salary negotiations himself, ""one-on-one"" with General Manager Frank Cashen. He got a $15,000 raise! I wonder if he fired his agent? 
 
* During his time in Baltimore, Blair was the star of the Orioles' basketball team. Between 1970 and 1974, *The Sporting News* reported, the team was 51-2, though I'm not exactly sure who they played... other baseball teams, maybe? The newspaper reported that Blair, pitcher Jim Palmer, and New Jersey's own Earl Williams, a catcher/first baseman, were the top players on the team. Williams, nicknamed ""Big Money,"" was a star high school basketball player at Montclair High School. Palmer had been a good enough player in high school to get a scholarship offer from UCLA's John Wooden! 
 
* The minor league throw-in the Yankees gave up with Maddox to acquire Blair from the Orioles was Rick Bladt, a 29-year-old outfielder who to that point had played 11 seasons in the minors while getting just 130 at-bats across two major league seasons. Bladt's claim to fame came in 1976 while playing for the Yankees' triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs. In a game in Memphis at Blues Stadium, batter Art Gardner hit a long fly ball that hit the ivy-covered fence and disappeared. Bladt dug through the ivy but couldn't find it as Gardner circled around the bases for an inside-the-park home run. When umpires couldn't find the ball in the ivy either, it was changed to a ground-rule double. The ball was supposedly never found! 
 
* As for Maddox, the surgery may not have been approved by the Yankees, but it was apparently necessary, as surgeons removed seven bone chips from his knee. He missed the first half of the 1977 season as he recovered from the surgery, but hit .262/.357/.383 in 128 plate appearances when he returned. Maddox was then signed as a free agent by the Mets and played three seasons with them as a utility player, hitting .255/.349/.327 (93 OPS+) at five different positions. (His manager with the Mets was Joe Torre!) He later returned to the Yankees in the early 1990s as a minor league coach and roving instructor. 
 
* In 1984, Blair was inducted into the [Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/history/orioles-hall-of-fame). 
 
* Paul's son, [Paul Blair III](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=blair-002pau), was an infielder in the minor leagues for the Giants and Cubs from 1984 to 1991. 
 
* Blair had worn \#6 with the Orioles, but he had to switch when he came to the Yankees -- Roy White wore \#6 from 1969 to 1979. 
 
* So he picked \#2! You of course know who the most famous \#2 in Yankee history is, but it also was worn by previously forgotten Yankees [Mike Gallego](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/17klhh5/no_game_until_february_25_so_lets_remember_a/) and [Mark Koenig](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/11l3faf/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). 
 
* During his second, brief stint with the Yankees in 1980, \#2 had been claimed by Bobby Murcer -- who had previously worn \#1, but had to give it up for Billy Martin -- so Blair switched to \#27. It's currently worn by Giancarlo Stanton, but also was worn by previously forgotten Yankees [Darrell Rasner](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1anputy/no_game_until_two_weeks_from_today_so_lets/) and [Bob Wickman](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/wwgvi4/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). 
 
> “I never saw Paul Blair’s first step.” -- Earl Weaver
 
In four seasons with the Yankees, Blair hit just .223/.270/.334 (68 OPS+) in 326 plate appearances, but he had that great glove and when it counted in the post-season, he hit .261/.292/.304 and had the game-winning hit in Game 1 of the 1977 World Series.

I had an encounter with the bbs in May and got treatments throughout June. I am pretty sure my apartment is now cleared but the anxiety like never goes away. 
I am currently prepping to move in a couple months and wondering what furniture is safe vs not safe to move. I am not taking my bed or couch but I have a couple display shelves that I really like, a coffee table, and a floor lamp etc. plus the non-furniture things like kitchen and bathroom items I am hoping to just wipe down with Lysol, does that seem correct? 

Also how do I keep the plastic bins “clean” on the outside once they’re all packed up.

1g1djgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/1g1djgl/blocked_by_nano_with_no_explanation/,Blocked by NaNo with No Explanation,"I wrote this post for the facebook group after being blocked and having my account locked with no warning. I submitted it but I don't think the admin will approve it but I still want to put it SOMEWHERE. Here it is:

  
NaNoWriMo blocked me without notice for asking questions and locked my account. I never received any warning that I had violated the code of conduct. I’m sure this post will be taken down but I wanted to speak up one last time before I went out for real. 

I know a lot of us don’t like negativity, but to block users and delete comments that don’t violate the CoC just because they don’t agree with the interim director is a toxic positivity that causes deep hurt. NaNoWriMo JUST went through a scandal last year where reports of harm weren’t taken seriously and their response now is to block people speaking up. That inherently creates an environment where the sort of harm perpetrated last year thrives, even if if it isn’t happening now. 

I am also not trying to be negative. I have only spoken out of a place of love for this organization. I was an ML for six years. I’ve made lifelong friends in NaNoWriMo and this challenge and organization were what brought writing back into my life when I thought I wasn’t good enough to do it. I served as an ML for six years. I have DEEP love for this organization. I know that the most vital part of NaNoWriMo is the wrimos. Not HQ, not me and my volunteer work, but the people who show up and write. If it wasn’t for participants, it would have just been me alone in a coffee shop. 

So it hurts me to see participants with questions that don’t get answered, like where are events, where is the winner shirt, where are my MLs. It hurts me to see this answered with “YOU can run the events” as if it didn’t take me hours every week to put together programming for my region, as if we can ensure participant safety by encouraging unvetted events, as if the purpose of NaNoWriMo is no longer to serve participants but to use participant labor to bolster org numbers. It hurts.I was blocked after asking why I could see only 9 comments on a post when there were 24 and then commiserating with someone whose comments were deleted without violating CoC. I said, “I keep hoping the organization will see the hurt it’s causing but it never happens,” and when I woke up the next morning I was blocked from the Facebook and my account was locked. I can’t go in and check my region page now to make sure that newcomers are being welcomed and directed to where we are still doing programming. 

If you look at my public facebook posts, you will see where I have publicly broken with NaNo and they may cause you to write me off as a naysayer and malcontent. However, I made my group separate because NaNoWriMo released a new agreement that said I couldn’t use their trademarks. I was complying with that. When I expressed concern about the agreement, the interim director sent me back an email that was so personally mean that I cried at my desk. That was when and why I left NaNo. Or rather, when I realized NaNo had left me. I have always harbored a hope that NaNo will turn around and recommit to its participants. Not to its sponsors, not to its directors, not to me, but to the wrimos. I guess it’s time for me to admit that won’t happen. 

But I want to make sure one thing is clear: I didn’t leave NaNo. NaNo left me.
