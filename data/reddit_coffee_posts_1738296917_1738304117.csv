Although our chapter meets in downtown Jacksonville, and may converse on topic that may focus on planning being developed for downtown or beaches area, our group are from areas that is across whole Duval County, Clay County, Gainesville and St. Augustine.

Again, feel free to join us this weekend, and we meet here every 1st Saturday of every month, you are all welcome to stop by and share us your thoughts on how to make Jacksonville better.

1ie853c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tulipserendipity/comments/1ie853c/a_letter_to_the_lost_souls/,A Letter To The Lost Souls,"Have you ever been stuck in a situation where you're confused if it's love because it's too good to be true? If you do, I hope this post finds you. This post is an extension of my deepest fear, unspoken battles, and the lingering thoughts for over 5 years.

For once in 5 years, I finally changed my perspective towards men. Towards him at least. The fear of wanting to love again when I have so much love to give. The fear of exposing too much of me when I just become fond and vulnerable when I love. The fear of being hurt again, but love seems to feel a little like a need. These fears vanished when he came along. For the first time in awhile, I actually feel loved. Genuinely.

He has this distinctive laughter that if you hear it from miles away, you'd know it's him. But his laugh when I'm around is different. It feels like summer almost. The warmth radiates across the room and makes me feel like I could snuggle up to him all day and all night. The way his lips curl upwards in my presence, the way his gaze softens while looking at me. His arms look like they're designated to hold me close. As he kisses me, the bonfire glows lighter; it is as if his lips were meant to hug mine. A love so gentle that I started to love myself even more. It's like I can see myself through his eyes, full of love, desire and fondness.

**But I had this constant thought to myself,** ***""Is this love? It's too good to be true""*****.**

His favorite thing to do after work is to wait for me to get off from work and bring me to dinner. He would give me a rose every day, and it's a different color of rose every time. He knows how grumpy I'd get without my morning coffee, so he'd grab me a cup of coffee before 9 a.m. every morning. I prefer staying in than going out, so he'd cook for us and set up the room for movie nights. He'd peel oranges and shrimp for me. He knows my feet get cold easily, so he bought me socks and heating pads just to warm them up.

**But then again, it's too good to be true.**

A year passed by; he did every single thing, constantly, without fail. *""Oh, this is how it feels like to be loved and not lusted""*, I thought to myself. I've finally found someone I can call 'home'. Someone who could turn my rainy days feel calm instead of gloomy. Someone who makes me believe in love again and its beauty. Someone who drew stars around my scars, and it doesn't bleed this time; it blooms alluringly. Perhaps my idea of love is undemanding, but that's how he is. He makes any calamities seem easier; the darkest days seem a little brighter, those roller coaster paths seem linear.

I loved him so much that it hurts whenever we're not on the same axis. I loved him so much that it burns to the core whenever he breathes different air from mine. I loved him even when it's impossible to do so. I loved him even when the whole world said no. I loved him for all it is worth more than life, for it is to grow.

*And just when I thought that love was for me to cherish, it left me in despair and misery.*

He showed me a whole new dimension that I never thought I'd experience and left me wondering what I did wrong. All foreign and dimmed, everything feels so heavy that I could lose my breath to its adversity. All those I love yous were casual. Those kind gestures were mere courtesy. How can someone seem so in love, but there's no love coming out of the projection? How can someone be so evil to leave people hanging, wondering if they're worth it? To actually let people in, that requires half of my energy. To love someone? That requires all of me. All of my will to exist. All of my very soul. And with his absence, he took everything I had with him. Crushed them into pieces. Within these 5 years, I've been trying to glue the pieces back together, but it seems impossible. And that is my biggest fear: to lose myself while trying to love someone.

5 years later, while I'm trying to figure life out, I've learned so much. That it is okay to let things go even when it hurts. That love isn't cruel; people are. That it is fine to let people in and meet someone new. That it is okay to walk away if you're starting to feel blue. When I started to understand the bits of life, my mind gained clarity. My soul becomes calmer. There's no more rage within me. I begin to let myself experience the life I've been avoiding. But still, the fear is there. To experience love, that is.

I'm 22F who has always found accepting change to be difficult which now I face the impending doom of watching my mother slowing fade away. She has uncurable illness and won't tell me how much time the doctors have told her she has, but from the fact that the doctor is telling her to start talking to a priest, I'm assuming it could be years but they're guessing months. I've always been an introvert and terrible making friends. Even when I went to college I came home every weekend to see her and now I'm facing the idea that I won't have her in my life soon. 

She's to the point I have to get everything for her such as water, coffee, food, ect. She's on oxygen 24/7 and can go into a panic where she can't breath. So basically she just sits there and it kills me to see. We've always been a little more sedentary than we probably should have but all we can do together now is watch movie after movie. I get so bored that I start doom scrolling on my phone and once it's time to go to bed, I feel guilty for not spending quality time with her, but every time I try something other than watching movies, she says she's too tired. Even card games are too much effort. 

I only have a couple weeks left before I go back to work, and I'm worried that this is the last bit of time I truly have with her but selfishly I'm wasting these moments because it's so repetitive. ",1,1738302400.0,sick,0,1.0,False

Only difference between now and then is that I work long hours in person every day. Being truthful with myself (because I‚Äôve been practicing for this moment) I don‚Äôt think I can cut out water.

Okay so my boyfriend is a freshman in college, he plays football so he doesn‚Äôt really have a good schedule to get a job right now. I am senior in HS (18) we have been together for a year. I have a job in which I work a lot, just because I like to make money and stay busy since I quit softball. He bought me good Christmas gifts, and then a Stanley and Nike sweater because he made a mistake and wanted me to feel better. He gets some money from his family but not a lot. I buy him food, bought a few vapes, and other things for him. He sometimes wants to go to the snack machine at his dorm and asks for $5, I‚Äôll always send it just because I can‚Äôt let the person I love go to sleep hungry or just be hungry in general. I am leaving for vacation in 2 days and a few hours ago told him I needed a new vape, about an hour later he goes to the store with his friend and buys himself a vape, the biggest disposable they have. I only feel some type of way because I have bought him vapes when he asked, even thought I didn‚Äôt ask for him to buy me one I just feel like since I said it a few hours prior to you buying yourself one, you would take the initiative to put me first for once since I do that for you.

Am I being selfish for wanting him to refrain going to fast food one day or get something different so he could send me and provide a $5 once every few months‚Ä¶?

I am more than capable of buying things for myself, in which I do, but I just feel it is the small things that count. Please help, am I wrong ??? How should i approach the topic???

1ie7vby,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1ie7vby/my_co_worker_crossed_the_boundary/,My co worker crossed the boundary!!,"
My male married coworker/team mate crossed the boundary yesterday, and it made me feel so uncomfortable it triggered a full panic attack infront my entire team. The rest of my team members were kind enough to help me sort it out. 
For context, this co-worker who is 10 years older than me, seemed to be an introverted shu man who minded his business. Once he warmed up to our team, we all start conversing more. We would usually talk about movies, or the news. But slowly he would start bringing in his personal life in our conversations, especially when talking to me (since he sits right next to me). I would wish him good morning or ask how his weekend was he would start bitching about his wife and how he doesn't like staying with her. I immediately felt uncomfortable and would not reply or react to the things he said. 

I also slowly started to avoid having any conversations with him other than work stuff. 

And so for the last couple of days he had been acting really weird and silent which got our attention as a team and we started to ask him what was wrong. And just for the sake of courtesy, I asked him if everything was ok and he ended telling me things that triggered the panic attack. He said that he feels a deep connection with me and he hasn't felt this way in 12 years. He demanded to know why I don't reciprocate his feelings, show that I care for him or talk to him outside of work. Why I don't drink coffee with him during breaks, why I talk to other co-workers especially other men,  or why I never share personal things with him. 

Hearing this I I immediately started shaking out of fear, but I also managed to voice record him. 
After he leaves, I immediately run out of the office building and call my best friend who also works with me. She suggests that I immediately talk to the manager. So today I told my manager, played the recording and found out that he has been doing a lot of other damage than initially thought. My manager has been quiet pissed of with him and felt what he did was beyond crossing the line. 

Now I am scared that he might try to harm me back, even though he doesn't know I talked to the manager about this with proof. From what my manager told me, I understand that he is a deeply disturbed man.

She was at that time engaged in ongoing warfare with the pimps and hookers who did business in cribs on our end of the street in the City.  Of the ‚ÄúTake your shit somewhere else!‚Äù variety.  

Constant complaints to PD.  They‚Äôd sometimes move ‚Äòem along to some other location nearby.  So she‚Äôd leave Them alone.  But they always came back.  

And she was in full cry once again.  A local pimp and one of his ladies taking it stoically.  It was important to be polite.  Well, for Them to. Z and X were monitoring the situation.  

X was the next to youngest of us four brothers, but the most respected. He‚Äôd recently done 6 months for sending a man for an extended hospital stay.  Free room and board, meals provided for both.  Juvenile facility.  He was 16.  The man had insulted Mother. 

‚ÄúLet them hate, so long as they fear.‚Äù üòÇ They feared.  Everyone did.  Unanimous general consensus, lol. It hadn‚Äôt been the first time he‚Äôd taught someone better manners, and helped them 
grow spiritually.  He was a humanitarian. 

He was watching to make sure the harangue remained convivial.  

So was Z.  He was leaning against the fence smoking a cigarette, watching and listening.  The pimp‚Äôs eyes kept straying to Lucy dangling casually in his other hand.  

‚Ä¶.I Think she was Lucy at that time.  She was the first handgun he‚Äôd bought when he was 14.  Her name changed casually from time to time. Always a woman.  

Definitely not that of one former girlfriend. He‚Äôd broken it off with her, and she thereafter had tried to kill him.  Twice. Some people don‚Äôt handle rejection well. 

Lucy remains his favorite to this day.  His first love. 

This particular fleshpeddling entrepreneur was a dandy.  Sartorialness was important to him.  But for all that he was a lightweight, mostly show.  Most were.  

Charles wasn‚Äôt.  And he didn‚Äôt care about fancy clothes. 

Pimp Daddy Chauncey opened his mouth to reply to Mother.  Stopped at a ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù From Z. And looked Z‚Äôs way.  

With the hand that still held the dwindling cigarette, Z raised his fingers to his brow and without any further words made a lifting motion. 

Tip your hat to the lady, son. (‚ÄúUneasy Rider‚Äù reference).  Before you address her. Show some dammed respect!  

Chauncey glared at him unspeaking.  Maybe even He wasn‚Äôt going to go That far.  

Then X slid off of the hood of the car he‚Äôd been sitting in, and Chaunce couldn‚Äôt snatch it off his head quick enough, lol.  

X resumed his seat.  üòÇ

I was a lightweight, compared to my younger siblings, but was who I had to be when I had to be it.  I spent much of my time coming up in the City just trying to keep them under some semblance of control.  Full time job.  After dad had tired of responsibility a long time ago and had sought greener pastures elsewhere with a girlfriend in tow (she didn‚Äôt last long), Someone had to.  

Spoiler:  Favorite line coming up.  I‚Äôve repeated it often.  It‚Äôs delicious:

I made a trip back to the City a couple, few years back.  Mother had had two more small strokes after having not been taking the medications to prevent such recurrences, as she had assured me she had been (liar liar).  Check in on her‚Ä¶.and have a face-to-face discussion. A short stay.

While there I sat and talked with the woman who‚Äôd graced baby brother BB with her presence lo these many years now.  Over a cup of coffee and her ever-present cigarettes.  

‚ÄúYou know, OP, don‚Äôt you, why your mother stayed safe in this place all those years after you left?  Everyone was scared to death of Z and X, and they knew BB was as crazy as a shithouse rat.‚Äù

She‚Äôs a hillbilly same as we are, from Back Home in the hills, and so prefers to speak plainly. I shrugged in agreement. It was all true, lol. 

You know, we would all have rather been someone else then, than who we had to be.  But we couldn‚Äôt.  Strength was respected.  It was the only thing that was. Perceived weakness would make your life very difficult.  

Our area was a bad place in a bad place in the heart of an overall bad place.  Casual violence was a part of life.  There were 8 murders over the years in just the few blocks of the back street on which we lived. 

There was a bar a block away from us even PD wouldn‚Äôt enter except in force, with helmets and face shields on. 

Another a little farther away in which if there wasn‚Äôt at least one stabbing or shooting, the weekend wasn‚Äôt considered a success. We referred to it eventually as the ‚ÄúSaturday Night Knife and Gun Club‚Äù in honor of a novel by that name. 

Police sirens and near distant gunfire were a fact of life, especially on weekends, and especially during hot summer months when tempers were raw.  

A visitor to our house was appalled by them, and was met with puzzlement. It was only background noise.  You paid it no attention unless it was getting too close.  It was just Saturday night, lol. She never came back. 

Mother once asked a favor on behalf of a woman she worked with.  The woman was new to the neighborhood, and had quickly discerned its character.  But she also knew about us.  

She had a son with vital health and slight mental difficulties.  Childlike, frail, and small for his age, though he was of our age.  

She‚Äôd asked Mother if I would befriend him in an obvious way.  Be seen to.  That she knew that then that he‚Äôd be left alone in a bad place.  

Of course. Anything for Mother.  

It‚Äôs funny now:  ‚ÄúIf you had been my friend, then your enemies would have been My enemies.  Then 
‚Ä¶..Then..They would have feared you.‚Äù üòÇ

But at that moment, it also stung a little bit to be reminded that we were seen in that light.

I never buy myself fast food because I just don‚Äôt really eat it but, he never just takes the initiative to send me $5 for coffee. Am I being selfish for wanting him to refrain going to fast food one day or get something different so he could send me and provide a $5 once every few months‚Ä¶? Idk maybe just because my love language is gift giving (result of a narcissistic father who wouldn‚Äôt show affection just money.) I am more than capable of buying things for myself, in which I do, but I just feel it is the small things that count. Please help, am I wrong ??? How should i approach the topic??? It‚Äôs just the thought that counts to me $5 coffee, I love coffee, but he doesn‚Äôt care to sacrifice for me ig. ",0,1738300421.0,amiwrong,6,0.5,False

1ie7iym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheKameena/comments/1ie7iym/aitk_for_being_too_insensitiveinconsiderate/,AITK for being too insensitive/inconsiderate,"Hi all, the post might be a bit incendiary for the opposite sex; please be assured I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I really need a different opinion from both males and females. I'm a 25 (M) working in a lab (doing my PhD). I've never been in an inner friend circle with women, never had a girlfriend for a variety of reasons (introverted, only boys school till 10th, ridiculed by the family for looks at a young age, so have an inferiority complex, lower-middle-class, etc.), trying to work on it.

My problem is I've had problems with connecting with/understanding women. So I've a female friend (call her A), who I feel gets angry for the smallest reason, just yesterday A had a very bad day, as her experiment didn't work; she cried and needed someone to console her and rant to (usually me and a mutual male friend - Y). I was in a meeting with my PA (PhD advisor) and other professors; and didn't see her texts for an hour. She got really angry as to why my phone is on silent and told me never to talk to her. I went to her and tried to explain myself, but got into an argument about why I should at least put my phone on vibrate (because there can be a hypothetical emergency). Another incident was when she got angry because I took the help of Y instead of her for a small experiment (plasmid isolation - for those who know), but she didn't talk to me for an entire day. Then, she told me my efforts to please her were insignificant. I had a deadline that day to submit a report (so I didn't please her as much as I usually would have, maybe). Another incident was when she got angry about me not wanting to have tea (because me and I had just coffee an hour ago), but I said I'd go with her if she wanted to have it. She was angry because I didn't, by my own volition, want to have tea, knowing she wanted to have tea (context me, she and Y go for tea every day). There have been many such incidents like this. Every time she does this it's usually me that has to step down and say sorry. Me and her are no longer friends after yesterday.

Another previous female friend (we went to a conference together) didn't talk to me for a period of 12 days abroad. It was my first trip abroad (not for her), so I was excited to see a foreign country. we had planned a lot of things together, but most of the trip was miserable because she wouldn't talk. The reason she got angry, which she said after coming back to India, was that I made a comment/joke about her taking time to get ready (something I've said jokingly 1 or 2 times before) and another comment/joke about she was having trouble to walk to the conference (it was 2 km hike uphill). But anyway, I tried talking to her many times during the conference; she acted like nothing was wrong, and I was miserable during the entire conference (even my PA asked me what happened). She also made another comment in front of others (another lab) that I was of no use and to take me with them. After coming back, she said that my efforts to please her were not enough, and I should've said sorry even without knowing my wrong, and it was my male ego to not say sorry. I pointed out, isn't it a female ego that you want me to apologize without knowing my wrong, and despite my efforts to talk to you, you didn't reciprocate and work it out, which could have been done easily. She said ""Yeah females have an ego and that's fine, I was on my periods, so you should've been considerate, nicer to me and made more efforts to please me"". Me and her are no longer friends.

I've had a similar incident of bursting out with one other female colleague, not a friend.

I've never had such problems with my male friends, none of the above incidents would have even made a blip in their radar, even if there are differences we just let it go, sort it out, without much friction. We usually don't even say sorry. I really mean no disrespect to all women, neither to the women I've talked about here. But I really need another opinion, is this normal? Do I need to change things about myself and be more sensitive around women?

(523/3.85/very confused),"Hello :) mainly looking for suggestions on anything I can do to spruce up my application before I apply in May/June, advice on what schools I should be applying to, and answers to some specific questions I left in the post. sorry for the length lol I am a yapper but I appreciate anyone taking time to read this. Thanks!

Demographics/stats:

* White trans man, originally from a state in the midwest
* Question: Do I count as a CA resident or not for admissions?? I have a CA license and pay taxes/work/have an apartment here but my parents are still in the midwest state that is politically/legally unsafe for me to go live in now. I don‚Äôt care about tuition I‚Äôm just talking about whether the admissions office considers me as in state vs out of state. I have not left CA for any summer breaks or anything like that, living here the whole time.
* T30 undergrad in California, graduating this May¬†
* Biology adjacent major, Spanish minor (but I‚Äôm NOT FLUENT or even really good at spanish, I just really like learning about it and practicing)

* cGPA/sGPA: 3.86/3.75¬† (without spring 25 grades)
* Question: Does my MCAT make up for a lower GPA at all or should I just not apply to more selective GPA schools?
* MCAT: 523, one attempt

Clinical experience:

* CNA job at children‚Äôs hospital - 1200+ hours, most meaningful, Will be working here during my gap year so I will have even more hours
* Medical Scribe job - 50 hours - only worked here for like 2 weeks, quit because I got my better CNA joo, I‚Äôm not really sure if I should include this in my app bc its not that many hours, but I also don‚Äôt have a ton of activities so‚Ä¶
* Volunteering at hospital - 50 hours - again unsure if should include bc short time, quit bc it wasn‚Äôt actual clinical experience i was just like at the unit desk and it sucked¬†

Research: 1200 hours, One lab all 4 years, third author on a published paper, cancer related but not clinical¬†

Non-Clinical volunteering:¬†

* Homeless shelter - 1200ish hours - Director of nonprofit/club that works with unhoused college students, very passionate about this and started as a volunteer then became director.
* Spanish lessons at medical school nearby - 30 hours - This was something that I volunteered for during a medical spanish class I was taking. I got to teach med students basic spanish and it was really cool but it was a short period of time so not sure if I should include it.¬†

Non-clinical work/experiences:¬†

* Chain store coffee barista - 700 hours
* Behavior Tech (worked w/ kids with developmental disabilities) - 150 hours
* EMT class - 150 hours¬†- unsure if this should be included because it was a class that I took but it wasn‚Äôt a part of college, it was thru a private program I paid for to get the EMT certification that I then never used because I became a CNA lol. It did take a lot of my time one semester tho :(

Shadowing: 40 hours at children‚Äôs hospital, 20 hours neurology, 10 hours surgical urology¬†

LORs:¬† Lab PI and professor will write a good one I think, Spanish minor profs, RN boss at CNA job, Advisor for my nonprofit/club - unsure, i honestly don‚Äôt talk to him that much but probably¬†

I‚Äôm looking for: MD schools in states that are at least neutral for trans rights. Unable to consider any red states really bc of how severely state laws could impact me even if in a progressive city/school. The states that I currently think I could reasonably safely live in are CA, CO, CT, DE, IL, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, NH, NJ, NY, OR, PA, RI, VT, WA, WI but this list gets narrower each day unfortunately. Outside of state/non-rural location, I don‚Äôt have many preferences. I‚Äôm fairly confident that I want to go into pediatrics as a specialty if that is relevant.¬†

Overall question - which ECs should I include vs not include if any? I don‚Äôt have anything else that I didn‚Äôt put in the post so as you can see my resume is a little shorter than many other premeds so I‚Äôm a bit worried about that.¬†

I will need to cut down to 20-25 schools max and I‚Äôm sure there are some I just don‚Äôt know in here that are a bad mission/vibes fit or not OOS friendly so please let me know:¬†

Crazy reach schools (will only apply my fav 2-3 of these.. gotta be able to dream right? lol)

* Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons
* Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
* Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine
* Northwestern University The Feinberg School of Medicine
* NYU Grossman School of Medicine
* UChicago Pritzker SOM
* Weill Cornell

* Georgetown University School of Medicine
* Stanford University School of Medicine
* The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University
* University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine

1. Living out of a suitcase gets old.
2. Melbourne, while amazing, is expensive and far from... everything.

So here‚Äôs the plan: I bought an apartment in Melbourne (for stability), but I‚Äôm renting a place in Chiang Mai to use as my new home base. Here‚Äôs why:

**Cost:**

* In Melbourne, rent for a nice condo is¬†**$2,000 AUD/month**.
* In Chiang Mai? Same vibe (but with a pool) for¬†**1/4 of the price**. That extra cash = more travel, better food, and not stressing about bills.

**Travel Made Easy:**  
Melbourne feels isolated. From Chiang Mai, I can hop to Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, etc., for cheap. No 12-hour flights just to reach Asia.

Setting up a home base in Chiang Mai solves logistic problems. I‚Äôll keep my Melbourne apartment (hello, long-term security!), but in Thailand, I‚Äôll rent a place where I can actually unpack my clothes, hang art on the walls, and pretend I‚Äôm a functional human. No more 2 AM check-ins or Wi-Fi roulette. Plus, flights across Asia are shorter, cheaper, and far less soul-crushing than trekking from Australia.

**Life Upgrade:**  
In Melbourne, I spend weekends cleaning and grocery shopping. In Chiang Mai? Hire a maid for less than my coffee budget. Eat street food daily. Focus on work¬†*and*¬†fun.

**The Best Part?**  
I‚Äôm not ‚Äúleaving‚Äù Melbourne‚Äîit‚Äôs still home. But Chiang Mai lets me live well, travel often, and keep my sanity. Win-win.",6,1738300096.0,digitalnomad,12,0.69,False

For the past month, I‚Äôve been working on sticking to around 1,500 calories a day‚Äîmostly eggs (before the prices went wild), apples, kiwis, blueberries, oatmeal, and then chicken, beef, and stir-fried veggies for lunch/dinner (with the occasional sourdough sandwhich with smoked turkey and swiss cheese). I allow myself two cups of coffee a day with 2 TBS of Chobani creamer daily and the rest of the day is green tea or water.

On the workout side, I hit the apartment gym four days a week for about 30 minutes each time, mixing cardio and weights. I can only run for about two minutes before I need to catch my breath, and I‚Äôd really like to improve my endurance. I‚Äôm also getting about 7.5 hours of sleep a night without any issues.

1ie7ch8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidOnlineJobs/comments/1ie7ch8/fairy_home_decor_kitchen/,Fairy Home Decor Kitchen,"Creative Ways to Incorporate Fairy Home Decor in Your Kitchen
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to add a whimsical touch to your kitchen, fairy home decor can create a magical atmosphere that‚Äôs both inviting and enchanting. By incorporating elements of fantasy and nature, you can transform your kitchen into a delightful haven where creativity flows. Here are some creative ways to weave fairy-inspired decor into your kitchen space.

### Add Fairy Lights

One of the simplest and most effective ways to introduce fairy home decor into your kitchen is by using fairy lights. These delicate strands of lights can be hung above countertops, wrapped around shelves, or draped over windows. Opt for warm white or pastel-colored lights to create a cozy ambiance. You can also find battery-operated versions that make decorating easy, without relying on electrical outlets.

### Incorporate Nature-Inspired Elements

Bringing nature inside is a core principle of fairy decor. Consider adding potted herbs and plants on your kitchen windowsill. These can be both functional and decorative, providing fresh ingredients for your meals while enhancing your kitchen's natural vibe. Look for whimsical planters shaped like mushrooms, fairies, or other enchanted creatures to further the fairy theme.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/fairy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Use Whimsical Artwork

Artwork can dramatically influence the mood of your kitchen. Seek out prints and paintings that feature fairy-tale scenes, enchanted forests, or floral designs. Hang these pieces at eye level to create a focal point. You may even want to rotate seasonal art to keep the decor fresh and relevant, with images of fairies enjoying fresh produce or preparing magical meals.

#### Display Charming Kitchenware

Your kitchenware can also serve as decor. Choose plates, bowls, and mugs that have fairy-tale motifs. Look for items embellished with flowers, creatures, or ethereal designs. Consider displaying them on open shelves or hanging them on the wall, turning your kitchen into a charming gallery of enchanted kitchenware.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/fairy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Create a Fairy Garden Nook

Set aside a small corner of your kitchen to create a fairy garden nook. Use a shallow dish or a decorative tray to arrange tiny plants, moss, and fairy figurines. Add miniature furniture, like tiny tables or swinging benches, to create an inviting scene. This tiny garden will serve as a delightful conversation starter while bringing a charming atmosphere to your space.

### Use Fairy-Themed Textiles

Transform your kitchen textiles to enhance the fairy decor theme. Look for tablecloths, napkins, and dish towels featuring floral patterns or illustrations of mythical creatures. Soft pastel colors can evoke a sense of whimsy. You might also consider DIY projects to create your own unique textiles, such as painting fairy designs on plain fabric.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/fairy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
#### Craft Your Own Wall Hangings

If you're feeling creative, why not make your own wall hangings? You can use items like branches, twine, and fabric to create a rustic decor piece. Hang small fairy-inspired ornaments or dried flowers to reinforce the theme. This project not only personalizes your kitchen but also gives it a hand-crafted, homey feel.

### Paint a Fairy Mural

For an adventurous choice, consider painting a fairy mural on a kitchen wall. You can go for a full-scale design or simply accentuate a smaller section of the wall. This could be a scene of fairies in a garden or whimsical designs featuring flowers and leaves. If painting isn't your forte, wall decals can serve as an easy alternative and offer the same magical effect.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/fairy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Embrace Enchanted Utensils

Don't forget to embrace the charm of your kitchen utensils. Replace standard cooking tools with fairy-themed ones or ones that come in playful colors. You can also look for wooden spoons or serving dishes that have intricate designs carved into them. These small details can significantly elevate the fairy home decor theme.

By incorporating these creative ideas, your kitchen can become a delightful blend of functionality and fantasy. Embrace your inner fairy and let the enchanting decor inspire you to spend more time in your magical culinary retreat.

### 1. Fairy-Tale Apron

Every aspiring fairy chef needs a beautifully designed apron. Look for one adorned with delicate floral patterns, shimmering stars, or enchanting woodland creatures.

You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre stepping into a storybook every time you wear it.

Background:

 I have to be honest, aside from the sweet mess my wife gets and I sneak sips of (Java Chip, White Chocolate Mocha, or anything 3/4 sugar, cream, 1/4 coffee), I really hate most drinks from Starbucks. The standard hot coffees always come out tasting burnt and stale to me. 

I wrote off Starbucks for me, and Dunkin hasn't been good to me for over a decade. Not much else is open on my commute.

Enter the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, often messed up and different between each store, it still comes out on top for me. I found to order mine with some half and half and most stores it ends up tasting better. Though, my last store, didn't need any modifications, just no ice, and sometimes more foam.

Sometimes it has the Cold foam on top, other times it's all just a mixed mess, usuallt delicious. Even though I get it with no ice, there have been cold days where I want a hot coffee, but often end up disappointed with some of the flat whites, lattes, etc...

1ie77ew,https://i.redd.it/fqo0qi32g9ge1.jpeg,How Much Does It Cost to Create a Motion Logo?,"
 The Price of Motion ‚Äì More Than Just a Wiggle!

You ever notice how logos are like pets? Static logos are like cats‚Äîjust sitting there, looking sleek. But motion logos? Oh, they‚Äôre dogs. They zoom, they jump, they demand attention! And just like a good dog trainer, a motion designer makes sure your logo doesn‚Äôt just run wild but actually wows the crowd.

But here‚Äôs the million-dollar‚Äîor let‚Äôs be real, maybe a few hundred-dollar‚Äîquestion: How much does it actually cost to make one?


---

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I Just Get One for Five Bucks?‚Äù (The Budget Fantasy)

Look, if you‚Äôre thinking of heading over to one of those ‚Äúget-anything-for-five-dollars‚Äù websites, let me stop you right there. That‚Äôs like buying sushi from a gas station‚Äîtechnically, it‚Äôs food, but do you really want to risk it?

A motion logo done for the price of a cup of coffee? Sure, but it might move like it‚Äôs got caffeine jitters.


---

‚ÄúSo, What‚Äôs a Realistic Budget?‚Äù

Alright, let‚Äôs break it down:

$50 ‚Äì $200: This is the ‚Äúmy cousin just got After Effects‚Äù price range. It might include some basic movements‚Äîthink of it like a logo that learned to nod but not to dance.

$200 ‚Äì $500: Now we‚Äôre talking semi-pro territory. You get smooth animations, clean transitions, maybe even a little sass in the motion. Your logo isn‚Äôt just alive‚Äîit‚Äôs got personality.

$500 ‚Äì $2,000: Here‚Äôs where the magic happens. Custom animations, sound design, and a logo that doesn‚Äôt just move‚Äîit performs. Your brand now has its own superhero landing.

$2,000+: Welcome to the big leagues. Studio-quality motion design, custom 3D work, and a logo that looks like it just walked out of a Pixar movie. If you‚Äôve got a brand that needs to own the screen, this is your range.



---

‚ÄúWhy So Expensive? Isn‚Äôt It Just a Few Keyframes?‚Äù

Ah, my dear optimist, motion design isn‚Äôt just about slapping some movement on a logo. It‚Äôs about timing, easing, physics, brand personality, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs not forget‚Äîkeeping the client from asking for ‚Äòone tiny revision‚Äô 48 times.

The real cost isn‚Äôt just in the animation‚Äîit‚Äôs in the creative process, the planning, the ‚Äúmake it pop‚Äù moments, and the hours spent making sure your logo doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs auditioning for a PowerPoint transition.


---

Final Verdict: What Should YOU Pay?

If your brand is just getting started, a few hundred bucks might get you something clean and decent. But if you‚Äôre serious about looking pro, invest in a solid motion designer. Your logo deserves to shine‚Äînot just wiggle awkwardly in the corner like a bad Zoom call.

So, next time someone asks, ‚ÄúWhy does a motion logo cost that much?‚Äù just tell them: ‚ÄúBecause good design isn‚Äôt just seen‚Äîit‚Äôs felt.‚Äù

And if they still don‚Äôt get it? Well‚Ä¶ maybe show them a five-dollar animation and let them decide.

We were dating for 1.5 years. This was my first relationship. A friend recommended to post it on here to gain perspective from you guys on reddit.

I first moved from California to DC for a new job in 2023. I met her on Coffee Meets Bagel. We met on the first date. Clicked really well. Asked her if she wanted to be official on the 3rd date and she said yes. I really missed home at that time I thought I would be moving back home after maybe 2-3 years here. I didn't want hurt her so I tried breaking up with her during the 4th date, but I felt terrible and I really liked her and missed her. So the following day I apologized to her and asked her if she wanted to do short-term and told her how much I missed California. She said yes, but I felt guilty for doing that to her.

Over the next couple months the relationship was going great. I fell in love with her and thought about settling with her in DC and didn't think about California at all. I changed my mind and wanted to do long term with her. During the beginning and middle of 2024 she brought up if we could break up. I didn't want to and asked her for more time and a chance to show her we can make this work. She would agree and gave me a chance. Throughout the year she lost her intimacy for me. Around that time I would say ""I love you"" but she would never say that back. But if I say ""I miss you"" then she would say that back.

At first I thought things were going great the past couple of months. I asked her if she was happy and she said yes at those times. However, she called me last week and wanted to break up. Caught me off guard. I met up with her in-person last Saturday to give her stuff back. She told me the reasons why she broke up with me:

* She feels like the relationship is too comfortable and complacent (stagnating)
* We don't challenge each other enough for personal growth
* Told me she hasn't loved me back at all yet she still treasures our memories and has no regrets
* We had some rough patches, but we got through them this past year. Some of my words would trigger her and I would have to apologize alot...
* She doesn't like how my work (engineering) is lax how I barely do any work and have lots of free time
* She pointed it out she wanted somebody who can hustle and have an impact on society like a doctor (helping people)
* She wakes up super early in the morning like 6-7am and waits for me to wake up 10am to 11am
* She said we have different values and life goals.
* She's not really an intimate person but I was willing to not be intimate with her.
* She doesn't like how I drink soda and play video games
* Our dates have been just the 2 of us. We haven't really found a group to hang with and she felt stuck in this relationship.
* I haven't been the best planner. We were running out of stuff to do. I couldn't find new places to explore and eat. She probably planned 75% of the dates.
* She was telling me this was all in the back of her mind accumulating up to this point.

I told her I wanted to fix these issues together step-by-step and that I could change, but she told me she never really loved me and doesn't see a future with me. During the breakup she was crying alot not for the end of the relationship, but she felt guilty because she cared alot about me. And I cared alot about her. She said she wanted to be friends still with me but after giving each other space...

I'm really sad right now. I regret so much of what I said to her. I wish I could just go back in time and just say the right stuff so she wouldn't leave me. I'm just grieving just looking at our photos together and our old texts right now.

The ones we never take out of the box are our most prized possessions. The ones we don‚Äôt want to use until someone can appreciate it with us. When‚Äôs the last time you took them out? How much dust has collected around them?
 

If you‚Äôre anything like me, they overflow the box. They‚Äôre coffee-stained, some written on napkins or torn pieces of paper. Some scribbled on college ruled crumpled paper.

We both might need an extra pair of hands to help wipe the dust off, watch it disintegrate behind it‚Äôs actual potential. We‚Äôll go through them in the forest, a few miles of hiking.

1ie6skz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ie6skz/mfbarry_and_the_trash_prophet/,[MF]Barry and the Trash Prophet,"It was 2:57 AM when Barry heard the muffled chittering.

He had just stepped outside the Gas ‚Äôn Go Emporium for his scheduled three minutes of standing eerily in the parking lot, a new habit Tina had already decided not to ask about.

The noise came from the alleyway behind the store. A frantic, rustling, almost desperate sound. Barry took a few steps toward the source, moving with an unsettling calm, stopping when he reached the edge of the dumpster.

A raccoon was stuck inside.

It was small, scrappy, and wild-eyed‚Äînot in a panicked way, but in a way that suggested it understood more than it should. As if it had received knowledge it was never meant to have and couldn‚Äôt decide whether to accept or reject it.

Barry peered in. The raccoon stared back.

They held eye contact for several seconds longer than necessary.

Then Tina‚Äôs voice cut through the stillness.

‚ÄúOh no. Nope. No. I don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

Barry didn‚Äôt turn. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trapped.‚Äù

Tina, standing by the door with her third cup of coffee that night, groaned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a raccoon, Barry. It got itself in. It‚Äôll get itself out.‚Äù

Barry looked down at the raccoon. The raccoon looked back, unblinking.

Barry reached into the dumpster.

The raccoon froze, completely still as he wrapped his hands around it.

Tina took a loud, slow sip of coffee. ‚ÄúYou know, I actually don‚Äôt have the energy to stop you. So do what you‚Äôre gonna do.‚Äù

Barry lifted the raccoon out and set it on the pavement. Instead of immediately fleeing, the raccoon remained perfectly still.

It studied Barry. Barry studied it.

Tina sighed. ‚ÄúI hate that you two are making eye contact like that.‚Äù

The raccoon slowly lifted its little paws. It placed one delicately on Barry‚Äôs shoe.

Tina took a step back. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ is it choosing you?‚Äù

Barry ignored her and crouched, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù

The raccoon chittered softly. It was almost‚Ä¶ thoughtful.

Barry‚Äôs lips curved ever so slightly. ‚ÄúYou may follow.‚Äù

The raccoon did.

Tina rubbed her temples. ‚ÄúI need to find a new job.‚Äù



The raccoon followed Barry into the Gas ‚Äôn Go like a shadow.

It didn‚Äôt scurry or dash like normal raccoons. It moved with a strange, deliberate grace, gliding seamlessly from the floor to the shelves to the top of the counter, as if it had studied the act of existing indoors and had chosen to excel at it.

Tina narrowed her eyes as it perched on the register. ‚ÄúWhy does it move like it pays rent?‚Äù

Barry did not answer. He simply watched as the raccoon surveyed the store, eyes flicking toward the snack aisle, the hot dog rollers, the employee break room door left slightly ajar.

Then, as if coming to a deep personal decision, it began.



The thefts began immediately.

At first, they were subtle.

A single pack of peanuts vanished from the impulse buy section.

A hot dog from the roller disappeared mid-turn.

A customer set their energy drink on the counter for less than two seconds, turned back, and found only absence.

A $5 bill went missing from the register. The drawer had never opened.

Tina tapped the counter with her fingernail. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Barry‚Äôs smile widened by a fraction. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. We are not doing this.‚Äù

Barry considered this. Then he turned toward the raccoon, who had somehow positioned itself directly behind a customer without making a sound.

‚ÄúHis name is Todd,‚Äù Barry said simply.

Tina took a slow, controlled breath. ‚ÄúTodd.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúTodd.‚Äù

Barry nodded.

Tina‚Äôs expression was distant, resigned, as if she were processing the many unfortunate ways her life had led to this moment.

Meanwhile, Todd continued stealing.

A trucker walked in with one glove. When he walked out, he had none.

A candy bar disappeared from a customer‚Äôs hand as they went to pay. They frowned, looked around, and hesitated‚Äîlike they weren‚Äôt sure if they had ever actually picked it up in the first place.

Then, stranger things began to happen.

A stolen lighter reappeared on the shelf‚Äîbut with a different brand logo.

A bottle of soda taken from the cooler reappeared on the counter‚Äîbut already open, half-empty, condensation fresh.

A missing set of car keys turned up in a customer‚Äôs pocket. He hadn‚Äôt put them there.

Tina exhaled sharply through her nose. ‚ÄúNope. Nope, I hate that.‚Äù



Chad, stepping inside at exactly the wrong moment, immediately sensed a disturbance.

‚ÄúSOMETHING IS OFF.‚Äù

Tina rubbed her eyes. ‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù

Chad pointed wildly toward the air. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a being here.‚Äù

Tina took a slow sip of coffee. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs Todd.‚Äù

Chad blinked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Who‚Äôs Todd?‚Äù

Barry gestured. Todd was sitting directly behind Chad.

Chad jumped. ‚ÄúHOLY‚Äî‚Äù

Todd did not flinch.

Chad squinted. ‚ÄúWait. Is that‚Ä¶ a raccoon?‚Äù

Tina crossed her arms. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Chad hesitated. He pointed again, less dramatically. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ is it?‚Äù

Barry smiled. ‚ÄúThat is an excellent question.‚Äù

Chad‚Äôs face twisted. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I hate that answer.‚Äù

Todd, perfectly still, flicked his little raccoon fingers.

A gum packet fell from the shelf.

Chad stared. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Okay, I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

Barry nodded approvingly. ‚ÄúGood choice.‚Äù



At 5:00 AM, Barry and Todd stood outside the Gas ‚Äôn Go, watching the sky lighten from inky black to deep, predawn blue.

Todd sat calmly, his tiny paws placed in front of him with the posture of a man who had just concluded a great work.

Barry crouched, meeting Todd‚Äôs gaze.

‚ÄúYou have learned well.‚Äù

Todd twitched his nose.

Your app is garbage. I can‚Äôt even log in half the time. Your EQBankStatus site claims everything‚Äôs fine, but surprise, I‚Äôm still locked out. And to make matters worse, Google flags your site as insecure‚Äîso now I‚Äôm supposed to trust my money with you? Sketchy, to say the least.

Let‚Äôs talk about that reloadable Mastercard. Who designed this thing? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure the goal was to make me feel broker than I am. Limited reload options, and every time I go to the store, I‚Äôm stuck reloading the damn thing in line like it‚Äôs 2005. Who even thought this was a good idea? Who‚Äôs the mastermind behind this? Honestly, the only thing more painful than this card is your customer service.

And the $500 withdrawal limit? Are you serious? Who withdraws less than $500 unless they‚Äôre paying for their coffee or grabbing a sandwich? If I‚Äôm pulling money out, it‚Äôs because I actually have a need for it‚Äînot for pocket change.

Now, refunds take forever to post? Are you kidding me? This isn‚Äôt a credit card, it‚Äôs a debit card. Visa debits are instant, so why am I waiting days for a refund? This is 2025, not the stone age. You‚Äôre literally making my day-to-day transactions a hassle.

Sure, you don‚Äôt charge NSF fees or FX fees, but everything else about your app is a pain in the ass. I get that you‚Äôve got a decent interest rate, but I can‚Äôt deal with this dumpster fire of a banking experience for much longer.

And let‚Äôs talk about your lack of a real credit card. Is EQ Bank a bank for youths who don‚Äôt know any better or immigrants who don‚Äôt have the standards to expect an actual banking product? I‚Äôm about one step away from jumping ship. RBC, PC Financial, or KOHO would be more than happy to take me back. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather deal with a bank that doesn‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm using dial-up internet to access my account.

EQ Bank, get your act together. If you want to keep me as a customer, impress me‚Äîbecause right now, you‚Äôre one step away from a full-on breakup.

Went again, oh you have yeast infection. No problem. But the itching came back. Slowed the discharge that did help. 

I stopped drinking coffee, lowered sugar and been morre serious about my water. Thinking it was due to coffee as it seemed to had exacerbated the itching. Then I became dry, and itchy and very painful to have sex. That scared me. I felt like my vagina was falling apart. They came back and said kidney infection and yeast. 

Then the yeast infection came out negative. So today, my Dr wanted to do the swab again. This time she looked up specific swabs for micro-organisms that are fungus but not common. With the first swab she looked for any signs of LS and didn't see any and said its yeast. This time knowing the test came back negative, she said if this next exam comes back negative we will have to do the biopsy and could be LS. She said that she saw whit patchiness from dry areas. 

The biopsy scheduled all the way in March. 
She said its inflammed and to start using steroid cream. I felt pretty upset. Like I Dont have answers and is this really happening to me. Can I even have sex? My partner and I rarely get time together and he'd flying in for a week for us to have intimacy time. 

My doctor said she didn't think this was menopause. If this is LS, and they do only steroid treatments whats the likely hood of have a successful sexual partnership? How did others husbands handle it? What treatment options are there that's not spoken about often enough? Is there such a thing called getting head of this disease? Thanks for any info.

If it is... 

That day you came for coffee, i TOLD you why. We discussed what you did..
You did what you did.. 
You made no effort to fix it until it was far too late. 
I WARNED YOU countless times.

I am sorry, but what we once had, there is a possibility there could have been more, maybe even a lot more..

You made your choices. 
I responded to them the best i could.
You decided i was being stubborn. You refused to even attempt to fix what you had done.

I wanted to try..

Even if i wasn't still hurt from what you did... 
Angry someone i trusted could do that to me. 
The fact that you couldn't even TRY to fix what you had done. 
Nothing. 
You JUST...
Tried justifying it.. 
Calling me stubborn. 
Maybe... if you had tried sooner to fix what you did or at least... make ammends somehow. 
Maybe.. we wouldn't be here like this now. 
Maybe.. we could have somehow worked to something more. 
I gave you chances... 
Many chances... more then i should have even... 
Even still that day at coffee... i didnt WANT to go but it seemed the only way i would get through to you..  You STILL were trying to justify.. what happened so long ago... 
No... no no no no NO! 
And you can stop with the phone calls... i KNOW  its you. 

I dont care WHAT you felt from me recently... My burdens are mine and mine alone when it comes to you. I will sort out my own issues and deal with my own emotions ALONE if i have to... I will live out my days in solitude if need be. It may not have been the romantic intimate love you desired... who knows maybe it would have grown i don't  doubt your words...  but you did things you DEFINITELY should not have... You lost the love i and trust i DID have for you. At this point you know as well as i do... i don't open up 2ce.

I graduated from my dream school with a B.A. in Political Science and a minor in Data Science with hopes of getting into policy research or any role in public service. I was part of a public service fellowship, interned for my state as a legislative researcher and worked as a research apprentice for a year. I also have two years of volunteer experience, over four years of experience with Microsoft suite, two years of experience programming with Python/R and a certified typing speed of 80 WPM. I also graduated with a GPA of nearly 3.7.

Since I graduated in May 2024, I have only managed to get 9 interviews and no offers. I have applied to countless internships, fellowships, full time positions, no prior experience entry-level jobs, temporary/non-benefitted positions and part time work just to even get anything and nothing has worked out. Last week I had an interview for a part-time temporary position I was overqualified for with my city as an administrative assistant that went very well and today I got an email saying I‚Äôm not selected for further review and it sent me over the edge. On top of this, I haven‚Äôt even heard back from retail positions who don‚Äôt call me back regardless of if I dumb down my qualifications or omit my education.

It feels like everything is a numbers game where my odds of winning are 0%. Every time I interviewed, I was given false hope only for it to be crushed with either ghosting or a rejection with no explanation. Even with my references from the state and faculty I‚Äôve worked with, I can‚Äôt get my foot into the door of any sort of employment. I can‚Äôt get unemployment because I have no paid work history (all of my experience is unpaid). I can‚Äôt afford to do unpaid work experience as I have virtually no savings after graduating. I also can‚Äôt afford to relocate as most job opportunities outside of my area don‚Äôt pay nearly enough to live where they‚Äôre based.

Worst of all, without a job I can‚Äôt have any hopes of moving out of my family‚Äôs house who constantly berate me for not having a job by now with my qualifications and making them disappointed. I‚Äôm also closeted to them and this has been putting a strain on my relationship with my boyfriend as keeping our relationship hidden is hard for both of us. Without any job, I have virtually no hopes of safely coming out to my family until I can be self-sustainable. 

I have applied to jobs in every related industry I could think of: legislative support, policy research, think tanks, county/state work, education, administrative support/clerical work, professional fellowships, research internships, nonprofit work, data entry and community outreach. I‚Äôm looking into working with a temporary agency my mentor from my state internship recommended me to apply to in a coffee chat last week. I‚Äôm also considering working as a substitute teacher, but I can‚Äôt even afford the fees to get a live scan because I haven‚Äôt worked in 8 months and my parents don‚Äôt seem too thrilled to pay the expenses. 

I feel so lost and I just needed to air out my frustrations and look for words of comfort from anyone. I‚Äôm so tired of job searching, and with the potential cuts to federal jobs I‚Äôm scared of the job market for my field becoming even worse because of the impending influx of government employees trying to find work. I‚Äôm going to have a coffee chat with the director of my state internship tomorrow to hopefully get some advice too, but I have little hope at this point.
