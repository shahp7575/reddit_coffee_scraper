What to do?,"So I already know I got MVP and my doctor also told me to reduced my coffee intake to only 1 cup per day. But for the past month was so engrossed to work that I inevitably increased my coffee from the usual 1 cup to 2 cups as I keep feeling better after taking coffee and do much work.

And now I have this weird feeling of feeling nervous or anxiety. It wasn't bad like before but kinda consistent, at the very least for few minutes when I'm definitely noticing it.

I have already taken my daily bisoprolol but can't shake this feeling.

I got an oximeter for the bpm and I have been getting 100bpm after taking my daily bisoprolol.

I know I'll definitely reduced my coffee from now on, but what should I do this with this weird nervous feeling in the chest?",1,1757917195.0,mitralvalveprolapse,0,1.0,False

Check the comments for the reading link.,"I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

**Read Link:** [**https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/**](https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/)

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.” 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn’t care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my 

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much 

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be- 

1/5 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…” 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably 

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.” 

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.” 

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like 

her could never satisfy you.” 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a 

gunshot. 

“What was that?” Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?” 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself. 

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-” 

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?” 

“It’s not what you 

think-” 

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!” 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock 

sympathy. “How cute.”

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?” 

The world spun. “You’re lying.” 

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting. 

Probably with our engagement announcement.” 

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-” 

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this 

worse.” 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

“Let go of me,” I whispered. 

“Sera-” 

“LET GO OF ME!” 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on 

the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper. 

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.” 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will 

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.” 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?” 

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?” 

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s 

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.” 

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!” 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!” 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how 

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

“Sera!” 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.” 

“Tell me.” 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.” 

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s 

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon 

Harbor!” 

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless 

family!” 

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver 

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold 

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow… 

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those 

people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!” ",1,1757917150.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

**Access to Vast Collection from Multiple Brands**

Shopping for ethnic wear online opens up a world of options that traditional brick-and-mortar stores simply can't match. You'll find everything from classic silk sarees and elegant lehengas to trendy fusion kurtas and contemporary sharara sets, all in one place. Online platforms bring together hundreds of designers and brands under a single digital roof, giving you access to collections from established fashion houses, emerging designers, and artisan communities across India.

The beauty lies in the sheer diversity - whether you're hunting for a heavily embroidered wedding outfit or a simple cotton kurta for daily wear, the options are endless. You can explore regional specialties like Banarasi silk from Varanasi, Chikankari from Lucknow, or Bandhani from Gujarat without traveling to these places. Many online stores like [THARANKA](https://www.tharanka.com) also feature exclusive collections that aren't available in physical stores, giving you access to unique pieces that help you stand out from the crowd.

**Convenient Shopping from Home**

Gone are the days of spending entire weekends hopping from store to store in crowded markets. Online ethnic wear shopping lets you browse through thousands of options while sipping your morning coffee or during a lunch break at work. You can take your time examining intricate embroidery details, reading fabric descriptions, and checking customer reviews without any sales pressure.

The convenience extends beyond just browsing - you can shop anytime, whether it's midnight or early morning. This flexibility is especially valuable during festival seasons when physical stores are packed with shoppers. You can also easily bookmark items you like, create wish lists for future purchases, and share options with family and friends for their opinions before making a decision.

**Better Price Comparisons and Deals**

Online shopping transforms you into a savvy bargain hunter. Within minutes, you can compare prices for similar items across multiple websites including [tharanka.com](http://tharanka.com), ensuring you get the best deal possible. Price comparison tools and browser extensions make this even easier, automatically showing you where the same or similar products are available at lower prices.

The digital marketplace is constantly buzzing with attractive offers - flash sales, seasonal discounts, festival specials, and clearance events. Many online stores offer exclusive discounts to their app users or email subscribers. You'll also find bundle deals where you can purchase matching accessories or complementary pieces at reduced prices. Cashback offers through digital wallets and credit card partnerships add another layer of savings that physical stores rarely match.

**Detailed Size Charts and Fit Guides**

One of the biggest advantages of reputable online ethnic wear retailers is their comprehensive size guides and fit information. Most quality websites provide detailed measurements for bust, waist, hips, and length, along with size charts specific to each brand since sizing can vary between designers.

Many platforms now include fit guides with model measurements and the sizes they're wearing in product photos, giving you a better idea of how the garment will look on your body type. Customer reviews often include fit feedback from real buyers, mentioning whether items run large, small, or true to size. Some advanced websites even offer virtual fitting tools or chat support with styling experts who can guide you toward the right size based on your measurements and preferences.",1,1757917056.0,u_tharanka,0,1.0,False

1nhe8qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LostSword/comments/1nhe8qu/what_is_the_purpose_of_life_here_it_is/,what is the purpose of life ? here it is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Chapter 1108
AHEM! Hello? Check, check… Is this on?
Hello out there! Come in, world… Ahem… I am Dr. Vegapunk, a humble genius scientist. While many of you will likely be shocked by what I have to say in this message, I assure you that it is the truth of this world!!!

Chapter 1109
Shaka: “Come now, Stella. You can’t just start this up out of nowhere.”
Hmm? What do you mean, Shaka?!
Shaka: “Surely the audience will need to be adequately prepared to hear it.”
You really think that’s necessary? Some intelligence agency will pick it up and it’ll spread across the world by the next day…
Shaka: “Are you certain about that? What if they manipulate the information?
Hrmm. A good point… So what do we do?
Shaka: “I’ll relay the signal through every naval base in the world and force them to output at maximum strength. The transponder snails can receive audio signals, but the visual transponder snails will take time in order to be set up for viewing. I suggest giving them an interval of one hour.”
One hour?! That seems long. So long, in fact, that it will give those who might not want this message heard the time to interfere with it.
Shaka: “Very well! Let us set the preparation period for the message to… ten minutes!!”
You hear that world?!!
…
Shaka: “The coffee will take ten minutes to brew.”
Then I won’t have time to drink it!!
Shaka: “I calculate the chances of jamming are exceedingly low.”

Chapter 1110
Shaka: “What is that, Stella?”
Hmm? Why, it’s the dream of all mankind: Vega Coffee!! One little speck of this stuff dropped in water, and you’ve instantly got nice, warm coffee!!
Shaka: ZRT “How many minutes left?”
It’s not like we’re on a strict timer. Let’s wait seven minutes or so and then we’ll begin. Not that anyone will be close enough to stop us if they wished.

Chapter 1112
Shaka: “I can’t help but notice you’re not drinking your Vega Coffee.”
It’s hot! I have a very sensitive tongue!! That’s mean, Shaka, you know that already.
Shaka: “Four more minutes, Stella.”
sip YEOW!!
Shaka: “Stella, there’s not much time left. Why not use thermoelectric elements to take the coffee’s heat and convert–” [dialogue cut off by other speech bubble]
…
Shaka: “One minute left, Stella.”
slurp I know!!

Chapter 1113
Well, it’s been such a short time that the coffee’s not even cool yet, but… Are they all set up with their video transponder snails by now, I wonder?
Shaka: “Thirty seconds to go, Stella.”
Pythagoras: “I feel a bit nervous knowing this is going all over the world.”
Video will one day connect the entire world. It will mean knowing and the discomfort of being known.
…
Can you all hear me? Test, test. Hello? This is Vegapunk. Hello, world. Come in, world!!
Shaka: “It’s a one-sided hijack of the waves, Stella.”
I know that! Well! In that case… let’s get this message started!!
…
I have committed two sins. Therefore, whether I am arrested or executed, I shall program this message to be broadcast when my heart stops beating. I want to make one thing very clear first. Whoever may have rendered their judgment unto me, I am not trying to convince you that their intent is evil. I will not apply the lavels of good and evil at all, in fact because I understand too little about him to begin with. What I am about to tell you is so preposterous, you might even burst into laughter. However, you all have the right to know. To make a long story short, the world as we know it, will sink into the sea!!

Chapter 1114
Now, speaking of the near future for me, assuming that the sensors I built are functioning correctly, in the days after I record this message, there should be a most remarkable earthquake that strikes the entire planet!! As a result of that, the sea should rise about one meter around the world, rendering some islands uninhabitable. Beaches around the world will be lost for good. If I am wrong in this prediction, feel free to disregard the rest of this message. If this has happened, however, you should heed my words very carefully! This particular earthquake is not exactly what I would call a natural phenomenon. In my own way, I only ever hoped for peace, but this was the root of my first sin. I dreamt of a source of endless, eternal energy… And in my desire to push the world forward into the future, I flew too close to the sun!! Allow me to explain just what it is that is happening to our world. From about 900 years ago to 800 years ago – a period of a century – there is a span of history that is completely and entirely blank. We call this the Void Century, because all records from this time were eliminated. The only means to know this lost piece of history is to find a message from the past in the form of ponegliffs scattered across the world and decipher its contents!! However, the World Government has made it a crime of the highest order to decipher the message of the ponegliffs. And despite being a member of the government myself, I broke the law. That was my second sin. Through the sheer tenacity of a group of excellent archaeologists, I inherited some texts and a number of ponegliffs, which I have deciphered and continued studying to the best of my ability. I regret none of this!! History, you see, tells a story… In other words, what I know is an incomplete story of that 100-year void!! It would be dishonest to fill the blanks with my own speculation, so I will leave you only with the verified truth!! The main character of this story was born into a kingdom with an impossibly advanced civilization, 900 years ago. Like the Sun God Nika spoken of in Elbaph legend, he fought with a body that stretched and contracted. His name was JoyBoy. And he was the very first man on this sea to be called a pirate!!

Chapter 1115
But as for why he was called a pirate, I have only read from a handful of ponegliffs, but what I found there was the record of a breathtakingly vast war. JoyBoy’s enemy…was the World Government of the present day!! More accurately, it was the precursor to the World Government, a provisional army put together by 20 kingdoms known as The Alliance!! You might say they had no other choice, so robust was JoyBoy’s faction!! Without knowing the spark that caused the war, I won’t say who was right or wrong, I’ll simply state that the two competing ideologies came head-to-head. As I mentioned earlier, for its time 900 years ago, the country of JoyBoy’s birth was a startlingly advanced civilization. And the weapons that were used over the course of this 100-year conflict appear to be impossible to re-create with the latest of modern science. Even I, a humble genius, cannot replicate them!! And therein lies the problem!!!
…
The Void Century came to a close with the defeat of JoyBoy… But not before leaving vast, permanent scars of war across the face of the world!!! The world is made up of a series of islands. Sailing between them is difficult, and many people never experience anything but their own culture at home!! But this shared understanding of the world does not necessarily apply to the world of a thousand years ago!! Because a cataclysm occurred during the Void Century, causing the world to sink once before!!! We are currently living on the pieces of a continent that existed long ago!!! The world of a millennium ago now slumbers unseen at the bottom of the sea!!! In fact, one can assume that in the past there were a number of continents we know nothing about. If the world were still the same as it was in the past, then the act of erasing 100 years of history would be simply unthinkable and impossible. However, it makes much more sense when you understand that the rise in sea level over that century was 200 meters!!! As for why the sea level rose so much during that century, it would be natural to assume the work of a sudden natural disaster, but I can state for a fact that this was a man-made disaster!!! If such a cataclysm were caused by natural forces, then the initial disaster would have spanned several centuries and inflicted slow but continual damage upon the world!! But by any measurement – climatology, geology, environmental and atmosphere science – this dramatic shift could not have happened within a single century!!! So the cause is something else. And when I detected the rise in worldwide sea levels the other day, I had my answer. I knew the cause and confirmed its existence!!! The Ancient Weapons that sank the world into the sea 800 years ago still exist today, and await the moment that they stir once again!! In other words, the vast war that arose during the Void Century, never came to an end!!!

Chapter 1116
Sadly, I owe you all my deepest apologies. But I need you to understand why!! I wanted to create the energy that would power the industry of the world to come. And though it is still incomplete, I have at last reached a practical stage of my life’s work, the Mother Flame, a fire that never goes out!! It is an energy source that will one day in the future enrich the lives of people all over the world!! Unfortunately, one little piece of that Flame has been stolen!! The fault of this lies entirely with me!!! Around two weeks after the theft of the Flame, the sky over Lulusia shone with a powerful light and the kingdom vanished without a trace, according to reports. After that was when I observed the first signs of worldwide earthquakes!! As a scientist, and with utmost pride in its development, I can tell you this… nothing but the Mother Flame could have created so much energy!! The flame that I created was used to activate an Ancient Weapon!! I know nothing about who might have carried this out, but the results speak for themselves!!! My actions have led, directly or indirectly, to the loss of many human lives!!! A fact that weighs most deeply upon my soul!! I am so sorry!!! I have inadvertently proven that the man-made disaster that once sank the world is possible again!!! In the past, there were three Ancient Weapons and JoyBoy attempted to preserve them for the future!! Why would he do that for such dangerous thing?! Have we not sunk far enough?! Who is the true evil here, and who fights the good fight?!! The day will come when all of the answers are laid bare!! And I warn you – that moment will happen when we reach the very precipice of the world’s drowning!!! The Void Century is still ripe with mystery!! However, there are some who have learned the truth!!! The King of the Pirates’ Crew!!! When they learned all of the true history, why did they drift apart without telling anyone? Why didn’t they act on it?!

Chapter 1120
zrk Someone once said that the voices of the past will be heard… History is told by the winners, and the loser at the bottom of the sea are so very faint… But the truth that was gleaned at the cost of so much sacrifice has at last been told to the world, just now…
…
I can only pray that this message has made it safely out to the world at large. It would be foolish to hear about a war 900 years in the past from only one side. History requires a multifaceted approach to understand entirely. If only I had more time on my side!! Alas! There are forces outside of my ability to stop. Twenty-five years ago, the pirate Gol D. Roger completed an unprecedented tour of the entire world. And what he and his crew heard zsst were likely the purest voices of the past. In conclusion, as I’m sure you’ve all surmised by now, my view of our future is thus!!!

Chapter 1121
One day, the memories of the Void Century will be recalled, and mark my words, that day is coming!!! The sinking of the world's continents was a man-made disaster brought about by weapons!! Weapons which, by someone's design, still exist today!!! The machinations of history and fate seem to insist upon the obliteration of those last descendants of rare races.
...
If the worst should come to pass, I want you all to take care of yourselves!! No matter what should happen, I believe in the intelligence of mankind!! I believe in science!!! zrshk--ger died 25 years ago!! Whitebeard died two years ago!! But the fall of these legends was merely the prologue of a new era!! And now!! These people who refuse to buckle under any and all suppression, they are the ones who are closest to the truth, ironically enough!!! zrpt Then again, perhaps it was Roger who sent them there. The person who winds up with it may not be the one JoyBoy desired!!! The fate of the world now rests zzsh in the hands of the one who finds it!!

I'm sure this is not an entirely gendered issue, but I'm not dating women.

Some ideas for guys and gals who struggle to find things to talk about:

1. Ask what kind of church they attend. This gives you a clue about their theological bent(or lets you know if they don't attend church regularly).

2. What do they like to do with their free time? If you know anything about any of what they list, follow that line of conversation.

3. What do they like about their church?

4. If they could live anywhere else, where and why?

5. What kind of food/restaurants do they like?

6. Where do they consider themselves politically? What are their thoughts on gay marriage, abortion, and recent events?

7. Do they have pets? Do they see themselves having pets in the future? (Good time to share pet pictures if you have any).

8. What did/are you studying in college, if that is or was part of your career?

9. What are your career plans? Do you like your job? Do you plan on staying where you are?

10. What are their opinions on theological topics that are important to you?

11. How many siblings do they have and do they want to replicate that family size?

12. What does their quiet time with God look like?

13. Do they volunteer with their church?

14. How close are they with their family?

15. What do they do to hang out with friends? Game? Go out?

16. What kinds of things do they/would they want to do on a date? Movie? Mini golf? Bowling? Coffee? Something else?

For everyone, I would recommend looking up therapeutic communication, which includes techniques such as asking open-ended questions, clarification, and empathy statements. It can sound a little goofy at first, but when you learn how to employ them in a way that comes naturally to you, it makes you a more enjoyable person to talk with and your conversation partner will feel more engaged.

Being chronically online has degraded modern conversation skills so that many are no longer comfortable chatting with others they don't know in person. Practice staying off your phone in public and saying hello to strangers, starting conversations in checkout lines, etc. Older ladies are great to practice when you first start, as they tend to be friendly and are often receptive to small talk and respond positively to compliments. Get used to talking to people you don't know and talking about things that matter. ",2,1757916311.0,christiandatingadvice,0,1.0,False

我一直想我和刘团长之间的事，认为自从2004年，他就没再来逗我玩了。我串联起了整个第2章《桃花劫》的故事（注，但还没有回忆出第1至3章的事），认为自己想明白了 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字。我一直对佛教的不见顶智（即上帝之眼）着迷，没想到刘团长用在我身上了。我觉得自己是个畜生，他那么大岁数了，快病死了，三番两次托人捎信让我去看他，而我像个活驴一样，无动于衷；自作孽，不可活！

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 肠梗阻 Ileus**

忽然，我感觉五脏六腑都在移动，身体里到处都是邪气乱窜。我小时候练过气功（参见第12章），对这种肢体的触觉幻觉不感觉奇怪，但这邪气发动的规模之大，程度之剧烈，让我震惊。我赶忙躺到了床上，以免晕倒。

我感觉到胸下出现一个隔截面（如插图10.2.1-A），上下不通气，胃肠不走动（注，现代医学称为肠梗阻）。我立刻调整呼吸，驱动真气沿着任脉向下冲击那个中截面。真气一接触那道截面，截面就溃散了。很快，那些邪气又变形重组，堵在胸口处（约在膳中穴，俗称中丹田）。我继续调整呼吸，用真气沿着任脉向下冲击堵在心窝处沉重阴冷的邪气。几分钟后，我打通了任脉，身体和胃肠的蠕动恢复了正常。我镇静下来后，心想：一时悸动，还真没遇见过；可不能再胡思乱想了！

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**10.2-2 大爆炸 Big Bang**

过了一会儿，我不介意刚才发生的事了，又开始自责：我可真不是个东西，这不是人干的事儿。突然，我又感觉全身都有异动，赶忙平躺在床上了，全身的肉都有轻微的凹凸跳动的现象。凹凸跳动的现象有些加剧了。从命门穴（后腰两肾处），各发射出一股电弧的感觉沿着体表皮肤，像似水纹一样扩散；两股电弧在前腹处相撞了。接着，全身都有大小多个电圈套着肢体和整个身体上下移动，像似在做CT检查扫描一样，但我在经历的是多个电圈上下移动扫描我的身体。两只胳臂和两条腿分别有多个小电圈在上下移动扫描。突然，全身各处涌起气伴随着电流，以比读秒快几倍的速度，向丹田（如插图10.2.1-B）汇集。聚集在丹田后，立刻就爆炸了。随着爆炸，那些碎片气扩散到了全身各处。

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

我高幸地想：哎呀！大爆炸，百脉震开！我小时候在气功书上看过这种现象的描写，会百脉皆开。可是，正在发生的事情和传说的不一样。几秒后，整个身躯，包括脸部的肉都有明显的凹凸式上下跳动的现象，像似沸腾了着的水面；我的全身各处都在沸腾和震动。我对自己说：“镇静！沉住气！别慌！” 全身凸凹跳动的现象持续了几秒后，渐渐地平息了。这时我在床上平躺着，关注着全身各处的异动。

散布在全身各处的气变得清凉，随着流动在数百处小范围内聚集，并伴有电流、阴冷、凸凹地跳动的病气（或邪气）的感觉。我意识到了这不是好现象！不是书里描写的舒服，凉爽。我感觉那些迷走性风湿气中几十股大的，不走经脉，而是径直地走向心脏，一边移动一边还在汇集。有几股迷走性风湿气移动得很快，比如说，厘米每秒。

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

我立刻紧张了，如果迷走性风湿气侵入心脏；心脏就是一团肌肉，若是这样怪异地颤抖，那不就是心肌梗塞吗！我小时候，听奶奶说过多次。她一次生气后，在外面树荫下睡着了。半梦半醒之间，她感觉像似有一股气流进了心脏。从那时起，她就患了心脏病。

保卫心脏，我立刻行动起来了，别的器官都管不了了。我开始用真气对离心脏近且移动速度快的迷走性风湿气进行攻击。好在，那些邪气流都很脆弱，一被真气碰到，就散了。很短的时间内，我就击溃了十几股迷走性风湿气流团。这时我发现，几股主要的风湿气移动得慢了，大部分风湿气不移动了。我镇静了下来。

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**注10.2.2 Note 10.2.2**

插图10.2.1-2源自古墨西哥，表明古代的美洲有和中国类似的真气理论（即针灸和气功理论，参见第12章）。插图10.2.1-4是公元七世纪，帕卡尔王（Lord Pacal，亦作金童，特拉洛克，狮子王））的灵棺盖板，刻画了他堕入地狱的前因后果。图上部显示十字架或金刚剑插入了帕卡尔王的腹部，表示他被十字架钉住了，病危了。图底部他的狮子头正处于一个火匣子里，表示帕卡尔王堕入了 “火途” （即地狱，精神病）。火匣子上面是他的神父的棺材，表示帕卡尔王是被 “他神父过世” 的信息打入地狱的。棺材里是空的，只留下了尸体爆炸后遗留下来的三块儿残渣（即三块佛骨舍利，人骨），表明帕卡尔王听到他神父过世的消息后，体内发生了爆炸，所以他堕入了地狱，即患了精神病。棺材上面显示，一根射精的阴茎可以提起棺材，表示帕卡尔王和翠玉女（即玉女）的事实婚姻是治疗他的疾病的正确方法，可以使他脱离地狱。

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 我投降了 I surrendered.**

我对刘团长对我做过什么感到迷惑；但我和他的矛盾是我不同意他的 “我卢岩是刘健君的丈夫” 的决定（参见8.2节《死不瞑目》）。我真气已经很少了（注，聚集和运送真气需要大量的体力和时间），可这时的我全身都是风湿气。我已经处于面对死亡的状态，投降了。

我跪在床上发誓： “刘健君是我的妻子；刘团长是我岳父；我会去追求她并和她结婚。” 我不断地叨咕着： “刘健君她爸是我的岳父，刘健君是我的媳妇。” 我知道誓言对人的思想有很强的统摄作用。这样出声地叨咕，有助于我集中思想和精力，对不让松散意识抵触和破坏我的主意识，消除心理矛盾大有好处。

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

我找出了我收藏的针灸经脉图。真气在经脉里会走得快，通畅和增强。我先在经脉图上筹划运气的路线，和打击风湿症的最短和最有力的角度，再运气发功对风湿症病处进行攻击。又击碎了几团风湿症后，我发现迷走性风湿症移动的速度变得更慢了。我沿着手少阴心经（如插图10.2.1-C）运气；用真气把心脏包裹了起来。这样，弱的迷走性风湿症不会有机会靠近心脏。

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

这时，我认为自己必须吃好睡好，保持健康，才能与全身的迷走性风湿症对抗。如果我的身体健康变差了，就可能什么时候患了风湿性心脏病，死不了也成了废人。我向妻子和孩子做了生死离别，没明说，她们也不懂。我害怕睡梦里自己不知道保护心脏，所以睡觉前，洗了热水澡来平衡全身的体温，以减少做梦。我躺在床上，调息收敛思想，然后熄灭了前意识，把心身的控制权交给了无意识（古作神识）（参考案例1.4《井阳之灾》）。佛经上说，这种状态，人的愈合力极强，等同神佛。

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense; reference case 1.4 Well-Sun Catastrophe). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**注10.2.3 Note 10.2.3**

前面三小节描述的病症在现代的医学中称作皈依失调（Conversion Disorder；如图10.2.3-1所示），是一种罕见的精神疾病。在随后几年与风湿症对抗的过程中，我不断地研究，现在认为此病是这样产生的。我从小就敬畏刘团长，想拜他为师（是一种连自己都不清楚知道的向往），第8章中，遇到刘健君后，更是对刘团长有了深刻的爱恨情仇。随后，我和刘团长的爱恨情仇又持续发展了六年，但我没见过他，所以在我的幻境中他就是一团白色迷雾。那迷雾是现量（参见11.4.5 识蕴 Sense Node），代表刘团长，是我对刘团长全部感情的和记忆的依附标的物。当我意识到他已经过世了，这信息被我的无意识（古作神识）接收到后，那团迷雾就消失了，因为无意识只处理现量，而刘团长不再是现量了。这样，我对刘团长的全部感情和记忆就失去了所依附的标的物，就引起了大混乱，产生了前文的“皈依失调症”。

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” (see 11.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

前面三小节描述的病症是癔症（古作鬼病）中的一种极端现象，称作圣鬼。插图10.2.3-2源自古墨西哥，是一位堕入地狱期间的特拉洛克（即金童）。雕像顶部是古墨西哥人对圣鬼的表述。雕像的正面，圣鬼正用许多代表迷走性风湿症的阴茎攻击特拉洛克。阴茎代表产生特拉洛克体内迷走性风湿症的原因是他和翠玉女（即玉女）的婚姻纠纷。插图10.2.3-3是佛教中的金刚降魔杵；其中（4）（8）（9）的顶端部是代表圣鬼的雕塑。圣鬼的本质是惭愧；面对刘团长，我总是惭愧，是罪人。

前面三小节描述 “死不瞑目”诅咒在我身上爆发的现象。后来我发现那和西方人所说的 “三个不可饶恕的诅咒” 的意义相同，知道了西方人所说的三个不可饶恕诅咒， “立毙咒，钻心咒，和夺魂咒” 正是对死不瞑目诅咒所产生的现象的描述。

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

Check it out: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en)

I’ve recently launched **The Sustainarian Tracker**, a privacy-friendly Chrome extension designed to help users track and reduce their digital carbon footprint in a way that’s actually personal and meaningful. Unlike most other extensions that rely on broad averages of human internet usage, this tool calculates emissions based on **your actual browsing behavior** across categories like streaming, social media, e-commerce, search engines, and more.

One of the key features I’m excited about is how it moves away from generic estimates and brings individual accountability into the picture. Your data stays on your device — no tracking, no remote servers, just actionable insights. The tracker shows your carbon emissions in real-time and breaks them down into understandable equivalents like car travel, cups of coffee, or grams of red meat consumed. Based on user feedback, I’ll soon be converting the emissions data from kilograms to **grams**, as this makes the environmental impact of your digital habits much clearer and more immediate.

To kick things off, I’m offering a special commitment for early adopters. For the **first 1,000 users**, I will be **planting 100 trees** — that’s **one tree for every 10 downloads**. This is my way of ensuring that this initiative starts off with tangible real-world impact.

I’ve also recently received a **small green innovation fund**, which I’m incredibly grateful for. It will help fuel upcoming improvements, including better emissions modeling, interactive comparisons, and potentially even gamified sustainability goals.

The extension is live now on the Chrome Web Store. If this sounds like something you’d find useful, I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback. This is just the beginning, and I’m building it to grow and improve based on real user needs and ideas.

I spend most of my time with family and recently got into collecting Pokémon cards with my nephew/godson—I’m officially hooked.  
My humor tends funny: deadpan, dry, and occasionally dark—people say they dig it (or at least they tolerate it). I take my coffee black, and I’d never say no to tacos.

I'm obsessed with Sudoku, love watching Cracking the Cryptic on YouTube, and enjoy reaction videos, puzzle games, and board games. I’m exploring anime and various TV shows—but I find them way more fun when watched with someone else.

# Who I'm Looking For:

* Around my age (36–40-ish), though I’m open if we click.
* Someone who writes more than one-word replies (bonus points for detailed, curious messages).
* Open‑minded, non‑judgmental, and genuine.
* Willing to share thoughts, photos, random curiosities, or just chat about your day.
* Flexible with time zones—location doesn’t matter as long as we make time.

# Shared Experiences I’d Love:

* Writing longer messages about daily life.
* Exchanging photos of things that catch our eye, funny memes, or whatever sparks joy.
* Watching anime, Cracking the Cryptic, reaction videos, or shows together—even if streamed separately, just chatting during it.
* Co‑op gaming or light puzzle challenges—if you’re into that!

# Why I’m Posting:

I crave connection. I used to have a best friend I met online, but time zones and life drifted us apart. I’d really love to find one or two people to build something similar with again. No pressure, no expectation—just seeing if sparks fly.

# ☕ Other Fun Facts:

* Coffee: black. 🌮 Tacos: yes.
* I know posting about “appearance” can feel superficial. I’m open to exchanging photos —only if you're comfortable.
* Platforms I usually prefer: Discord for messaging, but I’m happy to start chatting here to get things rolling.

Chapter 5: Arrow Battle Group.

The silence in ""the Pit,"" the subterranean heart of the Guard's fleet command, was a substance. It was dense and heavy, settling on shoulders like a leaden cloak and filling the lungs with every breath. It even muffled the quiet, vibrational hum of the life support systems, as if the bunker itself were holding its breath in nervous anticipation. One hundred and twenty hours had passed since Admiral Marcus, with the weight of an entire species on his shoulders, had given the order to form it. One hundred and twenty unbearably long hours since the nightmare known as the Plague had taken root in the Proxima Centauri system—humanity's closest stellar neighbor.

The news had not arrived in the form of a sterile report or a broken code. It had struck them with the brutality of a sledgehammer, through the raw, merciless images from long-range optical sensors. Images that would forever be seared onto the eyelids of everyone who saw them. The geometry of the cities on Proxima b was no longer a dead grid of streets—it pulsed, swelled, and spilled over in an unnatural, oncological growth. Ships orbited the planet, nightmarish echoes of the scouts encountered eight years ago in the Kuiper Belt, but now larger, more powerful, and dripping with menace.

Thermal analysis of the fifty-seven enemy units had identified four whose energy signatures screamed a threat. According to Earth's nomenclature, they were battleships, their mass estimated at over fifty-five thousand tons each. The image, delayed by four years, two months, and twelve days, also revealed an extensive base on the planet's surface—essentially a small city with a distinct industrial backbone. It had been built on the dark side of the globe, perpetually facing away into the black, which protected the structures from the flares of the parent star and its deadly X-ray radiation.

The question of why the Plague had chosen this hell remained unanswered for a long time. Proxima b, though technically within the ecosphere, was constantly swept by stellar wind and radiation—a place where life as we know it could not have arisen. The answer came only after a precise analysis of the entire system. The gravitational dance of the two larger stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, prevented the formation of stable planetary orbits in their vicinity. The only anchor in this cosmic chaos was the distant Proxima, orbiting the central pair once every five hundred thousand years. The Plague had used what the universe gave it.

Admiral Marcus stood by the main holoprojector, as rigid as a statue carved from fatigue and granite. His face, illuminated by the cool glow of the tactical map, was that of a man who had not known peaceful sleep for a long time. Only his fingers, nervously tapping a silent rhythm on his epaulet, betrayed the inner storm. On the three-dimensional map, hundreds of luminous icons—the most powerful ships in Earth's history—were finishing their formation at the L4 Lagrange point. This ballet of leviathans, suspended between the gravitational embraces of Earth and the Moon, had been marked by chaos from the beginning. Bureaucratic inertia, political squabbles, and logistical nightmares had cost them precious hours. Every minute of delay was like a drop of acid on the already taut thread of hope.

""Admiral,"" the precise, emotionless voice of Commander Hanako Tanaka cut through his thoughts. ""The last three 'Hammer'-class destroyers have reported at the assembly point. The formation is complete.""

Marcus exhaled, but relief did not come. His eyes scanned the sea of lights. Each point represented unimaginable power, but to him, it was above all a potential steel coffin for hundreds of souls. He thought of the pilots, permanently integrated with their fighters, submerged in amber nutrient gel, their minds expanded into the combat systems of their machines. They had become something more, and yet something less, than human—living weapons whose suffering was hidden deep within a metal shell.

""Commander, give me the final summary. I want to hear the numbers. To feel their weight.""

Hanako's voice remained dispassionate, as if she were reading a stock market report. That matter-of-factness was an anchor in an ocean of uncertainty.

""Yes, Admiral. The Arrow Battle Group consists of:

Fourteen transport ships, each with a tonnage of two hundred thousand tons, carrying fourteen brigades of Guard Infantry. A total of seventy thousand soldiers.
Three 'Hegemon'-class carriers, each with a mass of one hundred and eighty thousand tons, carrying a total of three hundred and sixty 'Raven' multi-role fighters.
Nine upgraded 'Thor'-class battleships, each with a tonnage of forty-five thousand tons.
Twenty-seven 'Warlord'-class cruisers, each with a displacement of twenty-seven thousand tons. Among them is Rear Admiral Volkov's upgraded flagship, the 'Ivan the Terrible,' with a tonnage of twenty-five thousand tons.
Eighty-one 'Hammer'-class destroyers, at twelve thousand tons each.
""A total of one hundred and thirty-four ships, Admiral. The largest armada ever assembled by humanity.""

Marcus nodded, feeling a cold shiver. Power capable of turning continents to dust. But was it enough to face an enemy that devoured worlds?

""Estimated travel time?"" he asked, though he knew the answer by heart. Every digit was like a nail.

""At a speed of point-five light speed, the journey to Proxima Centauri will take the fleet eight point four years of objective time. Due to time dilation, just over seven years will pass for the crews. The round-trip mission, assuming an immediate return, is sixteen point eight Earth years and over fourteen years for the crew.""

This wasn't a mission. It was an exile. A theft of time. The children they were saying goodbye to would be adults they wouldn't recognize. Parents would pass away, their graves overgrown with grass. If they returned, they would be ghosts haunting the lives that once belonged to them.

""The estimated departure time is in approximately twelve hours. The total delay will amount to sixty hours,"" Hanako concluded.

Sixty lost hours. Marcus clenched his jaw.

""Very well, we proceed,"" his voice was hard as steel. ""It's time to exterminate the pests in our stellar backyard.""

At the same time, in a sterile, windowless cabin on one of the transport ships, Kael and Lyra stood staring at the flickering holograms displayed by their smartwatches. The time for goodbyes, stretched to its breaking point by successive delays, had become a form of psychological torture.

In the image, their father, Aris, stood beside their mother. His face, usually as stern as a military regulation, was a mask of pain he was trying in vain to maintain. Their mother wept silently, her body trembling almost imperceptibly. They had already said everything. Now only a heavy silence remained, punctuated by the static of the transmission, which made their parents look like apparitions from another world.

Seeing their despair, Kael felt a cold determination build within him—a shield against the wave of sorrow. He focused on the dormant nanites in his bloodstream, cold and patient. He had to be the one to end this agony.

""We'll be back,"" he said, his voice sounding unnaturally firm.

""We promise,"" Lyra whispered, a desperate strength trembling in her voice.

The promise hit Aris with the force of a blow. He closed his eyes, and a single tear traced a path down his cheek.

Kael retreated into the only thing he had left—the cold logic of protocol.

""Mom, Dad... we have to go. Preparations for the Higgs drive startup, procedures... you know.""

It was a lie, a shield of ash in his mouth, and they all knew it. There were twelve hours until departure, which for them marked the beginning of a journey into the unknown.

""We love you,"" their mother whispered as her image began to flicker.

""We love you too,"" Lyra replied.

The holograms vanished.

Kael looked at his sister. In her eyes, he saw the reflection of his own fear.

""I have one more call to make. Please, leave.""

As the door hissed shut behind Lyra, Kael activated another call. Blanca appeared in the hologram, at her company, surrounded by energy and life.

""Hey, honey.""

""Kael, are you leaving already? I heard it's in less than twelve hours.""

""Yeah, we're getting ready,"" he repeated the same lie. He felt the cold dance of the nanites under his skin. ""That's not what I wanted to talk about, Blanca. I love you. I'm saying it now because there most likely won't be another chance. The odds of surviving the assault... they're slim.""

There was no shock in her eyes, only a deep, penetrating sadness.

""You will come back, Kael. And so will your sister. Remember, you promised me coffee.""

He fell silent, feeling the words catch in his throat.

""I'll wait patiently,"" she continued. ""I'll be fifty-nine then, and I'm counting on a cappuccino. And if by some miracle I don't make it, know that this past year was the happiest of my life. Our love never stood a chance, we both knew that. You—almost immortal. Me—a mortal woman. But that doesn't change anything. I want to fall in love with you in the next life. I love you too."" Her gaze became hard, almost commanding. ""And now I have one order for you: survive and come back for that coffee, my poor, lost little soldier.""

She ended the call before he could answer. Always to the point. She had left him with an order, not a farewell. With a mission, not a void.

The hangar of the carrier ""Attila"" was shrouded in twilight. The air smelled of ozone and cold metal. A ""Raven"" fighter, with a rose painted on its fuselage, stood connected to its support systems. Its pilot, Kalim Al-Farsi, was resting in a simulation. Technician Edgar Winter and his team approached the machine.

""Hey, Axel,"" Winter said, using the pilot's call sign. ""Woke you up to tell you everything's okay. We're securing you for the trip.""

A crackle came from the fighter's speakers, followed by a distorted but human voice.

""What trip?""

""Ah, right. We're going to Proxima Centauri. There's a Plague base there. Supposedly they have ground-based shipyards. Seventy thousand of ours will be taking them. The images from four years ago showed fifty-seven ships in orbit. It's going to be a big one.""

A long silence followed, during which Al-Farsi's consciousness, extended into the fighter's systems, processed the data.

""Thanks for the info. And thanks for treating me like a person.""

""Cut the crap, Axel,"" Winter replied gruffly, placing a hand on the machine's cold armor. ""My brother was a loyalist in the US Army, spent three years in a Guard prison. He only got out so fast because I vouched for him. I know what you did. I know that in that moment, you were saving your subordinates. That Guardsman, if he had gotten up after his nanites regenerated, would have fried you all with his plasma rifle. There's no denying it. I respect you for that, Kalim. You protected them, and I'm going to protect you. Your mechanical body will be one hundred percent operational when the battle starts. Remember that.""

""Thanks, Winter,"" Axel's voice was calmer now. ""Switch me to combat simulation. Time to train.""

""Sure. What interval?""

""A week of training, then two weeks of the beach and family. Set up a loop like that, please.""

Winter entered the commands. He knew the simulation of a paradise beach was the anchor that kept Axel's humanity tethered to this metal body.

""I'll wake you up every week for a report. Hang in there in that tank.""

It was a human joke, one that Al-Farsi needed. It gave him hope that he wasn't just a limbless torso in nutrient gel. He was a pilot. He was a soldier. He was Axel. And a war lay before him.

**10.1 刘团长的死讯 News of Liu’s Death**

二零一一年五月，我到高德联合公司（Golder Associates Inc.）的实验室工作。高德是家上市了的国际性岩土工程公司。我只在实验室里工作，不下工地，接触的人少。实验室的经理玛丽的名字很长，我不能拼读。在面试我时，她同意我称呼她玛丽（Mary）。她来自一个我不知道在哪里的国家。她再次解释；我还是想不出来，就不好意思再问了。工作一段时间后，我发现人们称呼她玛丽亚、罗密欧什么的，再次问应该怎么称呼她。她回答她的生活里就这样，不同的人叫她不同的名字，习惯了。我常观察她，她是个标准健壮的欧洲血统白人，行为端庄得体，传统西方人的世界观，性格不紧不慢，没有地方口音，没有民族和地域的特质；我分析不出她来自何方。

开始的两个月还好，可工作中，我又接触到了达弗罗克（Davroc）和大佛印（Dufferin）公司的人和业务，渐渐的我的觉思失调症又成长起来了。我和同事之间有了矛盾，对黑社会的担心越来越重。刘健君研究灵魂转世，雇佣黑社会的人，黑社会的人办事不成，丢了面子，或者什么人矜持不住了，就可能出现谋杀事件。

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

一天的喝咖啡休息时间，听同事们在唠嗑。事后，不知为什么，我回忆起了玛丽讲她开会时看的录像。刘健君回答桫椤派去调查我的人：“卢岩心理的社会环境和别人不一样。他念研究生的时候，他同屋那个人是我爸爸安排的。他们就一起骗他；他就信了。”

调查的人问：“现在你爸爸在哪儿？”

刘健君回答：“死了！我爸爸做的事儿与我没有关系。那时我不在国内，我在美国读博士呢！”

调查的人问：“那你为什么不告诉卢岩？”

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

刘健君回答：“我爸说，卢岩很犟。他不亲眼看见，谁告诉他，他都不信，就只能是别人在他旁边唠嗑，或者路上的人唠嗑，他听见了，就想。一点儿点儿地，他想明白了，就没事儿了。”

调查的人问：“你爸爸想让卢岩干什么？”

刘健君回答：“他说我这辈子命运中没有丈夫，除了卢岩，别人都不行。说我不是他的女儿，卢岩是他的儿子。他就想让我和卢岩结婚。我爸说，看不见我和卢岩结婚，他死不瞑目。你看，我不迷信，不信这个。”

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

我回忆起来玛丽亚所说的话之后，感觉奇怪：如果这是我以前想过的事，想象与现实混淆了，那不应该有我根本不知道的事。我回忆起了本书第2章中《桃花劫》的故事，是我妈妈给我讲的。她不记得 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字了。那玛丽亚说的这八个字是从哪里来的（注2）！？而且玛丽说的是英语，她的用词和我英语用词的习惯根本不一样。我回忆、分析刘团长已经五、六年没对我做过什么了，认为他真的已经过世了。

我认为刘团长真的早就过世了，心情很不好，两三天里像似病了一样。我怀疑刘健君收买了我的妻子，并委托人照顾我的孩子，我总发现他们在变化。

注10.1-2，环境形成后，相关的语言就会出现。在前文第2章，我两岁时听这样的词当然不理解，记忆也很少，但这时有了相关的环境，这词就冒出来了。

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

Check it out: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en)

I’ve recently launched **The Sustainarian Tracker**, a privacy-friendly Chrome extension designed to help users track and reduce their digital carbon footprint in a way that’s actually personal and meaningful. Unlike most other extensions that rely on broad averages of human internet usage, this tool calculates emissions based on **your actual browsing behavior** across categories like streaming, social media, e-commerce, search engines, and more.

One of the key features I’m excited about is how it moves away from generic estimates and brings individual accountability into the picture. Your data stays on your device — no tracking, no remote servers, just actionable insights. The tracker shows your carbon emissions in real-time and breaks them down into understandable equivalents like car travel, cups of coffee, or grams of red meat consumed. Based on user feedback, I’ll soon be converting the emissions data from kilograms to **grams**, as this makes the environmental impact of your digital habits much clearer and more immediate.

To kick things off, I’m offering a special commitment for early adopters. For the **first 1,000 users**, I will be **planting 100 trees** — that’s **one tree for every 10 downloads**. This is my way of ensuring that this initiative starts off with tangible real-world impact.

I’ve also recently received a **small green innovation fund**, which I’m incredibly grateful for. It will help fuel upcoming improvements, including better emissions modeling, interactive comparisons, and potentially even gamified sustainability goals.

The extension is live now on the Chrome Web Store. If this sounds like something you’d find useful, I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback. This is just the beginning, and I’m building it to grow and improve based on real user needs and ideas.

Hey Maximizame crew,

Been thinking about this idea of ""upgrading"" your life. It sounds so massive, right? Like you have to tear everything down and start over. But what if **Version 2.0** isn't a total rewrite, but a series of tiny, daily patches?

That's where the magic of **Micro-Hacks** comes in.

These aren't huge, life-altering commitments. They're the opposite. They're small, almost laughably simple actions that, when done consistently, create massive change over time. It’s about building momentum so small you can't fail.

Here are a few I've been playing with, separating them into happiness and productivity (but we all know they're connected).

**For Productivity:**

*   **The Two-Minute Rule:** If a task pops into your head and you know it'll take less than two minutes to do... just do it. Don't write it down, don't schedule it. Just get it done. The mental clarity this creates is insane.
*   **The ""One Thing"" Focus:** Before you dive into emails and the chaos of the day, decide on the *one* critical thing that will make today a win. Write it on a sticky note and put it on your monitor. That's your North Star.
*   **The 5-Minute Shutdown:** At the end of your workday, spend five minutes just tidying your desk, closing unused tabs, and jotting down your top priority for tomorrow. It signals to your brain that the day is *done*, helping you properly switch off.

**For Happiness:**

*   **Morning Sunlight:** Before looking at your phone, just get 60 seconds of sunlight on your face. Stand by a window, step onto a balcony. Just feel the warmth. It's a natural mood and energy booster.
*   **Gratitude Snippet:** While your coffee is brewing or you're brushing your teeth, think of one, super-specific thing you're grateful for. Not just ""my family,"" but ""the way my dog rested his head on my foot this morning.""
*   **Connection Ping:** Send one text to a friend or family member with zero agenda. No asking for anything, just a ""thinking of you"" or a funny meme. It's a tiny deposit into your social well-being bank.

Let's be real, though. Sometimes the biggest hurdle isn't knowing *what* to do, but feeling too overwhelmed or emotionally drained to even start with the smallest hack. I was stuck in that loop for a while, and I found that having a structured way to work through the emotional side of planning was a game-changer. For anyone feeling similarly, I got a lot out of **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**. It really helped me build a foundation so these micro-habits could actually stick.

1nhdmwh,https://i.redd.it/8q5qn3d1n9pf1.png,Healing After a Breakup | The elevator pinged softly as I stepped into the sleek,"Chapter 1

Chapter 1: The Fall of Dreams

The elevator pinged softly as I stepped into the sleek, high-rise lobby of Ryan’s Beverly Hills office building, clutching my homemade chocolate cake tighter to my chest. My heart raced—a mix of excitement and anticipation. Tonight was Ryan’s birthday, and I couldn’t wait to celebrate with the man I thought was the love of my life.

I glanced down at the cake, its creamy chocolate frosting glistening under the fluorescent lights. I’d spent hours crafting it, hoping it would make this night unforgettable. As I walked toward the reception desk, I pulled out my phone and texted Ryan: Happy Birthday, can’t wait to see you!

“Miss Taylor, isn’t it?” The receptionist greeted me warmly, standing up from her desk. “Mr. Mitchell mentioned you’d be coming. Please, go right up. His private lift is just down the hall.”

I smiled, feeling a flutter of nerves mingled with excitement. “Thank you.”

As I made my way to the elevator, my mind wandered to all the possibilities of the evening—the look in Ryan’s eyes when he saw the cake, the quiet dinner we’d share afterward, the way he’d hold me close and tell me how much I meant to him. Three years together, and I still felt like I was walking on air whenever he was near.

The elevator doors opened onto Ryan’s penthouse office, the space bustling with activity despite the late hour. His company never slept, always chasing the next big deal, the next innovation. I moved through the busy room, exchanging smiles with some of the familiar faces, but my eyes were fixed on the closed door of his private office. A warm glow emanated from beneath it, inviting me to what I hoped would be a romantic celebration.

I took a deep breath, smoothed my dress, and pushed through the door with a soft knock. “Ryan, sweetheart, I—”

The words died in my throat as I froze, my eyes locking onto the scene before me. Ryan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, but he wasn’t alone. In his arms was Natalie Brooks, his executive assistant, her red lipstick smudged and her blouse askew. They were locked in an embrace that spoke of more than just a professional relationship.

For a moment, time seemed to slow. My heart pounded in my ears, a roaring that drowned out all other sound. The cake slipped from my grasp, hitting the marble floor with a loud crash, the sound echoing through the room like a gunshot.

Ryan turned, his eyes widening as he took in the scene—me, the shattered cake, the devastation etched across my face. For a moment, he looked like he might say something, but then his expression hardened, and the warmth I’d grown accustomed to was replaced by a cold indifference.

“Madison,” he said, his voice steady but devoid of any real emotion. “We need to talk.”

I stood there, rooted to the spot, unable to move or speak. The betrayal cut deep, and for a moment, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. How could he do this? After everything we’d shared, after the promises we’d made to each other, how could he just stand there and look at me like this?

“What… what is this, Ryan?” I finally managed to whisper, my voice trembling.

He sighed, stepping away from Natalie, who stood silently, her eyes fixed on me with a mixture of defiance and contempt. “It’s over, Madison. I’ve moved on.”

I shook my head, refusing to believe what I was hearing. “No, this can’t be happening. Not like this. We’ve been together for three years, Ryan. Three years!”

“Three years,” he repeated, his tone dismissive. “It was fun while it lasted, but… you were never enough for someone like me.”

His words hit me like a slap to the face. Never enough? After all I’d done for him, after all the sacrifices I’d made for our relationship, he could say that to me?

I felt tears stinging my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. Not here. Not in front of him. “How could you do this to me?” I whispered, my voice breaking.

He shrugged, glancing at Natalie, who smirked and leaned into him. “You’re just… not on my level, Madison. Natalie understands the world I’m part of. She’s sophisticated, ambitious, and she doesn’t make me feel like I’m settling for something less.”

My hands clenched into fists at my sides as Natalie stepped forward, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “Don’t take it personally, honey. You were just a phase. Ryan’s future is with someone who can keep up with him, not some naive little girlfriend from the middle class.”

The words were like daggers, each one piercing deeper than the last. I could feel the weight of their betrayal pressing down on me, the pain almost unbearable. But as I stood there, surrounded by the wreckage of my dreams and the cold, unfeeling gaze of the man I’d loved, something inside me began to shift.

I wouldn’t break. I wouldn’t let them see me fall apart. With a final glance at Ryan and Natalie, I turned and stormed out of the office, leaving behind the remnants of the life I’d thought I’d built.

Chapter 2

I sat cross-legged on my apartment floor, staring at the crushed cake box I'd thrown against the wall. Chocolate smears decorated the cardboard like abstract art—a perfect metaphor for my shattered life. Three years. Three years of loving Ryan Mitchell with everything I had, only to discover I was 'just a phase.' Just a comfortable placeholder while he built his empire.

My phone trembled in my hand as I dialed his number for the fifth time. Straight to voicemail. Again.

""Ryan, please,"" I whispered after the beep, hating the desperation in my voice. ""We need to talk about this. Three years together... don't I deserve at least a conversation?""

I ended the call and hurled my phone onto the couch. It bounced off and clattered to the floor, screen illuminating with a photo of us in Malibu last summer. His arm around my waist, both of us laughing into the camera. Had he been sleeping with Natalie even then?

The apartment felt suddenly foreign—this place I'd decorated to match Ryan's modern aesthetic rather than my own eclectic taste. The sleek furniture he'd helped me choose, the minimalist art he'd approved. Even the damn espresso machine I'd learned to use just because he preferred his coffee that way.

I stumbled to the bathroom and stared at my reflection. Mascara tracks mapped the journey of my tears down my cheeks. My hair, which I'd carefully styled for his birthday surprise, hung limp around my face.

""Who even are you?"" I whispered to my reflection.

A woman who had poured herself into a man who saw her as disposable. A woman who had dimmed her own light to make his shine brighter. A woman I no longer recognized—or respected.

Something hardened inside me then. A seed of determination taking root beneath the devastation.

I spent the night drafting my resignation letter. My marketing job at Carson Media had never challenged me—it was just convenient, close to Ryan's office, with flexible hours that allowed me to be available whenever he needed me. I'd stayed comfortable, stagnant, building someone else's dream instead of chasing my own.

No more.

At 8 AM sharp, I walked into my boss's office, resignation letter in hand.

""Effective immediately,"" I said, my voice steadier than it had been in days.

My phone rang as I cleared out my desk. Mom. I braced myself before answering.

""Madison? Are you alright? You never call this early on a workday.""

""I quit my job,"" I said without preamble. ""And Ryan and I are over.""

Silence hummed across the line. Then, ""Oh, sweetheart. What happened?""

I told her everything, my voice breaking only once as I described the scene in Ryan's office. The cake. Natalie's smirk. His cold dismissal.

""I'm coming home, Mom. To Seattle. I need... I need to start over.""

""Madison,"" my mother's voice was gentle but concerned. ""I support you, you know I do. But are you sure quitting your job is the right move? Especially now?""

""I've already applied for a position at ThompsonTech,"" I said. ""That startup I told you about? They're doing incredible things with their marketing approach. It's entry-level, but—""

""Entry-level? After five years in the industry?""

""It's a fresh start,"" I insisted. ""A chance to build something that's mine. To prove I'm more than just Ryan Mitchell's ex-girlfriend.""

A week later, I stepped off the plane into Seattle's familiar gray drizzle. The rain felt cleansing, washing away the last remnants of Los Angeles and the life I'd built there.

ThompsonTech's offices occupied three floors of a renovated warehouse in South Lake Union. Industrial chic with exposed brick and pipes, nothing like the sterile glass and chrome of Mitchell Enterprises. The energy was palpable—people hurrying between desks, animated conversations spilling from conference rooms.

""Welcome to the madhouse,"" Mr. Thompson himself greeted the small group of new hires. He wore jeans and a company hoodie, his enthusiasm infectious as he outlined his vision for the company. ""We're building something revolutionary here. Each of you is part of that revolution.""

As we toured the marketing department, I noticed a man watching me from across the open workspace. Tall, with thoughtful eyes and a quiet presence that somehow stood out amid the chaos. When our eyes met, he offered a small, sympathetic smile that suggested he somehow understood exactly what I was running from.

I looked away quickly, unprepared for the warmth that simple gesture sparked. I was here to rebuild myself, not to notice kind smiles from strangers. But as orientation continued, I found my eyes drifting back to him, wondering who he was and why his smile felt like the first genuine thing I'd encountered in weeks.

Little did I know that Jake Harrison would become far more important to my story than I could possibly imagine.

Chapter 3

Two weeks into my new position at ThompsonTech, I found myself crammed into what the team affectionately called the 'Idea Nook'—a glorified closet with a whiteboard and barely enough room for six people to breathe. The space felt claustrophobic, but there was something energizing about it too, like we were conspirators plotting a revolution rather than marketers brainstorming campaign ideas.

I sat wedged between a UX designer named Priya and the quiet man I'd noticed on my first day—Jake Harrison, who I'd learned was a data analyst recently transferred to our department. He hadn't said much during the meeting, but I'd caught him watching me several times with those thoughtful eyes that seemed to see right through my carefully constructed facade.

""We need something disruptive for the EcoSmart launch,"" Priya sighed, tapping her marker against the whiteboard covered in rejected concepts. ""Something that doesn't scream 'we're trying too hard to be relevant.'""

While the team debated hashtag strategies, I found myself doodling on a coffee-stained napkin. The image forming under my pen was a funnel diagram, but not the traditional marketing funnel I'd been taught to follow at Carson Media. This was something different—a system that inverted the usual approach, starting with micro-community engagement before expanding outward.

""What's that?""

I looked up to find Mr. Thompson peering over my shoulder, his eyes fixed on my napkin sketch. I hadn't even noticed him enter the cramped space.

""Oh, just thinking out loud,"" I said, suddenly self-conscious. ""It's a reversed engagement funnel. Instead of casting a wide net and narrowing down, we start with highly engaged micro-communities and let them amplify our message organically.""

The room had gone quiet. I pushed the napkin toward him, my heart racing. ""See, we identify key micro-influencers in the sustainability space—not celebrities, but everyday advocates with authentic followings. We create challenges specific to their communities, then connect those communities through a larger narrative.""

Mr. Thompson picked up the napkin, studying it with intense focus. The silence stretched uncomfortably.

""This is exactly the kind of thinking we need,"" he finally said, his face breaking into a grin. ""Fresh, unconventional, authentic.""

He turned to the room. ""Everyone, meet Madison Taylor, our new junior marketing coordinator.""

Junior marketing coordinator? I'd been hired as an assistant.

""But I've only been here two weeks,"" I stammered.

""And in two weeks you've shown more innovative thinking than people who've been here two years,"" he replied, tapping my napkin. ""I trust my gut, and my gut says you're exactly what this team needs right now.""

I felt a flush of pride warm my cheeks—a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time. From across the table, Jake gave me a small nod of approval, the corner of his mouth lifting in that quiet smile that somehow felt more genuine than any of Ryan's grand gestures ever had.

The promotion felt like the first real victory since my world had imploded in Ryan's office. A small step toward reclaiming myself.

But my celebration was short-lived. Three days later, crisis struck.

""VitalGreen is threatening to pull their account,"" Mr. Thompson announced during our emergency meeting. The conference room crackled with tension—VitalGreen was our biggest client, and losing them would be devastating for the fledgling company.

""Their CEO saw the preliminary campaign concepts and said they're 'too safe,'"" he continued, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. ""We have twenty-four hours to convince them we can deliver something revolutionary.""

The team erupted into panicked suggestions. I sat quietly, my mind racing through possibilities, when suddenly the answer clicked into place.

""What about a midnight social media stunt?"" I said, my voice cutting through the chaos. All eyes turned to me.

""We approach Leila Chen—that eco-blogger with the cult following. She posts a flash poll challenging her followers to share their most creative sustainable hacks. We tie it to VitalGreen's mission statement about everyday innovation.""

Skeptical glances circulated around the table.

""It's almost 6 PM now,"" Jake pointed out, though his tone was more curious than dismissive. ""How would we coordinate something like that by midnight?""

""I know Leila,"" I said, surprising myself with my confidence. ""We featured her in a campaign at my old job. I can call her right now.""

Mr. Thompson studied me for a long moment. ""Do it,"" he finally said. ""The team will follow your lead on this one, Madison.""

As everyone filed out, Jake lingered behind. ""Bold move,"" he said quietly. ""Need any help?""

I looked up at him, noticing for the first time the flecks of gold in his brown eyes. ""Actually, yes. I could use someone good with data to help track engagement metrics in real-time.""

""I'm your guy,"" he said simply.

I didn't know it then, but that night would change everything—not just for VitalGreen's campaign, but for my future at ThompsonTech... and perhaps for my heart as well.

I mostly try to avoid UPF at home, though do have small amounts from chocolate/occasional takeaways. 

I was unsurprised by the almost-immediate side effects of bad skin and bloating, but I also experienced an acute bout of anxiety - I haven't had this in a long while, but after 1-2 days in the US I was feeling very anxious, unsettled and jittery. The only thing I can possibly chalk this up to is my UPF intake as I otherwise had a relaxing time.

Check it out: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-sustainarian-tracker/nffgedlgbnilggenlpopjnpnghhbjmkn?authuser=0&hl=en)

I’ve recently launched **The Sustainarian Tracker**, a privacy-friendly Chrome extension designed to help users track and reduce their digital carbon footprint in a way that’s actually personal and meaningful. Unlike most other extensions that rely on broad averages of human internet usage, this tool calculates emissions based on **your actual browsing behavior** across categories like streaming, social media, e-commerce, search engines, and more.

One of the key features I’m excited about is how it moves away from generic estimates and brings individual accountability into the picture. Your data stays on your device — no tracking, no remote servers, just actionable insights. The tracker shows your carbon emissions in real-time and breaks them down into understandable equivalents like car travel, cups of coffee, or grams of red meat consumed. Based on user feedback, I’ll soon be converting the emissions data from kilograms to **grams**, as this makes the environmental impact of your digital habits much clearer and more immediate.

To kick things off, I’m offering a special commitment for early adopters. For the **first 1,000 users**, I will be **planting 100 trees** — that’s **one tree for every 10 downloads**. This is my way of ensuring that this initiative starts off with tangible real-world impact.

I’ve also recently received a **small green innovation fund**, which I’m incredibly grateful for. It will help fuel upcoming improvements, including better emissions modeling, interactive comparisons, and potentially even gamified sustainability goals.

The extension is live now on the Chrome Web Store. If this sounds like something you’d find useful, I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback. This is just the beginning, and I’m building it to grow and improve based on real user needs and ideas.

# Read Link: [**https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/**](https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/) 

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.” 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn’t care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my 

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much 

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be- 

1/5 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…” 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably 

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.” 

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.” 

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like 

her could never satisfy you.” 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a 

gunshot. 

“What was that?” Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?” 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself. 

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-” 

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?” 

“It’s not what you 

think-” 

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!” 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock 

sympathy. “How cute.” 

0915

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?” 

The world spun. “You’re lying.” 

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting. 

Probably with our engagement announcement.” 

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-” 

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this 

worse.” 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

“Let go of me,” I whispered. 

“Sera-” 

“LET GO OF ME!” 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on 

the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper. 

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.” 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will 

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.” 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?” 

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?” 

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s 

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.” 

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!” 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!” 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how 

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

“Sera!” 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.” 

“Tell me.” 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.” 

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s 

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon 

Harbor!” 

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless 

family!” 

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver 

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold 

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow… 

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those 

people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!” ",1,1757914584.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Chapter 5: Arrow Battle Group.

The silence in ""the Pit,"" the subterranean heart of the Guard's fleet command, was a substance. It was dense and heavy, settling on shoulders like a leaden cloak and filling the lungs with every breath. It even muffled the quiet, vibrational hum of the life support systems, as if the bunker itself were holding its breath in nervous anticipation. One hundred and twenty hours had passed since Admiral Marcus, with the weight of an entire species on his shoulders, had given the order to form it. One hundred and twenty unbearably long hours since the nightmare known as the Plague had taken root in the Proxima Centauri system—humanity's closest stellar neighbor.

The news had not arrived in the form of a sterile report or a broken code. It had struck them with the brutality of a sledgehammer, through the raw, merciless images from long-range optical sensors. Images that would forever be seared onto the eyelids of everyone who saw them. The geometry of the cities on Proxima b was no longer a dead grid of streets—it pulsed, swelled, and spilled over in an unnatural, oncological growth. Ships orbited the planet, nightmarish echoes of the scouts encountered eight years ago in the Kuiper Belt, but now larger, more powerful, and dripping with menace.

Thermal analysis of the fifty-seven enemy units had identified four whose energy signatures screamed a threat. According to Earth's nomenclature, they were battleships, their mass estimated at over fifty-five thousand tons each. The image, delayed by four years, two months, and twelve days, also revealed an extensive base on the planet's surface—essentially a small city with a distinct industrial backbone. It had been built on the dark side of the globe, perpetually facing away into the black, which protected the structures from the flares of the parent star and its deadly X-ray radiation.

The question of why the Plague had chosen this hell remained unanswered for a long time. Proxima b, though technically within the ecosphere, was constantly swept by stellar wind and radiation—a place where life as we know it could not have arisen. The answer came only after a precise analysis of the entire system. The gravitational dance of the two larger stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, prevented the formation of stable planetary orbits in their vicinity. The only anchor in this cosmic chaos was the distant Proxima, orbiting the central pair once every five hundred thousand years. The Plague had used what the universe gave it.

Admiral Marcus stood by the main holoprojector, as rigid as a statue carved from fatigue and granite. His face, illuminated by the cool glow of the tactical map, was that of a man who had not known peaceful sleep for a long time. Only his fingers, nervously tapping a silent rhythm on his epaulet, betrayed the inner storm. On the three-dimensional map, hundreds of luminous icons—the most powerful ships in Earth's history—were finishing their formation at the L4 Lagrange point. This ballet of leviathans, suspended between the gravitational embraces of Earth and the Moon, had been marked by chaos from the beginning. Bureaucratic inertia, political squabbles, and logistical nightmares had cost them precious hours. Every minute of delay was like a drop of acid on the already taut thread of hope.

""Admiral,"" the precise, emotionless voice of Commander Hanako Tanaka cut through his thoughts. ""The last three 'Hammer'-class destroyers have reported at the assembly point. The formation is complete.""

Marcus exhaled, but relief did not come. His eyes scanned the sea of lights. Each point represented unimaginable power, but to him, it was above all a potential steel coffin for hundreds of souls. He thought of the pilots, permanently integrated with their fighters, submerged in amber nutrient gel, their minds expanded into the combat systems of their machines. They had become something more, and yet something less, than human—living weapons whose suffering was hidden deep within a metal shell.

""Commander, give me the final summary. I want to hear the numbers. To feel their weight.""

Hanako's voice remained dispassionate, as if she were reading a stock market report. That matter-of-factness was an anchor in an ocean of uncertainty.

""Yes, Admiral. The Arrow Battle Group consists of:

Fourteen transport ships, each with a tonnage of two hundred thousand tons, carrying fourteen brigades of Guard Infantry. A total of seventy thousand soldiers.
Three 'Hegemon'-class carriers, each with a mass of one hundred and eighty thousand tons, carrying a total of three hundred and sixty 'Raven' multi-role fighters.
Nine upgraded 'Thor'-class battleships, each with a tonnage of forty-five thousand tons.
Twenty-seven 'Warlord'-class cruisers, each with a displacement of twenty-seven thousand tons. Among them is Rear Admiral Volkov's upgraded flagship, the 'Ivan the Terrible,' with a tonnage of twenty-five thousand tons.
Eighty-one 'Hammer'-class destroyers, at twelve thousand tons each.
""A total of one hundred and thirty-four ships, Admiral. The largest armada ever assembled by humanity.""

Marcus nodded, feeling a cold shiver. Power capable of turning continents to dust. But was it enough to face an enemy that devoured worlds?

""Estimated travel time?"" he asked, though he knew the answer by heart. Every digit was like a nail.

""At a speed of point-five light speed, the journey to Proxima Centauri will take the fleet eight point four years of objective time. Due to time dilation, just over seven years will pass for the crews. The round-trip mission, assuming an immediate return, is sixteen point eight Earth years and over fourteen years for the crew.""

This wasn't a mission. It was an exile. A theft of time. The children they were saying goodbye to would be adults they wouldn't recognize. Parents would pass away, their graves overgrown with grass. If they returned, they would be ghosts haunting the lives that once belonged to them.

""The estimated departure time is in approximately twelve hours. The total delay will amount to sixty hours,"" Hanako concluded.

Sixty lost hours. Marcus clenched his jaw.

""Very well, we proceed,"" his voice was hard as steel. ""It's time to exterminate the pests in our stellar backyard.""

At the same time, in a sterile, windowless cabin on one of the transport ships, Kael and Lyra stood staring at the flickering holograms displayed by their smartwatches. The time for goodbyes, stretched to its breaking point by successive delays, had become a form of psychological torture.

In the image, their father, Aris, stood beside their mother. His face, usually as stern as a military regulation, was a mask of pain he was trying in vain to maintain. Their mother wept silently, her body trembling almost imperceptibly. They had already said everything. Now only a heavy silence remained, punctuated by the static of the transmission, which made their parents look like apparitions from another world.

Seeing their despair, Kael felt a cold determination build within him—a shield against the wave of sorrow. He focused on the dormant nanites in his bloodstream, cold and patient. He had to be the one to end this agony.

""We'll be back,"" he said, his voice sounding unnaturally firm.

""We promise,"" Lyra whispered, a desperate strength trembling in her voice.

The promise hit Aris with the force of a blow. He closed his eyes, and a single tear traced a path down his cheek.

Kael retreated into the only thing he had left—the cold logic of protocol.

""Mom, Dad... we have to go. Preparations for the Higgs drive startup, procedures... you know.""

It was a lie, a shield of ash in his mouth, and they all knew it. There were twelve hours until departure, which for them marked the beginning of a journey into the unknown.

""We love you,"" their mother whispered as her image began to flicker.

""We love you too,"" Lyra replied.

The holograms vanished.

Kael looked at his sister. In her eyes, he saw the reflection of his own fear.

""I have one more call to make. Please, leave.""

As the door hissed shut behind Lyra, Kael activated another call. Blanca appeared in the hologram, at her company, surrounded by energy and life.

""Hey, honey.""

""Kael, are you leaving already? I heard it's in less than twelve hours.""

""Yeah, we're getting ready,"" he repeated the same lie. He felt the cold dance of the nanites under his skin. ""That's not what I wanted to talk about, Blanca. I love you. I'm saying it now because there most likely won't be another chance. The odds of surviving the assault... they're slim.""

There was no shock in her eyes, only a deep, penetrating sadness.

""You will come back, Kael. And so will your sister. Remember, you promised me coffee.""

He fell silent, feeling the words catch in his throat.

""I'll wait patiently,"" she continued. ""I'll be fifty-nine then, and I'm counting on a cappuccino. And if by some miracle I don't make it, know that this past year was the happiest of my life. Our love never stood a chance, we both knew that. You—almost immortal. Me—a mortal woman. But that doesn't change anything. I want to fall in love with you in the next life. I love you too."" Her gaze became hard, almost commanding. ""And now I have one order for you: survive and come back for that coffee, my poor, lost little soldier.""

She ended the call before he could answer. Always to the point. She had left him with an order, not a farewell. With a mission, not a void.

The hangar of the carrier ""Attila"" was shrouded in twilight. The air smelled of ozone and cold metal. A ""Raven"" fighter, with a rose painted on its fuselage, stood connected to its support systems. Its pilot, Kalim Al-Farsi, was resting in a simulation. Technician Edgar Winter and his team approached the machine.

""Hey, Axel,"" Winter said, using the pilot's call sign. ""Woke you up to tell you everything's okay. We're securing you for the trip.""

A crackle came from the fighter's speakers, followed by a distorted but human voice.

""What trip?""

""Ah, right. We're going to Proxima Centauri. There's a Plague base there. Supposedly they have ground-based shipyards. Seventy thousand of ours will be taking them. The images from four years ago showed fifty-seven ships in orbit. It's going to be a big one.""

A long silence followed, during which Al-Farsi's consciousness, extended into the fighter's systems, processed the data.

""Thanks for the info. And thanks for treating me like a person.""

""Cut the crap, Axel,"" Winter replied gruffly, placing a hand on the machine's cold armor. ""My brother was a loyalist in the US Army, spent three years in a Guard prison. He only got out so fast because I vouched for him. I know what you did. I know that in that moment, you were saving your subordinates. That Guardsman, if he had gotten up after his nanites regenerated, would have fried you all with his plasma rifle. There's no denying it. I respect you for that, Kalim. You protected them, and I'm going to protect you. Your mechanical body will be one hundred percent operational when the battle starts. Remember that.""

""Thanks, Winter,"" Axel's voice was calmer now. ""Switch me to combat simulation. Time to train.""

""Sure. What interval?""

""A week of training, then two weeks of the beach and family. Set up a loop like that, please.""

Winter entered the commands. He knew the simulation of a paradise beach was the anchor that kept Axel's humanity tethered to this metal body.

""I'll wake you up every week for a report. Hang in there in that tank.""

It was a human joke, one that Al-Farsi needed. It gave him hope that he wasn't just a limbless torso in nutrient gel. He was a pilot. He was a soldier. He was Axel. And a war lay before him.

3) I reached behind me to grab the nearest piece of absorbent fabric I could use to stop the coffee rolling forward, and pull a rag from under the black water with 4 paint brushes I used to test w/ 4 different dk grays and it dumps directly onto family archived papers that have survived 25 years. I saved them. But it could have been the open tester black paint. I was lucky. . 

So some damage done. However, that messy nervous clumsiness is also a HUGE signal to me that my *process* is not being managed & I need to chill out and treat things I care about carefully and by seeing that pattern. I breathe a few times and once the stuff is safe I tell myself that I’m not paying attention because I’m doing just a step or two too much. Then I MAKE myself completely clean up everything that was touched by the coffee & I mean everything. I also don’t let myself say later. It’s maybe going to take 3 mins. I don’t allow myself to frustratedly race thru. It takes 2.45 mins. But then I put the important files in the bookcase. Ate my sandwich and went about my day but more aware & feeling proud.

It’s like life just pressed pause on me while everyone else hit fast forward. CUET? Yeah sure, could’ve given that, gotten a college. But then what? Just another degree, another 3 years of random lectures, half-baked internships, and no real skill. A piece of paper that says “qualified” but doesn’t actually mean I can do something. Like bro, what even is the point?


Everywhere I look, people are sprinting—careers lined up, parents flexing, kids being the “first engineer/doctor/whatever” in their families, and here I am stuck in my own head screaming what now?! Like okay, Plan A is gone, Plan B doesn’t even look worth it, and Plan C doesn’t exist. It’s just noise. I don’t want to be just another body in a college fest crowd posting the same “life’s lit” reel with 4 captions. I want to build something real. But right now? Right now, I don’t even know where to start.

Yes, it’s a *legit* survey site. You actually get paid in cash (PayPal, Venmo, direct deposit, or gift cards) instead of dealing with points. Cashouts start at just $5, and PayPal payouts usually hit within 15–20 minutes.

The good stuff:

* Super simple, no confusing point system
* Fast payouts (PayPal is almost instant)
* Low cash-out threshold

The not-so-great:

* Tons of survey disqualifications that eat up time
* Most surveys pay under $1, so earnings are slow
* Customer service can be hit or miss
* $0.50 fee if you withdraw under $10

So yeah—it’s legit, but it won’t make you rich. More like side coffee money if you’re consistent.

I am the sole resercher and participant involved in a study examining the spontaneous emergence of a state I’ve deccided to term 'Contentmentus Solitudinem,' which emerges uder specific conditoins of environmental tranquility and voluntary seclusion. First, let’s establish my expeirmental parameters. It's late afternoon, my tiny apartment is unusually quiet, no blaring city noise filtering through the windows. I’m curped up on the couch with a book, and there’s a faint whiff of lavender from a candle burning on the coffee table. In technical terms, I’d say this is akin to establishing controlled, serene environmental variables.

The primary variable under scrutiny is my own cognitive state. Initially, I observed a significant reduction in cognitive intrusions—brief flashes of stressors like work emaills or social obligations. Over a span of approximately 2.37 hours (give or take a few minutes, we’ll allow for some experimental error), my mind sifted focus from external stimuli to an introspective assessment of personal satisfaction indices.

I’ve hypothesized that the intricate workings of Contentmentus Solitudinem rely on the precise interplay of neural serotonin pathways and the dampening of external auditory stimuli. There’s something almost alchemically transformative about engaging in such a solitary activity without the usual cacophony of modern life.

After this consideragle observation period, I noticed an upsurge in the frequency of slight facial contractions, often colloquially teermed as 'smiles.' It’s a simplistic observation, yet profound in this overly analytical framework I’m attempting to construct.

This state remained stable until the eventual rupture of the quiiet by an untimely ringing phone—an environmental anomly that prematurely concluded my experiment. Nonetheless, the resulting data proviides substantive fodder for further analysis on the deliberate orchestration of personal trwnquility.

The biggest feature of this piece is the 'glass walls' that give a clear view of the interior, for which I used thin plastic sheets to create a modern feel. And of course, I kept the design where the first and second floors can be separated for an even better look inside! (FYI: For animal welfare, our cafe does not serve Kopi Luwak. 😉)

**☕️ A few fun things to spot:**

* See if you can find all the cute little details hidden throughout the modern cafe.
* There's a busy barista, and you might also spot the other staff member taking a quick break next to the trash can under the stairs. (He looks a bit more pitiful than planned, but he's just slacking off for a moment!)
* On the second floor, a cat is carefully carrying a tray of ice cream to his date. Will he make it without spilling?
* You can also find various other guests enjoying the cafe in their own way!

**✨ Bonus:** This time, separate from the building, I also specially made a tiny cat delivering a 'real coffee bean' instead of a clay one!

**My (29f) boss/ best friends (45f) only son (22m) passed last week. Im pregnant with her son?**



I’m having mixed emotions in this whole situation. I feel like a traitor, like I stabbed her in the back for sleeping with her son. At the same time I really cared about him and I loved him. I wanted a family with him and we were seeing each other for about 9 months (officially) already. I’ve known her for a little over 2 years and she’s helped me get on my feet.

I work for her business and I now manage all the employees. I started off living in my car and she gave me a place to stay while I made some money to find an apartment. After that she started giving me more work and even started giving me some work at her home.

She trusts me completely and I guess I broke that trust by seeing her son without her permission. I have mixed feelings because I did things the wrong way, but at the same time I treated her son like a king and I know he was happy with me before he left.

She has no idea about our relationship we had and we were gonna tell her, but life took a bad turn. I know he left before his time because he had many great things coming and now I have to raise our child with him absent. When is the right time for me to go tell her the truth and that she’s going to be a grandmother? I love her and I don’t want this to hurt her more.

TLDR: my best friends son past away in an accident.i was secretly seeing him and im having his baby in a couple of months.

Edit: I forgot to clear things up, she knows im pregnant, she just doesn’t know who the father is.

These comments really aren’t super helpful. If I could trade my life for his I would. I’m only willing to live on for my baby now but I have nothing else for me.

Edit 2: I talked with her last night after we had dinner. I apologized for hiding it from her and I told her I didn’t want any money or anything from her I just wanted her to be able to enjoy her time with her grandchild. I was honest with her on how our relationship started and how much I loved her son.

She had her doubts about it and told me she knew something was up between us 2, but she didn’t say anything because she wasn’t sure and she didn’t want to make assumptions. She was very upset at first and told me I should have never hid things from her and that she would have accepted us together if she knew my intentions were clean and I wouldn’t hurt her son.

I showed her pictures of us together, places we went, our messages, and she broke down crying. She looked very upset and I genuinely thought she was going to hit me because it looked like she was about to slap me. She asked me to leave and give her some space. I left home and she called me at midnight and asked if I could come back and spend some time with her. We finished talking and I offered her to take a dna test so she could see it’s her grandchild.

She believed me on what I said but she told me I should have never hid things from her because now she regrets not being able to support us since the beginning. She kept asking to hold my stomach and feel her grandchild and she told me she would be there for the baby. I told her I would leave work and leave her alone if she didn’t want to see me anymore, but she told me no, to stay and keep on moving forward how we were before.

I apologized a dozen times and she told me she was happy that she still at least has a part of her son in me. She’s been very emotional and she’s just been wanting to feel her grandchild and she has been nice to me. I just assured her I treated her son with respect and that I was very loving with him. Hopefully she is still accepting of the whole situation in the long run.



**Comments**



**NYCStoryteller**

*I'm sorry for your loss, and for hers, and for your child who will grow up without its father. Her son was old enough to make his own life choices without his mom's ""permission."" However, it is kind of messy to secretly date your boss's child. I would tell her that you lied to her about not knowing who the baby's father was because you were scared about her reaction, and you need to apologize for that. Tell her that you would be glad to give her some space and time to process, and that you're hoping that she will eventually be excited to be a grandmother, even though it's a lot to process right now.*

**Its-Just-Whatever**

*Wow, this is a heck of a situation and I'm sorry for your loss, honestly. I'm not sure what the root problem was for her, she clearly respected and cared for both her child and you. Logically, I would think that she would be relieved and happy to have a grandchild from her recently lost son, but I don't know all the details here.*

*You might as well let her know now, assuming you're far enough along in the pregnancy to communicate that. Ideally, the two of you can work as a team as I'm sure that's what her son would have wanted.*

>OOP: I hope she’s happy about it. I love her and I loved her son so much. If she would have approved I think I would have married him eventually. It’s been tough, but I at least know I’ll have a reminder from him. And yeah I am more than halfway along the pregnancy, I just have been holding his mother off on knowing he’s the father. She’s excited for my pregnancy she knows that, but she doesn’t know it’s his baby.

**Its-Just-Whatever**

*Do you know why she didn't want the two of you together??? Outside of her resistance this seems like a good situation initially.*

>OOP: She didn’t actually say that ever. I just thought he was off limits since I’m her best friend and that’s her son.

**Its-Just-Whatever**

*Oh my gosh, that's even better. You might be in a situation where an awful scenario can be given a silver lining by just using some direct communication.*



**Update - 8 months later**



I know it has been a while and I just wanted to give some closure. I probably won’t use this account again and I am trying to get through the hundreds of messages I got. It was really of hard at first. I didn’t really get a chance to grieve for him and I still miss him. I had my baby, but it wasn’t easy and there were some complications and I almost lost him.

Now my baby is healthy and he resembles his father so much. He honestly doesn’t look like me much compared to his dad. Along the way of all this, my friend had her times where she would randomly go off on me and be upset, but I get why and I forgave her. After that she has been nothing but supportive. She was there for me when my son was born and she cried so much the first few days.

She has been offering me to live with her since she wants the baby close to her, but I have declined to show her I really am not just after her money. She always wants the baby and honestly she is such a help at work because she is always holding him or has him in her office with her while I am working and I don’t need to find a babysitter to trust.

She spoils him and buys any baby supplies I need and I am so grateful. I just really miss her son. I can’t ever sleep at night knowing he won’t ever get to meet the little baby he and I made together. I just want to cry every-time I think about him and it’s hard seeing how hard my son resembles him. How can I thank her for being so wonderful to me and her grandchild? I love her so much and I still feel for the way things happened between us

*Just go up to her and say thank you*

>OOP: I thank her everyday, but I don’t think it’s enough.

**thatstwatshesays**

*It is, you’re good. You don’t need to go overboard bc she’s not doing it out of obligation. She’s coming from a place of love; love for you, for the baby, and also for her son.*

*If this situation calls for anything, a “thinking of you” gift/gesture would be appropriate (ex-“thought you’d like a coffee/smoothie/cupcake so I got you one as well”). And just show up for her as best you can, but it sounds like you’re doing that.*

*It takes a village, you know? You’re very lucky to have one another, I wish you love in your time of healing.*

**ResistSpecialist4826**

*Having her grandson when she’s lost her son and letting her be in the babies life is really all she wants or needs. I’m sure she is just as thankful to you!*

**hawaiitoday**

*Maybe you could write her a heartfelt letter in a really nice thank you card with some flowers. I know I’ve treasured the nice letters I’ve gotten. When my Mom passed I found a collection of special cards with notes she’d gotten. It wasn’t all of them but just the ones that were the most meaningful.*

*In the future, just make sure you get her gifts for Christmas, birthday, and above all else, Mothers Day. Especially if your ex was an only child, make sure you and baby invite her to a special outing on Mothers Day. I’m sure the first few will be really hard and she may be more sad than seem like she’s enjoying herself, but power through. I know you may feel like you are not getting a Mothers Day taking care of her but she’s making every day easier for you so I’d do it.*

But in that moment, sitting there undr the trees with the sun peeking through the lewves, I felt this intense wave of gratitude for the simple bliss of just...being. I guess I needed the reminder that these small moments are pretty special, too. 😊

A few things stood out to me:

The bowing never stops. You bow, they bow lower, you bow again. It becomes this polite battle you can’t win.

The streets are spotless, but trash bins are almost nonexistent. I walked around with an empty coffee cup for hours before realizing people just take their rubbish home.

Tipping feels weirdly offensive there. Coming from Europe/US where tipping is basically extortion, this was such a contrast.

High-tech toilets everywhere, but then you go to a shop and it’s cash-only. No Apple Pay, no Google Pay, sometimes not even card.

Honestly, those little contradictions made the trip more memorable than the big tourist spots.

Funny enough, I later read this piece on [Kay is Murmuring](https://fattkay.com/p/people-were-respectful-in-japan) where the guy ended up in a bowing contest at the airport, exactly what happened to me on day one. Had me laughing because it felt so spot-on.

1nhd35p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paidworkco/comments/1nhd35p/paidwork/,Paidwork,"My Experience with Paidwork – Is It Worth It?

I recently came across the app Paidwork, a platform that claims you can earn money by doing simple online tasks. Things like filling out surveys, playing games, watching ads, or trying out new apps. Since I was curious (and honestly wanted a bit of extra pocket money), I decided to give it a try.

How does it work?
	•	You create an account (pretty quick).
	•	Then you get a dashboard with different tasks.
	•	Each task earns you points, which you can later cash out via PayPal or gift cards.

What can you earn?

The payout really depends on the task:
	•	A short survey might pay around $0.05 – $0.50.
	•	Installing an app or game can pay a few dollars, but often you need to reach certain levels first.
	•	Watching ads usually only gives you a couple of cents.

So, you’re not going to get rich, but it can be a small side hustle if you’ve got some free time.

Pros
	•	Easy to use, clean interface.
	•	Low payout threshold (around $10).
	•	Lots of different earning options.

Cons
	•	Some tasks take too long for very little reward.
	•	Not always a big selection of tasks (especially if you’ve already done many).
	•	It takes a while to build up to a decent payout.

Final verdict

Paidwork is fine if you just want to earn a little extra in your spare time, but don’t expect it to be a serious income stream. Think of it more as a way to cover small expenses (like Netflix, Spotify, or a coffee habit).

So I’m sitting here at 11:47 PM eating leftover pizza and wondering how the hell I got to this point. Three months ago, I was just another guy frustrated with AI chatbots. Now I’ve got a patent pending and what might be the first actual solution to something everyone’s complaining about but no one’s fixing.

Let me back up.

It Started With Annoyance

You know that thing where you’re having a great conversation with ChatGPT, close the tab, come back tomorrow and it’s like you never met? Yeah, that was driving me insane.

I was working on this side project (something about automated expense tracking, doesn’t matter now) and I kept having to re-explain the same context to different AI tools. My background, my data format, why I needed X instead of Y. Over and over.

It hit me one Tuesday morning while I was explaining my project to Claude for the third time: these things have the memory span of goldfish.

But here’s the weird part—I started thinking about my grandpa, who had Alzheimer’s. Every conversation was like meeting him for the first time. Except my grandpa couldn’t help it. These AI companies just… chose to build their systems this way.

The Rabbit Hole

I’m not normally the “stay up until 3 AM coding” type. I’m more of a “solid 8 hours of sleep” guy. But this idea wouldn’t leave me alone.

What if memory could be portable? What if I owned my AI conversation history instead of OpenAI or Anthropic?

I started simple. Really simple. Like “save conversation to JSON file” simple. But then I kept thinking: what about privacy? What about proving the memory wasn’t tampered with? What about setting rules like “don’t train on this conversation” or “delete this after my project is done”?

Three weeks later, I had filled two notebooks with terrible diagrams and was reading cryptography papers at breakfast.

The Basement Months

My roommate started calling my home office “the cave.” Fair enough—I was down there most nights after work, weekends, basically any free moment. He’d bring me coffee and ask how the “memory thing” was going. I’d mumble something about encryption keys and policies and he’d just nod and leave me alone.

The breakthrough wasn’t dramatic. No eureka moment. Just me finally getting the key management working with user-defined policies at 2:17 AM on a Thursday. I remember the timestamp because I texted my sister immediately: “Holy shit it works.”

(She texted back: “what works? are you drunk?”)

What I Actually Built

Okay, without getting too technical—because honestly, explaining this to my neighbor yesterday made me realize how insane it sounds—I built containers for AI memories.

Think of it like this: every conversation, every preference, every piece of context gets wrapped in its own little cryptographic envelope. Only you have the key. The envelope has rules attached (like “expire after 30 days” or “never use for training”). And you can carry these envelopes between different AI systems.

So if I’m talking to ChatGPT about my project, then switch to Claude tomorrow, Claude can read my memory envelopes and know exactly where we left off. But OpenAI can’t read Claude’s envelopes, and neither can read mine without my permission.

The first time I successfully moved a conversation from one AI to another and it remembered everything—that was better than coffee.

Why I Think This Matters

Look, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is just me solving a problem only I have. But I don’t think so.

We’re all getting more dependent on AI for work, creativity, problem-solving. These things are becoming like external brains. But right now, that brain belongs to whoever built the AI, not to you.

Your therapist can’t read your medical records to someone else. Your lawyer can’t share your legal strategy with opposing counsel. But your AI assistant? Everything you tell it goes into some corporate database you’ll never see.

That seems… not great? Especially as AI gets better and we share more personal stuff with it.

The Patent and What’s Next

Filed the patent application last week. My attorney (who I probably overpaid) seemed optimistic. The technical stuff is working—I can actually demo this thing now, which feels surreal.

I keep going back and forth on what to do next. Part of me wants to just open-source it and let smarter people than me figure out the business side. Part of me thinks this could be bigger than a side project.

My sister thinks I should pitch it to the big AI companies. My roommate thinks I should start a company. My neighbor thinks I should write a book about it.

Honestly? I just want to stop re-explaining my projects to ChatGPT every damn day.

If you’re still reading this, maybe you get it. Maybe you’re as frustrated as I was. Maybe you’ve thought about this problem too and wondered why no one was fixing it.

Or maybe you think I’m overthinking everything and just need to get better at copy-paste.

Either way, I built the thing. Now I guess I figure out what to do with it. Advice?",3,1757912106.0,SellMyBusiness,4,1.0,False

1nhcsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1nhcsky/dating_in_dubai/,Dating in Dubai,"Okay there’s one thing I don’t fully understand about dating in Dubai : Is it considered appropriate for either person on the first meetup to make a move towards getting physical without even checking if the other party is interested? I’ll give you an example: There’s this one guy I met at a mixer’s event in JBR. We spoke a bit and shared each other Insta profiles. After the event, we just messaged each other like « Hi, how are you? » on Instagram and didn’t chat a lot. Then one day I was out meeting some friends in the area where he lives and by coincidence he messaged me that same time saying « hi ». So I told him where I was and asked if he was interested in meeting up for coffee. So he agreed to meet up and we spent around 3 hours talking which was fun. Then as we were leaving, he tried to kiss me (which I didn’t want) so I just pulled away. He asked me then how I planned on getting home and I told him I’ll take the RTA bus which was right around the corner. He then offered to drop me home in a cab which I refused at first because it would have cost him a lot of money and would have wasted his time. He said it was fine and then I agreed. On the way to my home, we continued talking and again he made a move which was more bold and that’s when I told him that I want us to first be friends first and then see what happens later. I could easily tell he was disappointed and was hoping for us to make out in the cab but I simply couldn’t do it because I wasn’t attracted to him. I had a nice time talking though and that’s pretty much it. When I reached home, I thanked him on WhatsApp for the ride home. 

Since then we have just spoken a few times and he has implied that he would like us to have a more physical relationship and I simply cannot understand why guys cannot leave the idea of getting physical on the first meetup with a girl.

1nhcru4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nhcru4/turbo_shots_vs_long_extractions_a_working_theory/,🚀 Turbo Shots vs. Long Extractions – A Working Theory on Modern Espresso,"Over the past months I’ve been dialing in a wide range of modern, light-roasted specialty coffees and I’ve come to a theory that goes a bit against the traditional “1:2 in 25–30s” wisdom.

Here’s what I’ve noticed, tested, and tasted:


1. Fast & Free (Turbo Shots)
	•	Ratios like 1:2.5–1:3 in 15–20s often give me the best balance in the cup.
	•	The shots are clean, juicy, and sweet, often with peach, winey, or floral character.
	•	Dryness, saltiness, or cigarette-like bitterness almost always decreases with faster extractions.
	•	In short: turbo shots highlight the clarity, sweetness, and fruitiness of light roasts better than traditional recipes.



2. The Milk Paradox
	•	As straight espresso, turbo shots are beautiful.
	•	But when I add milk, they often get lost the subtle fruit and aromatics flatten out.
	•	Surprisingly, some of my best milk drinks came from “in theory undrinkable” shots:
	•	Ratios closer to 1:1–1.5
	•	Extraction times 35–40s
	•	Dense, syrupy, almost “over-extracted” by textbook standards
	•	These shots don’t always shine neat, but in milk they transform: strawberry milk, caramel crunch, cinnamon roll, chocolate…



3. Light Roasts ≠ Classic Espresso Rules
	•	Modern light roasts don’t respond well to the traditional 25–30s 1:2 norm.
	•	Fast turbo shots: best for clarity and fruit.
	•	Slow long shots: best for milk balance.
	•	The “middle ground” often produces flat, muted, or harsh cups.


4. Working Theory
	•	Phase 1: A strong, full-blast start extracts the good stuff fast.
	•	Phase 2: Too much mid-flow contact = bitterness, dryness, astringency.
	•	Phase 3: Late-shot liquid is more dilution than flavor.
	•	So the “sweet spot” is often either very fast (turbo clarity) or very long/tight (syrupy milk anchors).


TL;DR

Turbo shots extract more evenly and highlight sweetness/clarity in light roasts.
For milk, paradoxically, long syrupy extractions often taste better.
The “rulebook” of 1:2 in 25–30s feels outdated for modern specialty espresso.",5,1757911803.0,espresso,8,0.63,False

Now that I’m here, I’d love to connect with like-minded people whether it’s for photo walks, film collabs, exploring the city, or just vibey conversations over coffee. I’m currently near Manikonda but totally down to wander around town.

After discovering this i went to my modlist to disable the mods that i assumed messed with it (Armor mods, mods for some models and meshes) and nothing came out of it.

  
i had then progressed completing the mission assuming it was just that moment that i could brush pass but then i noticed that NPC's with combat armor or any battle armor of the sort or just random really for example Zimmers bodyguard armitage in rivet city has the same fate. And so far Roy phillips of tenpenny power the ghoul who has the Commando armor has the same issue as the reillys rangers. So i had to get this fixed ASAP.

1nhceyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/1nhceyh/tricked_my_dog_into_going_potty_despite_rain/,Tricked my dog into going potty despite rain,"Let me praface this by saying I've had dogs all my life. I've trained puppies, and adult dogs. I've had small dogs, and I've had large dogs.  I've had easy dogs, and I've had smart dogs, and I've had stubborn dogs, and I've had dumb dogs. I've never had a problem with any of them. I have an extra large dog now. She's almost 5 years old. She's a mix breed of American mastiff, & Pyrenaen mastiff. She's a bit over 100 pounds. She's double coated (this is important later) She's bullheaded, she won't recall, I can't walk her on a leash, and she barks too much. She's infuriating. My husband wanted her to train her as his service dog, since his current service dog (who he also trained) is about at retirement age. My husband can't help with her training much, because he's disabled, and can rarely even get out of bed. 

We live in Washington State. What's Washington known for? Rain. Guess what my dog hates. You guessed it. Rain. I think because of that double coat. I think she has a hard time getting/feeling dry, even when her top coat is dry, the under coat may feel wet. We are at the beginning of the rainy season, and my dog hates it. She's very upset that it is no longer summer, and everything will be soggy from here until next summer. Today she is protesting, by not going potty. Normally I have a hard time getting her inside, because she'd rather live outside, and protect the chickens and property. 🙄😒

Every day, I sit outside, under the awning, with my coffee, a cigarette (don't judge me), and watch the dogs play. We stay outside for hours. Then it's food time and nap time for the dogs. My dog eats, and naps in her kennel every day and at night. 

She woke up today, and laid down next to me, without a second thought. I tried walking her to the end of the deck. She stood there for a second, shook (it wasn't even raining anymore. Just wet ground and water falling off the leaves), then came straight back to her dry spot next to me. I kept them outside longer than normal, hoping she'd give in, and go potty, but, no. So I fed them, and shut them in the room for nap time. I let them out a couple hours later, expecting her to really need to pee by now, and she'd have to get over it being damp out. But she did the same thing as earlier. Laid down next to me. After about an hour of sitting outside, I grabbed the leftover pizza crust, I was saving for the chickens, and lured her to the end of the deck. She grabbed the bite of crust and ran back to her dry spot. Twice. There's a dirt area next to the house, that they never go potty at, but... it's dry. I've been watching Rocky Kanaka on YouTube lately. He always gets dogs out of their fear state by getting their nose to start working, by tossing pieces of treats. I thought I'd give that a go. So I tossed a piece into the dirt. She went after it and came back up. I tossed another one, and another one. She started sniffing around for more pizza crust, and I could tell by her body language, that she switched and is now looking for a spot to potty. I held my breath as I watched her. YES! She's finally going pee! I held back the last piece, and gave it to her right after she was done, and acted like I did when I started training her as a puppy. High value treat and lots of praise and pets. I was so proud of myself for making her nose start working, to trick her into sniffing for a spot to potty. 

I'm sure she's more comfortable now that she's at least peed. No more rain in the forecast for a while. Hopefully the ground is dry enough for her liking by tomorrow morning.

I don't feel that way in front of my family members and friends that know my current situation, but I do with people that don't know. I know there's a portion of it that's me in my head projecting my feelings about the meds onto other people, but I also have experienced people treating me a little differently than before. It doesn't help that my pupils are naturally on the larger side, and they become saucers when I'm on my meds. I would frequently get accused of being high as a teenager even though I didn't do drugs. Additionally, I don't feel high at all unless I drink coffee with the meds, and I do not drink much coffee because it causes me anxiety on the meds and other undesirable side effects. I don't feel like I take that much either compared to other people. I take 10 mg twice a day 4 hours apart to help with the crash.

1nhc98u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1nhc98u/8_months_daily_reflux_unremarkable_endoscopy/,"8 months daily reflux, unremarkable endoscopy, losing hope","I’ve had on and off reflux for years, but starting at the beginning of the year it started being a lot more regular. My GI doctor prescribed me pantoprazole. About a week later, my reflux was worse than ever. Extremely painful even after eating extremely bland food. I ended up being given famotidine and Sucralfate. At this point I started changing my diet completely to lower the acid. Next my doctor tested me for SIBO, and it was positive (hydrogen dominant). I thought maybe this was the answer- I started eating low fodmap, and noticed some GI improvements but the reflux stayed. I stopped the pantoprazole and I went on Xifaxan for the SIBO and really didn’t notice a big difference. Since the reflux wasn’t fixed, at this point I was eating low fodmap and eating less acid on top of that. I switched GI doctors (last one was difficult to communicate with) My current GI doctor didn’t think it was necessary to retest my SIBO levels at this point. She wanted me to get my constipation under control and thought that may be contributing to everything so I’ve been on Linzess. The last thing I did was an endoscopy, I figured at this point I must have had a hiatal hernia but there was nothing remarkable, just irritation. I’m feeling so defeated. I can’t imagine what else I could change about my diet (on top of what I mentioned I obviously don’t drink alcohol or carbonation or coffee etc). I also have been tested and taking meds for MCAS- i have some other symptoms that point towards the possibility of me having that, but my test was inconclusive and I haven’t noticed much improvement from cromolyn sodium, Allegra and famotidine. I’m worried my doctor is just going to want to put me on PPIs again, and things will get even worse. I don’t know what else I could possibly do that this point. It’s complete torture panicking over what to eat every day. Please let me know if you have any ideas or words of encouragement. For context since all of these things overlap- I also am diagnosed with POTS and have hypermobility.",1,1757910063.0,LPR,3,1.0,False
1nhc8tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/snapinsight/comments/1nhc8tw/just_another_day_with_my_dog_led_to_a_surprising/,Just another day with my dog led to a surprising realization,"So, tday started like any other. My dog, Max, was doing his usual thing – you know, snififng around, exploring every corner of the yard. As I sipped my coffee (instant, not fancy), I watched him with kinda half an eye while scropling on my phone. But then he stopped, nose deep in the grass, completely still. 🐶 I paused too, curious, and it hit me. 

Max was just being present, not distrcted by a bunch of thoughts, worries, or to-do lists like I allways seem to be. It made me think, maybe there's sojething to learn in just benig... observant and tbere, without any rush. Idk why it was such a lightbulb moment, but it got me wondering about how often I let life's little dsitractions pull me away from just 'being' in the moment. 🤔 

Who would've thought a dog being fascinated by a random patch of grass would make me reflect on my own life haha. Maybe I need to take a leaf (or a blade of grass, I guess) outta his book and just chill sometimes.",10,1757910025.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False
