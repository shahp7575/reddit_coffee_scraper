How or should I even approach this?,"My(42m) wife(41f) and I have been married for 14 years, together for 18. Live in a suburb of Manchester, UK. We’ve got one daughter. My wife and I have always gotten along. We’re good friends and we really click. However, our sex life is another matter. It’s been a struggle, especially after my wife went to therapy and declared she didn’t want duty sex anymore. I had no idea she was even considering this, and it really broke my heart.

About two years ago, my wife came out as bisexual, possibly even a lesbian. She told me she was still interested in men, but that she wasn’t getting the emotional connection she needed from them and was feeling more drawn to women. I had a strong feeling she might have been emotionally involved with someone else, but although she admitted to having feelings for an ex-colleague, she insisted nothing happened. After a lot of discussions, my wife said she wanted to stay with me, but admitted she couldn’t rule out the possibility of meeting a woman she might want to be with more. Her phrasing was ""we'll keep doing this as long as it works""/

Over the last 18 months, I’ve poured myself into my career, health, and our daughter. I spent at least six months grieving the loss of what I thought our marriage was. Neither of us wears our wedding rings anymore, and I take on most of the school runs and activities. Many of the teachers and parents think I’m a single dad. This isn’t true with a few of the parents we are close friends with though.

This brings me to why I've posted,  one of the group of close freinds is Sophie. Sophie was widowed more than five years ago and is doing a great job raising her daughter, Helen, who is one of my daughter’s friends. A few times, while I was at kid-related activities, Sophie would join me for a coffee, and we’d chat for an hour or two. A couple of times, when I had to wait for my wife to pick up our daughter, Sophie would stay with me after the other parents had left. I wouldn’t say we were particularly flirty with each other—just a couple of compliments here and there. But there have been moments, like today, in a group conversation where we catch each other’s gaze and share a smile.

Just before Christmas, my wife decided to arrange a day out for our daughter and Sophie’s daughter. We all went out for a meal afterwards, and it was a lovely time. After our daughter went to bed, my wife casually said, “You guys make a really cute couple.” She wasn’t upset. I told her I was attracted to Sophie but had no idea if Sophie felt the same. My wife replied that Sophie seemed to like me a lot. About a week later, my wife told me that she’d be fine if I wanted to date Sophie, as long as we kept it discreet and didn’t let anyone at school or among our friends know. I was shocked and asked what she meant. She explained that as long as we were careful, she had no problem with it. Over the following week, we talked more about it, with my wife eventually asking if I’d asked Sophie out yet.

I told her no I wasn't going to make a move on Sophie. To be honest, it all seemed too risky. If I asked Sophie out, why would she say yes? I’m a married man, and I’m not even sure she’s interested in me. I’m not in the best position, and she’s been through so much already. After thinking about it for a week, I did see Sophie again. I gave her a compliment, and I thought I saw something in her reaction, but I still couldn’t bring myself to ask her anything.

When I saw Sophie today, I felt conflicted. The best thing seems to be leaving her alone. She’s great, and I’m sure she’ll meet someone better suited for her. I miss the connection we share and the conversations we have. But I’m not sure how she would feel if I asked her out. I’m still married, and if she did say yes, I don’t know how she’d react to the mess that is my marriage. It wouldn’t be fair to her. I could ask for a divorce, but that process will take years, and I won’t be in a position to do anything for a long time.

I suppose I know what I need to do: leave Sophie alone and focus on fixing my marriage?

**TLDR:**  
Married for 14 years, wife is trying to figure out her sexuality. I've built some sort of connection with a mutual friend of ours. My wife suggested I ask this woman on a date. I'm torn",1,1738771948.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

When they were kids Dean would watch movies with Sam and try getting junk food from convenience stores to distract him when Sam would start missing their dad when he’d go out on hunts.


Dean started learning to cook more when he got a bit older because he thought his mom did the cooking herself (in canon It was said that Mary told them later on she didn’t really cook), and wanted to try and be more like her for Sam so he didn’t have to miss not having a mom.


Sam would try to play board games with Dean, but Dean is the biggest board flipping sore loser and Sam pretty much always won. Sam got a kick out of seeing Dean lose and get all pissed about it.


Sam likes keeping protein bars stashed in the Impala for energy or a light snack, and Dean hates them because he thinks it tastes like cardboard, so he’d try stashing actual junk food (Sam would get annoyed and tell him how unhealthy that is).


They had a game that they’d play when they were younger and Sam needed more distraction from their dad not being around. They’d play hide and seek, then Dean would chase Sam down and tickle him.


Dean is actually still really upset that he missed Sam’s first alcoholic drinking experience of turning 21 since Sam was away at college during that time. But he still wanted to do something for Sam, so he mail him a case of beer to his dorm for his 21st birthday (he also included langire as a joke, and Sam made sure he burned it almost immediately).


Sam loves making fun of Dean for not knowing some of the new generations trends. He’ll make certain references purely to watch Dean get annoyed and confused. 


Dean liked to show Sam videos he found from the internet. “Hey, hey Sam, c’mere… you gotta see this…”


Sam bites his nails sometimes. It’s a nervous habit he has. Dean sometimes gently pushes at his arm to make him stop since he knows Sam sometimes does it subconsciously.


Dean got a lot of his clothing, mostly the flannels and jackets, as hand me downs from his dad. Sam started wearing flannel more for similar reasons, except Dean was his influence. Sometimes they’d swap jackets and flannels.


Dean claims to like his coffee black as to look “tougher,” but Sam knew Dean better than that. In cafes Sam would leave the creamer pots and sugar packets near Dean just in case.


When they were kids, Dean taught Sam how to make forts with blankets and pillows. When Sam first learned how to do it he was genuinely so amazed and impressed, and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Dean would then tell Sam scary stories with the flashlight, and then they’d just fall asleep in the fort.",1,1738771903.0,Supernatural,0,1.0,False

But sometimes I just have this weird head feeling where it doesn't hurt like a headache but it doesn't feel good either, and it goes away when I have coffee. I'm a college student studying computer science so I kind of need to feel good to think through something complicated like code.

Sometimes my eyes just feel like they dont want to focus on my computer screen which seems like physical fatigue (like the weird head feeling). But when I go to lectures, having coffee seems to help me focus which suggests that it's mental. Sometimes I just have brain fog. It's probably both mental and physical.

I would prefer if you don't tell me to switch to tea or decaf. It's not just the caffeine part that I want to change.

1iidgom,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenBlog/comments/1iidgom/sekkai_harada_on_putting_a_head_onto_your_own/,Sekkai Harada on putting a head onto your own,"**THE DAILY PRACTICE OF ZEN**

Zazen can broadly be divided in two: Zen within activity and Zen within stillness. Zen within activity embraces the other activities in our life, such as our work and so forth. Zen within stillness is what we do in the *zendo,* the meditation hall.

I would like to speak practically about how you can continue with Zen outside of the meditation hall, outside of retreat. Everyday life itself is Zen. As I have already said many times, drinking coffee, eating toast, washing your face, taking a bath, these are all Zen even though we do not label them Zen. I would like you to be clear about this. Consequently, there is absolutely no need to choose between activities that are Zen and those that are not. Believe this firmly and have unshakable confidence in it. Then let go of this faith. This is the way I would like you to act, but in practice this is not easy. It is a mistake for you to incorporate into your life things you have learned about Zen through books or by listening to others. This also includes the Zen practice you have done up until now.

There is an expression in Zen *""to* put another head on top of the one you already have."" This is a mistake. It really is not possible, and I want you to take great care not to make this mistake. Even though I say this, I am sure you will live and experience many things, learning by trial and error. You make an effort to build up your practice, but then you become lax and it falls apart. Again you make an effort to build up your practice, but again you become lax and it falls apart. It is important not to give up. While living your everyday life, I ask you once again not to adopt or bring Zen into that life. Apart from those times when you are sitting quietly, I would like you to forget completely about Zen.  
I also have some comments about formal sitting, Zen within stillness. Make sure to sit each day. Thirty minutes is fine, fifteen minutes is fine. The length of time will depend on your circumstances, and these vary from person to person. Be sure to set aside some time to sit every day. At that time, no matter how much you are concerned about your work or what is happening in your household, forget those things and sit in a *samadhl* of zazen.

From the beginning, I would like you to divide your life into Zen within stillness and Ten within activity. In this way, I believe you will be able to be one with your work and be one with a *samadhi of* zazen. If you do this, I believe you will not even have time to think ""this is Zen."" Then, during Zen in stillness, you will be able to forget yourself and be one with a *samadhi of* zazen.

Continue to persevere: building up your practice, it falls apart\~ again building up your practice, it falls apart. In this way, I am sure there will come a time when it is no longer necessary to divide Zen in two.

[1](https://dharmanet.org/wisdomweek8.htm)

""Isn't it wonderful when someone says, 'I'm busy and have no time for Zazen'?"" If you practice Zazen to truly forget yourself and simply become your work, then that is right from beginning to end. (...)

We understand that recent political and economic events, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration and affected countries, are having a significant impact on the coffee industry and the wider community. These are important issues, and we recognize that many of you may be feeling concerned, frustrated, and upset.

However, r/espresso is a subreddit dedicated to the *hobby* of espresso. Our focus here is on sharing knowledge and experiences related to brewing tasty coffee. While we acknowledge the broader context of the coffee world, this isn't the appropriate venue for extensive political discussion or debate.

Therefore, we want to remind everyone to keep discussions on-topic. **While it's okay to briefly acknowledge the impact of external factors, please refrain from derailing threads into broader political commentary, ""circlejerking"", or extended discussions of economic policy.**

Specifically:

* Stay focused on espresso: Keep your comments and posts related to espresso
* Avoid political debates: This is not the place for partisan arguments or discussions about government policy.
* No excessive complaining or ""echo chamber commentary"": While acknowledging challenges is fine, repeated negativity and unproductive complaining detract from the core purpose of the subreddit.

Moderation:

If you see a post that breaks the subreddit relevancy rule, please just report it instead of adding fanning the flames. We will be removing threads and comments that violate these guidelines. Repeat offenders may be subject to temporary or permanent bans.

I bounce most of the information I need off my grandmother, and have to cherry pick a fair bit because… we all know grandmas come with out of pocket advice sometimes. 

Two things kind of rattling around in my head right now are on caffeine and aging skin. As for the latter, I’m actually kind of startled.

And on the topic of caffeine, I’m starting to come to terms with the fact I’ve relapsed into a problem.

Many people, Times Colonist readers and others, have expressed resistance to paying the sum set for each household that is needed to borrow money to replace the Crystal Pool.

Professionals who help us learn how to reach goals teach us to break final goals into smaller, interim chunks that seem manageable.

Same with the cost of borrowing. $4,800 over 20 years? Impossible.

$240 per year for 20 years? Still too much.

$20 per month? Maybe.

$4.61 per week? I can try.

$4.61 per week equates to two cups of coffee at your favourite shop!

Bonus: if the city gets grants from either or both the federal and provincial governments (and one is pending on a Yes vote), you might pay the equivalent of one cup of coffee per week! Per household!

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iida4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1iida4o/prune_rhubarb_supplements/,Prune / Rhubarb supplements?,"Hi! Has anyone had success with prune powder or rhubarb root powder? I (27f) have struggled with chronic constipation since my teens and the only semi-consistent relief I found came from a combo of coffee + nicotine (yikes). I used nicotine for about 6 years and quit about four months ago - as soon as I stopped, my constipation came back with a vengeance. I eat a super clean diet and drink 96oz water per day. 

I've been having low-moderate success with nightly miralax + mag citrate capsules. I haven't gone in more than a week, I'll take milk of magnesia (works but it's a terrible experience and leaves me bloated/distended for days after).   
  
I feel like the miralax/mag citrate combo never gives me the urge to go, but I've heard prune and rhubarb can have stimulant effects that might help in that department - any thoughts? If I did take a supplement, how many mg should I look for in each? Or would it be better to just drink prune juice?

I enjoy the following:

1. Unique dining experiences
2. Workout classes
3. Spa experiences (have been to King Spa many times so would want to try something different)
4. Coffee/pastries

I don't particularly enjoy the following:

1. Shopping, though I wouldn't mind treating myself to a special clothing or home purchase
2. Museums
3. Bars/Clubs

I would love any ideas for restaurants and experiences so I can piece together a truly unique day.

1iid9jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/1iid9jj/building_bridges_not_walls_updates_on_political/,"Building Bridges, Not Walls: Updates on Political Content in r/dayton","Hey y'all, we need to talk about something important: how we're handling political content in r/dayton going forward. I know this is a long post, so here's the key points up front:

**TL;DR - What's Changing:**

We're updating how we handle political posts to keep r/dayton focused on building community, not division. Here's what that means:

**What's Welcome Here:**

* Local election coverage and city council news
* Verified local events (protests, town halls, etc.)
* Issues directly affecting Dayton (with reliable sources)
* Constructive discussions about local matters

**What's Not Allowed:**

* Boycott lists based on political beliefs (regardless of side)
* Claims about businesses/people without solid proof
* National or state political debates without direct Dayton impact
* Posts meant to divide rather than inform

Before posting something political, here’s a quick gut-check: *“If I posted this in* r/Cleveland *or* r/Ohio *without changing a word, would it still make sense?”* If the answer is yes, it’s probably not specific enough to Dayton and will likely be removed. The goal isn’t to shut down discussions—it’s to keep r/dayton focused on what makes this community unique and relevant to all of us.

**Why:** We've seen too many unverified claims cause harm to local businesses and their employees. At the same time, national political debates that don’t directly connect to Dayton often lead to toxic comment sections that move us away from the purpose of this community.

**The Bottom Line:** If you're posting about something serious, make sure it’s backed by reliable information—like news coverage, official records, or firsthand evidence.

# Want to understand more about our thinking and vision for the community? Keep reading below.

Let's talk about what's been happening lately. Whether it's posts about ICE activity, business boycotts, or national politics, we can see these topics matter deeply to many of you—they affect our friends, our families, our neighbors. Before we go further, I want you to know: we hear you, and we understand why these conversations feel important.

These conversations should happen somewhere. The question is: should that be here?

**What Makes** r/dayton **Special**

Let's put politics aside for just a moment and talk about what r/dayton means to all of us. For some, it's where you found your go-to coffee shop, thrift store, or your mechanic you now rely on. For others, it's where you connected with neighbors during the tornado recovery, got updates during the latest snowstorm, or found your first apartment. Maybe you're new to town and this is how you're learning about what makes Dayton special.

That sense of community—of neighbors helping neighbors—that's what makes this place different from other corners of Reddit. That's our north star—what guides every decision we make as moderators.

**About Moderation**

I'll be completely honest with you: moderating political content isn't easy. It's stressful and often a no-win situation. Sometimes we remove posts or comments and get called ""liberal snowflakes"" and ""fascist bootlickers"" on the same day, often for taking down similar comments from the *very same two people arguing with each other*. We get it—when emotions are running high, it's easy to see moderation as censorship or bias.

Our mod team is intentionally made up of people from across the political spectrum. We sought out diverse perspectives to avoid creating an echo chamber and to ensure we approach decisions as fairly and objectively as possible. 

We talk on Discord daily, actively discussing and reviewing many removals together to ensure we're making thoughtful, balanced decisions. While we may not agree on every political issue, we all agree on this: r/dayton should be a place that builds bridges, not walls.

**Why Verification Matters**

Just this week, we had to remove several posts making claims about local businesses that we knew weren't accurate. I'll be transparent: as someone who was heavily involved in the local small business community, I've had personal experiences with many of these business owners. Some of those experiences weren't great. But I've also seen people get accused of things I know for a fact aren't true, and watched as those accusations spread and potentially threatened people's livelihoods—not just the owners, but their employees and their families too.

That's the challenge we're facing: how do we make space for important local discussions while preventing harm from unverified claims? How do we keep our focus on Dayton while acknowledging that national issues affect us too?

**Working Through This Together**

We know there will be gray areas. Sometimes we'll have to make judgment calls that not everyone agrees with. But here's our promise: we'll always try to be transparent about our decisions and open to feedback.

When in doubt, ask yourself: ""Does this help bring Daytonians together or push us further apart? Does this make our community stronger or more divided?""

Remember: that person you're debating in the comments? They might be the bartender who remembers your favorite sour at Barrel House. They might be the parent you often strike up conversations with waiting at the deli line at Dots. They might be your mechanic Brad down the street.

**Moving Dayton Forward**

We get that not everyone will love these changes. But we believe r/dayton can be something special—a place that brings neighbors together instead of driving them apart, where we can have tough conversations while remembering we're all part of the same community.

We’re a small team doing our best to keep things balanced, and we’re always open to hearing you out. We’re not perfect—we don’t always get it right—but we’re constantly trying to learn and improve. If you think a post was removed unfairly, our ModMail is always open. Just give us a holler, and we’ll review it in good faith every time.

**Want to Get Involved?**

If you’re passionate about helping shape r/dayton and keeping it a space where everyone feels welcome, **we’d love to have you join us.** We’re always looking for more perspectives and helping hands on the mod team. You can apply now through[ this form](https://forms.gle/YGqy4aRUjBC8Tz8Q7). Your voice and input could make a real difference.

Whether you've lived here your whole life or just moved to town last week, whether you lean left, right, or neither—this space is for you. Together, we can keep r/dayton a place that makes our city proud.

Stay warm, stay kind, and take care of each other. We’re in this together. ✌️",5,1738771110.0,dayton,1,0.63,False

On erythromycin now for a month.,"I've been on Erythromycin for a month, my heartburn has been much better. But my stools been soft ever since after mid 2nd week. 1st week and a half was TERRIBLE and sometimes I get a stomach aches that go to 9 out of 10 pain level. Thank God I'm in the medical field and knew it wasn't c-diff.

So pros, heartburn is not 24/7, I've  even been able to drink coffee with  out heartburn or stomach pains and be good for 2 or 3 days afterwards before my next stomach ache. Cons stomach aches that can range to ""MOVE OUT THE WAY BATHROOM"" or that bloating pain, ATM bloating. 

The plan is me taking Erythromycin twice a day instead of 3 times, pepcid at night and Protonix twice a day. 

My doctor is very much I should do this surgery cause my esophagus has stomach cells so I have to have a endoscopy once a year. And she doesn't want to put me on reglan 

Things I have questions about: 

●I want to have a child, hopefully started by the end of the year. I'm wondering if that affected anyone who got the surgery, my doctor said it wouldn't be any issues. But then again she prescribed me Erythromycin while i was taking zolft and thank god for my pharmacist...

•Will my stomach hurt and just have soft stool/diarrhea all the time still? 

●Randomly, does it help you loose weight if you are trying to? 

●Lastly, Are you on any daily meds still? I'm okay with that, just wondering.

I have to talk to my insurance and find out how much. My doctor isn't worried cause my empty stomach study was... like 89% was still in my upper stomach by the end. But who knows if I'll be able to get it covered. ",1,1738771024.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False
1iid7r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1iid7r3/struggling_with_a_major_insecurity_in_my_first/,"Struggling with a major insecurity in my first relationship. How can I get over this, if at all?","I am 23M, in my first relationship with F24. She is my first for everything, but I am not her first for anything. She has been through her fair share of relationships and it has built who she is today. I unfortunately do not have the relationship experience, and as a result, there have been a few moments in our relationship where I have messed up due to my inexperience. However all our issues/arguments have been solved within the day through communication and understanding. But there is one thing that has plagued my mind since the 3rd week of us seeing eachother. 

She told me something during our 5th date (we became official on our 3rd date) about 7 months ago, which to this day has not left my mind and continues to plague my conscience. I can be having an extremely positive/productive day and I'll randomly remember this thought and it will ruin my mood. Between our first and second date, I had a holiday booked so we could not see eachother for 10 days, but it turns out during this time, she had a hookup. Now, I look at sex as the most intimate act between a couple. In my opinion there is little to no other acts that show true intimacy/love betwen a couple. I am not ruling out all other things which make a relationship great. For example, being best friends with your partner is also extremely important, but sex in my opinion is among the top. Perhaps I also think the reasons I have these thoughts is jealousy? I will not lie, I have not had luck with women most of my teenage-adult life, but I would be lying if I said I would not have hooked up once or twice, but alas, I am a rather below average looking guy so the opportunity was never there for me. I have brought it up with her 2 times, once very early on and she reassured me with nothing but kindness and love, and once more recently where it was slightly more heated but she told me why/what happened. 

I get intrusive thoughts about this all the time. A large insecurity for me is also that she mentioned she was drunk and it kind of happened, but she has told me in the past that she also cheated on her first boyfriend in the exact same manner. She got drunk and it kind of happened. Now I trust her 100%. I do not think she would be stupid enough to cheat on me as I have treated her like a queen in this relationship. Sure I have fucked up once or twice, but I have been the best boyfriend I can be. We have been practically living together between our parents places' for the last 2-3 months and every morning I wake up before her, make breakfast and coffee for her, go to the shop for her when she needs anything. I will say sometimes I feel suffocated by the amount I do for her but I do it out of my love for her. 

This insecurity of mine is so rampant that I sometimes feel disconnected from her in the relationship and I do not know why. I know she has had many sexual partners before me and while the ones from a relationship do not matter to me at all, the ones which are a result of a hookup do bother me immensly. Knowing the thought that the love of my life has been intimate with a random stranger honestly kind of disgusts me. She has told me flat out during a recent argument that she does not see sex the same way I do which hurt to hear in the moment, especially because our sex life has taken a massive hit in recent times. I have an extremely high libido but I'll be lucky if we have sex more than once a week which honestly is not enough to satisfy my needs. 

I am currently waiting for my second therapy appointment where I will bring this up and hopefully move forward from then. But in the meantime, I would massively appreciate any advice or if anyone would message me and just talk about it.",3,1738770992.0,self,3,1.0,False

1iid64s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iid64s/the_voices_wont_stop_calling_me_and_i_cant_escape/,"The voices won’t stop calling me, and I can’t escape them (Part 1)"," I don’t really know how to start this.

I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is Ezra, I’m 27, and I work as an overnight security guard at an office building. It’s not exactly a dream job, but it pays my bills, and I don’t have to talk to people much. Most nights, I sit in a booth, watching security monitors cycle through dimly lit hallways and empty conference rooms. There’s a rhythm to it—check the screens, drink some gas station coffee, count down the hours until my shift ends.

I’ve always liked working nights. The quiet. The stillness.

But lately, the quiet doesn’t feel empty anymore.

It started small. I’d catch movement in the corner of my eye—just a flicker on the monitor, like someone had passed through the frame an instant before I looked. A shadow in the breakroom. A shape at the edge of the stairwell. At first, I brushed it off. It’s easy to see things that aren’t really there when you’re running on bad coffee and two hours of sleep.
But then, things started happening at home, too. 

At first, it was just the little things—the feeling of being watched when I turned my back, the prickle of unease crawling up my spine in my own apartment. The TV would switch channels on its own, always to static, even though I never left the remote anywhere near me. I’d wake up to find my bedroom door open when I was sure I’d closed it. Once, I came home and found every cabinet in my kitchen wide open, doors gaping like silent mouths. I told myself I must have left them that way. That I’d been careless.

Then, one night, I heard whispering.

I live alone. I don’t own a TV, and my upstairs neighbor works the early shift—by the time I get home, his apartment is dead silent. But as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard it. Soft, almost like breathing. A voice, just on the edge of understanding, murmuring from the dark corner of my room. I held my breath, trying to convince myself I was imagining it.

Then it said my name.

A low whisper, stretched out and drawn thin, curling against my ear like someone was right beside me.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the voice to come again.

But the room was silent.

And somehow, that was worse.

That’s why I’m writing this.

I need to put it down somewhere. Maybe if I see it all written out, it’ll make more sense.

I live alone in a small apartment—not much bigger than a box. One bedroom, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom with a sink that leaks no matter how many times I twist the knobs shut. The walls are thin enough that I hear my upstairs neighbor pacing at night, the dull thud-thud-thud of his footsteps moving back and forth, back and forth. I don’t know his name.

I don’t have a lot of visitors. I don’t sleep much, either—never have.

Even as a kid, I used to lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house settle in the dark. The groan of pipes. The creak of floorboards shifting under invisible weight. I used to imagine someone was walking around downstairs, moving through the kitchen, standing at the bottom of the staircase.

I think that’s because I grew up in a house that was never quiet.

My mom—she had rules. Not the normal kind, like making your bed or saying “please” and “thank you.” No, her rules were different.

Don’t leave mirrors uncovered at night. Never open the door if someone knocks past midnight. And the big one—if you ever hear your name whispered in an empty room, never, ever answer.

She believed in things. Spirits, bad energy, ghosts. She never said those words exactly, but I knew that’s what she meant. I remember waking up some nights to find her standing in the hallway, whispering under her breath, rubbing something along the doorframes. A white, powdery substance.

I never asked what it was.

I didn’t want to know.

One night, after my mom had finished whatever ritual she was doing with the powder around the doorframes, she sat down at the kitchen table. Her eyes were distant, like she was staring through everything in the room. I was supposed to be asleep, but I couldn’t help myself—sometimes, I’d watch her when she didn’t know. This night, she finally spoke. ""There are things you can’t see, Ezra,"" she said, her voice soft, almost sad. “Things that follow you. They watch.” She paused, her eyes flicking toward the hallway, as though she were expecting something to step out of the shadows. I asked her what she meant, but she didn’t answer right away. When she did, her words were careful, measured, like she was telling me something I wasn’t supposed to know. ""If you ever hear your name, even when no one's around... don't answer, Ezra. You don't know what might be on the other side."" Her voice was almost a whisper by the end, like she was afraid someone—or something—might hear. I didn’t understand then, but it stuck with me. In the back of my mind, I always wondered what she was really afraid of.

My dad, on the other hand, thought she was crazy. He was a mean drunk, the kind that never really sobers up. He’d come home late, clattering around in the kitchen, slamming cabinets, muttering under his breath about money or work or nothing at all. My mom would sit at the table, staring past him, her hands folded neatly in her lap.
I had a little sister, too. Molly. She was five years younger than me, small and pale with wide brown eyes. She followed me everywhere. I was protective of her—I had to be. 
Molly was different. Quiet. She had this way of watching the world, like she was trying to understand it from a distance. Sometimes I’d catch her staring at me, her eyes wide and serious, and it would make me uncomfortable. I don’t think she ever fully understood what was going on with Mom and Dad. She was too young. But she felt it. I could see it in the way she clung to me, like I was the only thing that made sense in the chaos. I always felt responsible for her—like if anything ever happened, it was on me to keep her safe. 

I haven’t thought about them in a long time.

I don’t know why I’ve been thinking about them now.

Maybe it’s because of what I found last week.

I was going through some old boxes in my closet—stuff I hadn’t touched in years. Most of it was junk. Old clothes, tangled-up phone chargers, a few notebooks filled with half-scribbled ideas for stories I never finished. But at the bottom of one box, beneath a stack of old birthday cards and yellowed newspaper clippings, I found something that didn’t belong.

It was a photograph.

A picture of me and Noah.

Noah was my best friend when I was a kid. We did everything together—rode bikes through the neighborhood, climbed trees in the woods behind my house, stayed up late telling scary stories in his basement.

And then, one summer, he was gone.

I was eight. He was nine.

The picture must have been taken the day it happened. In it, we’re standing in front of an old, abandoned house at the edge of town. I remember that place. Everyone said it was haunted. Broken windows, rotting wood, a front door that hung open just enough to make you wonder what was inside.

Noah wanted to prove ghosts were real.

He and I had always been adventurous—riding bikes through alleys, sneaking into abandoned buildings, climbing trees like we owned the damn forest—but that day felt different. There was something in the air, thick and buzzing like electricity. We had packed a bag with snacks, flashlights, and a few bottles of water, though I don’t think we ever really planned on drinking them. It was more about the thrill of the unknown, the idea that we were doing something most kids our age were too scared to even think about.
We headed into the woods behind my house, the trees arching overhead like dark cathedral ceilings, shadows stretching long and deep as the sun began to dip lower. Noah was a few steps ahead, his usual grin plastered on his face.

“Hurry up, slowpoke,” he called, pushing aside a branch. “What, you scared already?”

“Piss off,” I shot back, but I jogged to catch up.

The trees pressed in around us, the branches scratching against each other like whispers. The ground felt weird under my feet, like it was shifting ever so slightly with every step. I shook it off. It was just nerves.

We came to a clearing, and there it was—the house. Old. Abandoned. The roof sagging, the windows black and empty like missing eyes.

Noah whistled. “Damn. It looks even creepier up close.”

I swallowed hard. “We don’t have to go in.”

Noah turned to me, smirking. “You kidding? This is what we came for. Thought you weren’t scared.”

“I’m not.”

“Prove it.”

He was already climbing the porch steps, and I had no choice but to follow. The wood groaned under our weight. He pressed his hand against the door, and with barely a push, it swung open with a long, aching creak.

The air inside was thick, stale, carrying the scent of mildew and something else—something rotten.

“Smells like ass in here,” Noah muttered, pulling his shirt up over his nose.

“Maybe we shouldn’t—” 

“Too late,” he grinned, flicking on his flashlight.

We moved deeper inside, our footsteps muffled by years of dust and neglect. The house was still, like it had been waiting for someone to disturb it. I ran my fingers along the peeling wallpaper, my skin crawling at the dampness beneath.

“Bet this place is full of ghosts,” Noah said, his voice teasing but quiet.

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah, sure. You believe in ghosts now?”

He grinned. “I don’t need to believe. You’re scared enough for both of us.”

“I am not!” I shouted, and Noah gave me the signal to hush

He then just laughed and kept moving.

Room by room, we explored—broken furniture, old picture frames with faces too faded to make out, cabinets filled with dust and forgotten things. We found a rusted knife on the kitchen counter, its blade eaten away by time. Noah picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

“Maybe it belonged to a murderer,” he said, waving it toward me.

“Jesus, put that down.”

He smirked, tossing it back onto the counter with a clatter. “Relax.”

Then we found the basement door.

Noah grabbed the handle and jiggled it. Unlocked.

He turned to me, his eyes glinting. “This is where the real shit happens.”

I hesitated. The air was different here, heavier. My stomach twisted.

“Noah, maybe we should—”

But he was already yanking the door open.

A wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below. The stairs stretched down into absolute blackness.

Noah took the first step, flashlight beam bouncing along the walls. “You coming, or what?”

I swallowed hard and followed.

Step by step, deeper into the dark.

The smell was worse down here—thick, wet, like mold and rot and something else I couldn’t place. The air pressed against my skin, and I shivered.

“Noah,” I whispered.

But he didn’t answer.

I swung my flashlight around.

He was gone.

Just… gone.

And then—

Nothing.

I remember that much.

But as I stared at the photo, I realized something was wrong.

I didn’t remember this picture being taken.

I don’t even remember bringing a camera that day.

And then, there was something else. In the background, behind us, there was a figure in one of the upstairs windows. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light—a shadow, a smudge, something explainable. But the longer I looked, the less sure I became. It was a person. A pale face, dark eyes, staring down at us.

I flipped the picture over. There was something written on the back, in faded ink. A date.

July 15th, 2005.

The day Noah died.

I’ve told myself that for years, but I don’t think that’s true.

The next thing I remember is running home, my arms scraped up, my shirt torn, my breath hitching in my chest. My mom grabbing my shoulders, shaking me, asking—""Where’s Noah? Where is he?!""

But I didn’t know.

I didn’t know. 

The police found his body two days later, deep in the basement of that house. They said he must have fallen through the floor. An accident.

A tragedy.

That’s what they called it.

But sometimes, late at night, I wonder.

I dream about that house. About walking down those rotting stairs, the air thick and stale, the darkness pressing in. I dream about Noah’s face, pale and wide-eyed, his mouth open like he’s trying to scream.

And in my dreams, I’m standing over him.

Watching.

I don’t know why I’m dreaming about it again. I haven’t thought about it for years. But it’s been getting worse, these last few nights. The dreams. The whispers.
It’s like I can feel somet hing watching me when I wake up. The air is different somehow, thick with a presence I can’t explain. I check the apartment, even though I know it’s just me. I’ve never been the type to jump at noises, but these days, even the smallest sound gets under my skin.

A tap at the window. The floor creaking in the hallway.

But it’s not just the noises. It’s the feeling.

It’s like something’s waiting for me to figure it out, like I’m on the verge of remembering something.

And maybe that’s why I went digging in the first place. Maybe I wanted to find some kind of closure. Maybe I thought finding Noah’s picture would bring me peace.

Instead, it only brought more questions.

I burned the photograph.

I don’t know why. Maybe I was scared of what it meant. Maybe I was scared of myself.

But it didn’t change anything.

Because last night, I woke up to something whispering my name.

And this time, I almost answered.

You must buy a coffee (or whatever) on your SP card with round up each week.

**Let's break down your spend requirements on this:**

Card Usage: $2 coffee = $104/year.   
Round Up $1 = $52 BTC buy/year.

**Now let's break down Shakepay's possible revenue on this:**

* 2% spread on your round up = $1.04 / year. This is the revenue they make from you directly.  
* 2% Interchange revenue from your card purchase = $2.08 / year (2% of your $104 in card spend). This revenue comes from the merchant, not you. 
* Then they give you 1% back in BTC for your card purchase = -($1.04) / year. 

So, net revenue for Shakepay = $2.08 / year (Spread on your Round Up + Interchange - Cashback BTC).

**Is this what people are bitching about? To get over $500 in free BTC for shaking your phone, you must buy $52 in BTC (and that's assuming a full $1 round up each week…) and give Shakepay a spread of $1.04 / year.**

And Shakepay makes $1.04 in revenue from you per year, and $1.04 in revenue from the merchant per year.

Are people seriously complaining about this? Fuck the freeloaders… Complain about the spread? Then buy/sell somewhere else. Complain about not getting enough free shit for shaking your phone? Go find another charity.

I also read that many users only use the double basket. However, I still select ‘Single Shot’ during extraction.

At first, I found it a bit strong, but now I actually enjoy it because I can taste more coffee in my cappuccino. It does feel a bit strange, though, since I’m using twice as many beans (around 20g) for a single cappuccino with the double basket, yet still choosing a Single Shot for extraction.

I’ve already lowered the tamper to nearly the max, and I’m now getting 19-20g of ground coffee—so reducing it further isn’t really an option.

i have a few different meds and prns (as needed). venlafaxine, quetiapine, diazepam, zopiclone. i am not dependent on the prns.  
  
however, i have been dependent on caffeine from coffee many years before these meds, around 200mg/day, i'm now coming off for anxiety and rtms. i take it now as prn med 150mg ir pill form  
  
it is one of the most powerful meds i have, more so even than benzos. it is the fastest acting med i have. faster than the fastest benzo. it will make you feel better and fuck your sleep more than the max dose of my antidepressant. the anxiety shake and sweat effect is as strong or stronger than benzo has anti anxiety.  
  
i would say it is very bad in terms of habit forming, with fewer side effects than some drugs though. it's short acting and you get a tolerance  
  
the main side effects are anxiety, indigestion and poor sleep  
  
the withdrawals are bad easily as bad as switching antidepressant for me. it will knock you out completely if you stop taking it  
  
overall caffeine is not a good med at all. i don't know anyone who is prescribing it as a daily med. what's crazy is that almost everyone is on it every day...  
  
i've never tried alcohol, but that seems also like a bad med to be on in terms of depressant and anxiolitic, lots of side effects, short acting, habit forming again. many people are on it!!!!",2,1738770502.0,decaf,0,0.75,False

So, got my stuff done there, and as I was about to head back home, I realized I was near the same jewelry store where I had once bought a silver ring for myself. Naturally, my brain went, “Hey, why not get an another one? The store’s right here anyway.”

Now, if you’ve read my previous posts, you already know I’ve told my mum that my bank balance is ₹73,441, when in reality, it’s ₹56,772 (yeah, a ₹16,669 difference). If I had bought the ring, which would have easily costed me around ₹2,000, that gap would’ve widened to ₹19,669. But guess what? The universe had other plans.

I reached the jewelry store, and… the shutter was down. Closed. No ring for me.

Alright, fine. I thought, “Might as well treat myself to a cup of coffee.” I remembered there was a 7-Eleven nearby, so I started walking towards it. But when I got to where it used to be… it was just gone. I went inside an another shop and asked about it, and the guy casually said, “Oh, that place? It shut down permanently.”

At this point, I just stood there like: So… no ring, no coffee… 

Had no choice but to head back home, wallet intact but soul completely unsatisfied. And honestly, I don’t even know why I do this to myself when I know damn well my bank balance is crying for mercy.",1,1738770287.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,0.67,False

Getting real tired of ordering something like a fruit cheesecake only for it to be regular cheesecake with the fruit on top. I run into so many names like strawberry shortcake for a cheesecake, strawberry cream, strawberry swirl, etc. It's very confusing and quite frankly annoying. When someone orders a coffee cheesecake, nobody expects coffee poured all over it. If I order a carrot cake, I won't expect slices of carrot on top of it. If I order strawberry ice-cream, I always get strawberry flavored ice cream and not just plain basic icecream aka vanilla with just strawberry chunks or syrup topping. So, what's the deal with cheesecake then? I order a strawberry one and it's just regular cheesecake topped with strawberry and then I order a raspberry one and it's mixed in. The name should tell you all you need about the item. No one wants to ask all these questions about how its prepared with a confused look on the servicer's face when the ambiguity should not be there. German Chocolate cake is always expected to be a decadent chocolate cake with coconut shavings. They gave it a name that is recognized widely for this. Why not in this situation as well?

I swept and wiped down every counter. I even took our trash with us as the outside receptacle was filled (by prior guests). I replaced 4 tablespoons of coffee in a jar as I had used that much. We did nothing wrong. I left the host a 5 star review and they left one for me. The next day, I received a request for $1000 to replace a mattress, mattress protector, sheets, and for mattress disposal. They claim we urinated in the bed. My 13 year old daughter is the only one who slept in that bed and absolutely did not do this! While I believed that she did not, I even inspected the clothes she slept in. This is a completely false accusation.  How am I supposed to prove this though?  I never thought that we needed to strip all the beds upon arrival and take pictures of the mattresses. 

Obviously upset, I sent a message to the host and attempted to call them twice. They eventually called back and told me to decline the request and said 3 times that they want to make sure I know that they “aren’t scammers”. I never insinuated that they were and that thought had not even crossed my mind. They said Airbnb’s insurance would cover it and to not worry about it and not let it ruin my day.

[unlimited budget],"I am well aware there is a disdain for any kind of pods/capsules on this subreddit but hear me out. As a hobbyist and a grinder/decent espresso machine owner, I decided to buy a machine for my workplace since buying from coffee shops daily OR preparing coffee at home and taking it out is just not efficient for me anymore.

Since I won't be using it just by myself I suppose it will be used often, so I am thinking of buying a pod/capsule machine to avoid the constant clean up. I couldn't find much info online, so I decided to ask for help here. The ESE pods being bio-degradable is a huge pro for me, but I notice that they are not much used especially in America while there are several types of aluminum capsules, and they are heavily marketed (and looks like more used). Which coffee has better taste (ESE pods or capsules) and what are some other factors to weigh on the decision?

So far we have stayed in Arecibo, Guánica, and Rincón and all of those areas were delightful, each one different. 
In Arecibo we stayed at an AirBnB directly on the ocean. We got lucky and missed riptides, so my family could swim a little in the rough waves, but it was a little scary for me. There wasn’t much to do in Arecibo, but we found a couple of restaurants nearby, drove to the caves to hike a bit, relaxed on the beautiful beach. 
Guánica was lovely. Driving from San Juan through the mountains was so cool. We stayed at Copamarina on the calm Caribbean and went out every morning to explore the area, returning in the afternoon to relax at the pools and beach. I never felt more rested in my life. We walked around Ponce, took a tour at a coffee plantation, had lunch at La Manada (superb!). 
Rincón was fantastic for my large family group. We stayed at a property directly in the Caribbean and the gentle waves were perfect for my grandkids. Everything was convenient from the dive shop for scuba to the restaurants and grocery stores, food trucks, fruit & vegetables stands.  The vibe was very fun. 
I don’t know where in PR we’ll go next year, but for us the island has never disappointed. We love it. See you in 2026!

Ep1: BETTER FUTURE.,"It was raining heavily outside. He was getting soaked. He fisted his hands and walked towards the house. His vision was covered with his own wet hair, and all he could smell was blood. He knocked on the door, no one answered. He knocked again but this time a bit harder. No one answered. He could hear mumbling inside.
They were home.

He waited for a couple of seconds before knocking for a final time. This time , a man answered... He weakly said from behind the door:
"" Who...Who is it?"" It seemed as if he was disturbed , disturbed for what he has done. The blood thirsty beast just showed his badge through the peep hole. The man went completely silent.
He was hesitant for opening the door. But he did.

He felt guilty and dirty for throwing that party...
He was willing to help.

But he...he was there to hurt...

The cop took a few steps in before throwing a punch at the man. He was flabbergasted, he wasn't expecting that. Then the cop picked him up like he was nothing and beat on him to the point were his white shirt was turning red.

"" You alone?Where are your friends?"" He was bursting with rage , but he said that in a nonchalant and almost friendly tone.

The man could only spew out a few words...

"" I'm... sorry...""

"" Answer the question. Where are they?""

"" Just give me a second please...""

The cop looked around. The house was filthy.

Flies and maggots feasting on left over food.

The strong smell of ammonia hurting his nose.

And a strange writing on the wall.

"" Do you know Jerry's? Jerry's bar."" The poor bastard said laying on the floor.

"" Yeah, been there a couple of times.""

"" They went there to cool off.""

The man smirked and took out his hand cuffs.
Then he proceeded to cuff the man and bring him along for a ride.

"" From here on try not to say anything, it will be used against you.""

"" I'm so sorry...""

He gently sat the perp in the backseat.It wasn't a long drive. The whole ride was silent except for the drops of rain bombarding the car. The car was comfortable, clean and old.
Really old. There were  some stickers barely hanging on the left window. Stickers of the famous fictional character , ""Vesper"" and some of his rouge gallery.

Eventually, they've arrived at the bar.

"" Sit tight, it won't take long.""

He left , and all the man could do was to watch.

Right as the cop opened the door to the bar , he could see a glimpse of his friends playing a game of pool.

He could see the cop through the windows. He was enjoying a drink. He even turned to him and cheered in his health before taking a sip.

He signaled something to the bartender, and he left him a baseball bat behind the counter. Before grabbing the bat, he paid for his drink and for the damages that this place was going to endure.

He saw the man walk over to the pool Table and then he couldn't see anything else.
A few seconds passed. More seconds passed.

All of a sudden, one of his friends was thrown out the window with glass all over him. His legs were both broken. His fingers were all in the wrong directions. He saw the bones pocking out of his legs. He couldn't move but he was still alive. The man In the car started hyperventilating. He was frozen with fear...

A few more seconds went by...

It stopped raining.

Suddenly a shriek was let out from inside the bar. It was ear piercing. That cop , that officer walked out of the bar with a couple of bruises on his face , he looked half dead. He got closer and closer to his car. When he got there he picked up his radio and spoke into it:

"" This is sergeant Cole Frost... 
Code blue at 345 Kimberly street, Jerry's.""

Then he leaned against the car and waited for those red and blue lights to approach.
 
( Title card 🔥)

One man's ego , one man's will for change...
Shaped The future. 

After the great war in the mid 2000s and the separation of the States, A lot of establishments were made to be a new , modern way for people to join the force and resume the fight for what's right.

The states that were against the separation became allies but they ultimately lost and were destroyed.

These establishments were called ""Agencys"" many of them were built throughout the 2010s , for the army, Navy , marines and as mentioned,the force. With each state in control of everything for themselves and having their own governments, they made a program for a lot of people and their families that fought for the right side in the war, to join for free.

They renamed everything.Technology grew more and more everyday thanks to one man...the great Bruce sterling... Entire streets and parks and harbors were named after him and his greatness. Because of him , life became easier. Easier for the majority... Hell for the unlucky fellow.
He made prisons for soliders who fought and feared change. The ones that weren't caught became homeless, guilds were made. Resentment was shaped and it grew stronger everyday.

Many people still believe that the separation was pointless and it did more harm than good.

Now almost 40 years after the revolution many people started to hate the police. They lost their faith in them. And they found them unnecessary...


It got to the point where the government steadily ,lowered their fundings. Some stations barely have enough power to keep the lights on.

Many left and resigned. But some still believe they can get people's approval back. Some still believe in redemption. So they keep on fighting.

D_ Agent Mccaghy, please come in. Take a sit...

J_ What? Sir did I do something wrong? Am I fired?

D_ quiet the opposite!. This morning I had a phone call with a police captain in blighten.
They want you... Congratulations son!.

J_ Sir with all due respect, is this a prank? Did Hal put you up to this? I still have like two years left in the agency.

D_ He wanted two of my top agents. So I sent him your resume. Here take a look for yourself.

J_ Oh my god!. I can't believe it!. Thank you sir. Thank you so much for everything.

D_ You deserve it.

J_ You mentioned, he wanted two agents, Who is the other?

D_ Katie Raven.

on his way out his friends ambushed him, and both of them attacked him with a bear hug. Tears of joy in their eyes , Jake felt safe and happy with them...but mostly he was suffocating because of the hug.)

Hal_ We'll miss you man...you were one of the less boring people here.

K_ Agent Mccaghy, congrats on the promotion.

J_ Thank you Katie, congrats to you as well.

K_ Thanks. I hope we can have a good and professional relationship In the near future.

J_ uh, sure yeah same. 

( She was prettier than ever. Jake was falling apart from the inside out. Tears were forming underneath his eyes. Not of joy this time...but of loss and sorrow.)

J_ Hey uh...me , case and hal were gonna have a couple of drinks later tonight. Would you like to come?

K_ I'd love to , but me and my boyfriend are going out later this evening.

J_ oh , I understand. See you later then.

( Jake was clueless that she wanted him to say something, anything. She wanted him to be direct. She wanted him to say what he wants.
But he didn't... He just fought the tears.)

K_ next time that we see each other, we'll be detectives...

J_ yeah...who would have thought? This early. But as the director said himself , we deserve it.

K_ That we do...
See ya around detective.

( Then she just walked away... Leaving him in limbo. He sat down and thought of what could have been. He didn't want her to ruin his happiness. He tried not to think about her.
He was unsuccessful.)

( Cole woke up by the sound of his alarm still wearing the blood ridden shirt. He had a huge headache. He stayed up late again . Eventually he got up and out of his bed. The first thing he did was going to the bathroom to do his deeds.
Bottles and bottles of booze laying around on his desk , bed and floor. He left the closet's door open again with his side project inside. After taking out a new shirt and a jacket he closed it. He didn't even bother cleaning his shirt he just threw it away. He made himself a cup of coffee and enjoyed it. He loves his morning coffee. Probably because the coffee at the precinct tastes like cat piss. He took his special pills and left.

After getting inside his car, the first thing he did was blasting his music to fully wake up. With less traffic in the morning, the drive was actually nice and enjoyable. After a few minutes he arrived at work.)

( Cole walked back to his office disappointed and angry. 
The scent of the flowers had filled the entire room. 
He took a long look at his flowers resting in a bowl filled with ice water. It calmed him down a little.)


( Jake was eagerly waiting for his friends to show up. Eventually they arrived at his apartment. And all three of them set off to the nearest bar.
They kept talking about all the fond memories they had together. Because of that, sadness was creeping up on them.
They were on the verge of drowning in thought and sorrow but luckily for them they had just arrived at the place where any kind of thought good or bad , would be forgotten and replaced with Nothingness...at least for a little while.
Although this couldn't be said for casey.

Casey had to drive'em back home so he couldn't really drink or as they like to call it ,  ""get shit faced"".

Inside, Jake saw a couple sitting together enjoying a few drinks , laughing and having a good time.
Jake could only smile for them, but deep down he was jealous.

His breakup with Katie was over three months ago. ""Coward"". That's what he called himself. 

""Did she really move on this quickly?"" 

Hal derailed Jake's train of pain by yelling at him to sit his ""pretty butt"" down. Jake follows orders incredibly well so he did.

They ordered the first set of drinks and a pop for casey.

They drank and drank. Casey was just watching them shitting on their faces...
While he couldn't. Petty.

They talked about all the cases they've been a part of and then they did more drinking.

Two shots turned into three and then somehow three turned into six... And then, six turned into eight.

"" Guys I forgot my wallet back home!."" Casey remembered.

"" It's (hiccup) on meeee..."" Hal said. 

"" No...No way I'll pay...it's on meee..."" Jake argued.)

H_ Fuck you looking at maan??(Hiccup) Do you want to eat me like a bug? 
( He drunkenly pointed at Casey)

J_ Yeeeah...eat him like a bug...I'd love to watch.

Ca_ What the fuck are you talking about?What's in these?

H_ C'mon, eaaat me like a buug...

Ca_ alright, time to go... y'all had your fun.

J_ No. I have something to sayy to that smug faced asshooole.

H_ Whoo?

J_ That guy oveer there... He is kissing Katie!. Son of a bitch...

Ca_ Oh no you don't!. Sit your ass down.here eat some peanuts.

H_ He's allergic!.

J_ No I'm not...liar.

Ca_ Is he?

H_ I don't know. How am I supposed to know?!

J_ I am not!.

Ca_ Ok!...ok...just stand up I'll hold your hands. We'll walk to the car.

H_ What about the dude who's kissing Katie?

Ca_ You guy's sit in the car and I'll go talk to him.

J_ What would I do without you?

( Casey held their hands like a parent and sat them down in the backseat.Then he took Jake's wallet with him and went back inside to pay.)

J_ did you beat his aaass?

Ca_ Yeah sure buddy I did.

J_ Thank you....( Then he passed out.)

( Hal farted. But Jake didn't notice. Hal was laying on Jake. Casey rolled down his window and drove to his place.

"" He still loves her , How am I going to tell him...""

Guilt overtook Casey's soul.)


( Out of curiosity Cole was studying Jake's resume.

He was the top of his class back in the academy and joined the agency because of his grandfather's war efforts. When he was only 22 he brought down bill harper. One of the biggest fraudsters to ever live. Well eventually he got out because of his connections but non the less, the kid had gathered enough evidence on him to lock him up for a few weeks.
""That's not nothing, especially for an agency kid"".cole thought to himself.
His arrest numbers were high. Highest than anybody else there. With a total of 84 through 2 years. Considering that most of them were fraudsters, he did really well.
Big names were listed there.)

C_ Maybe I was overreacting... the kid seems to be talented.

M_ Hey sarge , sorry for bothering you but Danny wanted to speak with you. He said it's urgent!.

C_ It's never you who brothers me moll. Is he in forensics?

M_ yeah.

( Cole stood up and left his room. He made his way downstairs and stood Infront of the door that read FORENSICS With bold red letters on it. He waited for a couple of seconds...
Danny should have let him in by now... 
He entered the code to the room on the side panel and it opened...
The room was dark.
Danny was there... 
laying on the floor with blood all around him...
Standing next to him , was a man holding a bloodied knife . He was scared.

"" DROP YOUR WEAPON AND GET ON YOUR KNEES!"" Cole drew his gun. 

The man did so as he asked. Cole went inside and got closer and closer to the killer he recognised him... The same coward he visited last night In the rain. Some other officers that were around followed cole inside and one of them cuffed the perp.

Danny wasn't fully dead yet and cole realised...

He went towards him. Right before life faded from his eyes he gurgled: "" Tell them...I forgive them.""

C_ What?No!. Danny stay with me! Medic... I need a medic!!!... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? ( He pointed towards the killer))


J_ Jesus...I feel horrible!...

H_ How much did we drink last night?

Ca_ You both had 8 shots in like 40 minutes...

J_ How aren't we dead?

Ca_ I don't know...

H_ Did we do or say anything weird?

Ca_ Well yeah. You wanted me to ""eat you like a bug"" and Jake wanted to beat up a guy.

J_ Did I?

Ca_ No , i stopped you.

H_ I'm gonna go wash off a little...

J_ And I'm going to a corner to die.

Ca_ But guys you didn't even touch your cereal!.
I think I have something that could possibly help with your hangover.

J_ Is it the salt thing again?

Ca_ yup.

H_ That doesn't help, it just adds more to the pain.

Ca_ Don't be a little baby just take a tiny sneef...
( He went inside his room to find it.)

H_ while he is gone, imma go take a shower. Enjoy the salt thing.

J_ I will brother. I sure will.

Ca_ Where did he go?

H_ I'm taking a shower!...( Hal screamed from the bathroom)

Ca_ Here ( he passed it to Jake.)

( Jake took the gentlest sneef ever and even then it still burned like a bitch.)

J_ God! Whoa!.

Ca_ Feeling better?

J_ Not really...no.

Ca_ Hey I wanted to talk to you about something.

J_ what is it man? (Sneef sneef)

Ca_ Last night you kept on calling for Katie in your sleep. And the guy I mentioned that you wanted to beat up, was because you thought he was kissing Katie...

J_ Dude , me and her are done. Drunk me is a few months behind...

Ca_ you were crying...well ,sobbing throughout the whole night.

J_ Trust me , sober me doesn't even think about her bro.

Ca_ You clearly still have feelings for her...

J_ No , I'm just...
I don't know...
I guess I'm trying to...

Ca_ Trying to what?

J_ Hmm? Trying to... let go...

Ca_ By shrieking her name all night long?

J_ I had to get it out of my system probably...

Ca_ uh huh...I don't want you to get hurt...she has a boyfriend now...

J_ That's great news!. ( no it's fucking not)
( So she wasn't lying earlier...she really did move on this quick.)

Ca_ I care about you man. You need to stop thinking about her and move on.

J_ How certain are you on the boyfriend thing?

Ca_ I...saw her...with another guy.

J_ Well I mean it's a free country maybe she was just talking to him or something...not every guy that talks to her is her boyfriend silly.

Ca_ Yeah well...they... were kissing. So...

J_ oh... french kissing or???

Ca_ JAKE IM SEEING HER OK?!

J_ What?

Ca_ Katie and I have been seeing eachother for a couple of weeks now...

J_ (You fucking homewrecker!) Oh...ok.

Ca_ I just don't want things to get weird...

J_ ( you made them wired asshole.)no no it's fine. Like I said I don't care anymore...( Fuck you.)

Ca_ So we cool?

J_ (Fuck) yeah(you)yeah(Fuck)of course (you).

Ca_ I'm so glad to hear it... If you want to talk with someone about this I'm your guy... And if you still like her just tell me...and I'll go away.

J_ ( say you like her , say you like her...) it's ok.
(Pussy...)

Ca_ Alright. When is your flight?

J_ tomorrow at 9 AM. 

Ca_ Katie's at the same time as well!. You know what? I'll drive you two there.

J_ No no thank you. I don't want to make things more awkward than it already is...

Ca_ I understand.

J_ Thanks for the cereal and the...salt.

Ca_ you're leaving? Wait a little bit for hal and then we'll leave together.

J_ nah I like to walk. Thanks.

Ca_ oh here is your wallet. I forgot mine and you offered to pay.

J_ of course I did... Say bye to hal for me.

H_ BYE...( He screamed)

J_ See you guys tomorrow at the airport. Bye for now.

Ca_ Bye man. And again I'm here for you don't you forget that.

J_ I won't.

( Jake put his earbuds on and listened to music while he was walking back home.

""Why did Katie lie about going out on the evening while Casey was with us?
It's probably because she doesn't like him...
Is she doing this so that she could get back at me? Or...is she cheating on Casey? Naah...she wouldn't do that."")


( Fluorescent lights above their heads twitching at times. With one giant see through mirror on the wall overshadowing them. The killer had no emotions on his face...he was numb. The walls were thin...he could over hear cole and Charlie arguing and grieving. He took a look at his hands. Blood. He has ascended. He made his god very happy.

""Answer me damnit!!!. Why did you murder him?"" The officer yelled...

He didn't say a word. He didn't budge. He just sat there focusing on one spot on the table.
It was a stain. Coffee maybe? He thought.
A stain like all of these worthless idiots running around all day not doing anything positive for anybody.)

C_ it's ok Hamish I'll take it from here. You can go.

H_ give him hell...
( He said to cole before leaving.)

C_ Terry was it?

T_...

C_ Terry Jackson. 23 years old. The son of Clarence Jackson. Top student in your college I see...what a shame. Do you have any idea who was the man you just slaughtered?...
28 STAB WOUNDS!!!. For the love of god... YOU ORPHANED THREE BOYS!.

I don't want to know why...

I want to know how...

T_...

( Cole puts away the tablet he was holding.)

C_ How you got out of your cell , how you got a knife and how you went inside his room...
Someone helped you. Someone who's here. An officer? A detective? A fucking bystander? Who?

T_ I had to do It. Now I am one of his children.
Now HE LOVES ME.

C_ Answer the fucking question!.

T_ The day shall come that all of you... especially you sergeant Frost...will pay. For it is because of your sacrifice that we will all ascend!. Till that day we shall all hail HERESY!!!
I have already played my part...
 now it's your turn.

( Tears of blood started coming out of Terry's eyes...blood that was like acid burning his face.
He was melting. He fell on the floor convulsing.

His plan didn't really work as he would have wanted...the tears eventually stopped. With his face completely gone he cursed Cole and everyone else in the building and got up. Then he proceeded to slam his face onto the table with so much force and speed...that his head was completely blown into pieces.
With the rest of the acidic blood coming out of the place where his neck bone should have been, and making a hole through the table.)



After saying his goodbyes to his director and leaving for the airport he felt a hole in his stomach. He was going to miss that building.
His desk underneath the AC. The coffee machines there. His friends and colleagues...
His director ,who to him was like a father. A father he never had. He arrived at the airport...
Hal , Casey and Katie were all already there.

From afar, he watched as Casey hugged and kissed Katie...
he waited for her to leave. Then he showed himself. Casey and hal had tears in their eyes saying goodbye to their friends. The thought of not seeing them everyday made their skin's crawl.

After receiving another suffocating bear hug he made his way through the terminal and eventually he got in the plane. Katie was a few sits behind him. 
""This is captain peralta speaking we are going to have a delightful flight to...."" 
Jake put on his earbuds and listened to his feelings.
Katie noticed him. He was right Infront of her but she couldn't see him...The man she loved wasn't there.
Jake was thinking about his future.
He felt happy, sad and hopeful.

A future that he had no idea what was holding for him... Holding for them.

End of this episode!.

1iiciwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1iiciwy/at_least_i_tried_im_glad_i_tried/,"At least, I tried. I'm glad I tried.","I was only grade 7 when I first saw you. Of course, I'm not the type of guy that will do everything to be with you. I was just watching you from afar every afternoon because I really can't do anything. You have your own circle of friends and a best friend who was always with you since day one.

  
Well, you're really out of my league ever since. You're pretty, famous, smart and everything I could ever asked for. While me, meh. I was never good at anything. I'm just an introvert kid who has an old soul. 

  
Days passed and school year ends, and I never saw you again. I don't know where you went but I heard you transferred to another school because of your father's work. That time, I was really sad down to my core and I really couldn't do anything about it, and it sucks. Ever since you're gone, I've been praying to God to meet you or just to see you again.

  
I guess this is the essence of growing up. It's a journey marked by both sudden and gradual shifts, encountered every single day. As time passes, you may feel increasingly overwhelmed and depleted by life's demands.

With age, the familiar becomes challenging, responsibilities weigh heavier, and the world seems to expand while your own ideas shrink. Navigating the complexities of life feels like maneuvering through a maze that grows more bewildering. Authenticity can feel disregarded, disagreement mistaken for insecurity, and declining opportunities seen as weakness. Society's emphasis on titles and success can overshadow personal fulfillment, making it draining to conform and set aside passions deemed impractical.

These transitions vary for each individual, but they all lead to unexpected discoveries. 

Then boom, pandemic came, and I decided to take IT as my course. I don't know if it's fate or God's will, but I'm really glad we were at the same course. It's like a dream come true and I couldn't ask for anything at that moment. 

This time, I tried messaging you first about our assignment lol. I know my questions were nonsense but I'm glad you answered. 

Our friendship started and things were going great.

I still remember the time you asked me if I can play Valorant with you. Even though my computer before was crappy as hell, I did everything I could but sadly, my computer was really outdated and couldn't run that game. Of course, I'm sad and disappointed. Sorry I wasn't rich, but I wish you knew I really did my best.

Fast forward, the school announced that the first F2F trial class will be held. My heart was so happy because after all the waiting, I'd be able to see you and meet you this time as friends.  

The f2f class came and I saw you again in the same place you used to stay when we were grade 7. You greeted me with a smile on your face and my heart stopped for a while. All I did for 3 seconds was to stare at you with shock. All I could ever think was: ""This is it; I am a bit tired; the sunset is irritated by clouds. And I love you, I love you, love you-and perhaps this is how the whole enormous world, shining all over, can be created-out of five vowels and three consonants.""

My only regret that moment was I never reached out my hands to shake yours. 

The thought that you exist is so divinely blissful in itself that it is ridiculous to talk about the everyday sadness of separation - a week's, ten days' - what does it matter? since my whole life belongs to you.

  
If only you knew how much I liked you. I tell myself all the time, like a secret I’m almost ready to share—but never do. It’s there in the way I remember your coffee order, how you like two sugars but no milk because “milk ruins the vibe.”

It’s in the way my eyes always find the tiny scar on your wrist, making me wonder about its story, though I’m too afraid to ask. You move through the world so effortlessly, and I can’t help but wonder if you realize how much space you take up in my mind.

I catch myself overthinking every little thing. Should I text you first, or would that seem too eager? Did I laugh too hard at your joke about pineapples on pizza, or was it just the right amount? Sometimes, I scroll through our old chats, replaying conversations like scenes from a movie I never want to end. It’s strange, isn’t it? How can someone brighten your entire day just by existing?

There are moments when I convince myself that you already know. Maybe the way I look at you gives me away. Or maybe it doesn’t. But if you asked—even casually—I think the words would spill out of me.

Fast forward, the university announced that the trial F2F class will end, and everyone will be going back to online class again. I took my chances because who knows when will I ever see you again? 

That was May 14. We were eating lunch at SM and I asked her if she's single and she said yes. I said everything I wanted to say. That I like her and she's everything I could ever ask for God.

But in my mind, I want to say that I don't care for your looks. They don't attract me nearly as much as your voice does when you're teaching me something I do not know. When you speak with passion and with conviction when your eyes light up at the opportunity to enliven me with words, with art, with depth. I am attracted to you because I am in awe of you. I respect you. You challenge me, you make me think, and that has nothing to do with the specks of amber in your eyes or the crooked way your teeth crowd your smile. With you, I am attracted to the way you make me feel, and because of that I want to dig until I reach the core of who we are, I want to dive.

Well, we can't always have the best of both worlds, right? I got rejected. 

I don't know why it never hurt. Maybe I took it like a man that time haha lol. As time passed, I came to learn a truth that I wish I hadn't—she has her *TOTGA*, the one that got away. And no matter how much I care for her, there’s nothing I can do to change that. Some of my friends told me that he left her for someone else, and that knowledge alone fills me with a kind of anger I can’t shake. How could anyone walk away from a girl like her? She’s the kind of person you fight for, the kind you build a future with. She’s *wife material*—and yet, he let her go. And here I am, wondering if she even sees what’s right in front of her.

I stopped talking to her because things were very awkward to both of us. And she's not reaching out anymore. That's when I knew it's time to go. 

I gave it my all. I studied harder than anyone, pushed myself past exhaustion, and earned the highest grades—all just to impress her. Every late-night review, every exam I aced, every recognition I received, I secretly hoped she would notice. That maybe, just maybe, she’d be proud of me.

I graduated Summa C*um Laude*, an achievement so many would dream of, but as I stood there holding my diploma, all I felt was emptiness. Because none of it mattered anymore. Not now. Not when she’s gone.

I don’t know where she is, what she’s doing, or if she even remembers me. And the saddest part? I spent years chasing something I thought would make her see me—only to realize she was never really looking.

I think about parallel universes a lot. I don’t know if I truly believe in them, but the idea that somewhere out there, there’s a version of us that never fell apart—it’s the only thing that makes this ache bearable. A version where you stayed, where you chose me, where I didn’t have to wake up every day pretending I’m okay when I’m not.

My best friend came over today. She asked about you. Just hearing your name was enough to make my chest tighten. I told her I was fine, that I don’t think about you anymore. She nodded, like she believed me. But we both knew it was a lie. Saying the truth out loud feels too final, too much like admitting you’re really gone. And I’m not ready for that. I don’t think I’ll ever be.

I keep telling myself to stop thinking about you, to stop writing about you. But it’s like you’ve taken over every part of me. Every thought, every word—it all leads back to you. I try to write about other things, but nothing feels right. It’s as if my words don’t know how to exist without you in them.

I dream about you sometimes—about the way things *could* have been. In those dreams, we’re still us, and I wake up wishing I could stay there just a little longer.

If things were different, I’d tell you. I’d tell you how much I miss you, how much it hurts to carry all of this alone. But I won’t. Because I know you’d laugh, say I’m overthinking, and I’d laugh too—just to hide how much it kills me.

Because for you, I’ve always been the one who feels too much.  
And for me, you’ve always been the one I can’t let go of.

They heard that your shop has some insanely good buns. At least that’s what Lisa said, and Lisa knows her buns. Mike said so too, but who ever really understands what buns Mike is talking about—the ones on the shelf or the ones that belong to Debbie, the cashier?

Either way, the crowd has arrived and is roaming the store, desperately searching for these legendary buns.

“They’re right there, in the deli section! What’s not to get?” Debbie snaps. She’s been working here for 20 years, and every regular knows exactly where the buns are—next to the doctor’s sausage. Seriously, what’s wrong with these so-called “new customers”? They don’t even deserve to be called customers. Can’t find the buns? What a joke.

Debbie is, of course, absolutely right. Some of these “almost-customers” give up and leave without ever reaching the holy grail of baked goods. Whatever. Good riddance. Not like we needed them anyway.

But the most persistent ones push forward, practically rubbing their hands in excitement as they finally spot the buns—only to be greeted by…

Jerry the Cockroach.

Jerry has been here for the same 20 years and doesn’t bother anyone. Every old-time customer knows him well. They give him a respectful nod in the morning before grabbing their beloved buns and enjoying them with coffee as bitter as an immigrant’s life.

But these newcomers, these weaklings, fail to appreciate the nuances of local culture. They throw in the towel and shuffle toward the exit under Debbie’s disapproving gaze.

However, to be fair, not all are so weak. Some people possess a special kind of resilience. They fear no hardships, no challenges. They’ll happily crush obstacles like Jerry and devour him along with their buns and coffee.

Yes, they are few, but the five of them, united in their pursuit of victory, proudly grab their buns and head to the checkout.

Nothing can stop these heroes!

Except…

A note on the register from Debbie: “Gone for 5 minutes. Be right back.”

After ten rounds of “5 minutes,” even the toughest warriors surrender and trudge toward the exit, defeated.

Except for one.

Nothing can break him.
Because the buns were ordered by his wife.
And you know she’s in that mood where coming home without them is simply not an option.

So he wins! YES! There he is, our victorious champion!
Marching home with his five buns, having paid his hard-earned 30 bucks.

And the only one truly upset in this whole story?

1iica8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1iica8g/failed_water_fast_36f/,Failed water fast... (36/f),"36/f and mentions of menstrual cycle.

My plan was keto for 2 days, water fast for 2 days, and keto for 2 more days.

I've done intermittent fasting up to 18 hours 4 or 5 days a week a few times on and off before, and these days I very often do dirty fasting (a bit of grass fed butter with my coffee and 1-3 teas with organic local honey, maybe a very bit of steamed broccoli with salt if I'm sufferring.)

I recently saw a doctor about doing a stem cell and plasma injection into my knee which I injured almost 3 years ago and has kept me from doing my profession properly (barber, and I can't stand still for more than 1.5-2 hours without needing to sit for at least 15 minutes.)

I've read/heard many places that fasting helps with stem cell growth and I have a month before my injection, so I thought id give a longer lasting fast a try.

End of day 1 (keto) I felt super nauseaus until I had a few berries. Day 2 (keto) was pretty good as my appetite was fairly low and I needed only 1 strawberry and sipped on a shot of almond milk to get rid of nausea (honestly I think its a sweet tooth thing.)

On the morning of day 3 (fasting day 1) I already felt like I hadn't eaten for days which is wierd because I very often don't eat until at least 3pm. That full day and evening was torture. I also appeared to start my period a week or so early, but at the time I thought it was spotting from a plan B pill. Some uterine cramps ensue early in the afternoon so I took some ibeuprofen. I stayed as hydrated as I could and did a shot of salt water a few times throughout the day.

I slept like HELL. I had to pee about four times through the night and I was very lightheaded getting downstairs to get more water this morning. Neck and shoulder pains like apmost never before. Even walking to the bathroom put me out of breath and cramps started to come back and I'm realizing this is probably a period, not spotting. In addition to uterine cramps, my stomach has gone past the hunger pangs we're familiar with and it feels like a vacuum is being made in my stomach (high and middle). It makes me feel like I've can't take a full breath. 9am today, I took ibeuprofen, sitting in the bathtub for cramps and my wonderful husband went to go get me some bone broth so I'm sipping on that. I'm hoping I can just turn my water fast into a bone broth fast but....

Aside from probably menstrual stuff, is keto followed by water fasting always this painful?

Will it be easier if I try again in a week or 2?",1,1738768602.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

1iic8tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1iic8tg/opinions_on_my_guitar_teching_situation/,Opinions on my Guitar Teching situation.,"Opinions on my Guitar Teching situation.

Good morning everybody, 

I'm a twenty one year old living in South-West England. I've been playing guitar for quite a long time and my family have quite a nice history of being musicians. Both of my older brothers played guitar/bass in deathcore bands in the early two thousands. I used to be very intrigued by how their instruments worked and they showed me how they set them up when I was a kid, I never thought much of it because I had other dreams as a kid and teenager.

Over three years ago I bought my first guitar with my very own paycheck and it was the best feeling in the world to know that I worked for that guitar. I then bought a few more over the years and my main players now are my, Harley Benton acoustic, a green jaguar which I built myself last year, and a American Vintage Reissue II Jazzmaster which I got for my twenty first from my family, my partner and myself. Every single guitar that I have ever owned has been appreciated and every time I got a new one I would say, ""this is the coolest thing i've ever owned."" 

A year ago I decided that music was the thing I wanted to do for a living, working as a Cafe supervisor, my time was very consumed by serving people coffee. It made me incredibly depressed and I felt like I was stuck there. I then decided that setting up guitars was my new hobby. So I took in some friends guitars, bought some cheap guitars, set my own up and learnt from all of those guitars. None of which were expensive. Then one day I decided that I wanted to try earning some money from doing it, so I posted an ad and a few days later I got my first customer! It was another super cheap guitar but it took me not even thirty minutes and that guitar was transformed into a much better instrument than before. I was super excited and proud of this so I posted a few more ads. Then one day, I got a HUGE customer who wanted his two thousand pound PRS set up. This was before I had even thought I'd ever own something that expensive so it was a fever dream. And the customer was so happy he tipped me quite a lot. ( Or atleast I thought)

Skip forward to today, I have my own social media pages and I get atleast ten guitars in per month, most of the time it is many more than that but that's on a bad month. What I did to get my name out there a little bit was contact the local uni near me and got a band society to do an ad for me on their pages, the deal was that they'd post my ad and I would give their members a free setup each and after that it would be ten pounds and heavily discounted work. For people who weren't students or apart of that society, it is fifteen pounds and slightly higher costs outside of that but not by much.

So far I haven't charged more than a hundred pounds for ANY work. I charged my most recent customer a hundred and fifteen pounds for four guitars, which included two FULL refinishes and one neck refinish and one spot repair. That took me over two months and I only made a hundred pounds in ""profit"". I still have one of his guitars in at the moment and it's a whole new refinish and extra work being done. 

Now I work in a supermarket and just do this on the side, every day I get more and more depressed about work because I just HATE it. Most people don't like their job so I understand that it's just something I have to deal with because it's what pays the bills. 

I want to do guitar teching full time but I just don't know how to do that, how do I raise my prices without losing my entire customer base? I feel like because I am so cheap, people love to come to me and take advantage of how extremely cheap I am. The quality of work that I deliver is better than I would even do for myself and I already have high standards. 

One thing I love is how happy students are after their guitars get fixed for such a cheap price because I know that those guitars are their prized possessions just like mine are and there is nothing better than a guitar that plays like it just came out of the custom shop. 

Thank you for reading, let me know what you think and if you have any advice for me that would also be great :)",4,1738768503.0,Luthier,3,1.0,False

Living in a place where winters are long and daylight is scarce, I was looking for something that could help me combat the seasonal blues and give me a much-needed energy boost. Spoiler alert: It works, mostly. But there are some quirks.

From the moment I unboxed it, I appreciated its sleek and compact design. It’s lightweight, ultra-thin, and resembles a small tablet, making it easy to move around the house or even carry it to the office. The painted metal base adds a touch of sturdiness, which is reassuring since I’m not the gentlest person when it comes to handling gadgets. Plus, the rotatable stand with a 90-degree adjustment is a thoughtful touch. It lets me position the lamp at just the right angle next to my laptop or on my kitchen counter while I sip my morning coffee.

Want the best Light Therapy Lamp GLD-LQ-05 deal? [See it on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/gld-lq-05-review-with-features-and-b08hv89tvq/)

Setting it up was a breeze. This therapy lamp is a plug-and-play device, so there’s no complicated configuration or special skills required. The touch control panel on the front is intuitive, and you can adjust the brightness to one of three levels with a simple tap. The brightness levels range from a soft glow to an intense 10,000 lux, mimicking natural sunlight without the harmful UV rays. The adjustable brightness is handy, especially if you’re like me and need a softer light in the mornings before you’ve had your first cup of coffee.

**Performance & Effectiveness**

Using this lamp consistently has genuinely made a difference in my mood and energy levels. I typically use it for about 30 minutes every morning as I work from home, and it helps me feel more alert and focused. The four customizable timer settings (15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes) are a lifesaver. I usually set it for 30 minutes, and it automatically turns off when the session is over—a small but appreciated convenience. On particularly gloomy days, bumping it up to 45 minutes feels like a mini escape to a sunnier place.

But here’s the catch: the buttons on the touch panel are perfectly flat and lack any tactile feedback. This means you have to look directly at the lamp to adjust the settings, which can be unpleasant because of its brightness. I’ve learned to keep a book or folder nearby to shield my eyes while fiddling with the controls. It’s a minor annoyance, but I know I’m not the only one who’s mentioned it.

**Comfort & Sensory Experience**

The light itself is quite comfortable to sit near, as long as you don’t stare directly into it (which you shouldn’t do anyway). It doesn’t emit any noticeable heat, even after extended use, which is a relief because I’ve used other lamps in the past that got uncomfortably warm. The neutral white light isn’t harsh, but I do wish there were an option for a warmer tone—it would make the experience even cozier during those chilly winter mornings.

**Battery Life & Charging**

This is a plug-in lamp, so there’s no battery to worry about. While some might see this as a downside, I actually prefer it since it guarantees consistent performance and eliminates the hassle of charging. However, the cord is a bit short, so you’ll need to position it near a power outlet or use an extension cord.

**Additional Features**

One of the standout features is its portability. Despite its power, the lamp is incredibly lightweight, weighing just 0.31 kilograms. I’ve thrown it in my bag a couple of times to bring to the office, and it hardly added any bulk. The adjustable stand folds flat, making it even easier to transport.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**

This lamp is UV-free, so it’s completely safe to use without worrying about skin damage. I have sensitive skin, and I’ve experienced no irritation or issues after months of daily use. It’s also silent during operation, which is a big plus since I often use it while working or meditating.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight design makes it highly portable.
* Adjustable brightness levels and timer settings for customization.
* UV-free light ensures safe, non-invasive therapy.
* Affordable compared to similar products.
* Rotatable stand adds flexibility in positioning.

**Cons**

* Touch controls lack tactile feedback, making adjustments tricky.
* Cord length could be longer for more placement options.
* No option for warmer light tones.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other light therapy lamps I’ve tried or researched, the Erligpowht GLD-LQ-05 stands out for its affordability and compact size. Many competitors, like the Verilux HappyLight and Carex Day-Light Classic, are bulkier and more expensive. While those models offer a wider range of brightness and color temperature settings, they’re not as portable or budget-friendly. However, the Verilux lamps have more intuitive control panels, which is an area where the GLD-LQ-05 could improve.

For those prioritizing portability and ease of use over advanced features, this lamp is an excellent choice. But if you’re someone who needs a warmer light tone or a larger light surface, you might want to consider splurging on a higher-end model.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Without getting into exact prices since they can fluctuate, this lamp offers great value for the features it provides. It’s a budget-friendly way to incorporate light therapy into your daily routine without sacrificing quality. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of more expensive models, it does the job effectively for most users. If you’re on the fence about trying light therapy, this is a low-risk option to start with.

Life is stressful enough, and because I come from a background where endurance and stoic suffering is valued, I am working on unlearning that perspective. I would encourage you to do the same! We can accommodate ourselves and do things to make life softer and more comfortable, even when those things may seem strange to others. Play the game on easy mode!  Here are a few examples:

1. Get medicated- This seems so obvious, but I didn't get medicated until I was an adult, because I was functional without medication. Now that I'm on meds, I'm even MORE functional and MORE comfortable and happy. So I can live without it, but why would I if I have access to it? 

2. Foam earplugs for meal times- Misophonia is really intense and stressful for me, especially when people are eating. So I carry those foam construction site earplugs with me at all times, and if something is triggering my misophonia, I just discretely pop them in, and then I can be comfortable without feeling like an insane person who wants to police the way people chew their food. 

3. Split King- My husband is a tosser turner, and I am a light sleeper and extra sensitive to noise and movement. I initially suggested separate bedrooms (which is a valid option and does not mean anything is wrong with your relationship!) but he was hurt by the idea and I wanted to respect his feelings. The solution: split king. Two mattresses, two frames, right next to one another, combined to make a huge bed. Now we both have our own space and are sleeping like babies. 

4. Binaural beats and focus music- Free on youtube! This + meds + iced coffee= to do list conquered. They're composed with the same science that video game music uses to put your brain in lock-in mode and drive you forward.  

5. Pomodoro timer- LOVE. The pomodoro website (also free!) even lets you write the steps of the task you're working on and estimate how many 25-min chunks it will take you to complete it. Most of the time, I finish in less poms than I thought I would, and get the little dopamine hit of checking off each task. Also much easier to focus when I know I have a scheduled break coming.

I remember this with league of legends when I played beta. The game was so different once drafting was added. Meta shifted, different heroes were picked more, and quite frankly the games were more enjoyable.

Right now the game does it's best to pick tank and ranged characters, but it doesn't quite match up as well as it should due to playerbase knowledge growing so much over the last several months.

For example, I like to main warden, but if I get solo lane vs paradox and no one swaps it's just dumb. That paradox gets large and it's over. Omg paradox OP! But, had I seen the enemy go paradox and I'm solo lane I would not have picked warden into that. I also could have asked someone to swap ahead of time before lanes are decided. Sometimes you get lucky and someone will swap, but not if they like their matchup or just don't want solo.

Characters who can be countered easily often need buffs that we can't tell right now because they just get good matchups and dominate and vice versa. Some characters may seem week but are actually awesome counter picks.

I think the game has matured enough to have draft picks take us to the next stage of testing. Maybe release another 2 heroes and give us draft picks.

Local cocktail bar does movies/tv shows inspired drinks. Went there last week and felt it was the time to give it a try.

  
TRANSLATION of the menu page

This drink is served with a pair of headphones that you can use to listen to a song made specifically for this drink. The immersive atmosphere has nothing to do with the soundtrack, but has the goal, alongside with the taste of the cocktail, to carry you into the claustrophobic imaginary of Lynch's masterpiece.

Life, in its infinite complexity, often presents us with two distinct choices on how to perceive our experiences. These choices shape our perceptions, feelings, and ultimately, our existence. The idea that ""your life is what you choose to see"" serves as both a philosophical mantra and a practical guide for navigating the ups and downs of our journeys. This poignant reality emphasizes the power of perspective, and it invites us to embrace positivity and gratitude as we look at the world around us.

## The Weight of Negativity

Negativity has a way of sneaking into our lives, often lurking unnoticed until it has emblazoned itself across our everyday thoughts. When we choose to dwell on what we lack—be it love, success, or happiness—our lives can feel stark and empty. It’s not that challenges and disappointments don’t exist; they certainly do. However, when our primary focus becomes a catalog of grievances, we inadvertently blind ourselves to the beauty that coexists with our struggles.

Consider a day where you wake up late, spill coffee on your favorite shirt, and miss a crucial meeting. If you choose to fixate on these misfortunes, the whole day can spiral into one defined by frustration and disappointment. Your experiences will be colored by the thoughts you allow to dominate your mind—those of absence and misfortune. As the saying goes, ""if we focus on what we don’t have, we will never have enough.""

## The Power of Gratitude

On the flipside, embracing a mindset of gratitude can transform our brows into smiles. Counting one’s blessings—however small—creates a lens of appreciation that can redefine how we view our lives. This doesn’t mean ignoring challenges; rather, it’s about acknowledging that joy can exist alongside hardship. When you choose to recognize the beauty in small moments, such as the warmth of the sun on your skin or a shared laugh with a friend, you create space for fulfillment amidst the chaos.

Psychological studies have shown that practicing gratitude can lead to increased levels of happiness and well-being. According to a study published in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, participants who engaged in regular gratitude exercises reported greater life satisfaction and positive emotions compared to those who did not (Emmons & McCullough, 2003). This highlights a tangible benefit to shifting our focus from lack to abundance.

## A Shift in Perspective

Making a conscious effort to shift our perspective can yield monumental changes in our daily lives. It begins with awareness; recognizing when negativity arises and deliberately choosing to pivot towards positivity. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and journaling, can create an internal landscape that is fertile for gratitude, allowing us to cultivate appreciation for our experiences rather than lamenting their shortcomings.

Additionally, surrounding ourselves with positive influences can reinforce this shift. The people we choose to engage with, the media we consume, and the environments we inhabit all contribute to our mental frameworks. When we immerse ourselves in positivity, we find it easier to see the beauty around us. 

## The Ripple Effect

Ultimately, a shift in perspective does not only affect our personal wellness; it has the potential to create ripples in the lives of those around us. When we radiate positivity and gratitude, we inspire others to shift their views. This becomes a snowball effect—imagine a community where individuals actively choose to uplift rather than criticize, to see love rather than absence.

As you go about your day, challenge yourself to actively choose what you will see. Is it the complaints or the gratitude? Is it the failures or the joys? Learn to identify the blessings nestled within the mundane; they are often the threads of happiness that can weave a more fulfilling tapestry of life.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our lives are shaped by our perceptions—what we choose to see becomes our reality. While negativity can feel heavy and prevalent, the act of shifting our focus to gratitude and appreciation can pave the way to a richer, more fulfilling existence. The choice between focusing on what we lack or the blessings abundant in our lives is firmly in our hands. Choose wisely, for your life—your true reality—depends upon it.

---

Embrace this day with an open heart and mind, and remember: your life is what you choose to see.

1iic2jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/1iic2jb/husband_tired_of_my_uncleanliness_long_rant/,"Husband tired of my ""uncleanliness""; (long rant)","For context: my husband and I share 3 year old twins who have entered their ""idgaf"" phase. We both work 24s opposite each other. And are the only support for each other. We both do not have close family nor friends nearby. I'm in school to obtain my associates so I can secure a higher level position, and earn more money. And to secure a foot in my future and career. 

Yesterday was hard. It was my husbands day to work, one of the twins was having a tummy ache, and I was behind on chores and schoolwork. 

I managed to survive the day, and settled the twins into bed finally at 0930. And went to get started on my schoolwork. Before I knew it, it was 3 am after I finished my lecture notes and assignments. I cleaned up what I brought upstairs, a soda, water and some peanut butter crackers I ended up having for dinner. I didn't vacuum because I didn't want to wake up the twins. There was some bits of paper, but I was so tired I decided to wait till morning to vacuum. 

This morning I woke up at 7 to text my husband Goodmorning and to be safe coming home like I usually do. 

He asks if I took trash down, and I forgot. (I often do forget because I can't seem to get my days straight sometimes) I tell him I'll do it in a minute. I ended up meeting him outside as I pulled the trash down to the street. And told him I was going to lay down for a few minutes before the twins woke up. He said whatever, and got the mail from yesterday. We talked, and both went upstairs. I laid down, and he went to the twins bathroom and started kicking stuff (the stool back to the wall) and making noise. I ask him what's wrong, and he said there's shit all in the bathroom. 

I get up and look in there, and there's a single wipe discarded on the ground beside the empty trash can with no bag because I grabbed it and forgot to put a bag back. He goes off on a tangent about I always forget to put the bag back, and it's not that hard that a toddler could do it. 

I tell him sorry and go to put a bag in, but he stops me and says he'll do it like always. He goes into the office, where I internally cuss because I know he'll say something about the bits of paper. 

We argue, and it turns in him calling me Helen Keller because of the three excuses I always give. ""I didn't see it, I didn't hear it, or I didn't feel it"". I told him I didn't notice it until was last night and I had planned to vacuum after the boys woke up. 

He goes on to that as a single male, his apartment was cleaner than mine before we got together, his car was cleaner than mine before we got together. And that most women are anal are being clean and I was a pig. 

In all honesty, before I got my shit together I was messy. I left clothes laying around, I would leave dishes in the sink, I left my shoes at the door in a pile. 

After getting married, I changed how I did things. And stayed on top of everything. After having kids, I started to get slack on things. And didn't see a problem if I left a few dishes in the sink, or if I had to rewash the laundry because we forgot about it. 

I tell him it shouldn't matter as long as chores get done within a reasonable time. He goes on to say if he didn't do everything, our house would be a pigsty. He does do chores when he's home, and I'm grateful for him when he does. And I tell him thank you. 

When I do chores, it's always wrong. Not up to his standards or I miss a spot or I don't put the cleaning spray back where he wants it to be. Or there's a few crumbs on the floor over here, ""what am I blind?"". There's a blanket not folded on the couch. Or I leave my robe hanging off the bed. 

I feel like I cannot win. I hate my husband for his behavior. When we have guests they always comment how clean everything is, how it doesn't even look like we have kids living here because all the toys are always put up. Our house does not look lived in. 

But yet, he always finds something wrong. Something to complain about. It makes me feel like an inadequate mother and human. I feel like pulling my hair out, and just walking out the door somedays. And I am falling out of love with my husband. 


So is it me? Am I the JUSTNO? Any advice or help would be appreciated on how to speak to my husband in this situation. 

Any time I speak to him, I honestly feel like a child sometimes with how he talks down or back. So I stopped talking altogether. 

It used to not be this way, we used to have a chill relationship and alternate chores with each other, or we'd put off things until either one of us felt like cleaning the baseboards. 

And if you ask, no the house is not a pigsty in  any given context. Unless your definition is the same as my husband's then we're living in absolute filth. From the unfolded blanket to the box of lego pieces hidden under the coffee table. 

I am physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually exhausted. I cannot do this anymore. And I am close to a mental collapse. ",4,1738768049.0,JustNoSO,4,0.83,False

“Conquering Hero,” Chapter 1

by c.w. cobblestone

Liz stretched her fists toward the ceiling and pushed out a loud yawn while I scooted across the mattress to nuzzle against her leg.

I blinked up at my wife and kissed her soft thigh. “Um … honey? You said maybe we could … you know?” I whimpered.

She rubbed her eyes. “Come on, Walter — it’s seven o’clock in the damn morning!”

“But … uh, last night you said maybe we could … you know, since you’re leaving for Baltimore, and I won’t see you for a week.”

Liz sighed. “Okay, Walter. Go get your stuff.”

“Oh, thank you, Mistress,” I gushed in my best little-girl voice. With great excitement, I hopped out of bed, scrambled across the bedroom to the dresser and pulled open my bottom drawer, where my stockings and camisoles were stashed beneath a stack of folded t-shirts. Wiggling out of my PJs and leaving them in a bunch on the carpet, I donned the feminine garments in six seconds flat before scooting back to the bed and arranging myself near Liz’s feet.

I looked up at her. She nodded.

“Go ahead,” she intoned.

“Thank you, Mistress,” I squeaked before I started sucking her toes and jacking off. While I diddled myself, Liz scrolled through her cellphone. It took only a few seconds to spooge all over my stomach.

She looked up from her phone and smirked. “Well, that was fast.”

“I … uh … was pretty horny,” I muttered. “Um, thanks.”

“You’re welcome, Walter,” she said, rubbing her foot on the comforter to wipe off my slobber. She rolled out of bed and padded toward the bathroom, calling over her shoulder, “it’s getting late — can you make sure the girls are up and get them going?”

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

Belgian waffles were Liz’s favorite. My stepdaughters, not so much.

“Ugh, waffles make me bloated,” Brooke groused after plopping down on her chair at the dining room table.

“Why can’t we have bacon and eggs like normal people?” Mia huffed.

“Come on, guys, I made a special breakfast for your mom.” I smiled at Liz as I filled her coffee cup. “This is an important trip — she’s going to be speaking in front of a thousand people at the Baltimore Convention Center.”

“Three thousand,” my wife corrected me.

Brooke scrunched up her face and pushed her plate away. “Seriously, I hate waffles, Walt — can I just have a bowl of cereal or something?”

My wife sipped her coffee. “Walter can make bacon and eggs if you want,” she told her eldest daughter before frowning at me. “You know the girls don’t like waffles.”

“I … I’m sorry, I guess I wasn’t thinking,” I replied with a gulp. “I was too wrapped up in trying to make you a nice breakfast before you go.”

Mia smirked. “Aw, look at Walt — Mister Romeo.”

Brooke took a gulp of orange juice. “Hey, Walt, is my blue skirt ready?”

“Your blue skirt?” I scratched my ear. “Uh, I don’t remember you asking me to get your blue skirt ready.”

The 16-year-old rolled her eyes. “Yes, I did, Walter. Last night; you were ironing Mom’s clothes and I told you to make sure you got my blue skirt ready because I wanted to wear it to school today.”

“Crap, honey, I’m sorry; I was really busy last night packing for Mom’s trip.”

“Well, can you go get it ready, please? I want to wear it today; I told you.”

Mia frowned at her sister, who was two years older. “Why are you wearing a skirt today? Isn’t it Spirit Day?”

Brooke slapped her head. “Crap, I forgot.” She smiled at me. “You’re off the hook; you can just put out my jeans and my red Central jersey.”

I nodded. “Gotcha, honey, let me go do that now.”

“And can you hurry up, please?” Mia picked up her cellphone. “I’m starving!”

I put on a smile and tramped upstairs to lay my oldest stepdaughter’s clothes on her bed. Then, it was off to the kitchen, where I whipped up a quick batch of bacon and eggs. After everyone was served, I peeled open a cup of yogurt, took my spot at the table and poured myself a cup of coffee. The ladies thumbed through their phones and ate in silence while the opening theme music for “America Good Morning” played on the living room TV.

The quiet of the household routine was blown to smithereens by the lead story:

“Breaking this morning: Pentagon officials say 17 American POWs have been rescued from a prison in Afghanistan. This dramatic rescue happened sometime yesterday, according to sources with knowledge of the operation, although Pentagon officials are not releasing further details. The rescued servicemen are being debriefed, a process we’re told could take as long as two weeks. We’re told some of these prisoners were captured as far back as 2003. The Pentagon said it’s in the process of notifying the families of these POWs, some of whom were presumed to have been killed in action. That means there are families out there who thought their loved ones were dead, who are going to get some happy surprises. But for now, details about the rescue, the identities of the rescued soldiers, and future plans are sketchy. We'll be sure to update you when we find out more. Back to you.”

Liz’s face was white, her lips tight.

“Mom?” Mia set down her cellphone and leaned forward. “Do you think Dad’s one of those prisoners who got rescued?”

“Your father is dead,” Liz snapped, snatching her knife and cutting her waffle so vigorously it made the table shake. “I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”

Everyone in the family simultaneously turned toward the starboard living room wall, where a framed letter bearing the official U.S. Army insignia hung beneath a triangular display case with a folded American flag, and a photo of Staff Sergeant Cody Hansen, who had been the spitting image of his two Nordic daughters.

“Sorry, Ma.” Mia picked at her eggs with her fork.

“That’s okay, honey,” Liz said with tears in her eyes. “I just wish he could see you girls now … how you’ve grown up to be so beautiful.”

“I barely remember him,” Brooke said, wiping her wet eyes with the back of her hand. “I have one memory of him giving me a stuffed dog.”

“Just before he got deployed. You named it Boo-Boo.” Liz sighed. “I wish I knew what happened to that damned thing; it was the last gift he ever gave you.”

My wife drained her coffee cup and pushed it toward me. “Can you fill that back up, Walter?” She glanced at her watch. “You know what? Never mind, it’s getting late — go ahead and fill my travel mug and put my suitcases in the hall for when the cab gets here.”

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

After dropping off my stepdaughters at school, I circled back home to start my day. Househusband had been my vocation since I’d been laid off from my draftsman’s job six years earlier, an event that had fortuitously coincided with Liz’s huge promotion at work which enabled her to comfortably support the family on her salary alone.

I fished from the basement the bucket containing rags, sponges, cleansers and furniture polish, and started in our bedroom, although I got sidetracked when I picked up Liz’s red panties from the floor. After bringing the delicate garment to my nose and inhaling the heavenly, musky scent, I made a beeline to my bottom drawer and donned my frillies with my brain in a horny fog.

Thus attired, I cleaned our master suite, pretending I was Liz’s sissy maid. When the polishing and vacuuming were done, I lay on the bed and jacked off to the same fantasy, which my wife had half-heartedly indulged throughout our seven-year marriage. It took only a few minutes to cum, and, with my big head snapping me back to reality, I changed the sheets and put on a tee-shirt and shorts to get started on cleaning the rest of the house.

I was on my hands and knees picking cookie crumbs from Mia’s bedroom carpet when the doorbell rang. Wiping my hands on my sweatpants, I hurried down the stairs toward the front entrance — and stopped dead in my tracks when I looked through the window near the doorway and saw two men in Army uniforms standing on the porch with somber expressions.",5,1738767927.0,cuck_femdom_tales,2,1.0,False

I was trying to merge into the right lane because the left lane was ending, with signs and arrows indicating the merge. I had my indicator on, but the driver in the right lane refused to let me in and gave me the finger. I responded in kind.

Since he didn’t yield, I merged behind him. A short while later, he threw his coffee at my car, splashing the bonnet and front grille. Further ahead, I needed to switch to the left lane to make a turn. As I changed lanes and turned, the same driver suddenly sped up, took the turn as well, then overtook me and abruptly pulled over in front of me, blocking my path.

He got out of his car and punched/pushed my window, causing it to crack, before running away. I called the police and waited for two hours with no response. Eventually, I filed a complaint online with Victoria Police and then left.

Later, I received a call asking me to visit the local police station. When I went in, the officer told me they couldn’t do much. Despite having witnesses and the offender’s registration details, she didn’t file a formal complaint. Instead, she suggested I handle the matter privately without involving insurance, claiming it would be cheaper, and then inform them of the repair details.

A special thank you to our butler Rihana who was helpful and attentive to our needs and request. We found the only place at the resort to find a relaxing and somewhat quite area to spend the day. This was a small “preferred only” pool behind the Olio restaurant where a lovely lady named Margarita took great care of us at the bar and around the pool.

# [Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana](https://www.hyattinclusivecollection.com/en/resorts-hotels/secrets/dominican-republic/royal-beach-punta-cana/) is a beautiful 15 year old resort with 641 rooms and suites that in most areas the resort is elegant and modern.  But somehow they have managed to make the guest rooms look like they are in a 30 year old resort?

# “Preferred Club” in general is a joke. There is almost nowhere in the resort that every guest, Preferred Club or not can’t go. In most cases the only deterrent is a small sign reading “Preferred Club Only”. In the time we were at the resort we were only ask 1 time about our preferred club status.

# At 80% occupancy there are over 1,000 guest at the resort which brings up these observations:

# The sports bar is very small, dark and at times very loud. The Coco Café, Coffee and snack bar is also very small and inadequate for the number of guest.

# If you wanted to eat at one of the 4 à la carte restaurants near the Show Time Bar without a 30 minute - up to 2 hour wait you needed to arrive either before 6pm or after 9pm. As you wait to be seated for dinner it is almost impossible to get a drink at the Show Time Bar with the occupied seats across the whole front of the bar blocking you from access to the bartender. Suggestion, remove the chairs.

# It is nearly impossible to get beach or pool chairs that also provide a little shade (umbrella or palapa) unless you “save” the chairs before 7 am. They do have “rules” and even signs against saving chairs that are not enforced. Sadly it has been that way at every resort that I have stayed at over the past 25 years.

# Dress Codes?  Many of the dress codes found on their website are either wrong or not enforced. Here are a few examples:

# Barefoot Grill, website says “Casual” (Bermudas (long shorts or Capri pants), sneakers/tennis shoes and sandals. Ladies must wear a bathing suit wrap or cover-up. No sleeveless shirts for men.), reality - barefoot, swimsuits and no shirt. *it’s in the name!

# à la carte restaurants, website says “Casual Elegance” (Sneakers/tennis shoes or dress sandals, dress shirts with short sleeves or collared shirts. No sleeveless shirts or flip-flops. Long pants required for men.) Reality – tee shirts, flip flops and shorts (not sure about the French Restaurant, Formal)

# Preferred Club Bar/Lounge, website says “Beach Casual” (Swim trunks, bathing suits and flip-flops accepted.) This is just wrong, it is a very nice lounge that people in swim suits should not be allowed in. There is a bar in the pool just outside the lounge.

# Quick note about the Lazy River which is just an extension of one of the pools, the “river” does not flow.

# As you can tell, I am a stickler for having, following and the enforcement of rules, I only wish this resort cared enough to do their part.",2,1738767769.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m trying to get a better understanding of the different foods and ingredients unique to Odisha’s districts. I’ve put together a very ***incomplete*** list and would love your help in improving it.

The criteria:

* For dishes: They should have originated in the district or be strongly associated with it—whether through patronage, innovation, or advocacy.
* For ingredients: They must be grown in the district.
* A dish or ingredient can be linked to multiple districts.

Some dishes, like Pakhala and Dalma, are ubiquitous across Odisha, and I’m unsure of their district of origin. If you know where they might have first emerged, feel free to share!

Ideally, by the end of this exercise, each district will have at least one dish or ingredient associated with it. This list is just based on what I know so far, and I’m happy to be corrected! Feel free to disagree, suggest changes, or share more insights. My goal is to learn, and I truly appreciate your input.

This isn’t a rigid or scientific exercise—there’s plenty of room for interpretation. I just want to get a general sense of how different foods and ingredients are tied to different districts. This information could be useful for the community in understanding and appreciating our culinary diversity.

Thanks in advance!

I want to say that i didnt try any smell exercises or anything else. I still cant touch the meat but now it doesnt smell awful like before, it has ok smell but taste is still nahh... My biggest enemies are still Onion and Eggs. I cant stand smell of Onion and i can smell it like miles away and it got me so frustrated that i am like: i wont eat it anymore eaven if my taste come back to normal 😄. Eggs on the other hand are smelling way less awful then onion but they are giving me hard times also. Also things like Ketchup and salads and some things are still having sus taste, i can eat them but i dont enjoy them...

Also it was really mentaly hard for me bcs i was in training almost 3 years, eating perfectly, gaining a lot of muscle mass and then just like that, in a month i couldnt eat meat and eggs as a main source of protein and you are just there looking how the all of sweat and effor you put into your body are fading away and you cant do anything about it... I lost almost 10 kg and it feels terrible mentaly.

Pulled up to the Drive Thru with one car ahead.  Ordered a medium hot coffee and a chocolate croissant.  $8.02.  Pull around and wait for 15 minutes.  Got my order (lady tried to give me two extra dollars back).  Get coffee, it's lukewarm at best.  Croissant feels day oldish.  

Some background:  Like every STL person, I grew up enjoying St. Louis Bread Company when it was our town's special hometown place.  Then in turned into Panera.  Became more expensive (was never cheap) but the food quality and the uniqueness of the offerings remained very high.  

Then, I don't know maybe five years or so ago, after I had moved back to St. Louis, I noticed that no matter how good the food looked, it had no taste.  Meanwhile, it had become crazy expensive.  Like today, $8.02 for a croissant and a medium lukewarm regular coffee is nuts.  Probably $2.00 more than it should be.  Not gonna break the bank, but when it's subpar quality the cost becomes more noticeable.

And the quality has affected EVERYTHING.  Their soups taste gritty, even simple ones like Chicken Noodle.  Soup is easy.  It's awash in sodium and everything is canned for the most part.  How can you screw that up?  Ask Panera because they have.  The breads have lost a step.  Panera BREAD COMPANY can't do bread well anymore.  

Lastly, at least the one by our house is staffed exclusively by trolly snotty twenty something ladys who enjoy eye rolling for requests like extra spicy mustard packets or, the coup de gras, if you dare ask for an extra Greek Goddess dressing cup.  You can almost hear the delight in their voice when they say with a wry smile, ""WE'RE OUT"".  

They did have one absolute angel Baby Boomer aged retiree woman who worked there for a year or two and would always ask how your day was when you pulled up, and, without fail when you said ""good, how about yours?"" would reply, ""well better now that you're here"".  How can you not love that syrupy sweetness.  She was probably too nice for the Mean Girls and was trolled into oblivion or they set her up by stuffing her car with all those lost Green Goddess dressing cups so she got fired for theft.  

Not sure why, but today I just decided that I've had enough.  

So I'm writing today to announce my divorce from Panera.  It's been a good run but I can no longer afford you, you no longer make me happy and I'm tired of your expensive and subpar tastes.  

And Steak N' Shake, if I can ever figure out if your location is actually open or not when I drive by, I might test to see if your service is still as crappy as it was last time.  Then I might divorce your wannabe Shake Shack ass too.  You're on notice!",54,1738767181.0,StLouis,58,0.78,False

Creative and Thoughtful Valentine Gifts for Your Husband
--------------------------------------------------------

Finding the perfect Valentine gift for your husband can feel like a daunting task. You want something special that resonates with your relationship and shows how much you care. Here are some creative and thoughtful ideas that will make your husband feel loved and appreciated this Valentine's Day.

### Personalized Gifts

Personalized items carry more meaning and show that you put thought into your gift. Consider these options:

- **Engraved Watch:** A stylish watch with a personal message engraved on the back can be cherished for years to come.
- **Customized Photo Book:** Compile your favorite photos together as a journey of your love story. Add captions to make it even more personal.
- **Monogrammed Wallet:** A sleek leather wallet embossed with his initials can blend practicality with sentiment.

### Experience Gifts

Sometimes, the best gifts are experiences rather than physical items. Consider these ideas for a memorable day:

- **Personalized Coffee Mug:** A mug featuring an inside joke or a sweet message can brighten his morning routine.
- **Framed Star Map:** Create a star map of the night sky on a significant date, like when you first met or your wedding day. It's a romantic reminder of a special moment.

- **Subscription Box:** Sign him up for a subscription box that aligns with his hobbies, such as gourmet foods, books, or craft beers. He'll enjoy a gift that keeps giving.

This Valentine’s Day, remember that the thought behind the gift matters just as much as the gift itself. Whether it’s something personalized, an unforgettable experience, or a heartfelt DIY creation, your husband will appreciate your effort and love. Celebrate your unique bond and let him know how much he means to you with a thoughtful and creative gift that speaks volumes.

Unique Ways to Celebrate Valentine's Day Together as a Couple
-------------------------------------------------------------

Valentine's Day is more than just a date on the calendar; it’s an opportunity to create lasting memories with your significant other. Choosing unique ways to celebrate can make the day special for both of you. Here are some innovative ideas to consider, ensuring that your celebration is both meaningful and memorable.

### Plan a Themed Date Night

Transform your living space into a cozy setting that represents a culture or time period you both love. Here are a few themes to inspire you:

- **Italian Night:** Cook traditional pasta dishes and enjoy Italian wine while playing romantic music.
- **80s Movie Marathon:** Dress in retro outfits, binge-watch iconic 80s films, and create a fun snack bar of classic treats.
- **Beach Escape:** Set up beach towels indoors, play sounds of the ocean, and prepare fruity cocktails or mocktails.

### Nature Getaway

If you both love the outdoors, consider planning a day trip to a nearby national park or a tranquil beach. Pack a picnic filled with your favorite snacks and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature together.

Listening to birds chirping or waves crashing can be a refreshing backdrop that enhances your connection. Remember to bring a camera or smartphone to capture the beautiful moments.

### Take a Class Together

Learning something new can be a great bonding experience. Look for local workshops or online classes that interest both of you:

- **Cooking Class:** Join a virtual class and create a new dish together.
- **Art or Craft Class:** Get creative with pottery, painting, or crafting something unique.
- **Dancing Lessons:** Learn a new dance style online, like salsa or ballroom, for a fun experience.

### Gift of Experience

Instead of traditional gifts, think outside the box. Here are a few ideas:

- **Concert Tickets:** Surprise your husband with tickets to see his favorite band or artist.
- **Adventure Day:** Plan an exciting day filled with activities like zip-lining, kayaking, or visiting an amusement park.
- **Getaway Weekend:** Book a surprise weekend trip to a destination he loves or has always wanted to visit.

### Write a Love Letter

In our fast-paced world, a handwritten love letter can be a heartfelt gift. Express what your husband means to you, share precious memories, and talk about your dreams for the future. Consider slipping it into a place where he won't expect to find it, like his work bag or lunchbox for a delightful surprise.

### Host a Game Night

Turn the evening into a fun-filled game night! Gather your favorite board games, card games, or video games you both enjoy playing. You can even set up some fun prizes for the winner to up the stakes! Prepare some tasty snacks and drinks to make the night even more enjoyable.

### Create a Scrapbook

Take the time to create a scrapbook together. Gather photos, ticket stubs, and other memorabilia from your time together. Share stories behind the items as you work on it. This collaborative effort will create a keepsake that both of you can cherish forever.

### Volunteer Together

Giving back can be a fulfilling way to spend your day. Find a local charity or organization where you can volunteer as a couple. Whether it’s serving at a soup kitchen or participating in a community clean-up, helping others can bring you closer together.

### Stargazing Night

If the weather permits, spend the night outdoors stargazing. Set up a comfortable spot in your backyard or a local park, and bring a telescope if you have one. Share your thoughts and dreams as you admire the constellations together. Don't forget to pack hot drinks to keep warm while you explore the night sky!

When planning your celebration, the key is to make time for each other and nurture the connection you share. Unique experiences will not only help you celebrate the day but also enhance your relationship, leaving you both with wonderful memories to treasure for years to come.

### Conclusion

Valentine's Day is a wonderful opportunity to show your husband just how much he means to you. By choosing creative and thoughtful gifts, you can make the day special and memorable. Whether it’s a personalized item that reflects your journey together, or an experience that you can share, the ideas explored provide plenty of inspiration. Remember, it’s not just about the gift itself but the love and effort behind it.

Celebrating Valentine's Day as a couple brings added joy to the occasion. Engaging in activities that you both enjoy not only strengthens your bond but also creates lasting memories. From cozy nights in to adventurous outings, there are countless unique ways to make this day uniquely yours. The most important thing is to prioritize time together, focusing on what you both love.

Ultimately, whether you decide on a heartfelt gift or a fun date idea, the essence of Valentine’s Day lies in the thought and love you put into it. This day should be a celebration of your relationship, highlighting the connection you cherish. So, get creative, plan something exciting, and remember that the best gift you can give each other is your time and attention. Celebrate your love in a way that’s meaningful to both of you, and make this Valentine’s Day a beautiful chapter in your love story.

However, it's only been about six weeks since then, and the second filter basket broke in the same way this morning. I have been very very careful and gentle with it since I got the replacement, more than I should have to be, so the fact that it broke so quickly tells me it's a serious design flaw in the basket.
I've reached out to Fellow for another replacement, but I don't want to have to keep replacing the basket every 6-8 weeks.

1iiboqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnerDriverUK/comments/1iiboqx/passed_my_8am_test_huddersfield/,Passed my 8AM test (Huddersfield),"I passed my test today in Huddersfield, it was my first test and I have been taking lessons on and off since last summer, though more seriously since October. 

My test was originally booked for the beginning of January but was postponed due to the snow. I was lucky that it was rebooked for only one month later, I suspect this is because the test centre rebooked it.

My test was originally on a Friday at 12:00PM but was moved to a Wednesday at 8:10AM. I was really freaked out by this but some comments in this subreddit helped me reframe my thinking. 

These are good things about an early start for your test:

The examiners are fresh, full of their coffee/tea, and likely in a good mood.
The roads are full and slow, you spend more time in traffic and at lights, and you just generally drive slower. 
You can see people in front of you doing certain manoeuvres – tricky turns, etc.
The early birds have gotten to work, most construction teams / white van mans have an early start and are at their work sites  
People on the road are more alert, not rushing to get home.
You don’t have to wait around all day freaking yourself out. 

The only challenge was that there’s obviously loads of kids walking to school so you just have to be really alert.

I got 6 minors, mostly for being hesitant and I think one for being too slow but I’d rather have a few minors for being careful than a serious fault for being careless. 

My only tips are be present where you are, don’t try to think too hard about what route you’re on, and ask for clarification if you need it! The worst that will happen is they’ll repeat the instruction verbatim 🤷🏼‍♀️

I’m posting this specifically for the humans in the future that have tests in Huddersfield: we did the Rochdale route, my teacher says this is a really popular route. My only ‘woah’ moment happened immediately upon leaving the test centre, turning left on to Sheepridge Road as a pedestrian popped across the street from behind a car - there’s a bit of a hidden drive there and people run across the road to the bus stop so just make sure you’re checking right AND left when turning (as you should be!)

A family member was found deceased outside this last week in the Oklahoma City area. I believe he was homeless and obviously I wasn't close with him. He had a hard life and was in and out of prison. My mom was close to him when he was young, and this is pretty difficult on her. His brother checked out the price for a cremation and was quoted $6,000. I don't know if this included the urn, which at this point the family would be fine with bringing their own coffee pot. Outside of two siblings and my mother, there is not any other family and they cannot afford that cost.

* Is there a low-cost option in the OKC area? I don't know where he is, so I know transport may be an issue. I think he may already be at one cremation business/parlor. Do you know of funeral homes in the area?
* If the state was to take possession of the body, is the only option a government/public cemetery nameless plot, or do they have cremation services for a fee?
* Other organizations or non profits that can assist?

I have been using openart and similar for a quite some time now. Yet, I'm having hard times understanding what in the name of the aliens I'm doing wrong.

So, the task is: I have a prompt, I have a sketch reference, my character. I need to generate five-six different poses of the same style (the character is sitting in a kitchen and drinking coffee, then the cup is down and they hold an apple, then it's a smile, etc, you get the idea). However, even the fact that I have the necessary prompts and sketches references (based on myself, so same clothes, place, lights, etc) I am still not able to make the app do the exact same style of the image.

What am I doing wrong here??? How to manage with it and to actually make it work? Not sure if bulk creation would be of any help....

1iibcyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1iibcyw/cannot_even_be_nonverbaluse_asl_to_get_away_from/,Cannot even be nonverbal/use ASL to get away from them.,"First I want to start off by saying I'm autistic so a lot of the time in chaotic situations, I shut down. Also, I find it difficult to discern all of the sounds I hear continuously. This means that I often find it hard to understand what you are saying. A lot of the time it sounds like similish. In those moments, I use ASL to communicate. It is something that has not come easy to me as I do not feel communicative in the least but is easier than masking verbally. 

People at my local Panera bread know me really well because I go and get tea from there almost every day. (My friend has an account for free coffee/tea and she lets me use it).  

Yesterday, I was making my tea and as I was leaving, the guy that was making his coffee stopped me by tapping me on the shoulder. This is pretty common to people who do not realize that I can hear them. They simply behave as though I am deaf. I rarely correct this as I do not feel the need to. He then stuck his phone in my face with a note in text on it. 

""Do you know Jesus?"" 

And I just signed back that I was not interested. He sidestepped me, placing himself directly in front of me and continuing to shove his phone in my face. Which by the way is not the way that you should treat a deaf person or any human being at all. He then proceeded to body block me while he typed out an entire paragraph on his phone and then shoved that into my face also. 

""My mother met God. She died during my birthing... (this was the exact phrase he used. Super weird)... She met God and he sent her back"" 

And then proceeded to continuously shove this (pulling back a little and then almost slamming it into my face) as though he also thought I was blind.... And then I smiled and grabbed his phone from him and typed in that I'm an atheist and am not interested in his religion. 

And his response was to again shove his phone into my face with the text "" God can heal you.""

To which I responded ""what makes you think I need healing?"" He started to say something further and I stepped around him and walked out with my tea. 

I'm more upset about that last part. Because, I can predict the outcome of further conversation. 

""God can heal you... You just have to believe""

""I do believe. Why has God not seen fit to fix me yet?""

""He works in mysterious ways. You will have to wait until he sees fit to do so.""

""What if he never fixes me? Then this is a test and you have to live a better life because you have to pass the test.""

""But you said if I simply believe then I would be 
healed.""

""Yes but that's not up to me. That's up to the all powerful God""

""But then why hasn't God healed me?""

And the conversation would just continue in a cycle like that because it's like talking to a narcissist. 
When the answer is very simple (from Christian logic):  ""God is real. He doesn't want to help you""

Or from (atheist logic): ""God is not real or is not powerful and therefore is not god. Therefore there is no help to be given""

TlDR: guy thought that I was deaf because I use ASL to communicate. Told me that God would heal me by shoving his phone in my face and body blocking me into a Panera bread",3,1738766214.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False

I retaliated and in the end unintentionally ruined his life. Now I feel waves of guilt.,"TLDR at the bottom but it's better to know the whole story.

This has happened a year ago but I have recently found out the scope of consequences this guy suffered and I feel very bad now.

We were on the same team in a big company, he has joined 2 months after me. This is in Japan, I am Japanese but moved out to Europe when I was a teenager and came back few years ago (this is important for the story). The coworker is Korean who moved to Japan when he was 20 (now 31).

No one on our team had any issues at the beginning, we cooperated and got along well. Unfortunately, after a few months this guy, I'll call him ""K"", started to be too comfortable and he would say xenophobic things about people around us. He would say things like ""brainless Japanese monkeys"", ""this is why this country is getting poorer"", ""Japanese girls are easy"", he would also call our boss ""a failed old trash"", some of these things he would type out on our work chat in private messages to me. At beginning I tried to ignore it and just replied with emojis or ""haha wow"" but after time it started to piss me off so I asked him if he is aware that I'm Japanese as well as my family and he keeps insulting us. He has answered that because I have lived abroad for a long time and speak English, I'm not ""the brainless monkey"" in his eyes. I have saved screenshots of our chats in secret just in case because I had this gut feeling.

I focused on my work and minimized contact with K. It seems that he has noticed it and started to one-up me in every possible way. If he saw me talk to a manager, he would invite him later to drink coffee together and talk, when he saw me with a training bag, he enrolled into gym and started to bring his. In work meetings, he would disagree in front of everyone with every single thing I said, even if it didn't make sense and then when someone else spoke, he would comment that this is a perfect idea, let's use this person's procedure etc. One time I have submitted a new procedure and was discussing it on one-on-one with our boss and K was sitting at his desk a few meters from us. Then when it was his turn, he showed his work and it had all the good parts from mine and all points that boss made when he talked to me. I just knew something is fishy. Boss praised him and K boasted that he has experience and he can send me his work so I can learn from him. So I agreed, checked the history of the file and surprise. It was edited exactly during my one-on-one. So as suspected, this man was listening and adding all mine and boss's pointers and presented as his own.

Another time, I created a fully automated Excel sheet that would massively shorten some of our job. I had to edit it on a shared disk so K noticed it and started to add some cells that had to be repeated, I actually appreciated it even though help wasn't needed cause this was just a copy paste job. Next week I presented this to our boss and I have noticed that the document has not only my sign but also K's. During the presentation he has joined in as if he was one of creators and he proposed to the boss that he will bring the file to other departments to help them. This really pissed me off, he fucking took credit for my job. I have decided that I'll fight it from now.

There were several more small things that this guy did to put me down but the final one came when our manager was promoted and someone was going to take his place. I was the first choice (K wasn't considered because he had too short experience). We had a meeting of our team and the members were sharing their opinions on me and my main rival, a woman who was some time in this company but her total experience was smaller than mine and only in Japan. Everyone told stories about both of us how we have helped them or how we made the job easier. That's fairly typical to do in situations like this. However when it came to K, he started with the woman and he described her as if she is a saint, gave like 10 mins speech, praising her and describing how much he would be motivated to work under someone like her. I wasn't ready to hear what he will say about me. Basically, he said that I'm a nice person but he isn't sure if I would make a good leader. He said that he has seen me slacking, leaving the work early, working remotely too often and that my overseas experience might hinder me as a leader of mostly Japanese employees. Obviously none of these is true. He can't prove it and I can't prove it's not true, our work doesn't trace clocking in or out or working remotely. This was the only bad opinion about any of us during this whole meeting.

Two weeks later we were informed that the girl was chosen as the next leader. My boss told me on the side that K's opinion was ultimately what tipped the scale against me. All the things he did to me without any reason now had actual impact on my life. I have worked really hard for this promotion, took courses, took initiative, sacrificed my own time. My goal was to climb up in this company and that chance was taken from me by someone who had some kind of sick jealousy, who was lazy and bad at his job. In a moment of anger, I collected all evidence I had - the racist comments of his, how he badmouthed our boss, files that proved he took credit for my job, described all of it and sent it to my boss and to HR in HQ in Germany.

I sent it on Thursday and on Monday K was suddenly taken to the side by our boss. He came back to his desk with very worried face, grabbed his stuff and left with the boss somewhere. Boss came back after 2-3 hours, K was nowhere to be seen. Boss came over and told me they are handling the case and thanked me. Next day K was back at his desk, doing something on his laptop, then he came forward and announced that he is fired and wishes us goodbye. Everyone was surprised and asked him why, what happened? Before he could answer, I said that he was calling you guys a ""brainless Japanese monkeys"" on top of hundreds of bad things he did. Everyone was shocked and he just left. I left the company a month later as I was scouted by another and finally became a leader there.

Skip one year and I was invited to a lunch with my old coworkers. They told me what happened to K after losing his job. He applied to other companies but struggled to find anything as he was fired from last one and it was fishy. He stayed unemployed for 4 months before settling at a job that paid him 30% less and was far away. He was actually engaged during this whole drama but he couldn't afford the wedding and due to that and pressure from his fiancee's parents, the engagement was cancelled and he was forced to leave and go back to his parents apartment. Due to that he gained weight and stopped caring about himself. After a while, he cut contact with former coworkers. When I heard this, I felt very bad for him. When I reported what he did, I thought it's an equal retaliation, he fucked with my career, I fucked with his. He did all that shit without any reason, just out of random hate and I did it to him as a warning and punishment. But all I wanted is him to get yelled at or at worst, fired. I had no idea it will destroy his relationship and his health as a consequence. Now I feel guilty and can't stop thinking about it. Would like to know what other people think.

TLDR: A guy was harassing me at work, being xenophobic and impacted my career. I reported him and it caused a domino effect - he lost his job, fiancee and apartment. I found out about all this after a year and feel guilty.",2,1738766069.0,AmIOverreacting,9,0.67,False

From its iconic landmarks to charming hidden gems, Paris never fails to leave a lasting impression. Whether you’re visiting for the first time or returning to discover something new, there’s always something magical waiting around every corner. Here’s a list of some of the best things you can do in Paris that will make your trip unforgettable.

# 1. Admire the Eiffel Tower

The Eiffel Tower is undoubtedly the most iconic symbol of Paris. Standing tall in the heart of the city, it offers breathtaking views of the Parisian skyline. You can take an elevator ride to the top, or if you're feeling adventurous, climb the stairs to the second level for a closer look at the intricate ironwork. As the sun sets, the Eiffel Tower lights up, creating a sparkling spectacle that you won’t soon forget.

# 2. Explore the Louvre Museum

No visit to Paris is complete without stepping foot in the Louvre Museum. Home to thousands of masterpieces, including the famous *Mona Lisa*, the Louvre is a paradise for art lovers. Whether you're fascinated by ancient Egyptian artifacts, Renaissance paintings, or Islamic art, there’s something for everyone here. The museum's vast collection can be overwhelming, so be sure to plan ahead to see the highlights or simply wander through the galleries and get lost in its beauty.

# 3. Stroll Along the Seine River

The Seine River flows through the heart of Paris, and taking a leisurely stroll along its banks is one of the most delightful ways to soak in the city’s atmosphere. The bridges spanning the river, including the historic Pont Neuf, offer stunning views of landmarks like Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower. You can also hop on a boat cruise to see the city from a unique perspective, especially at sunset when the buildings are bathed in golden light.

# 4. Discover Montmartre and Sacré-Cœur

Montmartre, with its narrow cobblestone streets, is a charming neighborhood full of history and artistic flair. Once the hub of bohemian life, it’s now a picturesque area where you can visit the beautiful *Sacré-Cœur Basilica*. The view from the top of the hill is panoramic and offers one of the best vistas of Paris. Take time to explore the charming cafés, art shops, and the famous Place du Tertre, where local artists display their work.

# 5. Indulge in Parisian Cuisine

Paris is a food lover’s paradise, and sampling the city’s culinary delights is an essential part of the experience. Start your day with a buttery croissant and a café au lait at a local bistro. For lunch or dinner, try classic French dishes like *coq au vin*, *boeuf bourguignon*, or a freshly made *quiche*. Don’t forget to indulge in the irresistible pastries—*macarons*, *eclairs*, and *tartes* are just the beginning.

# 6. Relax in the Luxembourg Gardens

If you're looking for a peaceful escape from the bustling city, head to the Luxembourg Gardens. This stunning green space offers beautifully manicured lawns, fountains, and flowerbeds, perfect for a relaxing afternoon. You can also visit the Luxembourg Palace, home to the French Senate. Whether you're reading a book, enjoying a picnic, or simply people-watching, the gardens provide a serene environment right in the heart of Paris.

# 7. Experience the Nightlife

Paris comes alive at night, and there’s no shortage of exciting nightlife to explore. Whether you prefer sipping cocktails at a trendy rooftop bar or experiencing the lively atmosphere of a traditional French cabaret, Paris has something for every taste. The vibrant neighborhood of Le Marais is perfect for bar hopping, while the Latin Quarter offers a more laid-back vibe with its quaint cafés and bars.

# 8. Visit Notre-Dame Cathedral

Even though it’s undergoing restoration, the Notre-Dame Cathedral remains an unmissable stop in Paris. The gothic architecture, intricate stained-glass windows, and soaring spires make it a must-see. You can admire the cathedral from the outside or take a tour to learn about its fascinating history.

# 9. Shop in the Champs-Élysées

For those who enjoy shopping, the Champs-Élysées is the ultimate destination. Known as one of the most beautiful avenues in the world, it’s lined with designer stores, theaters, and cafés. Whether you’re looking for high-end fashion, souvenirs, or just a place to relax with a coffee, this legendary avenue is a must-visit.

# 10. Wander Through the Marais

The Marais is one of the oldest and most charming neighborhoods in Paris. Full of narrow streets, boutique shops, art galleries, and historic buildings, it’s a delightful place to wander. Stop by the Place des Vosges, one of the most beautiful squares in the city, or explore the quirky shops and trendy cafés that line the streets.

Paris is a city that offers something for every traveler. Whether you're an art enthusiast, history buff, foodie, or someone simply looking to enjoy the beauty of the city, Paris has unforgettable experiences waiting for you.

I was walking across campus yesterday and I heard a voice from the wilderness.

Gyyyyynnnnnnnnnnngerrrrrrrrrr

I looked around and someone ran over - we are gonna call them Mr. Green - they know why. 

They told me that they liked my pictures. Look forward to seeing them each week.

This has happened once or twice a day for the last week. Its uncanny to me. It happened at an art exhibit at UALR.

It happened at a restaurant while I was eating lunch. It happened at a coffee shop where I bought a coffee.

The people who came up to me were Black and Brown and whyte… they were in West Little Rock and Downtown and midtown. And at the core of what each person said was the same theme.

This is a beautiful town we live in y’all.

This is our home.

All the compliments - extended to a flamboyantly trans-femme prancing her Queer ass through the streets of Little Rock with a camera - have given ME hope.

For the first time in the 12 years that I’ve lived in Little Rock, your compliments and kind words  this past week have made me feel more a part of this town than ever before.

Your compliments help me fit in and belong.

So don’t hold back… you may not see me out there today, but you’re gonna see somebody else beautiful and pretty doing beautiful and pretty things compliment them.

Compliment each other too.

Maybe it’s a pair of beautiful earrings that you compliment.

Maybe it’s the person who discretely picked up the trash and threw it away 

Be good to each other. 

Today more than ever, give one person… One complete fucking stranger… A compliment 

I love you all so much.

This is part of a year-long project for me - looking at Little Rock photographically in ways that it never has been. I keep playing with the title, but really what we have here is Little Rock through the trans gaze.

Every day I post a picture on BlueSky page (Link at [PinkVampire.org](http://PinkVampire.org) )

Weekly, I’ll curate a handful of photos alongside a journal entry about my experience in our city.

If you see me out “in the wild”, please come up and say hi - that’s the other reason for the picture, so that you’ll recognize me and approach me and we can talk about your life and your experience in Little Rock.

Sorry for the hashtag… I’m doing it solely for my ability to gather these posts and review the flow of the project from time to time

1iibaao,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1iibaao/friendship_breakdown_long_rant/,Friendship breakdown - long rant,"My best friend of 10 years and I recently went for a coffee. I hadn't seen her in around 3 weeks since Christmas when she went on a mini break. On the way back from the vacation, their car needed to be towed home due to a fault.

Context - my friend is a chronic spender. Had breast surgery, went on a fancy Caribbean cruise last year and luxury holidays not to mention clothes and other treats. They are planning on eloping to Europe to get married later this year alone. They have lots of credit card debt but in my opinion this is of their own doing - it's not like they were suddenly made redundant or had major health issues etc. I also don't drive.

So - in the three weeks, I reached out 5 separate times via text to check in with how she was getting on, and she replied each time. One of the times I said I missed her and we should figure out a coffee (I was thinking of just going to her house) but she just gave a non committal reply. I thought she was just busy.

At the coffee she vents for nearly an hour about all the problems in her life with the credit card debt and how sad she is, which I sympathise with. For a decade I have gone everywhere she wants me to because she 'hates doing things alone' and listened to her constant moaning. She then says 'it's made me wonder if we are just friends because of convenience, like because it's easy. If I didn't have a car would we still be friends and see each other as much' I said 'do you mean from me? like from my side?' and she said yes. I told her this made me really sad and she just drank some of her drink. 

In my eyes, she was accusing me of using her for her car, or only wanting to be her friend because she can drive. This is simply not true at all. I have known this woman for 10 years, had her beside me on my wedding day. We live maybe a 15 minute walk from each other, and we could always get a bus or train or walk to anywhere we wanted to hang out. She always just says 'I want to go to x I'll pick you up' and does, we arrange or see each other maybe weekly or fortnightly, and I have never ever asked her for a ride or to pick me up. She is quite lazy and never suggests to walk to meet or to get a train, she tends to often have her dog in the car also. I challenged her on this the next day and told her how much she had hurt me and she said 'Sorry if it upset you but I was just saying how I felt.' To me this is her confirming that she believes those things about our friendship, and is saying she doesn't think our friendship is a genuine connection. I now obviously feel like I can never get in her car again as I had no idea this was how she saw things at all. I would never want her to think this of me, and why is she only telling me this now?

We argued over text for a couple of days, and I said I will meet you somewhere to talk when the dust settles. She said I will come to your house at 6pm. I said I don't feel up to it today (as I had cried for hours over the situation) and said another day would be better when we are calmer. 

She got very aggressive, said I was making it into a big deal and it wasn't deep. I felt like she was gaslighting me and trying to make me sound dramatic. After being aggressive with me/name calling  she said 'let's just leave it'. I sent a calm reply explaining again how I felt she had betrayed our friendship by questioning it when I had given her no reason to, and how it made me question what other feelings she had about me behind my back that she was hiding. I was very civil, didn't react to the name calling. I said I will meet you somewhere one day next week to talk. 

Over a week goes by of silence, and so I assume she is done with me and 'leaving it'. A week is a long time to leave the conversation when she is regularly on Instagram. Yesterday, she messages me just a one line message asking if my husband got his blood test results back (he has Crohn's and is very unwell). 

This made me furiously angry. She completely ignored my message for a week and is now trying to act normal. There was no 'hello, how are you, do you still want to meet?' I feel like I want her gone from my life as I can't trust her or feel the same about her any more, and that there will always be an awkwardness. She then messaged my husband and said 'how do I sort this with her as I have no idea' - he is really unwell and doesn't want dragging into anything. As far as I was concerned we were 'leaving it' as she had said.

Although I am sad to think of all the happy times, she is a difficult person to be around sometimes and I feel like a weight has been lifted in some ways while we haven't been speaking. How would you cut this off if you were me? Do I just not reply any more and cut all contact?

1iib86i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iib86i/the_first_assignment_becoming_amanda_pierce/,The First Assignment: Becoming Amanda Pierce,"I should have known something was wrong when Ms. Grey's smile never reached her eyes.

The TempCorp Solutions office looked like any other corporate suite on the twenty-third floor of the Goldman Building - all glass, chrome, and that particular shade of gray that screams ""we mean business."" But the air felt different. Thicker somehow, like breathing through a wet wool blanket.

""Sarah Smith?"" Ms. Grey's voice was honey-smooth, professional. Perfect. Too perfect. ""Your paperwork is complete. We have your first assignment.""

I nodded, trying not to show how desperate I was. Three months of unemployment had eaten through my savings like acid through paper. My landlord's patience was wearing thinner than the walls of my studio apartment.

""You'll be covering for Amanda Pierce at Meridian Analytics,"" Ms. Grey said, sliding a manila folder across her pristine desk. ""Standard replacement contract. Four weeks, possibly extending to six.""

The folder contained Amanda's ID badge, her parking pass, and a sheet of login credentials. Her face smiled up at me from the photo - round-cheeked, brown hair, unremarkable. The kind of face you'd forget as soon as you looked away.

""But this is..."" I started.

""We provide seamless workplace transitions,"" Ms. Grey cut in, that perfect smile never wavering. ""Our clients expect their temps to step into roles completely. You'll use Amanda's desk, her email, her extension. For all intents and purposes, you are Amanda Pierce until the assignment ends.""

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a sound that would become my constant companion. ""Is that... legal?""

""Everything is perfectly in order."" Ms. Grey's fingers tapped once on her desk. ""Unless you'd prefer to decline?""

My rent was due in three days. ""No, I'll take it.""

The next morning, I stood in Meridian Analytics' lobby, wearing Amanda Pierce's name badge and clutching her security pass. The guard barely glanced at me before waving me through.

""Morning, Amanda,"" he said.

I opened my mouth to correct him, then remembered. ""Good morning.""

Amanda's desk was on the fourth floor, cubicle 4-15. Everything was exactly as she'd left it - family photos (husband, no kids), a half-empty bottle of hand sanitizer, a coffee mug with ""World's Okayest Employee"" printed on it. The keyboard was slightly sticky, like someone had spilled something sweet.

""Amanda!"" A woman in a blazer stopped by my cubicle. ""How was your mother's surgery?""

I froze. Ms. Grey hadn't mentioned anything about this. ""It went... well?""

""Oh, thank God. We were all so worried when you had to leave suddenly."" She squeezed my shoulder. ""Glad to have you back.""

Throughout the day, more colleagues stopped by. Each one called me Amanda without hesitation. Each one remembered things about Amanda's life that I shouldn't have known but somehow did. When Karen from Accounting mentioned Amanda's cat Mittens, I found myself automatically responding, ""Yeah, she's still scratching up the new couch.""

I hadn't meant to say it. I didn't know Amanda had a cat. But the words came out anyway, natural as breathing.

The worst part? The family photos on the desk had changed. The husband was different now - older, balder. And there were two kids I hadn't noticed before.

At 5:15 PM, an email from Ms. Grey appeared:

""First day performance review: Excellent integration. Remember, consistency is key to successful transitions. Maintain the role at all times, even off-hours. We'll be monitoring.""

I opened my purse to check my phone. My hands were shaking. That's when I noticed my own driver's license in my wallet. The face was mine, but something was off. The edges looked softer somehow, rounder. Like Amanda's face was bleeding into mine.

In the bathroom mirror, my reflection looked normal. But when I blinked, just for a split second, I could have sworn I saw Amanda staring back.

The worst part? I couldn't remember what my own mother looked like anymore. But I could picture Amanda's mother perfectly, down to the scar on her right knee from a childhood bicycle accident.

As I packed up to leave, I found something carved into the bottom drawer of Amanda's desk. The letters were shaky, desperate:

""THEY MAKE YOU FORGET WHO YOU WERE""

Below that, in fresher cuts:

""I DON'T WANT TO BE JANET ANYMORE""

Who was Janet? And why did that name make my head hurt so much?

I pulled out my TempCorp badge to sign out. The photo was still mine, but the name had changed.

It now read: ""Amanda Pierce (formerly Sarah Smith).""

The GPS led me to 1247 Maple Grove Drive without hesitation. My hands - Amanda's hands? - knew exactly how to grip the steering wheel, exactly where to turn. I hadn't needed directions. The muscle memory was already there, like a virus spreading through my nervous system.

The colonial-style house loomed before me, painted a soft blue that seemed wrong somehow. Hadn't it been yellow this morning? The garden gnome by the front steps winked at me with knowing ceramic eyes.

Greg's car was already in the driveway. Amanda's husband. My husband? The wedding ring on my finger felt simultaneously foreign and familiar, like a childhood scar you've forgotten about until someone points it out.

I sat in the car, watching the porch light flicker. The neighbor across the street was watching too, her face pressed against her window like a pale moon. When our eyes met, she quickly drew her curtains.

My phone buzzed. A text from Ms. Grey: ""Remember, consistency is key. The role doesn't end at 5 PM.""

The house key was on my ring, right where it had always been. No. Not always. Just since this morning. But my fingers found it without looking, like they'd done it thousands of times before.

The door opened before I could use it. Greg stood there, tall and balding, exactly like the photo on my desk. The photo that had changed.

""There you are, honey!"" His smile was warm, genuine. ""I was getting worried. You usually call when you're running late.""

The words came automatically: ""Sorry, traffic on Highland was terrible."" I hadn't driven on Highland. Had I?

He pulled me into a hug, and my body responded instinctively, fitting against his like a puzzle piece. He smelled of aftershave and coffee - familiar scents that triggered memories I shouldn't have had. Our first date at Marino's. The way he proposed in the rain. The honeymoon in Cabo.

But those weren't my memories. Were they?

""How's your mother doing?"" Greg asked as we moved into the kitchen. ""Did the doctor say when she can come home?""

""She's..."" I started, then stopped. Because I could see her, clear as day: Amanda's mother in the hospital bed, her right knee scarred from that childhood bicycle accident, smiling weakly as she held my - Amanda's - hand. ""She's recovering well.""

The kitchen was exactly as I remembered it, even though I'd never been there before. The magnetic letters on the fridge spelled out ""WELCOME HOME AMANDA."" Hadn't they said something else when I first walked in?

""You seem different,"" Greg said suddenly, studying my face. ""Did you do something with your hair?""

""No, I..."" I touched my hair self-consciously. In the reflection of the microwave door, my features seemed to shift and flow, like wax melting under heat. For a moment, I saw Amanda's round cheeks, her softer jaw. Then my own face again. Then something in between.

""Must be the light,"" Greg muttered, but his eyes held doubt. He opened the fridge, and I saw photos stuck to it with magnets. Photos of us - Greg and Amanda - at parties, on vacation, at their wedding. In each one, Amanda's face was slightly blurred, as if someone had smudged it with a thumb.

""Remember when we took that trip to Maine?"" Greg asked, pointing to one photo. ""You were so scared of the lobsters.""

I did remember. The salty air, the way the rubber bands around the lobsters' claws looked like tiny handcuffs. The irrational fear that they'd somehow break free. But that couldn't be my memory. Could it?

""Greg,"" I said carefully, ""what if I told you I'm not really Amanda?""

He laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Of course you're Amanda. Who else would you be?""

""Sarah,"" I whispered. 

Greg's face went blank for a moment, like a computer screen refreshing. Then he smiled again, but something was wrong with his eyes. They looked glazed, like a doll's. ""Don't be silly, honey. You're my Amanda. You've always been Amanda.""

I backed away from him, bumping into the fridge. The magnetic letters rearranged themselves: ""AMANDA (FORMERLY SARAH) (FORMERLY JANET).""

""I need to use the bathroom,"" I stammered.

""Second door on the left,"" Greg said automatically. ""Like it's always been.""

I knew it was the second door on the left. I knew the third floorboard creaked. I knew the hot water took exactly twelve seconds to warm up. I knew these things like I knew my own name.

But what was my name?

In the bathroom, I found a box of hair dye hidden under the sink. The same shade as Amanda's hair. Next to it was a small notebook, its pages filled with cramped handwriting:

""Day 1: My name is Janet Miller.

Day 15: My name is Amanda Pierce (formerly Janet Miller).

Day 30: My name is Amanda Pierce. Who is Janet Miller?""

The last entry was in different handwriting - my handwriting:

""Day 1: My name is Sarah Smith.

Day 1: My name is Amanda Pierce (formerly Sarah Smith).

Day 1: My name is Amanda Pierce Amanda Pierce Amanda Pierce""

When I looked in the mirror, I couldn't tell whose face was staring back.

The phone in my pocket buzzed again. Ms. Grey: ""Excellent progress on the transition. Phase 2 begins tomorrow. Remember to check your email for your next assignment. You'll be covering for Elizabeth Wong at Sterling Industries.""

But I was Amanda Pierce. Wasn't I?

The magnetic letters on the fridge had changed again when I returned to the kitchen: ""GOODBYE AMANDA. HELLO ELIZABETH.""

""As Sarah/Amanda faces her next assignment, what terrifying truth will she uncover?""

Options:   
\[A: Investigate Elizabeth Wong's current whereabouts - is she really ""on leave""?\]  
\[B: Confront Ms. Grey about the true nature of TempCorp's ""transitions""\]

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

29 F single

I currently live in San Diego (moved here 3 years ago from upstate NY) and while it’s been amazing, it’s obviously very expensive. I’ve made it work by having roommates this entire time, but I’m at the point in my life where nothing has ever felt “real” or “like a home” and I think a big piece of that is due to the fact I’ve never truly had my own place here, and I never will due to the HCOL. 

I currently work for myself online and while it brought be great success to get me out here and make a life, it’s wrecking my mental health and not something I want to do much longer. 

Part of me thinks I could grind grind grind, get a second job and sure maybe pay up the ass for a studio but I “grinded” the majority of my life to build my business to begin with and frankly, I’m exhausted. 

I have been leasing out a girls apartment while she travels the last 3 months to get a break from roomates and the lease is up at the end of this month. 

So now I am torn of my options — to stay or leave 

What I’m looking for:
- lower cost of living (looking for somewhere I can get an entire place for say ~1.3K rather a single room 😭) 
- needs to be near an ocean or a body of water 
- active lifestyle / community — I’m a fitness & health coach so this is huge to me!
- somewhere warm and SUNNY most the time, but don’t mind mild winters (but please nothing like NY winters) 
- walkability (to an extent, I do have a car!)
- SAFE
- some greenery - I love nature, land, peace — even the idea of say Oklahoma intrigues me for this
- don’t mind the city but can’t all be city 
- vibrant social life — I don’t drink so night life is not a huge factor to me but I do love exploring, trying new things, and having other things to do — that’s what I love about sd is there’s always something going on 
- having access to local farms & fresh produce (I’m a crunchy health queen) 
- good dating scene 
- don’t mind a bit of city either! (Something I have missed in sd)
- other: I love country music, trying new coffee shops, yoga/pilates, walk daily, live music, farmers markets

Here’s what I have considered (although I have been to none):

- Austin Tx - I heard the social aspect is similar to SD.  “Country” is a bit of my roots & I really miss that aspect and the idea of lots of land, farms, dancing, etc  — hence why Oklahoma is also appealing 

- Virginia - colder winters but apparently beautiful

- North or South Carolina 

- Florida (St Pete?) 

- Chicago? I heard this was very underrated and would give m some of the city vibe 

- another option is to travel abroad (Europe — Spain, Italy or Portugal) I have always wanted to go, and part of me feels I need to go or I’ll always wish I did. 

I could go drive back hone for a month & stay with my parents while I store some things away & save some cash, then go for 3-6 months (potentially more if I take language classes and apply for a student visa — I also have ancestral dna that would probably grant me dual citizenship). 

After building my dream business and now feeling like that no longer aligns, I feel so lost like I don’t know who I am or what I want anymore so this could be a good reset, as traveling you gain so much more perspective and clarity. 

- Open to anywhere else as well

- I also don’t HAVE to move — I can get a month to month lease with a roommate while I see if anything else is left for me here/give it more time/check out other places/and make a more clear decision — just don’t wanna waste time or more money 

I have not been to any of the above as I mentioned, but with a month left on this lease, I figured I could at least take a weekend trip to 1-2 of the places

Sorry for the mess, thanks if you read this far! SOSSSS

With its enchanting streets, breathtaking landmarks, and exquisite dining experiences, the city sets the perfect stage for a memorable escape. But, to make your romantic trip truly unforgettable, choosing the right hotel is essential. Here’s a guide to some of the most romantic hotels in Paris that will elevate your experience and provide the perfect atmosphere for love to bloom.

Imagine waking up to the soft glow of sunlight filtering through windows adorned with lace curtains, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. Boutique hotels offer this unique, intimate experience, often nestled in the quieter, charming neighborhoods of Paris. These hotels may not have the grandiosity of large chain establishments, but their charm lies in their personalized service and cozy atmosphere. Whether located near the Marais district or tucked away in Montmartre, boutique hotels are perfect for couples seeking a tranquil and intimate setting.

# 2. Rooftop Views for Unmatched Romance

If there’s one thing that makes Paris even more magical, it’s the city’s stunning skyline. Many hotels in Paris feature rooftops that offer panoramic views of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Seine River, and the historic cityscape. Dining under the stars with your loved one, watching the city light up as the night falls, is the epitome of romance. Opt for a hotel that boasts a rooftop bar or terrace where you can toast to your love while enjoying Parisian beauty in every direction.

# 3. Luxurious and Elegant Escapes

For couples who desire a blend of elegance and opulence, some of Paris’ most luxurious hotels offer world-class service, stunning décor, and all the amenities to make your stay unforgettable.

Whether you choose a historic hotel with a rich cultural legacy or a modern, high-end retreat, Paris has no shortage of luxurious accommodations perfect for a romantic escape.

# 4. Charming Hotels by the Seine River

For many, there’s nothing more romantic than strolling along the Seine River as the sun sets, casting a golden glow across the water. Hotels situated along the river offer not only stunning views but also easy access to some of the most romantic spots in Paris, such as the Pont des Arts or the Ile de la Cité. You can enjoy a leisurely breakfast with a view of the river or take a moonlit walk along the Seine. Whether you’re gazing out of your window or dining by the water, staying near the river enhances the romantic ambiance of Paris.

# 5. Parisian Palaces for an Unforgettable Stay

If you’re looking to treat your loved one to an unforgettable experience, consider staying in one of Paris’ magnificent palace hotels. These grand properties exude an air of refined luxury, with ornate interiors, chandeliers, and sweeping staircases that make you feel like royalty. From private spas to Michelin-starred restaurants, every moment spent in a palace hotel is designed to make you feel special. Whether you’re celebrating an anniversary, honeymoon, or just a spontaneous romantic trip, these majestic hotels are sure to make your getaway feel truly extraordinary.

# Conclusion

A romantic escape to Paris isn’t just about the places you visit, but the experiences you share together. From intimate boutique hotels to luxurious palaces with breathtaking views, the right hotel can set the tone for an unforgettable romantic adventure.

(long post),"I work in a group home for the mentally disabled. The home I work for is a very rare type of home. The closest one to mine is about 200 miles away. The 8 men that I assist in taking care of are all extremely high functioning autistics, some of them have other mental illness or physical ones. Either way, they aren't ever living by themselves no matter how smart they are. They've proven that in their past, most of them will likely pass away in this home. We know it, they know it, so we live like a family as best possible.   
  
Now these guys are geniuses in whatever field they're interested in, and why am I making this post? Well, it's because the company so desperately LOVES to put them in as tax credit/write offs as ""high functioning"". However, when it comes down to treating them accordingly? It's horrendous IMO. 

They are to follow the same exact routines and rules the other clients throughout the entire company which are extremely degrading to a ""normie"". We're talking about child like day programs, hard set bedtimes, no phone calls after last med administration, and things like that. It is really starting to get on not only their nerves, but us staffs as well. 

These guys aren't your average every day mentally ""disabled"" people. They can speak coherently (one is multilingual), they shower/dress themselves, make coffee, and generally do things in the home themselves. Of course we assist them whenever they call for help. They still do need it every so often just like all of us. 

Now this is where I get mad. Yesterday, corporate came in for their regular monthly medication audit. While they were there, we had a meeting, and it was only to go over the basics. However, this time the meeting lasts a bit longer. We get told that we ***MUST*** choose their daily clothing for whatever they are doing that day, make sure they wash their entire body, make their coffee, follow an extremely disgusting meal plan, and must be treated equal to the other clients. 

While I get that there needs to be a standard set for everything? I believe the standard is only that. STANDARD! We are to excel that standard and take it farther; it's lowest form of ""acceptable"". If these men can do things themselves then why are we taking away their personal ambulatory and decision-making freedom? Why are we putting them in situations like checking their bathing habits? These guys don't like social interaction much, so imagine having to go into the bathroom after they shower to check if every part was washed? That's messed up.

To conclude, a short story from yesterday on this long AF post. I am sorry it's so long but I'm heated. 

I get told to go make sure one of the clients is dressed accordingly for the day. We had no plans, just lounging around the home. This man is 68 years-old and is one of the guys who loves space. He's very well spoken, although he stutters sometimes. I go into his room . . . I'm looking at a man whose sitting in his recliner, sipping coffee, and looking out his window at the remaining snow as it melts. He's wearing a tweed suit, looking like the freshest Harvard astronomy professor I could imagine, and I have to tell him to put on some sweat pants and a T-shirt. FUCKING WHY!?!?!?!? LITERALLY LOOKS BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THE BUILDING! OUTCLASSING EVEN CORPORATE! Jesus, this is so stupid!

I’ve been consuming mostly red meat (steak, pork belly, salmon, canned tuna) with cheese, eggs and some vegetables like cabbage, mushrooms, cauliflower and broccoli. I have been aiming to eat less than 1200 kcal with less than 20 g carbs for weight loss.

Due to my schedule, I usually just have a black coffee with a dash of double cream for breakfast and I pack my lunch (meat/ fish + veggies) in a thermos and eat it around 10am. After 2 hours, I feel extremely hungry and at times dizzy! After lectures I find it very tiring to walk back home, upon which the urge to binge something sweet or filling becomes so overwhelming so I’ve been resolving this with pulsin keto bars or a scrambled egg in butter.

I’ve been drinking sufficient water and I don’t understand why I don’t feel fuller with a high-fat diet compared to eating rice / pasta like I used to. Immediately after the meal I feel extremely satiated, if not a little greasy and sick. 

I’m usually someone with a super sweet tooth and loves carbs so perhaps the abrupt change is messing with my body. Please let me know what I’m doing wrong! (It’s my first time posting on Reddit so please be kind 🙂‍↕️) Thank you very much..!",2,1738765335.0,keto,27,0.75,False

What does your diet look like and how’s it working for you? How often and intense are your flares? 

I was an omnivore, drinking coffee (1 per day) and the occasional cocktail (1-2 on a weekend) and a lot of processed foods during the worst flares. Once I went vegetarian, I could count on 3 days between flares, instead of daily. When I cut out caffeine completely, it got better. I know alcohol can cause vomiting (for me) so I’m down to a sip if hubby has something interesting, just to taste it. 

I also have never really done sodas, energy drinks, or sugar-free stuff. And we cut out artificial dyes and flavorings and most seed oils in the last 18 months as well. 

I miss bourbon, BBQ, cheeseburgers, and candy. But I’m not nauseated, vomiting, and in pain all the time. It’s only been about 18 months and it’s still trial and error. I still get SUPER queasy after eating. Doesn’t matter how small the portions are. And I still can’t drink with my meals. But I feel like overall it’s a little improved.

I'm relatively new to grinding whole beans and I've found that the ones I buy from the supermarket grind so much easier than the specialty stuff I buy. It takes a lot more elbow grease, and additionally the grounds always get stuck in my grinder and I need to use a brush to get them all out.

I'm using the filter blend from Sqaure Mile, which is a much lighter roast than the supermarket stuff so that's a variable to consider. Grinder is the Timemore C3 Pro. Anything I can be doing to make my life easier? I've seen people spray water on their beans before grinding, is this necessary? Thanks in advance y'all! :)

As someone who can’t start the day without a solid cup of coffee, this machine has been both a blessing and, at times, mildly frustrating. It’s sleek, functional, and capable of crafting an impressive array of beverages, but there are a few quirks worth discussing.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my eye was the modern and professional design of the Lavazza Classy Plus. It fits well in my kitchen without occupying too much counter space—an important point when you live in a small apartment like me. The black finish is elegant, and the build feels sturdy, though not overly heavy. I appreciate that it doesn’t look like a clunky appliance; instead, it almost adds a bit of sophistication to the room. It comes with a built-in milk frother, which was a game changer for me since I love my lattes and cappuccinos. However, the frother’s material seems prone to slight wear and tear, so extra care is needed while cleaning.

Curious about the Lavazza Classy Plus Machine? [Check the latest price on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/lavazza-classy-plus-review-model-lb-400-b08j8j3s4y/)

**Brewing Performance**

This machine is a multitasker’s dream. It prepares espresso, lungo, 8 oz coffee, and milk-based drinks like cappuccinos and lattes with ease. The speed is commendable; I can have a perfectly brewed espresso in under a minute. The double-shot feature is my go-to for those mornings when a single shot just won’t cut it. However, there’s a slight inconsistency in the brewing. Occasionally, the pod placement feels like a guessing game because if it’s not seated just right, the coffee might not brew properly. I’ve also noticed a little water ends up in the capsule compartment at times, which Lavazza claims is “normal,” but it feels unnecessary.

**Coffee Flavor**

As a bit of a coffee snob, the taste is, of course, what matters most. I’ve tried a variety of Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules with this machine, and the results have been excellent. The espresso is bold and full-bodied, and the milk-based beverages have a smooth, creamy texture. That said, I find the coffee options slightly on the strong side, which might not suit those who prefer a milder taste. My husband, on the other hand, loves the punchy flavor and insists it’s better than what we used to get from our local café. Guests have also been impressed with how professional the drinks look and taste.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Here’s where things get a bit dicey. The machine is relatively easy to clean, especially since the milk frother and other parts are detachable. However, the manual descaling process is a chore. After three months of regular use, I tackled my first descaling session, and while it wasn’t overly complicated, it’s not something I look forward to doing. Also, the occasional leakage at the bottom of the machine has me wondering if I got a less-than-perfect unit. It’s manageable but annoying enough to mention.

**Pros**

* Compact and elegant design fits well in small spaces.
* Versatile beverage options, from coffee to milk-based drinks.
* Quick brewing time, perfect for rushed mornings.
* Coffee flavor is rich and satisfying, especially for espresso lovers.
* Built-in milk frother eliminates the need for additional tools.

**Cons**

* Pod placement can be finicky, leading to occasional brewing mishaps.
* Slight water leakage into the capsule compartment can be frustrating.
* Descaling and maintenance require time and patience.
* Milk frother material feels delicate over time.
* Some users might find the coffee taste too strong.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to machines like the Nespresso Vertuo or Keurig K-Café, the Lavazza Classy Plus holds its ground with its robust coffee flavor and milk frothing capabilities. Nespresso machines might offer a slightly more refined espresso experience, but they lack the all-in-one convenience of the Lavazza’s built-in milk frother. Keurig machines, while versatile with their pod options, don’t quite match the quality of coffee produced by the Lavazza Classy Plus. However, Nespresso’s capsule system feels smoother and doesn’t have the pod-placement issues I’ve experienced with Lavazza. Price-wise, the Lavazza offers significant value for its features, as long as you’re okay with sticking to Lavazza’s own capsules.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While not the cheapest machine on the market, the Lavazza Classy Plus is reasonably priced for its all-in-one functionality. The cost of the capsules is competitive, especially if you buy in bulk, and they’re easy to find online. That said, the need for specific capsules may be a drawback for those who prefer more flexibility in their coffee options. Considering the design, performance, and flavor quality, I’d say it’s worth the investment—especially for someone who loves milk-based coffee drinks and wants a café experience at home.

**Features Breakdown**

The machine comes with several standout features that I’ve tested thoroughly. The adjustable height for cups is a small but thoughtful addition. The milk frother works seamlessly, and the buttons are straightforward to use. The double-shot function is a lifesaver for caffeine addicts like me. However, I do wish the machine could accommodate different pod sizes, as some competitors offer more versatility in this regard. It’s also worth noting that the noise level is average—not too loud but not whisper-quiet either.

When i post, I’m generally bombarded with miscalculating calories- but I’m really not. Like I’m actually seriously not. There is no way, unless i absorb calories from the air or something. 

I have to eat the school lunch due to working in Japan, it’s generally 700 calories a day. If they give us bread i don’t eat it, which saves me some calories. I don’t drink anything but water and tea and black coffee. For dinner i usually eat vegetables and a small protein, i generally try to keep it around 200 calories. Bc if i breach 1,000, i don’t lose weight. 

I am fairly active, not super super active but im on my feet all day, i dont own a car so i walk everywhere. I get a lot of steps in and lately have been working out more and more on top of my calorie deficit. 

It was only when i finally started restricting to under 1,000 that I was able to actually lose weight. I’ve lost 3 kg or so. 

I think that because ever since being around 9 years old, i only usually ate one meal a day. I looked up the symptoms for slow metabolism and I’ve struggled with them all my life. Looking back there were many days I’d eat around 500 calories as a kid and that’s it. I genuinely wonder if due to that my metabolism is totally messed up. When I was a kid i would eat like one hot pocket a day or something. I can’t believe i used to do that but i am wondering if that’s what makes it so so so hard for me to lose weight. 

Again i know im not miscounting calories. When i tell you guys im hardly eating anything, like seriously actually. Almost only vegetables and protein as well, i only eat rice in the school lunch. 

I just wanted to update that after much thought and calculation i literally don’t (or very very very slowly) lose weight unless im at less than 1,000 and i think its due to a very very slow metabolism. Moral of the story… feed your kids so they don’t develop the slowest metabolism known to man. 

Anyways I’m around 4’11 and around 125 pounds. Hoping to lose more This next month but I’ve been very sick and haven’t gotten better for almost two weeks. Wish me luck on the strictest diet ever lol",0,1738764886.0,WeightLossAdvice,9,0.33,False
