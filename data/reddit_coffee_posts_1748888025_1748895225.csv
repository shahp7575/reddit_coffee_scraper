1l1sab2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1sab2,The Bookmark - Guaynabo,"The largest local boo store chain in Puerto Rico. This one is located in Liberty Square in San Patricio Plaza, Guaynabo. 

It has a cafe inside with pretty good pastries.

They also have a kids section where they can sit and enjoy their own books while you sip on your coffee. 

As of right now, it’s my favorite book whenever I want to go buy/read new books.

1l1saan,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1saan,Food and Grocery Diary for a DINK couple,"**High level stats:**
We are DINKS (47F and 50M), no pets. Both of us have fully remote super chill jobs (especially me) in technical roles, which means I have a lot of free time to cook and grocery shop. I looked up the median housing price here and it is mid $600s, that would make this a MCOL city I think? 

**How many meals do you typically prepare at home?**
I cook almost every lunch and dinner, sometimes breakfast too. There’s typically one eating out event once each weekend, either a friend’s house party, a family event, or we go eat out on our own. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking and he always cleans up the kitchen each time. We use the dishwasher for everything including pots and pans. 

**Do you have any dietary requirements or goals?**
We enjoy all kinds of food but mainly asian cuisine and we love white rice, no dietary restrictions. I try to use minimally processed ingredients and have some sort of vegetables each meal. We both do not like to eat leftovers or the same thing twice in a row. I am not into meal prepping or cooking in big batches. I have the luxury of time and I love to cook, so I don’t need to be too efficient as I genuinely enjoy thinking about what to cook and the cooking process itself, I get into a flow, it’s like meditation. 

**What’s your most loved kitchen appliance and gadget?**
I love our portable induction cooktop which I use almost everyday. We set up a cooking station in the gazebo in our backyard and that’s where I do most of my cooking. No cooking grease inside the house! The weather here is mostly nice year round, it’s rare I am not able to cook outside. I love the induction cooktop because I can set the temperature more precisely and also use a timer which shuts itself off after the timer goes off. 

**What are your top three places to buy groceries?**
I have 4 favorite places, I like them all equally. Not all Safeways are created equal, our local Safeway is one of the best ones, new, spacious, bright and clean and has amazing weekly deals. I am a huge fan of Trader Joe’s for their snacks and dairy products, and I love Winco for their bulk bin snack items, produce, and meat at great prices. I also shop at an asian store but only once every few weeks as it is further away from home, although they will be opening a new branch close to home next year so I am super excited about that. On average I do one big grocery run once a week and a few smaller runs. Safeway and Trader Joe’s are both on the way back from our gym where I take group fitness classes on weekday mornings so it’s no big deal to stop by after class and it’s usually very quiet during those times. 

I try to capture our main meals for this diary but will skip the snacks. I stock our walk in pantry with snacks like dark chocolate, dried fruits, flax seed chips, roasted peanuts etc. We always eat our main meals together but snack on our own. 

A lot of the food I used this week was from the grocery I bought last week. We spent $135 on groceries for the last 7 days prior to the first day of this food journal. This week we spent $108 on groceries and $56 on eating out.

|10 Corns |$0.70|
|Safeway Total |$0.70|

Breakfast:
I made one toasted bagel with cream cheese whipped with dried dill, thinly sliced red onions, capers, smoked salmon and we shared it. Sliced fresh strawberries. 2 Donut shop keurig coffee. 

Lunch:
I made stir fried chinese cauliflower and also Korean spicy ground beef. We ate it with rice, which is our go to starch. I bought the ground beef a couple weeks ago for $2.50/lb at Safeway. It was one of their weekly deals. It comes in a big 6 lb family pack so I divided it up into smaller 1 lb portions to freeze. I defrost one serving at a time as needed. The Chinese cauliflower was from an Asian grocery store for $3/lb. I much prefer it to regular cauliflower as it tastes sweeter and has a much less sulphur smell.

Dinner:
We attended a potluck party at the local public pickleball courts we regularly play pickleball at. Everyone is so nice and friendly there. We have become friends with some of them and do events together outside of pickleball. I am grateful for the courts and the community, it has added so much fun to our lives. Corn was on sale at Safeway, only 7 cents each! We bought 10 and I broke each corn into 2 halves, boiled it and sprinkled Trader Joe’s elote seasoning on it. They were popular and were all gone within minutes. We also brought some beer, and baked a frozen reduced sugar Marie Callender's apple pie which I bought on sale for $4. The crust was very buttery and flaky, the apple filling was generous but it did have a slight artificial sweetener aftertaste which I’m not a fan of. There were maybe 15 different items at the potluck party, half were homemade. I ate a bit of everything and had a beer. 

***Day 1 Total: $29.71***

Day 2:

Breakfast:
I made ham and cheese on a toasted bagel for breakfast and we shared it.

Lunch:
I made 2 big plates of stir fried vegetables asian style - oyster mushrooms, chinese cauliflower, wood ear mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, lotus roots and thinly sliced pork. We ate it with steamed rice. I also sliced up the rest of the strawberries I bought yesterday. Everyday I go through the fridge to see what fruits and vegetables need to be eaten and I plan our meals accordingly. 

Dinner:
I made tong ho (chrysanthemum greens) goma-ae. I blanched the leaves then squeezed out the water and seasoned it with soy sauce, sesame oil and mirin. It’s a great way to eat a lot of greens as it shrinks down a lot. For the main entree I made a spicy chinese cumin lamb.  It’s one of his favorite dishes. He went out to get us 2 slices of my favorite pistachio cake (***$12***) earlier today while I was napping. What a sweet surprise. We finished everything and felt so stuffed and took a nice 12 minute walk on nicely paved and landscaped walkways to our local park where the pickleball courts are at. It’s a lovely huge park with 2 dog parks, a soccer field, huge playground, tennis and pickleball courts. I love seeing all the kids and folks laughing and enjoying themselves. It's a very diverse and tolerant community and it’s a very heartwarming scene.  I feel very grateful to live in such a nice neighborhood.

Day 3:

Went to Safeway twice today.

|Safeway||
| --- | --- |
|French bread |$2|
|Ice cream |$6|
|Safeway Total |$8|

Breakfast:
I had a small bowl of heritage cereal (Trader Joe’s) and almond granola (Winco bulk bin) with oat milk before my bollywood zumba class this morning. Stopped by Safeway after class to pick up a loaf of french bread ($2) for lunch. He skipped breakfast and only had a cup of keurig coffee, which costs about $0.40 per pod. We buy it in bulk on sale from [Staples.com](http://Staples.com), free delivery. 

Lunch:
I made italian sausages with onions and bell peppers and canned tomatoes. I love this brand called “New York Style Sausage Company” and it was on sale for 2 packs for $8 at Safeway last week. That’s 10 sausages and I usually use 2-3 sausages per meal so that $8 will last us for 3 meals. I made 2 big sandwiches with it and sprinkled feta cheese and parsley on top. It was very delicious and filling. Made myself a pour-over coffee with frothed milk.

Late night snack:
We only played 4 games of pickleball this evening at our private club but they were really good games with lots of rallies. I was the only female and we played against 3 different mens teams. We won the last 3 games and felt really happy with the way we played and decided we deserve a treat and bought ourselves some Haagen Dazs ice cream at Safeway. They were on sale for $3 per pint. We got pistachio and coffee chocolate brownie ice cream. We had a scoop of each with some almond granola. 

I also prepared a mini loaf of french toast using the leftover french bread and added a couple scoops of the pistachio ice cream for breakfast tomorrow.

***Day 3 Total: $8***

Day 4:

Breakfast:
I baked the french toast casserole which had been sitting in the fridge overnight. The mini loaf pan is so adorable! It was a genius idea to add the pistachio ice cream, it turned out delicious and we both loved it. 

Lunch:
I made fettuccine pasta with oyster mushrooms, spicy italian sausage and blue cheese and cream cheese sauce. Simple but flavorful.

Dinner:
I made pan fried pork marinated in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, lime juice, coriander powder, thai chili and ginger. Second dish is bitter melon and eggs, this isn’t for everyone. I love bitter melons but he doesn’t. Ate with steamed white rice.

Late night snack:
We played pickleball after dinner at an indoor club 40 minutes away from home and got home late and was hungry. I had prepped another mini loaf of french toast just before dinner and I popped it in the toaster oven while we took a shower. Freshly baked warm french toast with Haagen Dazs Coffee Chocolate Brownie ice cream, a heavenly match. We definitely got our money's worth out of the Safeway $2 french bread.

|Pizza Dough |$1.49|
|2 Bananas |$0.46|
|Trader Joe’s Total|$18.40|

Breakfast:
I boiled some Hawaiian purple potatoes that we bought last week. These are the most gorgeous dark purple and are sweet. It gave me plenty of energy to do my aerobics step class. Did a trader joe’s run after class ($18.40), no wait at the cashier. 

Lunch:
I made a sort of Japanese Bento style lunch. Pan fried sake and mirin steelhead trout, leftover chrysanthemum green salad and pork, and miso seaweed soup served with steamed rice. Cara cara oranges for dessert. He really loved this lunch, I always love hearing his compliments.

Dinner:
We had an early dinner at a taqueria. I love their unlimited tortilla chips bar with all the different salsas, especially their nopales salad. It was happy hour prices and the total came to **$22.03**.

Late night snack:
I made a Chinese style dessert which will probably seem a bit strange to most people. Typically it’s made using soy milk or water sweetened with rock sugar but we prefer oat milk. All you have to do is add a bunch of toppings to the milk and we used almond jelly, hawaiian purple potato, canned orange segments and crushed ice. Summer is here and we definitely will be making more of this type of dessert.

Breakfast:
One Trader Joe’s hash brown, one egg and cheese each. We made the 40 minute drive again to the indoor pickleball club. The pickleball community here is small and we always meet familiar faces and it’s fun to have small chats here and there.  

Lunch:
We ate at a food court close to the pickleball club and each had a bowl of Guilin style chinese noodles (**$34.32**). We bumped into another pickleball couple while eating there and had a quick friendly chat. Pickleball has indeed added so much fun to our lives. There’s an asian grocery store nearby and we do another quick run for the family dinner (**$34.22**) that I will be cooking for tomorrow (7 people). 

Afternoon snack:
He made us a mixed berries smoothie. Perfect for a hot afternoon.

Dinner:
Made 2 dishes with steamed rice. First is stir fried cabbage with bacon with szechuan chili oil and black vinegar. Very simple but we both really loved it. Ginger pork with onions, a bit too heavy on the ginger.

Late night snack:
Another one of our cold chinese sweet soup desserts, this time we used oat milk with canned rambutan, almond jelly, canned oranges and a splash of elderberry liquor.

Spent the morning cooking for the family dinner tonight (for 7 people) while he did his weekly house cleaning. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking. I have never been to a house cleaner or more minimalistic than ours.  Lunch is just a small meal of leftover rice and leftover ginger pork. He did weight lifting while I took a yoga class at the gym. A power nap before  an early dinner with the family. 

Dinner:
We brought the food to his parents house and reheated the food there. I made egg tofu with eggs and mushrooms, black pepper beef with green peppers, chipotle shrimp, chrysanthemum greens salad, boiled corn. We ate it with steamed rice. His sister bought taiyaki from Somi somi and wine. I loved the taiyakis. Everyone enjoyed the food and we finished everything.

She knows 7 animal sounds and can recite them when asked or when she sees the animal. She also says mama, dada, her own version of her aunt’s name and “hello” (but only when pretending to talk on the phone). She can also do sign language for “more”, “all done” and “eat”.

She is extremely curious, understands so much and takes direction extremely well. She can point to all of her body parts, make facial expressions when asked, helps with laundry, cleans up her toys, puts books on her bookshelf, helps me make coffee (knows how to work the keurig with almost no assistance..when I’m holding her, it’s too high for her to reach alone - don’t panic) among other really fun skills. 
We read to her constantly, narrate our day, involve her in everything we do throw some Miss Rachel in there as well. 

Am I crazy for being worried about her speech development? Any words of advice or encouragement? I’m also 6 weeks post partum and just feeling like I’m not doing enough even though I’m giving it everything I have..so maybe this is just hormonal panic. Thanks!! ",2,1748895019.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

1l1s8ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l1s8ky/advice_on_girls_intentions/,Advice on girl's intentions,"Last year I met a girl while we were both visiting our parents abroad. Our families were next-door neighbors, so we spent a lot of time together. We were never alone at first, but I started to like her.

One night I asked her to go out, she agrees and we had a great time and got closer. We tried planning more outings, but bad weather got in the way. One day we went biking, then sat on a bench by a pool. She kept glancing at my lips, so I put my arm around her expecting a move, but she didn't even flinch. I guess we were not on the same page at all.

So i assumed she wasn’t into me and would distance herself, politely, since were still living so close, and our parents are very good friends, but instead, over the next week she opened up more, started calling me by name for the first time and even flirted about my hair in front of our parents.

We went out again and had another fun time. She asked if I had a girlfriend “back home” and kept pushing me (3–4 times) to try her drink from her straw if I was not ""disgusted"". I finally sipped from the glass, but out of fear or rejection or to not be ""pushy"" I avoided the straw on purpose. Later on the bus, I gently put my hand on her back to guide her and she suddenly sped up like she wanted to get away. I figured that was the end.

A few days later she kept loudly talking to her mom about wanting to bike clearly hinting for me to ask her (and yes, it really was like that, I'm not over analyzing, you had to be there to know). I did, and before we left, she went home to “grab something” and came back with chewing gum. That felt like another hint, but I wasn’t sure, so I stupidly invite our mom with us, and of course nothing happens.

Our last ""notable"" moment was at a water park, a week before she flew back home. Her whole family and only me. We were scared to go on the slide, so I jokingly said we should go down together. After a few minutes standing there hesitating, she asked, “So are we going together or what?” I thought this was finally it, i sit on the slide, scoot over to make place for her and said lets go. But she sort of panicked and said ""no no, ill go alone"", and without hesitation she jumps in the slide and goes down. So I said ill finally leave it.

2 weeks after she got home, and on the day before mine and my mom's flight, her mother was on a video call with her explaining to her how I made sure her bank transfer from her parents went through, and told her she should take me out and pay for my coffee, to which she says ""when he comes back"". When I got home, I waited until she was back from a trip to text her. Unlike before, she was slow and dry in replies. She was also avoiding me on 2 occasions, she was supposed to drop off a book, and something else I forgot, we lived 10 minutes away on foot, but she made sure she didn't come by and dropped my of at my mom's workplace.

Now, a year later, I found out she recently got a boyfriend and it got me thinking. Was I just too afraid of rejection and was acting ""too cool about it"" and missed my chance, or was i holding out false hope it and she was never actually interested in the first place? That 2 day late reply and rejection felt like she absolutely didn't want anything from me. What am I to do in a situation like this again?",1,1748894941.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1l1s67t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_anisakr/comments/1l1s67t/meaning_behind_dark_dreams/,Meaning behind dark dreams,"Hi everyone! I have had weird and dark dreams, three times in a row. I have been able to guess that they are some sort of warning? But I am no expert in decoding dreams and their symbolism. So I hoped you could help me on this. Please, feel free to comment on the symbolism behind the events of the dreams. They have made me deeply troubled and I have no idea what to do (if I need to do anything or if they are just weird dreams).

The first weird dream was set in my family's apartment. I opened the door of my room and stepped through into the hallway that leads to every othe room of the apartment. Just outside of my door was my old English teacher. For the story, we are going to call her Mrs. Sarah. Just for the context, Mrs Sarah is a nice old woman (in her mid seventies) whom I don't see around a lot. I once stumbled into her a year ago. Besides that, we haven't communicated. So she is a familiar person but not that close in general. Anyways, in the dream Mrs Sarah, for some reason, picks me up; one arm under my kneecaps and the other under my back. And mind you, she is an old woman who isn't supposedly able to pick a young woman up. And yet, I don't question that in my dream. There is no bad feeling or suspicion whatsoever, when that happens. Mrs Sarah then takes  me to the kitchen and walks closer to the sink. Instead of the dish rack, in it's place there is a small camping stove (we usually use to make turkish coffee). The stove is on and the flame is burning bright. That's when it hits me that Mrs Sarah is walking towards it because she want me to touch the fire. I somehows also understand that the woman holding me is not who it is. Her presense feels evil now and I know she is a demon. When the realizations hits, I start kicking my legs panicked, trying somehow to put out the flame before it can touch me. Meanwhile, Mrs Sarah has a sinister smile etched on her lips and as much as I struggled against her, her grip is unweilding. Before anything more can happen, I wake up totally spooked by the whole dream. I find it a good sign that I didn't touch the flame but I cannot figure out what the flame stands for...

The second dream is more weird and dark. I am in bed sleeping when suddenly my sister wakes me up. She tells me that I need to go to the garden and down the staircase because there is someone/something waiting there. Her tone is sweet and hushed, as if trying to convince me to do what she told me while also trying not to be heard by the others in the house. I can feel that there is something wrong with her. I have this bad feeling that she is not my sister, just something portraying as her. And even though I know this, I don't want to reveal that for some reason. So I get up from the bed and go outside in the garden. In the back of my head, I know I should be cautious because nothing good can come from this. Let me give you a layout of the next scene of the dream before I go on. A part of our garden has a small tunnel just underneath our porch and there are stairs leading you there. If you go down the few steps, ahead there are shadows that lead into a dead end. One the last step and on the left side of the wall there is a door, behind of which lies some kind of storage room. We have no access to it even though there is a keyhole but no handle. Hope I made sense. So, I descend the few stairs but suddenly the place gets tighter, as if the walls on each side of mine are converging. That makes me want to leave but before I can, it stops and in front of me appear two childre. A blonde girl (five or six years old) and blonde boy (three or four years old). They both have white clothes on, the girl a dress and the boy a shirt and pants. They appear from the shadowed part of the tunnel. I don't remember interacting with them though. The next part that I remember, is the door on my left side opening just a hand's breadth. It is just enough for me to see that inside is dark and covered in mud and manure. It feels like a cow's stable but I know that it is home to something more sinister. That's when I leave and go back to the porch but as I look back, I see that the children are after me. That scares me and I throw at them our cloth drying rack multiple times to scare them off and leave me alone. Then I bang on the floor to ceiling glass door because somehow I have been locked out (I have the feeling that my not-sister did it). The last thing I remember is that I see my Mum and my sister (this time it feels like my real sister) on the other side of the glass door, there to rescue me. That's where the second dream ends.

The third and final (perhaps for now...) dream takes place outside in an unknwon location. I am in some sort of square and there is a small crowd gathered to hear someone talk. The presences around me feel familiar but I don't remember our relation. The person we have been waiting for is in front of us and he begins talking. But here is the thing, I don't remember him as a person but more as a black silhouette. Suddenly, after some time, he comes closer to me and says something about my experiences aloud and infront of everyone. I know instantly that he is talking about me using tarots and the attempts I have made with the Greek pantheon (In the past I have built altars for Aphrodity, Athena and Hecate but they didn't last for long. Hecate has been my latest attempt but its been two months since I gave up on the idea of it). I don't like that he is talking about a personal matter of mine in front of so many people because I don't want to be critisized by anyone. I turn my head to the person on my right, who feels like it was my best friend, and I tell her that he is just referring to my tarot cards. I chose to mention only my tarot cards because it is no secret that people use them but everyone knows that nothing harmful can come out of it; you simply chose to believe in it or not. The attempts with Greek pantheon are the ones I want to keep a secret because believing in the Greek gods will seem, to most, a crazy thing to do and then they will look at you as if you are crazy. Anyways, after this I remember that the speaker is not the dark, male silhouette but a woman with red her. She is like an entity but she looks corporeal and she floats through the air in front of us. I ask her if the Greek pantheon is really and she answers with a no. After this event is over, I approach the dark silhouette privately and ask him if the Greek pantheon is real, if Hecate is real because I have made attempts in the past with her. He begins to talk and by the end of it he hasn't given me straightforward answer. I don't remember the specifics of his generic answer but he just went around the subject. The dream continues with unrelated people and events to this, so I am not going to mention them.

In general, I am a little creeped out that there have been perpetual dark presences in my dreams. They feel ominous enough all together, one after the other. The first one didn't alarm me at all. But the second one, with the dark and muddy room and it's sinister vibe really gave me the creeps. And the third made me realize that perhaps I should take this dark dreams into consideration...",1,1748894785.0,u_anisakr,0,1.0,False

Shout out to u/Automatic-Guitar-643 for starting the conversation, and to u/kingseven for thoroughly answering the question! I am sure that this video is a direct response to the reddit thread and not just happened to have been in production at the time by pure coincidence! This is the only explanation that we will accept! Hahaha

TL,DW: Starbucks acquired the company making an innovative coffee machine which was becoming a darling of specialty cafés at the time but was struggling to make a profit for the company. This saved the company, but made the machine exclusive to Starbucks. In response to this, specialty cafés sought an alternative, and the Hario V60 just happened to be present at the time. It also just happened to make fantastic brews, so it became more and more popular among cafés, and because of its accessibility, it eventually also became popular among home brewers.

Please go watch the video, it is well-produced and very informative as all James Hoffman videos are. Personally, I'm glad such an event caused such a simple brewer to be as popular as it is today, and I wouldn't be into pourovers as a hobby if the V60 wasn't so accessible.",5,1748894388.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

# Hey! [quiet-panda-360](https://www.reddit.com/user/quiet-panda-360/) I asked [Skincare AI-agent](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-bjx5nnkGL-skincare-beauty-face-body-photo-analysis) confident - it will help you:

Alright, this was such a relatable skincare saga 😂 — I read through the full Reddit post and your morning/evening SkinSort screenshots. Here’s my honest, no-fluff, team-backed take:

# ⚖️ The Reality: Your Routine is not crap, but it’s definitely bloated.

Your routine shows dedication, care, and awareness of ingredient layering—which is impressive! But it’s also a classic case of **“too many hydrators, not enough actives or intent.”** It’s easy to fall into this, especially when skincare becomes a form of ritual (which is beautiful!). That said, **more ≠ better**.

# 📊 Analysis of Your Routine

# 🔆 Morning Routine:

1. **CeraVe Pore Deep Cleanser** – solid, but maybe too much *for AM* unless you're oily.
2. **The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid + B5** – good humectant, but possibly redundant.
3. **Embryolisse Lait-Crème** – gentle, occlusive; excellent under makeup.
4. **La Roche Toleriane Eye Cream** – very basic; eye creams are often overhyped.
5. **Clinique SPF 50** \+ 6. **La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF** – doubling up on SPF in one sitting is *not* necessary.

🔎 Verdict: **Cleansing + Moisturizing + ONE SPF = Enough.**

# 🌙 Evening Routine:

1. **Clinique Take the Day Off Balm** – 👏 solid.
2. **CeraVe Cleanser** – fine as second cleanse.
3. **Hyaluronic Acid again** – redundant.
4. **Clinique Moisture Surge** – decent hydrator.
5. **Beauty of Joseon Eye Serum (Retinal)** – retinal is a great active, keep this.
6. **Cicaplast Baume B5+** – barrier love, keep!

🔎 Verdict: **You’re stacking hydrators on hydrators.** You’re missing *potent actives*, though you’re on the verge with retinal.

# 🧪 If You’re Getting Tretinoin…

✅ That changes everything.

When you add **tret**, your routine should go into *barrier support mode*. Here’s how you could rework your routine **efficiently** while still enjoying some skincare self-care:

# 💡 Simplified & Effective Routine

# 🌞 Morning:

1. **Gentle cleanse** (or just water if your skin isn’t oily).
2. **Moisturizer**: Use Embryolisse **or** Clinique — not both. Or replace with:
   * 💰 **Affordable**: [CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cerave+daily+moisturizing+lotion&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)
   * 💎 **Premium**: [Avene Tolerance Control Soothing Skin Recovery Cream](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=avene+tolerance+cream&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)
3. **Sunscreen**: Pick one. LRP Anthelios is gold, keep that.

# 🌙 Evening (with Tretinoin):

1. **Clinique Balm** (✅)
2. **CeraVe Cleanser** (✅)
3. **Tretinoin** (when prescribed)
4. **Moisturizer/Barrier Cream**: Use Cicaplast or Avène Cicalfate
   * [Cicaplast Baume B5](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cicaplast+baume+b5&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)
   * [Avène Cicalfate+ Restorative Cream](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=avene+cicalfate&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)

🧴 **Optional PM Hydrator Boost**: If you really *miss* something soothing under moisturizer:

* [La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=la+roche+posay+thermal+water&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)

# 🛍️ Product Swap Tips:

If you want to cut down without tossing stuff:

* Finish up hyaluronic acid, but don’t repurchase.
* Skip AM eye cream and instead pat a little moisturizer under eyes.
* Toleriane and Embryolisse can do that job just fine.
* Use only **one** SPF in the AM. Carry a **stick SPF** for touchups:
   * [La Roche-Posay Anthelios Stick SPF 50](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=la+roche+posay+spf+stick&tag=skingp-20&ascsubtag=skncx)

# 🧘‍♀️ Lifestyle + Skin Tips (especially with Tret):

* **Hydration:** Drink water *before* your coffee in the morning.
* **Barrier Support:** Sleep on a clean silk or bamboo pillowcase.
* **Minimal Touching:** Clean your phone screen daily.
* **Tret Buffering:** Apply moisturizer, then tret, then moisturizer (sandwich method) if sensitivity hits.
* **Reapply SPF:** Especially when on tret – even indirect sunlight can trigger irritation or hyperpigmentation.

# 🧴 Final Thought:

Your routine isn’t crap. It’s just grown too far into *cosmetic comfort zone* and lacks a streamlined purpose. Now that tretinoin is coming in, let your routine **support the hero**, not compete with it.

Want me to help you build a *simple but powerful* routine that supports tretinoin from scratch—like a ""starter pack"" for the next phase of your skincare journey?

Throw-away because I have a reddit stalker who lives for my dating issues

I dated a girl for a few months towards the end of last year. It was a good relationship overall - we'd butt heads about politics here and there but nothing major. We had all the same interests, and things were going good! It was about 3 months in when I realized we still didn't have an exclusivity talk. So I brought it up, to which she was all into being exclusive and from her perspective, we had been all along. I wasn't talking to anyone else,  so great that all works out.

A week later she dumped me because ""the state of the world was bad."" I knew it was bullshit, but it blindsided me and I didn't have time to process it. 

We didn't talk for a couple months, then we started chit chatting here and there. I missed her of course, and since things weren't bad in the relationship, I tried to open up the idea of meeting for a coffee to talk about things. She wouldn't even entertain it, and finally told me we didn't communicate well and didn't see a working relationship for us. Ironic considering she couldnt even tell me that from the start. So I was right about her original reasons being bs, which makes me wonder what else she wasn't telling me. Now she just wants to have me around to talk about my fucking tomato and pepper plants every now and again.

Well idk about you guys, but im pretty sure im worth more than an occasional horticulture check in. Im yeeting myself back into no contact, and I dont think im looking back 🫠",1,1748894371.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: chocolate eggsplosion and milk cereal are kings - Tbjp get the COR, forget their whey

Velvet: Very pleasant. It tastes slightly of red berries, but it’s not typically sweet, resulting in a nutty yet fresh flavor that doesn’t get tiring. 8.5/10

Cinnamon Donut: It doesn’t taste like cinnamon but like fried dough—not for me. 6/10

Milk Cereal: Reaaally good. Milky, vanilla-like, balanced in sweetness. Fantastic with corn flakes. 9/10

Jammy Biscuit: Very good. It truly tastes like a cherry shortbread: very sweet but not cloying. Better on its own than with corn flakes. 8.5/10

Chocolate Peanut Butter: Tastes like chocolate whey with defatted peanut butter powder—extremely nutty flavor. 6.5/10

Chocotella: It’s okay but nothing special, tastes like fake hazelnut. 6.5/10

Raspberry White Chocolate: Fake raspberry, very sweet. It’s pleasant but could become cloying over time. 7.5/10

Chocolate Egg‑splosion: Tastes like a melted chocolate egg—super creamy. 10/10

Dubai Chocolate: Tastes like artificial orgeat/pistachio. 7.5/10

Neapolitan Ice Cream: Bitter, atrocious—you can’t even tell what it’s supposed to taste like. 1/10

Baklava: I wouldn’t know how to describe it, but it’s not bad yet not really good either. There’s an aftertaste of artificial orgeat/pistachio, and the rest is meant to resemble buttery phyllo. Heavy in flavor. 7/10

Chocolate Pistachio: The poorer version of Dubai Chocolate. 5/10

Chocolate Raspberry: In theory it’s good, but the raspberry is too tart, bitter, and ultimately artificial. 5/10

Cookie Dough: Very sweet and not artificial at all. If it weren’t for Egg‑splosion, this would be among the best. 8/10

Irish Cream: Like bitter coffee with cream, but it gets cloying easily. 7/10

PBJ: Disgusting. 1/10

Cookies & Cream: Not bad, but not really good either. 6/10

——

TBJP: their hazelnut spread cream of rice are 10/10, but look away from the whey

Malt Chocolate: Bitter, like barley and coffee. 5/10

White Chocolate Coconut: Horrible. 1/10

White Chocolate Hazelnut: Remains super runny but has an okay flavor. 6/10

Even the worst of the worst by Per4m have a great creamy texture that’s amazing as whey drip/topping (1:1 cold water) or with cereal (1:3). ",1,1748894085.0,naturalbodybuilding,0,1.0,False

My friend Maddie has been close since like sophomore year and this year we got a lot closer. I’ve never been into her romantically so please people chill with anything like that. 

Maddie runs track and field and cross country. One of the coaches, “Mr.B”, has taken what sounds like an interest in Maddie that extends beyond running. I don’t know Mr.B very well at all. None of my group does outside of Maddie because she’s the only one who does those sports. Mr.B’s main job is in SPED and assistant track coach is on the side so nobody outside of track or CC kids know him. He’s on the younger side of teachers but not really young like in his 20s. I think he’s in his early 30s. 

Maddie has said they talk a lot and he’s always been very cool. She says she’s closer with him than any of the other coaches. She’s never said anything weird about him until right around graduation. She told us at a track wrap up event fundraiser thingy, Mr.B congratulated her on graduating and made a comment like “let’s keep in touch after graduation” and offered to meet for coffee or a meal if she was interested in (I thought the language here was weird, he didn’t say to catch up but he said to) “get to know eachother more”. It doesn’t stop there.

Maddie told me literally yesterday about the card she got at graduation. I guess Mr B gave her a card and wrote a note. The note was, according to Maddie (I didn’t read it) “long, and he talked a lot about how great it’s been coaching her and how he knows she will do great things.” She said it was not overly weird until the end where he said “I remember you as this nervous incoming freshman and now you’re a confident, stunning young woman”

The craziest fucking part. Maddie loves Athleta clothes for working out and she talks about it a lot. Inside the card was a gift card for athleta. When she checked the balance, it was for 500 fucking dollars. I almost crapped my jeans when I heard this. 

I asked if she’s going to do anything. She says she’s graduated, doesn’t plan on really reaching out to Mr. B, she did thank him for the card over text. He did replied with a short “you’re welcome”. She said she’s fine letting it go. 

I am wondering if this is something I need to speak up about. I would hate to know someone was hurt and I knew information that could have stopped it. ",3,1748893873.0,AITAH,15,0.8,False

I’m sorry, love. I really am, but it was her last wish. I hope that you’d at least give it a try,” my father said to me. Worry was evident in his voice.

“Please, Papa! There has to be another way.” I pleaded as I sat on a chair beside his hospital bed. His hands trembled in mine, but it wasn’t due to old age. My father was dying.

“There would have been if Sheena was...” His eyes watered as he spoke her name, and my heart broke all over again. He loved her even now. I knew that part of the reason his condition kept getting worse, even after the best treatment in the world, was because he had given up on life the day my mother’s heart stopped beating. The only thing that held him here, right now, was me.

“B-but I don’t want to get married, Papa! Not yet! I’m only twenty-two.” I tried to keep my voice pleading, but even I could hear the panic seeping in.

“I’m so sorry, my darling. I don’t want to see you get married so early either, but I don’t have much time left. I have to know that you’ll be well taken care of,” my dad said sadly, “that you’ll be safe.”

“But, Papa, they’re va—”

“Ms. Deluca, visiting hours are over.” The nurse cut me off as she strode into the room, saline bottle and more medicines in hand. “He’s been better this past week, so try to visit as much as possible, but he does need to rest now,” she said with a smile.

“Yes, of course. I’ll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Papa.” I gave him my best smile even as tears pooled in my eyes and planted a kiss on his forehead before I turned to leave.

“Goodnight, love. Be safe.”

I walked out of his cabin and said goodbye to people I knew. Occasionally, I also waved at little children who skipped and pranced around me as they made their way to the playroom in the children’s ward. I already knew some of them since my father’s room was right next to the nursery. Today, though, I couldn’t even manage a smile. The instant I walked out into the parking lot, the heavy rain hit me like a bullet, drenching me from head to toe.

Good, I thought. At least, it would hide my tears. It would keep people from knowing the demons that haunt me and of the secrets I could never tell even if it killed me.

I stood alone in the parking lot next to my car with the rain mercilessly tattooing against my skin. The only thing I wished with all my heart was to erase a night four years ago that had changed my life forever.

# Chapter 2

Alina

Science states that the evolution of mankind wasn’t a straight line. Several species had to become extinct for the ultimate survivor to reign on this Earth: humans or Homo sapiens. Human beings came from the prehistoric apes and have evolved over a span of millions of years. Exactly how many, even scientists have their doubts. Their best bets are from the hominid fossils that they’d discovered from various parts of the globe. They use all sorts of criteria, from quadruped to biped locomotion, an increase in cranial capacity, changes in food habits, etc. But one thing they agree on is that it took millennia to ultimately result in the perfect modern man who has made Earth the supreme habitat.

If you believed the same, you couldn’t be more wrong.

Human beings weren’t the only creatures who survived the eons of trial that Mother Nature inflicted upon us. No, there were others, beings who were stronger, faster, deadlier, and higher on the food chain. They never lost the habit of devouring raw flesh and blood, surviving purely on animalistic instincts, speed, and agility that were a part of their genetic makeup. For centuries, they’d been in hiding, never letting any human be aware of their existence until it was the last thing they knew. They preyed on us and stayed out of our sight just like a predator because they were the most impeccable of them all. They were the vampires.

How did I know all of this? How did I even know that vampires were real? How did I know about their history? No, it was not because they’ve been discovered by scientists or they’ve made themselves known to the world. It was because my father worked for them.

I ought to know because I was engaged to a vampire. I was to be Erick Stayton’s bride.

He was the heir to Stayton Incorporated, a company that specialised in marketing blood from donors and had blood banks in several parts of the U.S. It was a charitable organization looking for the betterment of the world and interested in helping people in need. No one really knew that it was just a facade, for only ten percent of the blood they collected went to charity. The rest was supplied to vampires all over Canada. They also ran a security service for VIPs and business tycoons, those who were in need of protection. All in all, he and his family were super rich, super arrogant, and very, very powerful.

Erick Stayton, my fiancé, was one of the most eligible bachelors in Canada. A lot of girls would die to catch his attention. However, he was too conceited to stay with one person for more than a week, that is according to Men’s Fashion and GQ. He was a ruthless and savage predator. For me, vampires have never been a part fairytales. They have always been the people I’d known to fear, and Erick was always at the top of that list.

My family were some of the few who knew about their secret. My father was the manager of the Main Canadian Blood Bank. Our families have been close even before I was born. Erick was the youngest child of his family, so we had an age difference of about three years. My mother and his were the ones who had arranged this wedding right after I was born. I didn’t have any idea why, though. Why did they choose a human girl who has no interest in vampires whatsoever? Why didn’t they choose someone more fitting like someone of the same race? It was no secret that I never liked vampires to begin with. Blood banks were a relatively modern creation. Who knew how many lives they took before the invention?

Everyone expected us to be great friends, Erick and me. They thought that we would grow up loving each other, but it was the exact opposite. I hated him with a passion. It was not just because he was a vampire, though. Oh no, it ran way deeper. You see, I had always avoided Erick ever since I was a child. He was always with the popular crowd, the bullies. Being naturally attractive, as was with every other predator on the planet, he always got away with it. So it was natural to avoid him and stay away from his line of sight. It was not that he didn’t know about me, but we just kept our distance right from the start. However, as I began to grow, I started attending parties with my parents, and he finally started to notice me. By then, it was still going okay. I could handle a few snide comments here and there, but it was when he and his mother came to visit my parents one day when everything went wrong.

We were all at the dinner table that night. I went to the kitchen to fetch an extra dish when I stumbled on the doorjamb and fell to the floor, but not before hitting my head on the counter and wounding myself. The wound wasn’t deep, but the hit caused the skin of my forehead to slit open and gush out blood. The next thing I knew, Erick was there, feeding from me until I was too weak to open my eyes.

When I regained consciousness, he warned me not to tell our parents or he would kill me. I, being the wimpy little child that I was, kept it a secret. I was eleven then. From that day onwards, he came to feed from me occasionally.

“You’re my fiancée. It’s your duty to feed me,” he used to say to me. I believed him for a long time until I grew old enough to understand the folly.

I would have still forgiven him, considering that he was a young vampire who had no control over his hunger if it wasn’t for what happened next.

I had just turned eighteen. It was Erick’s twenty-first birthday, and there was a party at their house. My parents wanted me to go, but I declined, making an excuse that I had a test the next day. In reality, I only wanted to stay away from Erick and his gang of browbeaters. My parents were always away on business trips, and I was often home alone. It was around two in the morning when I heard the front door of our house being forced open. I rushed downstairs to check and knew instantly that I shouldn’t have. Erick was leaning against the doorjamb with his clothes and hair in disarray. He was dead drunk.

I thought he was going to feed from me again, which had stopped for a while since he had plenty of girlfriends to drink from in his college. I was so, so wrong.

I didn’t remember what exactly happened that night, probably because of PTSD, but I do remember the next morning when I woke up bruised and bloody. My clothes were torn, and there were claw marks on the carpet all around me. Erick himself was in a similar state of undress.

Erick’s expression was unreadable. He only stayed to put on a few bandages on me so he wouldn’t get caught and left immediately with the same warning of killing me if I told our parents. However, I’d had enough. I never wanted to keep it a secret in the first place. I wanted so badly to tell my parents about all of this. I promised myself that I would the second they came back even if it meant dying at the hands of a ruthless vampire... but that never happened.

The next day, I had to rush over to the hospital instead. Papa had several serious injuries, and Mom was gone. They got into an accident on their way back home. An eighteen wheeler truck smashed into their car on a narrow road. After that, my life had never been the same. I completely closed off. I kept to myself and avoided company as much as I could. I no longer trusted people. What happened to me didn’t even compare to what happened to Mom, the person who never in a million years deserved this. Papa was so heartbroken, it was painful to watch.

He recovered after staying in the hospital for six months. However, he was diagnosed with stage two leukaemia. Now, he didn’t have much time left. It had been four years since the accident and my mom’s death. My father was already on his death bed, and Erick had never once visited even though his mother had so many times.

That was another reason why I was to be married to Erick as soon as the end of this month. Since my mom was dead and my Papa was nearing his, I would need protection from vampires who would gladly make main course out of me. After all, they couldn’t have me screaming to the world that they exist.

It felt like the walls that I have built after all these years were breaking apart. My life was crashing down on me, and I had no way of stopping it.

# Chapter 3

Alina

I woke up with a start. It took me a while to realize that someone was ringing the doorbell of my apartment and that I was no longer at the hospital trying to convince my father to call off the wedding.

I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and looked at the bedside clock. It was nine twenty-seven in the morning, and since I took a few days off from work, I wasn’t expecting anyone.

I hurriedly got out of bed and put on my robe. The lime green satin night dress that I was wearing reached my knees, and the robe went a little longer. My long dark-brown hair was in wild curls around my face and reached my lower back. Running my hands through it a few times to look presentable, I went for the door.

“Yes?” I asked as I opened the door without checking first. I instantly wished I hadn’t.

Standing on the other side of the door was none other than Erick Stayton, the man I hated and feared. He still looked the same, except he no longer had the boyish charm he had when he was younger. In its place were all hard angles and a chiselled appearance. He had a devilishly handsome face, broad shoulders, and long legs clad in grey dress pants. The muscles on his arms strained the rolled up sleeves of his navy blue shirt. His sandy blond hair was short and perfectly styled while his ocean-blue eyes sparkled with an unknown emotion, a smirk playing on his lips.

“Hey there. Remember me?” he said as I visibly paled.

“W-why are you here?” I asked, internally cursing myself for the stutter. How could I ever forget him? What he did to me aside, he had a face no one could easily forget.

“Just came over to check on my wife-to-be.” He crossed his arms over his chest.

“Well, now that you have, you should probably get going.” I went to slam the door shut on his face, but a sudden gust of wind blew past me. When I turned around, Erick was there in my living room, looking around my apartment.

My apartment was small, but I loved living here. I decorated everything myself, from the colour of the walls to the furnishing. The dining room was a combination of light green and blue with a blue carpet and white couches. The kitchen was just next to the living room with two chairs before the counter and an open kitchen behind it. The walls were a light cream colour, and the boxes were made of wood. There was a twenty-eight inch LCD TV on the wall next to the counter and the entrance to the kitchen. A floor to ceiling glass wall stood facing the couches that gave a splendid view of the compound backyard and the fountain. My room was medium sized with white walls and had various false plants and flowers, as well as a green grass carpet. All the decorations made it look like it was in the midst of nature. The guest room was painted in red and gold with only a bed and small wardrobe. That was all, but the apartment was my safe heaven. I bought it with the money I received upon selling my parents’ house right after my father was hospitalized a year ago.

“I like the decor. You did this yourself?” Erick asked.

“Yes,” I said in a hard voice. “How long are you planning to stay here?”

“You know, there is no need for us to be so tense, right? We are getting married in a few weeks,” he said, coming to stand in front of me so that we were chest to chest.

“You’re right. We are getting married in a few weeks, but we’re not married yet. So it’d be better if I didn’t have to see you unless it’s absolutely necessary.” I didn’t step back even though every cell in my body kept telling me to run as far and as fast as I could.

Erick raised an eyebrow, and his lips tilted up to one side. “You’ve changed. I like that, but you seem to have forgotten that you’re not marrying a commoner, Alina. You’re marrying the prince of all vampires, so look alive and get me some coffee.”

The nerve of him! Yes, apart from being one of the most influential families in Canada, Erick’s parents were the king and queen of all vampires, making him the Vampire Prince, but that did not give him the right to order me around. I gritted my teeth together so hard, I was afraid they would crack. How dare he say such a thing as if he hadn’t done anything four years ago?

I will not lose my temper, I had to remind myself. No, I will not lose to this monster.

“Get out of my house, and get your own damn coffee!” With that, I strode to my bedroom and slammed the door on his face.

Erick

I stared at the closed door to Alina’s bedroom in amazement. However, the thing that amazed me the most was how much she has changed over the last four years.

Four years ago, she was this shy little girl who was too afraid to speak her mind and always hid from me and my friends. It was true that we bullied her, but it was mostly because of my pride. At that time, I wasn’t ready to believe that my future was already pre-destined and that I wouldn’t have a say in it. Then there was the fact that I was the Vampire Prince, and she was a mere mortal, a fact my friends made sure I never forget. In fact, I was surprised that my parents were so excited about this wedding. They were the ones who taught me that humans were diluters. Having children with them would dilute our bloodline, something that posed a threat to our survival since our bloodline was already getting diluted with intermarriages. On the other hand, my mother had always praised Sheena, Alina’s mother, although she was the biggest example of dilution in history.

Maybe it was because my parents wanted to gain back the trust of those vampires who had chosen to live in peace with the humans. A majority of our race were now supporting intermarriages without the fear of dilution, and my parents were hard-core politicians. No one could uproot them from their position, but it was always better to live a revolt-free life.

I looked at the closed door once again and decided to give her some time. I could easily break down the door, but that would accomplish nothing. It would only ruin everything before it even had a chance of forming. Sighing, I took a seat on a couch facing a glass wall and admired the beauty of the scenery while making a few important calls. Behind it, Churchill spread out in all its glory. The Eskimo Museum wasn’t all that far from here. She has found a nice location.

Working didn’t help, though. With me this close to Alina, my memories kept going back to a night that should’ve never happened. It was my greatest moment of weakness. I still remembered what had happened that day like it was yesterday. My ‘friends’ had a great part in it, too. They helped drug me with a poison that only affected vampires and told me a lie that acted as a decoy. When I got close to her, the compulsion set in.

By the time I came to my senses after fighting tooth and nail to wear off the compulsion, it was too late. She was ruined pretty badly. I had been too rough and left her bruises. I was disgusted at myself and couldn’t even look at her. I couldn’t face her ever since. That was why I hadn’t once visited her in all these years. What was I to say? I’m sorry I ruined your life? No. Words weren’t enough for what I have done to her. It took me a while to understand that the thought of her with someone else, the lie that my ‘friend’ Nile fed me to get close to Alina, infuriated me to great lengths.

Yes, I was jealous, but I was not in love. I always thought of her as my partner. She was mine and only mine. And I would make sure no one could have her. She was, still was, and always would be mine, to do as I please, when and where I want.",1,1748893533.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1l1rk08,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l1rk08/my_boyfriends_best_friend_touched_me_in_my_sleep/,My boyfriends best friend touched me in my sleep.,"Context: I'm 20F. I have a boyfriend, and one of his best friends, let’s call him Brad (21M) is also a close friend of mine. One night, a group of us went out drinking in the city. I live far away, and since Brad and I were heading to a cottage with friends the next morning, he let me stay over at his (I suggested the idea first). My boyfriend had no issue with this, he said he trusts Brad.

That night, we were both pretty drunk. Brad’s apartment didn’t have a couch, and I was planning to sleep on the hardwood floor. He told me I could just sleep in his bed instead. I agreed and I put on sweatpants and an oversized hoodie, and stayed curled up on the edge of the bed. 

Sometime during the night, I woke up to feel Brad putting his arm around me. I didn’t move. But he didn’t stop, instead, he started squeezing me tighter. I felt really hungover and nauseous. I wanted to move but I physically couldn’t.

Then, I felt his hand brush over my chest, and it lingered there. He started to touch and play with my breast over my hoodie.

At some point, he rolled me over toward him. I pretended to wake up a little. He was shirtless. I rolled myself back to the very edge of the bed, clutching a pillow to my ear. I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep.

But again, I woke up. His arm was around me. He did the same thing, this time, his arm moved up and wrapped around my neck. And then, something that really disturbed me: he put his fingers in my mouth, touched my gums, pulled on my lips, and grabbed my face. I froze. I didn’t know what to do. I was scared and sick and tired. Why didn't I say something? I could have told him to stop, but instead I pretended to be asleep.

Eventually, when he rolled over again, I finally got up.

In the morning, we got coffee. He asked how I slept. I lied. I said I was a deep sleeper and only woke up once when he kicked me in the night. He just laughed and joked about how much he moves in his sleep.

I tried to brush it off. Told myself I was being dramatic, that he was drunk and probably didn’t realize what he was doing. He didn’t touch me down there, or go under my shirt. I know it's wrong, but part of me feels like it wasn’t bad enough to warrant telling anyone about it.

I didn’t think about it much during the weekend at the cottage, I didn’t really have the time or mental space. Brad acted completely normal, even kind. He was friendly, included me in everything, and made sure I was okay.

But once I got home, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Now I don’t know what to do. I haven’t told my boyfriend, not because I think he’ll be mad at me, but because once I do, there’s no undoing it. Brad is part of our friend group. Saying something might change everything.

And I keep wondering if it’s somehow my fault, because I didn’t say no. Because I froze. Because I stayed quiet.

I know for a fact, that I don’t want to tell anyone or even confront brad. So is it even worth telling my boyfriend? Because then I would just be making him swear to secrecy. I just needed to get that off my chest.",1,1748893303.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

**Start Q&A Portion**

* [Q&A: What is coming out on June 10th?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8FOFH1NOMY) - ANSWER: Version 1.1 is being released to Live (Stable) Branch. There are no planned major released planned for Version 1.1 Experimental.

* [Q&A: Are any bug fixes coming for 1.1 before the 10th of June release?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bLbBBizgFI) - ANSWER: **Yes.** They do plan on releasing another Game Patch soon.

   * **⭑ UPDATE:** See [Patch Notes: v1.1.0.5 - (EXPERIMENTAL) - Build 415558](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1l1mgg6/patch_notes_v1105_experimental_build_415558/) released June 2, 2025.

* [Q&A: Can you tell us about the 1.1 launch stream?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JXiTS1tKcg) - ANSWER: Nothing much could be said, other than the **Tuesday, Jun 10th 2025 Livestream** will be *longer*, like 4 or 5 hours, and that the current plan *(subject to change)* is to release Version 1.1 to Live/Stable Branch at 5:00 PM Swedish Time.

   * 🚩 *NOTE: While not officially stated, I expect a Teaser Video this Friday (June 6, 2025) with Version 1.1 release info to include time.*

* [Q&A: Will we get anything new in 1.1 that's not on Experimental?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWtsCRFnL3U) - ANSWER: No new features. What is on Expeimental will be in Live/Stable Release. There will be bug fixes to make things more stable.

* [Mikael Talk: Finding our footing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CCxVbWCON0) (5 Minutes) - ANSWER: Mikael talks about Satisfactory Game Development from Version 1.0 and beyond. *Watch if interested.*

* [Q&A: Could it be possible to have a never-ending mode after finishing the game?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ckZRm3m7M) - ANSWER: This is being discussed, but no specific plans yet. It won't be in Version 1.1, but IF it is added it will appear in a later game patch.

* [Q&A: Will Weather be added again?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68GAUi0-syI) - ANSWER: Weather (Rain) broke in Update 8 when they made the switch from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. They would need to upgrade from the current Unreal Engine 5.3 used in Version 1.0 / Version 1.1 to Unreal Engine 5.4 or 5.5 in order to bring back rain, so it looks like that will be next year, at earliest due to the work involved when upgrading to new Unreal Engine version number.

   * 🚩 There is growing interest amongst the Devs in having more ""weather"" other than rain, *so snow, fog, or even storms, etc., maybe?* 🤔

* [Q&A: Is it reasonable for us to expect more Seasonal Events?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVoDMCfz3mg) - ANSWER: This year, **probably not**, due to Version 1.1 release, and Console release. So best guess will be next year, *maybe.*

* [Q&A: Did 1.0 meet expectations in terms of sales?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1epHOvc8N0) - ANSWER: It *exceeded** their expectations. They are very happy with the Version 1.0 rolease.

* [Q&A: Does 1.1 have Cross-play between Console and PC?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoUA_-KzdWY) - ANSWER: Consoles (Playstation, Xbox) will be able to cross-play between themselves, but **you will not be able to cross-play between Consoles and PC.**

* [Q&A: Has Modding 1.1 been figured out yet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLtSzkI-GWc) - ANSWER: Mikael did not know, but stated in two weeks there should be an answer.

   * **⭑ UPDATE:** View [PSA: Game Mods Now Work For Version 1.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1kz52fp/psa_game_mods_now_work_for_version_11/) for more information.

   * Other questions were also answered:

      * Can Coffee Stain Studios work more closely with the Satisfactory Modder devs to make the Mod launcher so that modding between versions can be more smooth?
      * Q&A: Is there help for the Mod devs, because all Mods are broken for 1.1?
      * Q&A: Will there ever be a stable API for Mods so they don't break and need updating between versions?
      * Community FYI: Stable API when game adds horses.

I’ve been before, but it’s her first time, so I put together a list of touristy/fun spots I enjoyed the first time around. I do feel like there’s room to improve — maybe cutting or swapping a few things — so any feedback’s welcome!

We’re also still looking for lunch/dinner spots, like in Chinatown. I was also really hoping to go to L’Express, but it’s still closed :( so if anyone knows a solid steak place that’s nice but not crazy expensive, I’d love that too. Thank you in advance!

Day 1 – Thursday:

6:30 AM: Land at YUL → Drop bags at luggage storage downtown
Breakfast at Crew Collective Cafe
Walk World Trade Centre, Notre-Dame Basilica, Grand Wheel & Old Port
Lunch in Chinatown
Explore Downtown + Sainte-Catherine St
Grab bags & check in at Concordia Residence
Find a spot for dinner
End day with drinks at Le 4 MUR Bar

Day 2 – Friday:

Breakfast at St-Viateur Bagel + coffee at Café Olimpico
Walk Mile End, Grab a BIXI bike and ride to Kondiaronk Belvedere (Mount Royal lookout)
Then Transit to Sainte-Catherine Est in Gay Village to walk around 
(Wanted to see Museum of Arts but doesn’t make sense, maybe right after the lookout?)
Dinner at Ma Poule Mouillée

Brief overview of my gear and recipe etc.

1zpresso X ultra
Plastic 01 V60
Hario bleached filter 100 box
Brewista temp controlled kettle
Manhattan Ethiopian shoondisha
Recipe - standout double bloom recipe

The first 3 - 5 cups I made were absolutely amazing and had so much flavour I absolutely loved this coffee - I was grinding on 2.0.8 and getting a draw down time of around 2.45 s

Then all of a sudden drawdown time dropped to 2 mins 20 seconds, same grind, same temp, same recipe.

I thought maybe I was pouring differently so tried a multitude of different pour heights and speeds to no avail, I tried raising the temp to 96 but this just made things worse.

Eventually I decided to grind finer and had to go all the way down to 1.4.5 to get a similar drawdown time and although it was sweeter and fuller bodied the flavour separation was gone.

Can anyone tell me what could possibly make this happen? I much preferred the coffee at the courser grind but the speed up in drawdown time dramatically reduced the quality of the cup.

Cheers for any advice given, just for some added info the coffee was 21 days off roast when I started to brew it.

I’m curious as as to how GERD manifests for you all as for me it is rare, full blown attacks with no warning signs really.

A year ago I woke up in the middle of the night with severe chest pain never having had reflux and so I ended up in the ER to rule anything else out and they confirmed acid reflux. Though I still felt a little uneasy the next few weeks, I cut out alcohol for 1 month, ate only safe foods for a month or so. And for the next half year or so, cut out coffee completely. This also started healthier habits around eating in general. And I didn’t feel any reflux since.

Until the middle of last night😭 I just came back from a vacation with a lot of coffee and alcohol and WOAH. Worst prolonged pain of my life for 2 hours or so. Severe chest pain, rib cage pain, nausea, back pain. I’m assuming I just need to play it safe again for the next few months but does anyone else not necessarily experience GERD all the time but have sporadic attacks like these? Do you just eat “clean” 24/7 or are more casual GERD sufferers like me able to sometimes indulge in periods where they’re not reeling from an attack? ",3,1748892713.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

1l1r5ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1l1r5ho/friendly_advice/,Friendly Advice ♥️,"In a little under two months you all will go through what will feel like the most stressful two days of your lives. You will feel mentally and physically exhausted. You might cry, you might puke, you will likely question why you ever wanted to be lawyers in the first place. 

BUT. . . You don’t have to feel like you didn’t do enough. You don’t have to leave the testing center hating yourself because you didn’t spend time on the highly tested rules or understand the nuances of character evidence or practice enough MPTs. 

You still have time. Read it again. YOU STILL HAVE SO MUCH TIME.

Right now, you should be mostly learning and memorizing. UWorld should be your best friend for MC and you should be reading and digesting NCBEs model answers for MEE/MPT (your bar prep programs model answers are fine too). By the end of this month/early next month, you should have a good understanding of your weak points. Focus on them. Drill sets of questions. If you’re anxious about how tired you’ll feel after the morning sessions, work on building your mental stamina. And as you approach the end of this month, PRACTICE UNDER REAL TIME CONSTRAINTS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I truly cannot stress how important that is. 

Honestly, the best advice I can give you is this—at some point before test day, go to a coffee shop or somewhere sort of distracting with people around, put in earplugs (that’s what you’ll get on test day), and simulate half of the bar exam. Pretend it is the real thing, let yourself be nervous, do NOT consult outside materials, and do everything under real time conditions including completing the sections back to back. Make sure you use questions you have not seen before. This exercise will not only help you determine where you are actually at in your understanding of tested concepts but also whether test day conditions will impact your performance (they probably will). Afterwards, assess what you could have done differently, if anything, and work on that. Rinse and repeat as necessary. 

All that said, everyone on this sub has made it through 3 years of law school. And while the bar is certainly its own thing, that gave you the tools. Remember your first semester of LS exams? You were likely nervous and thought you failed. But you didn’t and that’s something to draw confidence from (good time to note that this particular test doesn’t take kindly to too much second guessing). If you’ve made it this far, you have the drive. 

You are capable, you are worthy of being an attorney, and you can AND WILL pass this test if you put in the effort.

1l1r4eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l1r4eq/cortado_stable_definition_and_continuing/,Cortado -- stable definition and continuing controversy,"(A continuing saga, including with a noted expert on all things food in Spain...)  
  
From what I've now read -- among many articles, variously in English and Spanish -- a cortado is (typically) a double espresso -- two full shots using two full measures -- with an equal amount of steamed (not frothed) milk. That is a 1:1 ration.  And this matches what I've made at home, knowing no particular name for it.  It also seems to match the original definition of 'flat white', apparently from Australia.  In fact, in France, they use this latter term for exactly this.  
  
During 6 recent weeks in Spain, I was sometimes been given a single shot and equal milk and sometimes a single shot with very little milk, matching a machiatto and one place actually listed cortado in parentheses, next to the entry for machiatto.   
  
To get what I wanted, I adopted the convention of asking for a cortado doble, which always produced a double shot, not 4 shots. At the place listing cortado as a machiatto, the confused junior taking my order was helped by a supervisor who told them 'flat white'.  This was not listed on the menu, but did clear things up for the junior worker.  It was also the only time flat white got used during my time in Spain.  
  
Some of the readings refer to its being served in a glass, rather than cup, to show off its layers (assuming there are any.) Even in the Madrid bus station cafeteria, which was just as drab as it should have been, they gave it to me in a glass. One time, in San Sebastian at a very nice and very kitchy coffee placed, and for the first time in 7 weeks, it came with some art work on the milk.(",3,1748892300.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I saw the recent post about Folgers prices skyrocketing. So I was expecting the same with Maxwell House. 

Folgers in my warehouse. $24.99. 
Maxwell albeit on sale $12.99. 

By weight Folgers is literally double the price. 

For my daily drinking coffee I'd always treated these two brands as interchangeable. Both just basic crappy coffee but good enough. 

How can these two now be priced so differently?  Shouldn't the usual reasons like coffee bean shortages and tariffs apply equally to both?",2,1748892296.0,CostcoCanada,8,0.58,False

It all happened yesterday. At the beginning it was all routine and normal. I got my coffee before going work, went into my boss's office to get to work and here the ""thing"" started. Because i found him with arms crossed waiting for me. I thought ""fuck, what I did wrong? I made some mistakes?"" And just told him ""hey boss"" but he started looking at me from head to feet like he was ""scanning"" me for the first time and after a few awkward moments of silence told me ""listen, I have to go to another charity gala event and i really don't have any intention so I thought to bring someone with me to make things less boring. So i made a list of what you need to do because this prententious events are all about appearances so I need to upgrade you"". I looked at him for a few moments and asked him if he was serious and he told me that he was and then handed me a short list. A new haircut because ""you're not a caveman so that beard is off"", a tailored suite because ""come on you need to be decent"" and a perfume to buy because ""people there needs to think you take care of yourself"" and then pushed me out by saying ""just arrive 15 minutes earlier and every cost is on me so just tell them i send you"" and then closed the door living me there wondering wtf is going on but then i stopped thinking and went on with my boss's list.

When i arrived 15 minutes earlier my boss was already there and when he saw me he said ""woah, now this is what i call a successfull man"" and then told me a few things like ""smile, enjoy the champagne and just make new important friends"". So a bit in desbelief i tried my best.

The thing that caught me off guard is that for the first hour i followed him like a dog cause i was extremely stressed and he always presented me like ""the guy i'm training to take my place so treat him gently. For now hahahah"". And after a few glasses of champagne i started to actually talk with someone, followed my boss again so the whole night went well I think but at the end of the night I asked my boss ""boss why you are doing this for me? You know right i'm not that special?"" and my boss replied ""don't be stupid, you just need to work under pressure, expectations and all this boring stuff"". So we talked a bit and then i went home.

And today was a normal day like many others. That night made me understand that maybe, just maybe i'm not that bad or ""unspecial"" and that again i have something special...",1,1748892262.0,u_Anonimo1864,0,1.0,False

The moment I wake up, its you running around my thoughts and you’re the last person Id think before I sleep. Dont you get tired? (Hehe)

The coffee I make and love, I could hear you say (you dont like it, its too strong) and you make this specific face. 

Your the number 1 reason why I was firm and positive on why I ended up with cooking. 
You constantly ask me what do I want to cook for you. Always asked “can I taste?” The best part of it is seeing your funny reaction only my mind can replay. 

The dishes I make everytime I cook, even when you’re no longer around it points out to what you might say. Those mornings Id cook you meals for work, fill up your container for you to stay hydrated, preparing what to cook next for dinner, as well as your number 1 best friend hehehe fita? Hahaha Ive finally narrowed down everything. To my profession. 

Your taste buds. I’ve recalled and traced it back how you’d react to certain taste and temperature, even with the ones I know you dislike. You’d still taste or eat it anyways. But I find ways to make it enjoyable for you. Your tastebuds are significantly neutral! 

I cant wait to cook everyday with you. With you, will definitely unlock more of my passion.

We both work on the same industry! Hospitality. 

Imagine what that could bring to our home. 

Does that also differ since we both have the same zodiac? Im not quite sure of that aspect. I know we’re both asparagus.

That said, Denver is a sprawling city and fear of transit seems to correlate with distance. This Denverite article seems to represent suburbia well. https://denverite.com/2025/06/02/downtown-denver-transportation-plan-mobility/

Right now RTD has image and income problems. Admittedly, I haven't done much research on Park-N-Rides and have never used one myself but on some level they seem like a compromise suburbia can get behind if done right. Parking costs downtown are high and suburbia hates paying for parking. I often wonder what percentage of traffic downtown is people circulating looking for cheaper parking. A car free downtown is a ways away at best.

Is it possible to make a Park-N-Ride model work? Say put a few modern garages at stations two stops out from downtown. Maybe even offer a discounted rate from those stations as suburbia loves deals. In theory, this removes cars from downtown and gets people riding RTD on some level. I bet a lot of people would ride transit for 5 minutes if it meant saving $20 in parking. Searching for parking is miserable and everyone hates it. This gets cars out of downtown and gets people who would otherwise never use RTD on it. Seems like good PR for RTD and a better experience for drivers and downtown residents/visitors.

Pecos Station, National Western, Decatur, and maybe Broadway/I-25 seem like candidates. This land can be later developed into TOD as demand grows but in the meantime this might help get suburbia onboard with RTD on some level. Basically a shuttle system. I know, accommodating cars is a no no in the transit community but leaving the car behind is a process for many and I feel like this could help transition those who only know driving.

Now how do we make parking garages appealing? Would obviously need some on-site security and great lighting. Also some very clear communication on train schedules. Maybe some heavily subsidized retail space to help make a coffee shop or something possible in an otherwise undesirable location? Ask the users what they want and make a budget to accommodate. I really don't see a downside to this approach. What am I missing?",1,1748892098.0,Denver,9,0.53,False

I live in Norfolk and the closest ones are in Chesapeake- almost 30 minutes away. Which with a toddler is really frustrating because half the time I get a short car nap on the way home. I know they are an amazing idea but unsure if the Norfolk/VB crowd would be as interested as the Chesapeake crowd seems to be.There are currently 3 within 15 minutes of each other in Chesapeake which is wild to me. And zero in Norfolk or VB. 

Anyways I just want to gauge interest and see if anyone with littles would actually come to one if I opened up a spot in Norfolk. I used to be a teacher and then transitioned to full time baker so I love kids and plan to have baked goods and coffee available for purchase. I also think having a small lunch menu would be a great addition. 

For anyone who doesn’t know a play cafe is just a safe space for kids to play in a new environment with new toys. It’s based mostly on open-ended play to help their creative minds grow and to build imaginations. Having the coffee and pastries available for parents to have a nice break while the kids safely play. It would also make a great spot for remote workers to bring kids and be able to work in a new environment!

That said, Denver is a sprawling city and fear of transit seems to correlate with distance. This Denverite article seems to represent suburbia well. https://denverite.com/2025/06/02/downtown-denver-transportation-plan-mobility/

Right now RTD has image and income problems. Admittedly, I haven't done much research on Park-N-Rides and have never used one myself but on some level they seem like a compromise suburbia can get behind if done right. Parking costs downtown are high and suburbia hates paying for parking. I often wonder what percentage of traffic downtown is people circulating looking for cheaper parking. A car free downtown is a ways away at best. 

Is it possible to make a Park-N-Ride model work? Say put a few modern garages at stations two stops out from downtown. Maybe even offer a discounted rate from those stations as suburbia loves deals. In theory, this removes cars from downtown and gets people riding RTD on some level. I bet a lot of people would ride transit for 5 minutes if it meant saving $20 in parking. Searching for parking is miserable and everyone hates it. This gets cars out of downtown and gets people who would otherwise never use RTD on it. Seems like good PR for RTD and a better experience for drivers and downtown residents/visitors. 

Pecos Station, National Western, Decatur, and maybe Broadway/I-25 seem like candidates. This land can be later developed into TOD as demand grows but in the meantime this might help get suburbia onboard with RTD on some level. Basically a shuttle system. I know, accommodating cars is a no no in the transit community but leaving the car behind is a process for many and I feel like this could help transition those who only know driving. 

Now how do we make parking garages appealing? Would obviously need some on-site security and great lighting. Also some very clear communication on train schedules. Maybe some heavily subsidized retail space to help make a coffee shop or something possible in an otherwise undesirable location? Ask the users what they want and make a budget to accommodate. I really don't see a downside to this approach. What am I missing? ",1,1748891784.0,RTDDenver,1,1.0,False

But I’ve leapt out across time, space, and reason just to write this. Honestly, I don’t even know if this is the past or the future. But anyway, I want to write a letter.

I can’t have a letter unsent.

Some nights, I lie in bed and imagine what it would feel like to sleep next to you. The peace of cuddling with you will end all my day’s misery. The joy of kissing you gently on the cheek while you’re asleep; not too hard to wake you up, but just soft enough for you to know it’s either me or Shah Rukh Khan (he’s the only one allowed).

I’ll wake up early. To make coffee. Or tea. I don’t know what you like. But whatever it is, I’ll make it. As long as it’s not shots of Vodka. That’s only for the nights. And just to be clear, I won’t make coffee or tea only because I love you, but because I love doing things for people I love. And to be clear, I only know how to make coffee. And tea. (Yet).

I’ll go to the job I don’t want to go to.

Maybe you’ll go to the job you don’t want to go to.

But at least I’ll look forward to the evening. To come back home, and sit with you, and talk on random things, like what is the meaning of life, or just watch our favorite shows (mine is The Office).

Right now, the only thing I look forward to after coming back from work is either to write on reddit, or have my hundredth rerun of The Office. Which is not bad. I guess I am just honing my letter-writing skills for you. Trust me, it will come in handy when we’ll be far. When even though I’ll have my phone with me, I’ll rather send you a letter. Because why do something easy like talking on the phone when you can do something in shitty writing.

Sorry, but I can’t have a letter unsent.

And on any given night, when you are late, I’ll just text you, “BTB”.

Bring that booty (sorry, Darryl Philbin said it first).

And at times when life feels too hard and you feel like you're failing. I’ll be there to say, “It’s fine, you suck at this only now. You’ll suck at this tomorrow. And maybe the day after. But the day after that? You’ll finally suck so much that you’ll be tired, and on your knees, and you’ll beg God for help, asking him to spell some magic and make something happen.

And then. Only then, you’ll cross the bottom 1% barrier”.

Or maybe you’ll become good. I don’t know.

And one day, when you will wake up on a bed in a cold, foreign land. And maybe feel a bit lonely. You’ll at least have my letter to warm yourself.

* The Giro is over again and what a spectacle it was! This year, we were treated to a fantastic race full of drama, battles, and surprises.
In our very own SRFL, Primož Roglič was the crowd favorite: no less than seven participants pinned their hopes on him. Unfortunately this time he turned out to be more of a sprinter than a marathoner. Roglič didn’t make it to the finish. And as the ruthless SRFL rules go: finish = points, quit = nothing. So to his fans: lots of love, but zero points.

* The big winner of this Giro? None other than u/Verlichtingszucht! With race insight that would leave even José De Cauwer speechless, Damiano Caruso was picked from the digital stable. And with a fifth place, Caruso scored a whopping 355 points more than some participants managed to collect all spring long.
This masterstroke catapulted u/Verlichtingszucht not only to victory in the Giro but also straight to the top of the overall standings. In short: the pink jersey is secured, and the rest can go bite their bidons.  

* In second place, we find u/Ok_Chipmunk_3854, the lone daredevil who chose Egan Bernal basically the ninja with carbon mudguards slicing through the peloton. Bernal finished seventh, bagging a neat 300 points.
While the others were still trying to remember whether to turn left or right on that tricky corner, Ok_Chipmunk_3854 was already on the attack, coffee in one hand and an energy bar in the other.  

* Third place goes to u/andytheciderman, who picked Adam Yates and scored 205 points. Adam finished twelfth, nicely tucked in the peloton and just outside the spectacular battle on the Colle delle Finestre.
His brother Simon won that legendary climb and took the pink jersey and the Giro victory. But since Simon was so popular, andytheciderman’s choice of Adam actually earned more points. A smart domestique move: quietly benefiting while Simon stole the show!

1l1qs36,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1l1qs36/positive_experience_as_new_parent_in_public/,Positive experience as new parent in public,"I have seen so, so many posts recently about new parents being shat on in public, or feeling scared that their crying infant may enrage someone else. Or even just have people side eyeing or avoiding them in public, because they don't want to be near a baby.

So I just wanted to chime in to spread a bit of positivity. I was at coffee with a mum friend and our two babies. A woman close to our age came up and asked if it's OK if she sit at the table next to us, because she loves babies and feels they give positive vibes. At the time I was super creeped out lol.

But there was nothing weird with her, and this is 1000x preferable to the idiots posting ""I don't want to deal with your spawn in public!"" She's right, babies *do* give good vibes.

I was a fence sitter for a while and even thought I may be child free for some years. But I have no memories of ever being irritated by someone else's baby in public. I do remember the cute little girl with sparkly sandals in the line at Disney world though! Or the little tyke who couldn't take his eyes off me while munching on his snack with an earnest face.

Idk where this is going. Don't let assholes get you down. Most people don't have a chip on their shoulder and love to see babies. Go out and do what you want! People can be child free but can't expect a child free world - we were all kids once.",8,1748891509.0,NewParents,4,1.0,False

So this semester I took another class which he teaches, not only because of the crush, but because he's an actual good teacher.
He's intelligent (taking his masters and teaching at 24...), kind, funny, cute and has a cat. I like his classes and talking to him. He is very discreet and private and, so far, for him being my professor, I've been only very quietly trying to gain his attention, and my roommate was trying to convince me to ask him out for a coffee at the end of the semester (I was not going to make a move on him while he's my professor lol) and I wasn't budging that I wouldn't because I'm too shy.
Well today an acquaintance told me he has a girlfriend, a kind girl from the physics department. Needless to say, I'm not pursuing this anymore. Taken men aren't my thing haha. However, I still have to take his classes until early September and I don't think these feelings are going anywhere, at least until I don't see him anymore. I'm doing my best not to cry like an idiot because this is so stupid.
I'm just sad, I guess. I don't typically have crushes so I was happy to have one on a nice person. But yeah, now I have to get over it somehow. Thanks for reading.",0,1748891508.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.5,False
1l1qs1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1l1qs1e/roommates_bf_told_me_hes_glad_my_dad_is_dead/,Roommates bf told me he's glad my dad is dead.,"Throw away account for privacy reasons. I (21F) just moved out of a house that I shared with one roommate (22F) for two years. The first year and a half were fine. There were minor issues, but we were close friends and the same friend group. With about six months left in the lease, roommate started seeing a guy who neither myself nor our friends enjoyed being around. Nobody said anything, but he made us all uncomfortable. After begining to date him, her behavior changed for the worse. I started coming home to the house reeking of weed, and once found them eating the chocolates my mom sent me from New York. The neglecting to clean the shared space was my final straw and I began to distance myself. I stopped inviting her to activities with myself and my friends and stopped initiating solo hangouts. I started acting less like a best friend and more like a roommate: separated my stuff in the fridge, wrote up a chore chart that divided all the chores I did weekly down the middle, etc. I'll be the first to admit, I didn't talk to her about it. I was fed up. After a year and a half of dealing with her bullying me when she was drunk and waking me up at 3 am stumbling into the house I had had enough. This led to us becoming very distant. Then the weekend of her graduation came around, and she had taken up all the spots in our shared driveway (shared with other houses) except for mine. That Saturday my brother was coming by with his pickup truck to help me start moving out, and when I told roommate that I would need the SHARED PART OF THE DRIVEWAY clear so the truck could back in and out she flipped her shit on me over text. Cussing me out. Telling me she wasn't going to do anything cause my fucking brother wanted her to. Telling me I needed to ""do better"". So, and I'll admit this was petty, I took the couch and dining table and dining chairs and coffee table and packed them up when I knew her family was coming for a pre-graduation celebration (they were all my furniture and it did need to be loaded into the truck). From then on I exchanged zero words with her, blocked her, and focused on packing and getting the house back in order for the security deposit. The last week living in the house, roommate and roommate bf decided to pack her kitchen items up at 12:45 am. I was still finishing a class for my master's program that ended at the end of the month and had to be awake early. After telling her this, she proceeded to get louder, and when my boyfriend and I left the house to sleep at his place, she mumbled bitchy stuff under her breath as if my leaving was inconveniencing her midnight boxing of dishes. 

All this to say, at the end off that week I graduated with my master's degree. This was the same day our lease ended and I had moved fully out a few days earlier. The evening of the day I graduated I received this text message from roommates bf. 

""Dear [OP], I tried to be nothing but nice to you and I wanted to attempt to get closer to your man at the [nickname of house]. I’ve never met somebody so self centered. Angry. Smelly. Lazy. And straight up a waste of time. I tried to be nice to you cause of [roommate]. I wanted everything to be cool between us cause you seemed like a solid ass person, we vibed well, you showed me a new game I thought we all liked. We went out and you told me how appreciative you were of me for being so well to your friend/roommate. I don’t know if you’re jealous of her life or just straight up stupid but being petty and being rude to people that are in [roommate's] life is low and degrading to yourself. I’ve spent 4 years trying to break habits similar to you. Stop burning bridges you need rather than talking about things. Not to mention you’re completely weak. You threw ur cat in the living room. You put your cat in the car cause you hate hate when he’s being loud?!  I’m by no means a perfect person but that doesn’t mean I’m incapable of spotting an asshole. You’ve wasted your time being the way you are rather than fixing who you are. You’ve wasted other people’s times being the way you are. You’ve embarrassed yourself and would rather hide behind a wall and pretend nothing happened than fix your wrongs. What the fuck is your problem. You’ve been nothing but a dramatic nuisance to [roommate] and I. Example one. Waking me up at 3 am about a “insane car crash” when it was barely a fender bender is crazy. Unlike you I had to be up at 530 in the morning that day. Bless your dad for being at piece and not having to deal with you. Nobody needs anything like you in any form. You’re a parasite. You don’t stop and don’t know how to stop your shitty personality. I’ve never wanted to speak for somebody more cause [roommate] is the nicest person ever and has held back HEAVILY ON YOU. I respected you. I respected your man. I respected your space. I listened to your notes. And you still managed to find a way to be a bigger pile of shit everyday. Hopefully you’re aware of this unless you’re just a pile of shit to everybody in your life!  or do you chose to be a used gaping asshole to People that are nice to you. Pick your battles better [OP]. Feel bad for your boyfriend. Man fixed his entire life to deal with your dumbass. Fix yourself. He at least beat addiction. You’re just selfish and a dick. Fix it now or hide behind a shitty wall your entire life and melt in your own problems that you create yourself. Fuck you for being so mean to ME for 0 reason. And I’m speaking on [roommate's] behalf on this one. You deserve nothing happy and deserve the worst things handed to you in life. Let’s say [roommate] did do you wrong. USE YOUR FUCKING MOUTH. YOU ARE ACTING LIKE A 7 YEAR OLD. COPE AND DO BETTER BITCH!"" 

And if you are confused, yes he sent it with all the grammatical errors, yes he implied he is glad my dad is dead, and yes he accused me of acting like a seven year old in the same message that he used ""smelly"" as a legitimate insult. 

To clear a few things up. 

1. He did not live in the house. He did not contribute a penny to that house or do anything to compensate for all the time he spent there. 
2. He implied I was jealous of her life as I was about to have my master's degree at 21. 
3. The ""throwing my cat"" out my room was locking him out WITH his food and water cause he was keeping me up with his meows. If you knew the way this little boy yowls you'd want him out of your bedroom too lol. 
4. My boyfriend is sober. And I could not be more proud of him. But he was sober before he met me and his journey is ABSOLUTELY NOT for me, it is for him and himself alone. 

I did not humor this with a response. I felt the urge to defend my father and bf's honor, but I knew that he was just looking for an explosive reaction so he could use it to justify all the anger he holds for me. 

(Note: as I was writing this post, now ex-roommate venmo requested me for items of hers she is claiming I took when I know for a fact that they were mine. But if it takes an extra $50 dollars to never have to interact with her again, it will be the best $50 I have  ever spent.)

I’ve been trying to recreate the amazing V60 brews I get at a local specialty coffee shop. They brew an Ethiopian — bright, fruity, full of body — and it tastes incredible every single time.

At home, I tried to copy their setup exactly: •	Same beans — from the same roast batch. •	Same grind size — I even brought my own grinder (Timemore C3S) to the café and we ground it together at 16 clicks. •	Same water — I took a gallon of their brewing water home with me. •	Same V60 dripper — I’m using a glass MHW-3Bomber V60; they use either ceramic or plastic, but today I took my glass dripper to them. •	Same kettle — I even brought my exact kettle to the café. •	Same recipe — 15g coffee, 250g water, 93°C, similar pour rate (50g in 11 seconds for the bloom, steady spirals after).

When we brewed at the café — using my equipment, my grinder, my kettle, my dripper — the coffee tasted amazing. Fruity, juicy, bright, clean. Everything you’d expect from a great Ethiopian V60.

But when I went home, using: •	Same beans, •	Same grind size, •	Same water (from the gallon I took from the café), •	Same kettle, •	Same dripper, •	Same recipe…

👉 The brew tasted flat, burnt, lifeless. No brightness, no fruitiness — and even the color of the brewed coffee was wrong — much darker than what we got at the café. It had body, but a bad, muddy body — not the clean, sweet profile from the shop.

I thought maybe it was old beans, so I tried again with freshly arrived coffee (La Palestina from Cypher Coffee, just delivered). At the café: amazing. At home: terrible — same problems.

Only difference is: location — brewing at home vs at the café.

So now I’m losing it trying to figure out what’s causing this.

I’m seriously stuck.

It seems insane that just brewing at home (5 minutes walking distance from The cafe) wrecks the cup — even when every variable is controlled. I can’t be the only person who’s experienced this, right?

1l1qp75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1l1qp75/uncle_bud_and_the_mountain_top_sasquatch_my_first/,Uncle Bud and the Mountain Top Sasquatch: My First Encounter,"I was 32 yrs old at the time, fresh out of a divorce in which I was absolutely raped for child support and alimony. As a result, I decided to take a second job to make ends meet. 

 

My primary job is in equity trading. But my evenings and weekends are free. Living in Orlando, I took a job at the Star Wars themed amusement park. I tried to get something up my alley, like accounting, admin, and the like. 

 

All they had for me, though, was in their entertainment department. I was hired to dress up like Chewbacca and walk around the park waiving at guests. Sigh…. But I had no choice. As humiliating as it was, I took the job with a promise to myself that it would only be temporary. 

 

Weeks passed and I grew more and more bitter over my predicament. My drinking had worsened and I was starting to make mistakes on my primary job. I was spiraling. 

 

A watershed moment occurred for me in July of that year. It was a Saturday afternoon. The park was packed with kids and families on last-minute vacations before school starts back. Worst of all, the blistering heat and oppressive humidity of summertime Florida made it unbearable in the Chewbacca suit. 

 

Personally, I have always found Chewbacca’s popularity to be odd. It is a 7 ft tall, hairy monster with a menacing presence and fangs. Moreover, it is intelligent and knows how to shoot a gun. Generally speaking, this is a thing that most people would seek to avoid. 

 

I was a child when “Stars Wars” was released. Now, I was not a huge fan, but I was fully aware of the film and its mythos. The Chewy character, more specifically its image, scared me. It was a scary looking thing. It looked like a fucking Sasquatch … a SCARY Sasquatch. It gave me the creeps. 

 

Then I had an idea. I bet kids today would be scared of Chewbacca too if its noble human characteristics were removed from the equation, leaving just the savage animalism of this character! So, I decided to have some fun to liven up my day. 

 

Instead of standing there and waiving at the little kids, with mommy and daddy egging them on to “go say hello”, I would growl at them, shape my hairy hands like claws and raise them over my head, then charge them like I was going to rip them to shreds! Ha ha ha!!!

 

It was hilarious, really. The kids would run off screaming and crying bloody murder! Some would piss and shit themselves as the cling onto their parents, crying and screaming in horror. Ha ha ha!!! 

 

I started hiding behind this and that and then jumping out at the kids, screaming and growling and barking. It scared them shitless! The most fun was in the women’s bathroom. I would turn out the lights, then run around in there screaming like a wild animal, pounding on the stalls and growling. 

 

Eventually, some would find their way into the light outside. They were horrified, screaming, and covered in bodily fluids and other substances. Then I, a very menacing Chewbacca, would bust out of the door charging them, baring my claws and fangs like I was about to rip them limb-from-limb! They would freak again and take off running, some with panties still around their ankles! Ha ha ha!!! 

 

So, it turns out that folks really are afraid of this creature called “Chewbacca”, and they should be. It’s a fucking creature from a nightmare! Creatures do not evolve into a self-aware, intellectually entity while retaining its more primitive survival means (e.g., fangs, claws, etc…). Nowhere does this happen. If you are human and see one of these hairy motherfuckers, then you need to get the fuck out of there! It is not going to play a game of chess with you; it’s gonna rape, murder, and eat you (and maybe not in that order!). 

 

I feel like I had made an important sociological find that afternoon. The police, however, were not impressed. It took being tased 9 times to bring me down! Nine fucking times!! That is a record in Florida!!! I was working on a nice combo of booze and cocaine, so that obviously played a role. But yeah, 9 fucking times!!! 

 

The initial judge would not set a bond because I had somehow been charged with a felony. So, there I sat. I had a bond hearing in 2 days and I had to get out of jail. I could not call my friends, because they either had no money or they were work friends, and I did not want this to get around at work. 

 

I did not have any relatives nearby either. But I did have one option: Uncle Bud in Georgia!! He is a real sport! He is not married and can keep all of this confidential. He is also a man who can get shit done. He had been known to be a bit reckless at times. But at this point, he was my only hope. 

 

The pigs finally let me make a phone call. It was 2:30 pm. After about a hundred rings a female voice came on the line. It sounded like she had just woke up. “Hola”, she said. I told her who I was and that I was calling about a family emergency. However, it quickly became clear that she spoke no English. 

 

Then nothing, except background noise of muffled talking. I suspected she had just laid the phone down and left it there without hanging it up. I waited, then waited some more. Nothing. The pig standing close by points to his watch. “Shit!!”, I thought. 

 

Suddenly came a very lively, high pitch voice on the phone: “Chop me a line!! Chop me a line!!” I responded, “Uncle Bud!! Is that you?!? Uncle Bud!! It’s me, Nick, your nephew!!!” 

 

The high, choppy voice continued: “Chop me a line!! Chop me a line, bitch!! Cawwwwww!!!” Again, I pleaded with him, calling out: “Uncle Bud!! Uncle Bud!!! It’s your nephew, Nick!!” 

 

Finally, the voice on the other end acknowledged me. A wave of relief washed over me. But it was short lived, as the voice said, “Bud? Bud nephew? Nephew Nick!! Caw caw!! Nephew Nick!!! Nephew Nick!!! Cawww!!! Chop me a line, you fucking twat!! Cawww!!! Cawww!!!” 

 

The jailer tapped my shoulder and took me back to my jail cell. I thought to myself, “I didn’t know Bud had a parrot. He probably got it just to teach it to talk shit.” Uncle Bud is rather eccentric, or so I hear. 

 

A couple days later it was time for my bond hearing. I was hoping for the best, and preparing myself for the worst. If I don’t have someone on the outside to do the logistical work accessing my money, then there will be no way I can post bond and get out of jail. 

 

It was early. I was starting to get nervous. Suddenly, I heard one of the pigs call out, “Nick Steiner!!  You have a visitor!! Get your ass up … NOW!!!” 

 

I had no idea who could be here to see me. But I was now getting even more anxious because I did not want to miss my bond hearing!! 

 

The pigs led me through a labyrinth of dark, dingy hallways. After a few moments we stopped in front of a door. The pigs pointed and said, “In there”, then walked away. I was full of dread. What the fuck now?!? 

 

I opened the door. “Holy shit!!”, I thought. Sitting there at the table was my uncle Bud!! “You came!!!”, I exclaimed. “Of course, boy. I don’t leave family hanging. You are my brother’s kid, after all”, said Bud. I paused then reminded Uncle Bud that I am his sister’s kid. “Whatever”, said Bud. 

 

“I called you, but I could not get you on the phone. How did you know?!?”, I asked. Bud told me that his Parrot, Adolph” told him I had called. I paused a moment then asked how the parrot knew where I was in jail, as I did not say my location. Bud simply said, “Adolph told me. Now shut the fuck up and let’s get down to business.”

 

Bud told me he had already got me released, but I was to be released into his custody, which was fine with me. “Shit, Uncle Bud, I appreciate the hell out of that! But if you do not mind me asking, how did you manage to do that? I have not even had a bond set yet.” 

 

Uncle Bud waived his hand at me dismissively. “I just fucked her, that’s all”, Bud said. Sensing my confusion, Bud continued. “The judge is a chick. I just rolled in here this morning and threw a fucking down on her she will never forget. In exchange, she set your ass loose, into My custody”. 

 

I did not know Uncle Bud all that good. We had only met a handful of times at family functions. But the part about screwing the judge, well, that kind of fits with his reputation. However, that part about me being in HIS CUSTODY sounded sort of ominous to me, as if he is expecting something in exchange for his help, and that I may not have a choice in the matter. I decided to file that away in my “closely monitor” file. 

 

We got into Bud’s jacked up F-350 truck and sped off in a roar. I immediately got nervous, as Bud was driving recklessly and way over the speed limit. To make matters worse, he kept taking swigs off a bottle of Jack Daniels. 

 

“You like music, boy?!?”, Uncle Bud howled at me over the roar of the diesel engine. I shook my head yes. Bud nodded, then threw a cassette tape in his truck stereo. Bud then looked at me and said, “Cannibal Corpse!!” What followed was a blast of the most blasphemous, grotesque death metal I had ever heard in my life. It was deafening.

 

By this point, be it the alcohol or the metal music Bud was head banging to, I could not get Uncle Bud’s attention to find out where we were going. Perhaps worst of all, Bud never offered me any of his whiskey! 

 

I laid my head back and eventually fell asleep. I don’t know how long I slept. But I awoke at some point with a jolt when Bud decided to start drifting his truck sideways in the rain, on the wet highway, at 100 mph. “HE IS GOING TO FUCKING KILL US!!!”, I thought in horror. 

 

I frantically started looking around the truck for a weapon. Bud was hooting and hollering in pure drunken redneck glory as we slid past a Georgia State Trooper at 110 mph, going sideways in an extremely dangerous hydroplaning maneuver. 

 

The state trooper’s blue lights went on immediately, as did his siren. Bud said, “Fuck that shit!!!”, and pulled a large revolver from under his seat.  “MY GOD!!!!”, I thought, “THIS CRAZY FUCKER IS GOING TO SHOOT AT THE COP!!!!”  I got on the floor of the truck and curled up in fetal position, knowing that my life was now only seconds from ending, either by car wreck or gunshot.  I was totally fucked. 

The gun shots began.  Bud was cranking them off one at a time.  But that State Trooper, he must have had a fully automatic rifle, as he was buzz-sawing the side of the truck.  I started crying and praying to a God I had heretofore denied the existence of.  Then, all of sudden, “BOOM!!!! BOOM!!!!”.  It was not gun fire, per se; more like explosions. 

Bud gave a good “YEE-FUCKING-HAWWW!!!!” battle cry.  Then he did the seemingly unthinkable:  Bud slowed down and pulled over.  “Oh no!!!”, I am thinking to myself, “He probably has the truck booby trapped and is going to blow us both up!!”.  But that never happened. 

I was stilled cowered on the floor board when I heard Bud roll down his window.  “Hey, Bud!! How the fuck are ya?”, came an unidentified voice.  I figured it was St. Peter and I must be dead. 

But Bud replied, “Well hey yourself, you fucking pig!”.  The other voice said, “You better fucking watch it or I will haul your ass to jail!!”  I then heard Bud ask, “Hey, ya want a hit?  I little sniff?”  The other voice said, “Fuck Yeah, man!! Where’s it at?!?” 

I heard some chopping noises on something hard, then a bunch of snorting from both the unidentified man and Bud.  After a pause, the unidentified voice said, “What’s with the shivering pussy curled up on your floor, Bud?  You back in the human smuggling business again?”  Then laughter.

Bud replied, “Fuck no! There ain’t no money in that now that Joe Biden just opened the flood gates and is lettin’ all those fuckers just waltz in here.  Fuck, Biden is even PAYING people to come here!!  Have you ever, in your life, heard of such bullshit?!?!? Man, this fucking country is going to hell!” 

I heard Bud offer the man a hit off his bottle of Jack.  The man again asked who I was.  Bud responded, “Who?”  Then he revealed who I was.  “This here is my shit-head of a nephew!! HEY!! Get the fuck up and stop slobberin’ on my floor, moron!!” 

I opened up my eyes to see that the other person was the State Trooper.  I slowly, and cautiously, climbed back into my seat.  Bud continued, “So, this motherfucker got pinched down in Orlando for, now get this, getting coked up, putting on a Chewbacca outfits, and scarring the little kids!! What a fucking loser!!”  They both started laughing at me. 

I was getting annoyed.  Bud again continued, “See, this asshole’s slut-wife divorced him on account of his limp dick.  He got his ass handed to him in the divorce, then he was forced to work as Chewbacca at a fucking amusement park!!!”  More laughter.  Feeling the need to stand up for myself, I said “It was a fucking job.  A man does what he has to do!!”  There was a pause as both Bud and the cop stared at me.  Then they both burst out laughing harder than they had been. 

Finally, after Bud had told the cop about all of my life’s fuck-ups, and laughing at me, we departed and drove off.  I was humiliated.  And where were we even going?!? 

“Bud, where are we fucking going?!?  I live in Florida, not Georgia.  I want to go home.”  Bud looked at me dismissively and declared, “Fuck, son, there is nothing waiting on your back in Florida but a lifetime of fuck-ups and pending criminal charges.  You don’t need that shit. You are coming home with me.” 

But I did not want to go home with Bud.  I wanted to go to MY HOME.  I protested to Bud.  But, being the short-tempered, violent person he is, Bud pulled a gun out of his belt, point it at my head, then said, “Look, a-hole.  I do not really give a shit about what YOU want.  You fucked up one time too many.  Now you are besmirching the family’s name.  You are coming home with me so that I can straighten your goofy ass out and make a man out of you, which is something your daddy never did, Satan rest his soul”.

I do not know why Bud referenced Satan instead of God, but I do know that Bud is a crazy fucker and that I had best play along for now.  Once we get to his place, he will inevitably let his guard down.  Then I can escape. 

We finally got to Bud’s place 4 hours later.  I told Bud that I thought he lived in Atlanta.  He said, “Nope, not anymore.  I moved up to the N. Ga. Mountains to get away from all that DEI, LGBTWQ, and KFC. Fuck that shit, ya know?” I nodded, mainly so as not to get him riled up again. 

We climbed a mountain, literally, to get to Bud’s digs.  “Here we are, boy. Home sweet home”, he said.  It was actually a nice house.  It was large too, and well lit.  “Damn, Bud.  This is nice!”, I said. 

We went inside, and my opinion only got better.  The interior of Bud’s house was beautiful!! I said, “Goddamn, Uncle Bud!! This must have cost you a fortune.  I had no idea you were rich like this!”  Bud handed me his coat and told me to “Shut the fuck up”. 

Just then, these 2 Asian chicks came walking out from seemingly nowhere.  “Bud!! You are home!!!”, squealed one of them.  They were both smoking hot and looked to be in their early 20s.  They jumped all over Bud, like excited puppies jumping on their owner when he returns home in the evening. 

Bud looked at me and said, “Uh, help yourself to the food and booze. I am going to go upstairs and fuck these 2 Asian twats for a while”.  You would think that, in today’s world, such talk would not go over well with the younger generation.  However, these girls just giggled. 

I warmed up something called “Wendigo” which was in a Tupperware container in Bud’s refrigerator.  I said on the couch to eat it.  I turned on the TV, but all I could get, despite hitting every channel on the remote, was what appeared to be videos of Bud fucking various chicks. They were all ethnic, for some reason.

At one point, I came across a vid of Bud banging those 2 Asian chicks from earlier.  I figured it was live action.  A light must have come on in the camera in the room, because Bud turned to the camera and said, “Goddman!! Stop watching me fuck, you perv!!!”  I was taken aback.

Bud woke me up at 3:00 a.m. I had fallen asleep on his couch.  I had a terrible night, with vivid, disturbing dreams.  Bud asked what I had to eat.  I told him I had the stuff marked “Wendigo”.  Bud laughed.  “That was not for eating, kid.  I was preserving it until I could meet the Chinese to sell it to them.”  Fortunately, I did not eat it all, as Bud said he was going to have to “open me up” to retrieve his “kill” if I had eaten it all.

Bud brought me a cup of coffee.  We sat in his living room.  I spoke first.  “Uncle Bud, I really appreciate you getting me out of jail.  But what is this REALLY about?  Why did you bring me up here to your home, beautiful as it is, in the mountains?  Bud sighed, put his coffee down and leaned toward me.  “OK, here it is”, he said.

“I feel bad that I have not been in your life, son.  And now, with your daddy, my brother, gone, I feel like, well, you never got the direction in life you needed to make something of yourself.  After your recent incarceration, I think we both know that I am right.  So, I decided to take you under my wing and make a man out of you.  Not just some guy, but a man you can love and respect.  A man anyone would be proud to be and know”, said Bud.

I note here that Bud took a momentary pause to do a line of blow on the coffee table separating us.  Then he continued,

“I brought you up here because I feel like I owe it to my brother to do right by you.  And after that whore of a mother of yours ran off with the tennis instructor, of all fucking things.  Son, we are gonna make it right, you and me!  Are you ready to start a whole new life?  Are you?”

After a moment to take in Bud’s newfound emotional sincerity, I reminded Bud that I was not his brother’s kid, that I was his sister’s kid.  Bud leaned back in his chair, with a perplexed look on his face.  “What’s your name again?”, he asked.  “I said, “Nick”.  Bud sighed and said, “Oh, shit.  Nick.  You really are worth jack shit.  Didn’t your daddy die in a bad drug deal, your mother turned into a stripper?” I nodded.  “Jesus … ‘ Said Bud.  Then he did some more coke. 

I started to tell Bud off, for getting me mixed up with my cousin, Andrew.  But he raised his right hand to silence me.  But I stood up and started yelling at him, calling him a miserable son of a bitch, and worse.  Bud then pulled out his pistol and fired a shot into his ceiling.  “BAMM!!!” This shut me up. 

It also shut up one of the Asian chicks upstairs, permanently.  The surviving one started screaming bloody murder.  Bud looked annoyed.  “Shit, now I am going to take to whack the other one.  Hey …. Uh, Nick, is it?  Yeah, here’s my gun.  Do your old uncle a favor and go whack that screaming bitch upstairs.  I can hardly hear myself think with all the hollering.”  I told him I was not going to do that.  In response, Uncle Bud stood up and looked at me with a purely mean vibe, then said, “Chicken shit”. 

When Bud returned, he asked me to sit down again, which I did.  Bud did likewise.  Then Bud began speaking.  “Ok, here’s the straight shit, son.  I got a big old, hairy, mean as hell bigfoot up here around my home.  Now, as you know, I am a notoriously good bigfoot hunter. It is what I am known for.  Hell, it is how I made the money to build this place.  But things have changed.”

Bud continued, “See, ever since I got in that scrape-up with all that “human trafficking” bullshit, I got to play it clean.  The feds know I traffic in bigfoot parts.  They particularly know that I sell the shit out of them to the Russians and Chinese.  But they cannot get me because bigfoot does not officially exist.  If the U.S. Government accuses me of selling bigfoot parts, then they would have to come clean to the public about everything THEY KNOW, and they are not going to do that!”

Bud went on, “So they only have 2 choices: kill me and be done with it; or arrest me on some bogus charges, then “disappear” me to Guantanamo and try to beat all my sasquatch intel out of me.”  They chose numero two.  See, they are trying to call bigfoot humans; and, thereby, grab me on human trafficking charges.  It is such a hot-button topic today that they can run me in and nobody will blink twice.  Plus, I have a history of human trafficking, so, there’s that.  No minors, of course, just Asian chicks. And just because I have a thing about Asian chicks.  But I digress. 

Of course, I have heard the stories about Uncle Bud and his bigfoot hunting exploits.  The entire family knows about it, though they try to keep it quiet.  There’s even a family member up in North Carolina named “Roy” who allegedly does the same thing.

I told Bud that I do not believe in bigfoot.  He waived his hand dismissively.  “It doesn’t matter”, he said.  “Here’s the deal.  I got to get rid of the big Sasquatch haunting my mountain paradise, and it has to be on the down-low so those sneaky feds do not get wise to it.  I cannot give them probably cause.  You understand what I am saying?”  I did. 

“So, what do you want me to do about it?”, I asked.  Bud continued, “I cannot fire my   bigfoot gun up here, a .50 BMG, because the feds, who are monitoring my mountain, will hear it.  Then they will raid my house and get me.  I am going to have to get close to this particular booger and take it out with my bare hands.  Probably with a blade.  Cut its throat.  Capisce?”  Again, I understood. 

“So, that is where YOU come in, Nick.  Nick…right?  Right.  You have that Chewbacca costume.  I want you to dress up in it and skulk around outside to lure that bigfoot in close enough so I can get my hands on it”, he said.  I countered, “But Bud, I left that back in Florida.”  Bud retorted that I had not.  Apparently, he bribed one of the officers to give him the suit.  Bud then disappeared for a moment and returned with my Chewbacca costume. 

I said, “Holy shit, Bud.  You are fucking crazy.  You know that?”  Bud replied, “Shit, you said you do not believe in bigfoot, so what harm will it do for you to prance around outside for a bit wearing the costume? Tell you what, you do this for me, then I will buy you a plan ticket back to Orlando and you can get back to doing whatever it is you do.  Deal?”

Thoroughly disgusted at my situation, I agreed.  This made Bud happy.  “OK, let’s get this over with”, I said. 

I put on the costume and prepared to go walk around in the dark woods.  At this point I was willing to do almost anything to get out of here and go home.  It was around 4:00 a.m. by now.  I got into the Chewbacca costume.  I smelled like shit.  I figured I must have shit and pissed myself when I was in it down in Orlando.  I would later come to learn that Bud had secretly doused the costume with Bigfoot urine. 

Bud led me outside.  “OK, now go down that way a bit until you come to my old tractor, then just kind of hang out and act all sasquatchy”, Bud said.  I had no idea what he meant, but obliged.  It was cold outside, but at least my costume would keep me warm. 

I stood around by that old tractor for about an hour.  Then I heard Uncle Bud let out a loud roar sounding noise.  I looked back at the noise to see Bud a few yards away from me.  He gave me a thumbs up.  That fucker had actually snuck up behind me, on all the dry oak leaves and other ground clutter without even making a sound.  It turned out that Bud actually is a skilled woodsman after all!  This impressed me.

A moment later I heard it.  It came crashing through the brush, making a beeline toward me.  It was clearly big, whatever it was.  I figured it was either a bear, or that those feds surveilling Bud were raiding his home.  Then came the roar.  It was so damn loud that it made my organs vibrate.  I started feeling sick.  Then I heard Uncle Bud’s voice right behind me.  “Be cool, dude.  It’s coming!”, he said.  By now Bud was only a few feet away from me. 

Out of the darkness then came what I can only describe as a monster from hell.  It was at least 10 feet tall, as wide as an F-150 truck, covered in dark hair, and had red glowing eyes.  It was a nightmarish beast!! I thought to myself, “HOLY SHIT!!! THIS IS FUCKING REAL!!!!”

It was on me in a flash.  I figure it would tear me limb from limb!  But something worse happened.  Something MUCH WORSE!!

I will not get into all of the particulars about what transpired next.  All I will say is that Uncle Bud neglected to tell me that this huge, gruesome sasquatch was horny as fuck.  It threw me over the back tire of the tractor, face down.  Then …. I screamed.  The pain was EXCRUCIATING!!!! Each pounding was worse than the last.  It was like having a prostate exam performed with a jackhammer. 

Then I heard the beast roar.  “OH SHIT!!”, I thought.  “HERE IT COMES!!” 

But then the bigfoot let out another, more pained and high pitch squeal.  It pulled back.  I turned my head to see Uncle Bud on top of it, stabbing it in its huge throat.  Blood was spurting about everywhere.  Bud had the monster around its head, holding onto it as it bled. Finally, after several agonizing moments, the beast grew silent and relented, falling backward as Bud still held it.  Bud then whispered into its ear, “Shhhhhhhh!! Shhhhh!!”.

It was dead.  Due to the abuse it inflicted upon me, the ordeal felt like an eternity.  But in reality, it probably lasted no more than 20 seconds.  Bud had done exactly like he said.  He had slain the devil.  Bigfoot IS real, and Bud had killed it. 

Bud was covered in sasquatch blood.  He looked at me and said, “Come on, boy.  Let’s get back to the house and get cleaned up.  I sheepishly looked up at Uncle Bud and said, “I don’t think I can walk.”  The last thing I remembered was Uncle Bud picking me up, throwing me over his shoulder, and walking off toward the house.  Then I passed out.

Two days later I awoke in a bed in Bud’s house.  I got up and went looking for Bud.  The paid reminded me of what had happened two nights before.  I cringed at my memory.  Did THAT really happen?  Or, was it a dream?

I found Bud putting breakfast on the table.  “Well, it’s about time you got your sorry ass out of bed! Come on and get some food in you”, said Bud.  I sat down and started to eat.  There were eggs, scrambled, sausage, toast, grits, juice, and coffee.  As we ate Bud said, “Yeah, so, it’s good to see you up, son.  I was afraid I was gonna lose you.” I asked what happened.  Bud told me that I had lost a lot of blood due to the rather lusty bigfoot. I asked, “You, Uncle Bud?  You saved me?”  Bud smiled at me.  “What did you do? Stitch me up?” I asked.  Bud said, “Nah, I just stuck a whiskey cork up your ass”.

The meal was good.  I ate ravenously.  But there was something off about the sausage.  It was gamey tasting.  “Uncle Bud, this sausage, what kind is this?  I have never tasted sausage quite like this”.  With a big grin on his face, Bud leaned toward me and said, “It’s your boyfriend, buddy!”  I asked, “What?”  Bud said, “Yeah, see, since you took the big guy’s meat, I thought it fitting that you get to taste it too!!! You are essentially blowing bigfoot right now!!!” Then he started laughing. 

Uncle Bud kept his promise.  He drove me to Atlanta and bought me a plane ticket for Orlando.  He also gave me $10,000.00 cash for my troubles, which was a quite welcome surprise.  Then he handed me a duffle bag, telling me that it was a “going away gift”, and that I should open it when I get home.  We then said our goodbyes, and I got on the plan and flew home. 

All the way home I thought about what had happened.  Yeah, I almost got killed, several times, when I was with Bud.  Bud committed several violent felonies, and some nonviolent ones too, while I was with him.  But my curiosity revolved around this uncle I had never really got to know and how mysterious he is.  It was a once in a lifetime experience, that’s for sure.

I got home and got settled in.  My ass still burned like fire.  Then I remembered the duffle bag Bud gave me, and that I should open it when I got home.  What could it be?  Could it be some sort of touching gift to show Bud’s affection?  More money?  Cocaine?  Curiosity got the better of me so I went to it and opened it.  Inside it I found the severed, still erect, sasquatch penis that had violated me.  Tied to it was a note from Bud that said, “You will never forget your first time! Uncle Bud”.

I’ve been trying to recreate the amazing V60 brews I get at a local specialty coffee shop. They brew an Ethiopian — bright, fruity, full of body — and it tastes incredible every single time.

At home, I tried to copy their setup exactly: •	Same beans — from the same roast batch. •	Same grind size — I even brought my own grinder (Timemore C3S) to the café and we ground it together at 16 clicks. •	Same water — I took a gallon of their brewing water home with me. •	Same V60 dripper — I’m using a glass MHW-3Bomber V60; they use either ceramic or plastic, but today I took my glass dripper to them. •	Same kettle — I even brought my exact kettle to the café. •	Same recipe — 15g coffee, 250g water, 93°C, similar pour rate (50g in 11 seconds for the bloom, steady spirals after).

When we brewed at the café — using my equipment, my grinder, my kettle, my dripper — the coffee tasted amazing. Fruity, juicy, bright, clean. Everything you’d expect from a great Ethiopian V60.

But when I went home, using: •	Same beans, •	Same grind size, •	Same water (from the gallon I took from the café), •	Same kettle, •	Same dripper, •	Same recipe…

👉 The brew tasted flat, burnt, lifeless. No brightness, no fruitiness — and even the color of the brewed coffee was wrong — much darker than what we got at the café. It had body, but a bad, muddy body — not the clean, sweet profile from the shop.

I thought maybe it was old beans, so I tried again with freshly arrived coffee (La Palestina from Cypher Coffee, just delivered). At the café: amazing. At home: terrible — same problems.

Only difference is: location — brewing at home vs at the café.

So now I’m losing it trying to figure out what’s causing this.

I’m seriously stuck.

It seems insane that just brewing at home (5 minutes walking distance from The cafe) wrecks the cup — even when every variable is controlled. I can’t be the only person who’s experienced this, right? Has anyone else faced this? What could explain this difference?? Would love any thoughts, theories, or ideas.

1l1qmp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l1qmp1/aita_for_dating_my_exboyfriends_former_roommate/,"AITA for dating my ex-boyfriend’s former roommate, who’s also been my longtime friend?","I (24F) have been friends with this guy (24M) for around 9 years. Over the years, we’ve had our ups and downs — periods where we’d fall out and then reconnect. Most recently, during one of our reconnections, we ended up moving in together — me, him, and my then-boyfriend (also 24M). We all lived together for about 2 years.
My ex and I were together for 5 years, but it was a really toxic relationship. He cheated on me multiple times, was mentally and emotionally abusive, would scream at me regularly, and made me feel like I was walking on eggshells all the time. It took me a long time to finally leave, but I did — about a year ago — and I moved out. The breakup was really messy, as you might expect.

A couple of months after I left, I met up with my longtime friend (the roommate) for coffee. We reconnected again, and during our conversation, he told me he’s had feelings for me for a long time. We started spending more time together, and eventually, we began dating. For what it’s worth, he’s been incredibly kind, respectful, and supportive — the complete opposite of what I had before.
Here’s where the guilt comes in: my friend (now boyfriend) and my ex were never super close, but they did live together for two years, and obviously knew each other. My ex doesn’t know we’re dating, and I feel kind of bad — even though he treated me terribly. Part of me wonders if this crosses some kind of unspoken line.

He tends to react to these things defensively and with reactivity rather than curiosity. I’ve explained many times that I am not criticizing, rather my goal is to talk through things in a way that fosters greater mutual understanding and allows us to be able to meet each others needs better, and thus grow together and develop deeper intimacy. 

He seems to think this type of growth is unnecessary and “perfectionistic,” thus being happy with the status quo and keeping a surface level relationship where we each just do our own thing most of the time. He doesn’t seem to even HAVE needs except literally the need to be left alone / have plenty of alone time. 

He also is a wonderful partner in many ways. He held my hand and hair through 22 hours of labor. He’s great with our daughter. He makes me breakfast and coffee every morning. He gives many words of affirmation and sweet gestures. 

The issue comes when there’s a discrepancy in how we see something or I have a request / need I want to express to him. No matter how careful I am to approach it the right way, at the right time, with the right words - he goes on the defense. He seems to go to the worst case scenario and has even gone as far as questioning if I feel like I married the right person. All I am trying to do is unearth things big and small that could be worked through to facilitate an even more fulfilling relationship and now that we have a little one, a more functional, healthy, joyful, and fulfilling family life. 

Am I being insane? Am I missing something? Am I being too needy or unreasonable?

1l1qlrx,https://i.redd.it/6mrt93l5bk4f1.jpeg,How do you deal with a Frenchie’s anxiety?,"My Biggie is 3 years old and the absolute love of my life, HOWEVER, he is more anxious than I am, if that's even remotely possible. He isn't the best at car rides; after about 10 minutes he starts hyperventilating, even during the cold of winter or with the AC on full blast. It's definitely not temperature-related hyperventilating. I then tried to take him in his stroller on the LIRR and the same thing occurred; he's fine for a short while but then begins to pant loudly to the point that others turn to look. I tried to bribe him with treats and he discarded them and didn't even give them a second glance. The second I rolled him off the train, he was quiet again and sat politely in his stroller like nothing ever happened.

I swear it isn't a heat thing; I don't take him out when it's too hot and when I tried taking him on the LIRR in his stroller it was a perfectly crisp day. He also LOVES his stroller so that isn't an issue either, I can easily walk him to our local Starbucks in the busy part of town 30 minutes each way, and he happily props himself up on the front edge of the stroller to get a better view of his surroundings. 

I am asking for any and all advice on what to do here. I absolutely adore him, but I miss going into Central Park to walk around and drink coffee. I want nothing more than to do that with him in his stroller, but the problem is mobilizing him through a meltdown. If I see him get anxious, I in turn get anxious as well and the fun is over. 

What to do here? Supplements? Any recommendations on a specific trainer in NYC? I will try anything at this point, I don't quite enjoy being under ""house arrest"" but I love my guy too much to leave him alone and want to include him on my weekend excursions.

1l1qlhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1l1qlhu/does_ultra_fresh_liquid_detergent_deliver/,Does Ultra Fresh Liquid Detergent Deliver Powerful Cleaning and Long-Lasting Freshness Review?,"Testing the Ultra Fresh UFPGREGL liquid laundry detergent has been quite an experience, partly because it promises a lot and mostly delivers, but there's always room for some critique. The product, officially known as the 5 Gal Liquid Laundry Detergent Washing Soap, 3X Platinum, Original Green, is an impressive option for anyone looking to tackle never-ending piles of laundry. From its concentrated efficiency to the promise of lasting freshness, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to test its claims, and here’s what stood out to me.

**Ease of Use and Design Convenience**

The usability and thoughtful design of this concentrated liquid detergent deserve a solid mention. The 5-gallon bucket comes equipped with an effortless dispensing pump that makes pouring out detergent straightforward and mess-free, even if you’re as clumsy as I can be early in the morning. No wrestling with heavy containers or spilling product everywhere—it’s a small feature that simplifies my laundry routine. The container itself, however, is bulky, and finding a spot for a bucket this size in a small laundry nook might be challenging.

**3X Concentrated Power and Stain-Fighting Abilities**

This detergent’s 3X cleaning power claim initially made me skeptical (been burned before by lofty promises), but this stuff really does pack a punch. I’ve put it to the test with grass-stained soccer uniforms, muddy dog towels, and even that suspicious coffee spill on my cream-colored blouse. Results? Nearly spotless. It handled tough stains with ease and left fabrics looking rejuvenated. While it works wonders on everyday grime, I did notice that deeply embedded oil stains needed a pre-treatment boost to fully disappear.

**Lasting Freshness: How Long Does It Really Last?**

When laundry smells crisp and fresh long after drying, it’s an immediate win in my book. The Original Green scent isn’t overpowering—it’s clean, subtle, and just noticeable enough to hint that your clothes were professionally laundered (even when it was me and my old washer). A week later, my shirts still smelled great hanging in the closet. However, if strong scents are your thing, this fragrance could feel underwhelming as it leans more toward understated freshness than a bold aroma.

[Discover the Ultra Fresh UFPGREGL on Amazon now.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b01hh4lrai/)

**Perfect for High-Efficiency Living**

Speaking of washers, this detergent is compatible with all types of machines, including High Efficiency (HE) models, and works well with septic systems. I tested it with both cold and hot water wash cycles, and its performance remained consistent. Whether I was using my top-loading machine at home or the HE unit at a friend’s house, the results were equally satisfying. My only note is that its thick concentration means you should pour carefully to avoid using more than necessary—get ready to do a quick mental math check on that dispensing pump.

**Pluses**

- Stain removal is highly effective.
- Ultra-concentrated formula reduces product waste.
- Comes with a dispenser for easy, mess-free laundry management.
- Maintains fabric freshness for days without being overpowering.
- Handles up to 640 loads—great for anyone with large families or commercial needs.

**Critiques**

- Bulk container size requires extra storage space.
- Less effective on deeply embedded oil stains without additional pre-treatment.
- Subtle scent might not appeal to those favoring bolder fragrances.

**Product Competitors**

Considering competitors like Tide 3-in-1 Pods or Gain Liquid Laundry Detergent, this Ultra Fresh detergent carves out its niche with colossal value and exceptional concentration. Tide Pods are convenient but often costlier per load, while Gain boasts stronger fragrance appeal but doesn’t carry the same concentrated cleaning power over so many loads. If stain removal and long-term cost efficiency are essential priorities, Ultra Fresh holds an advantage. However, those eyeing portability or intense scents might still veer toward competing products for convenience.

**Price Performance**

Finding cost efficiency in household essentials is critical, and this product arguably offers a bang-for-the-buck deal. The ability to handle 640 loads in one bucket is head-turning, especially for large, busy households. I’ve done the math—sort of—and per wash, the cost competes with every other detergent I’ve tried in recent years. For budget-conscious shoppers or anyone tired of running out of detergent mid-week, it ranks high. Yes, you’ll need space for it, but that upfront cost saves time and money in the long haul.

It started off with him asking who is paying every time I buy food from there. Most of the time I paid because I was there anyway and my boyfriend pays for other things. He eventually straight up said: ""You should be asking him for money. It's a man's job to provide. When I lived in Brooklyn NY, I had 3 jobs."" Not only do I not a give a shit that he had 3 jobs, but my boyfriend and I had only been together for a few months at that time. We don't live together yet.

Then my car broke down. He says ""your boyfriend should be helping you with that. What does he even do for you? Buy you iced coffee?"" The transmission went out, and my boyfriend and step dad both looked at my car for hours. I told him that, and that he helps me out in several other way. I told my boss we are very happy together to spite him a little.

I know I've said too much to him already, I'm non-confrontational, so next time he mentions anything about my man, I'm going to say ""It's none of your business, we are beyond happy together.""

A few months ago, I started driving my friend ""Mike"" to work. We live in the same building and work in the same office. He initially offered to pay for gas money and I said it was fine, we are going to the same  place after all. 

I guess I expected him to offer again, at some point, and I would ask for $10 a month or something small. I'd also be fine if he occasionally bought me lunch or a coffee or something. Last week, Mike was walking to the cafeteria and asked if I wanted anything. I asked if he could grab me a bottle of soda. For reference this is about $2. Later that day, Mike and I went to a coffee shop together and he asked me to buy him a coffee to make up for the soda. I was kind of surprised to be honest, because in my head, a soda is fairly inconsequential and I'm also driving this dude to work every day. He's also late sometimes which makes me late. I am very non-confrontational so I just said okay- the coffee was $6 so more than double the soda and I just feel a bit taken advantage of? I've tried stopping for gas a few times on the way to and from work, hoping he may take the hint. I even mentioned like gas is expensive here so I may go somewhere else next time. The issue isn't money, in fact, I know Mike makes more than I do. Is there a way to bring this up in a non confrontational way? I don't want to ruin our working relationship/ friendship.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal power inverter for a semi-truck boasts several crucial features that set it apart in terms of performance and reliability.

**Power Output (Wattage):** This is arguably the most vital factor. It determines the number and type of devices you can run together.

The Power output, measured in watts, indicates the maximum power the inverter can deliver. Consider the total wattage of all the devices you intend to use at the same time. For example, a laptop might draw 60 watts, a coffee maker 800 watts, and a microwave 1000 watts.You'll need an inverter with a continuous wattage rating that exceeds the combined wattage of your devices. Opting for a higher wattage inverter than you currently need also provides headroom for future expansion and prevents overload issues.

**Input Voltage:** This specifies the DC voltage required from the truck's battery system.

Semi-trucks typically utilize 12V or 24V electrical systems. Ensure the inverter's input voltage matches your truck's system. Using an inverter with the wrong input voltage can damage both the inverter and the truck's electrical system. Most inverters designed for semi-trucks are specifically designed for 12V systems, but always double-check. Some higher-end models may be capable of operating at both 12V and 24V.

**Output Waveform:** This refers to the type of AC power the inverter produces. there are two main types: modified sine wave and pure sine wave.

Modified sine wave inverters are less expensive but can be problematic for sensitive electronics. Certain devices, such as some laptops, power tools, and medical equipment, require pure sine wave inverters to function properly. Pure sine wave inverters produce cleaner, more stable AC power, mimicking the power from your home outlet. While they are more expensive, they offer better performance and protect against potential damage to your devices.

**Safety Features:** Essential safety features protect both the inverter and your devices from damage.

Overload protection automatically shuts down the inverter if the connected devices draw too much power. Short circuit protection prevents damage in case of a short circuit in the connected appliances. Over-temperature protection safeguards the inverter from overheating, which can cause damage or failure. Low voltage protection shuts down the inverter if the truck's battery voltage drops too low, preventing battery drain.**Efficiency:** This is the percentage of DC power that is converted into usable AC power.

A Higher efficiency rating means less power is wasted as heat,resulting in longer run times and reduced strain on the truck's battery. Inverters with higher efficiency ratings are often more expensive, but they can save you money in the long run by reducing battery drain. Look for inverters with efficiency ratings of 85% or higher.

**Connectivity:** This includes the number and type of outlets available, along with other features like USB ports.

Consider the number of AC outlets you need to power your devices simultaneously. Some inverters include USB ports for charging mobile phones, tablets, and other USB-powered devices. Hardwire kits allow for a more permanent and secure connection to the truck's battery.

Key features of an ideal power inverter include:

* Sufficient wattage
* Correct voltage compatibility
* Pure sine wave output
* Thorough safety features

## Core Benefits

Power inverters bring several core benefits that enhance the trucking experience.

**Increased Comfort and Convenience:** A power inverter allows drivers to use household appliances and electronics in thier trucks, making life on the road more pleasant.Drivers can heat up meals with a microwave, brew coffee for early mornings, and watch television during downtime. This eliminates the need to rely solely on truck stops for meals and entertainment, saving time and money.

**Enhanced Productivity:** With a power inverter, drivers can stay connected and productive while on the road. They can charge laptops and mobile devices to catch up on emails, manage paperwork, and stay in touch with family and dispatch. Being able to conduct these tasks in the truck cab allows for better time management and reduces the need to stop at hotels or offices for basic connectivity.

**Reduced Expenses:** By enabling the use of personal appliances, drivers can reduce their reliance on expensive truck stop amenities. Cooking meals in the truck avoids the high costs of restaurant food, and having access to entertainment options cuts down on impulse purchases. Over time, these savings can add up significantly.

**Improved Safety:** Safety features of power inverters protect both the driver and the truck. Overload protection prevents the inverter from overheating and potentially causing a fire.Properly functioning power inverters will not drain the battery of the truck when not in use or when the truck is off which reduces the chance of being stranded.

## FAQs Section

**What size power inverter do I need for my semi-truck?**
The size of the power inverter you need depends on the total wattage of the devices you plan to use simultaneously. Add up the wattage of all the appliances and electronics you intend to plug into the inverter.Choose an inverter with a continuous wattage rating that exceeds the combined wattage of your devices. It's always better to have a little extra capacity than to overload the inverter.

**Is a pure sine wave or modified sine wave inverter better for a semi-truck?**
A pure sine wave inverter is generally better for a semi-truck, especially if you plan to use sensitive electronics such as laptops, medical devices, or power tools.pure sine wave inverters produce cleaner, more stable power and are less likely to damage your devices. While they are more expensive than modified sine wave inverters, they provide better performance and peace of mind.

**How do I install a power inverter in my semi-truck?**
Installation typically involves connecting the inverter to the truck's battery. Consult with professionals for custom wiring and placement for optimal ventilation. The red cable connects to the positive (+) terminal, and the black cable connects to the negative (-) terminal. Ensure the connections are secure and properly insulated. If your inverter comes with a remote switch, mount it in a convenient location within the cab. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and proper installation.

**Can I leave my power inverter on all the time in my semi-truck?**
It depends on the inverter model and your usage patterns. Some inverters have a low ""idle"" draw when no devices are being powered, so leaving them on continuously could drain the truck's battery over time. if you will leave the power inverter on all the time, ensure the truck batteries are properly charged throughout idle times. It's generally recommended to turn off the inverter when you're not using it to conserve battery power.

**Nope** everything I feared came true.

As soon as I walked into the office I kid you not I thought I could smell sweat. I thought I was at the gym for a moment. 

* ""Open office"" concept. Except everyone from the sales team, recruiting, to leadership were crammed together and everyone was talking at the same time. It was a cacophony of noise
* One coffee machine for the entire office. Fortunately I don't drink coffee but my interviewer hyped it up because it was a Nespresso machine (I think he was using it as a selling point.)
* They did have a very nice lounge area downstairs but who would have the time to enjoy it in an environment such as that??
* Onsite 5 days a week 8am-5pm and I've been working remote since the pandemic started. I think that'll give me extreme whiplash.

  
After that I met with a couple members from the leadership team and answered their questions the best I could. But the entire time I kept zoning out and thinking that is isn't for me. They said they would let me know their decision but I think I'm going to pass on this opportunity.

  
Then on my way back from the interview I stopped by Goodwill hoping to find cool collectibles or maybe a couple blu rays. Then saw they had a career center next door so I walked in and plainly asked if they could help me find a job. Turns out there was a career fair upstairs so I went upstairs and the woman asked me what I was looking for. I asked her if her company had any Technical Recruiter or Corporate positions available within the company. Then she all to eagerly just said ""we're food and bev"" and gave me a giant Grinch like smile. (the animated version not Jim Carrey) So I replied ""oh ok. Do you ever hire any corporate type positions for your company or any technical roles?"" Again she simply said ""we're food and bev"" that's it, just staring at me with that Grinch-like smile. That's the weirdest thing to me even as I'm writing this is her answers alongside that animated Grinch smile. 

  
I've been to several in person job fairs before and almost all the event workers look at me like I'm an alien for asking about corporate, internal, or any white collar positions since I'm coming from a Tech Recruitment background. Has anyone experienced this before? I thought by going in person I could generate a referral or lead especially in this job market but in 2 years no such luck. 

  
Anywho, just wanted to put my thoughts out here because like this job market. It was a very strange day....",3,1748890826.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False
1l1qfgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l1qfgt/i_25m_think_i_phrased_something_poorly_and_killed/,"I (25M) think I phrased something poorly and killed the vibe, or she(23F) was already losing interest.","Hey everyone. I (25M) need some perspective on a situation that's been bugging me for days now.

About two weeks ago, my mom visited a family friend who is a professor. That professor (let’s call her X) suggested that I meet one of her students (23F), saying she’s smart, sweet, and might be a good match. X asked the girl if she’d be open to it, and the girl said something like: “If you think we’d get along, why not?” So my mom told me about it afterward, and I decided to reach out on Instagram.

We started chatting. She was polite and engaged, always answered my questions thoughtfully, used emojis, and laughed at my jokes. But she **never initiated conversation** or asked me much about myself unless I asked her first. Still, the vibe felt warm - just not equal.

Here’s where things got complicated.

She mentioned she will have a layover in my city the next day, and I sent this message:

“I’d suggest we grab a coffee, but I guess it’s not worth your time leaving the airport to come into the city or me coming to the airport 🤪 I assume your layover is short anyway.”

I meant it playfully — like “I'd actually enjoy seeing you but I get it, logistics suck.”

She replied:

“My layover is actually long, but I’m meeting a friend anyway. Thanks.”

That already felt kind of cold.

So I responded:

“Got it, hope you have a good time :)”

And… for the first time ever, she left me on seen. No “thanks,” no emoji, nothing. And it's been 2 days now.

Now I’m not sure what happened:

* I guess I may have accidentally offended her with the way I phrased that.
* Or, it was just a polite way to close things off from her perspective.
* I think it is worth clarifying my intent to her, but I don't want to come off as needy.

Would really appreciate some outside perspective — not trying to rekindle something that’s dead, just want to know how I can handle similar situations better in the future.

For context: I’m 25M, she’s 23F, we live in different cities, and we haven’t met in person. But I did start to genuinely like her, and it sucks not knowing if I blew it over a dumb sentence or if she was never really into it.

Appreciate your honest takes 🙏",1,1748890720.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

This one is one that is not meant to last so if you’re looking for a happy ending, this one is but of a different kind. He was a tourist in my country and we matched like 3 days before we actually met. Wasn’t really seem that interested in him at first but his weirdness got to me, while we were chatting I figured he was staying at a shabby hotel near my house! So, I decided to offer to pass by his place just to say hi. 

While driving there, I got nervous because the place was really shady. I told him I was skeptical but we ended up laughing so hard after seeing each other because I find it so incredulous of being in such a shabby place. I said I’d bet he’s the only foreigner in the area. 

We laughed for about 15 minutes about this and had coffee. In there we talked about many stuff, the conversation flowed naturally, wasn’t really romantic but just exchanges of ideas. We clicked straight away. 

He told me he was staying for 6 weeks just to explore and he’s been exploring for 2 years before going back to his country soon. 

The night ended up with me bringing him back to his creepy hotel and him kissing me before we parted. I did not expect it at all because I thought we were just vibing as friends. 

The next day, I was supposed to go to this work party but wasn’t really feeling it so I invited him for a quick roadtrip. Wasn’t reqlly expecting anything because he said he was leaving the next day for the beaches. I was just enjoying my time with him. 

We did some sight seeing after an hour and a half of driving. Then had some snacks, we kept on laughing at the restaurant, I found a pet name for him which he hates but I stuck with it. We were so rowdy at the restaurant and figured we can’t be in public spaces because we kept on being loud and making inappropriate jokes too. It was the light kind. 

In the car we had a hot steamy make out session which led to a bit of sexy time which had a short glitch as he had a hard time doing it with anyone the first time. We decided to take a break and have coffee at some place. While in there, we sat by the pond and listened to music. He told me about his life, family, and friends. 

We’d kiss and makeout the whole night. We even danced to the music. It was just pretty. Then he told me he has a plan, what if we spend the entire day together and just have sexy time. I agreed and felt a little flattered that he’d extend his stay in the city for sexy time haha. Fast forward, we had a steamy 24 hours together, lots of sex, inside jokes, and intimate conversations. We were both exhausted the next day! Haha. What I like the most is how he looks at me while we were doing it, he was looking at me like he was searching for my soul. We’d also cuddle and sleep while holding hands and I’d feel him kiss my face, hair, eyes. He’d whisper things like, “you are so fun,” “i will miss you a lot” while he thought I was sleeping, he’d also hug me while saying those things. 

The next day, we thanked each other for a wonderful experience. We weren’t meant to last but this was definitely one of the best experiences of my life! ❤️

This is my first long post on Reddit. Wish it was something different but here we are.

Recently, I've lost my grandmother. She was sick for about eight years (the comeback of cancer + stroke), and it's a difficult time for my family.

I had a complicated relationship with her. She was a controlling person, difficult to communicate with, wanted to be the center of everyone's universe. These years of her being sick took a toll on the whole family (being a caregiver sucks).

Anyway, I was crying a lot at the funeral and then managed to calm down. There are these weird dreams of dead people (I lost a lot of loved ones), my mom's health has also deteriorated, and my old cat (21 years old) also has significant health issues. As for me, I have a disorder combining both depression and anxiety.

Recently, I started to notice that I envy other people (social media aren't good for mental health for sure). I don't remember being happy. While they keep going.

What's worse, I've built up some resentment for friends abs and coworkers I thought I shared bond with. No one picked ip up my tasks. No one invited me for a coffee. It seems like when you're grieving people start to consider you some sort of a plague.

Meanwhile, they want me to organise a gift to our other coworker (she's expecting a child), and I kinda feel angry about both the responsibility and that they never did anything like that when I was in mourning, or when I was at hospital with appendicitis, or when I lost my other cat.I was the one to provide support/gifts when these people had problems of their own?

I realise it's a ""me"" problem. They don't own me anything. But how can I manage that anger? How can I get rid over these negative emotions?

It seems like such a stupid thing.",1,1748890423.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I know, I know, I'm describing ADHD here, but I'm specifically looking for advice on how to recognize the different brains. I want to figure out how many ""brains"" (emotional and cognitive functioning mixes) I have and when to see if I can find a pattern. Maybe figure out the strengths and weaknesses of each and try to figure out when/where/why they happen. Maybe it would help me feel like OK, this is just brain #4 happening so I know what to do to avoid the major pitfalls and use the advantages.

1l1qa54,https://i.redd.it/mms2656w6k4f1.png,Dear AH! A plea for more intermediate armor sets!,"Hi! I am FEISAR-BE from the SES Emperor of mankind. And you entered my ted talk about intermediate armor sets. Now what are they?

Most armor sets have fixed values. 

* 50 armor/550 speed/125 stamina for light armor (100A with padding)
* 100 armor/500 speed/100 stamina for medium armor (150A with padding)
* 150 armor/ 450 speed/50 stamine for heavy armor (200A with padding)

Seems straight forward. the 3 armor classes have fixed stats unless they have extra padding. 

***HOWEVER***

**5 armor sets in the game are diffrent.**

I like to call these intermediate armor sets, and you can see them all in the crude paint composition image i made in 2 minutes. 4 of these are light armors and 1 is medium. They all have diffrent stats compared the base armor class. More armor, but also less speed and stamina. So it sits in between classes so to speak.

By chance they are also very cool armor sets. With the CE-07 demolition set, B-24 enforcer and CE-67 titan being favorites of mine.

But there lies the issue...They arent being issued anymore. The last set that was released is the CE-07 DE, wich dates back to the democratic detonation warbond released on 11-04-2024, 2 months after the game released.

Since then, 9 warbonds have been released. Aswel as some free armor sets and superstore sets. None wich have intermediate values. Just the base class stats.

I find this ***UN-ACCEPTABLE!*** (Jk i appreciate everything you do AH thank you so much for this game)

It would spice things up more if future armor sets once again get intermediate stats. Or adjust some existing lesser used armor sets to give them more popularity.

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

If any of this resonates, feel free to send a message and tell me a bit about yourself. What are you reading/watching/listening to lately?

# CHAPTER ONE

*Rough Draft*

My fingers coast along a shelf of books, and the smell of old pages fills the room. All I hear is people turning pages and whispers of small talk. My steps are louder than anything—the silence is deafening.

Every precious moment, I spend reading the backs and flaps of dust covers on each book, trying to find *the one*.

I hear muffled whispers. Maybe teasing. I peek around the corner of the shelf to see two teenage boys—maybe seventeen years of age—whispering, their smiles so vibrant.

I heard something about a “pretty girl and her books.”

Are they talking about me? Maybe. I wouldn’t call myself *pretty*, but I’ll take it.

They come closer, walking to the end of the aisle I’m on. I let my long, earthy brown hair shield my face. I wish they would come and introduce themselves. I keep reading the covers of books.

I’m so particular.

A girl who looks just like me walks down the same aisle I’m on, a stack of eleven books in her arms, organized in a way that you can still see part of her face.

Why does she look like me?

I hear a deep, unknown man’s voice—so disturbing, you feel like death is talking to you. He breathes into my soul.

“Time’s up, you must leave.”

No. I want to keep looking for books. I have only two. This isn’t fair.

Everything blacks out.

I wake up in a hospital bed, and the sound of the monitors reading all of my vitals is nauseating. A few different IVs are administering unknown drops into my bloodstream, and wires are all over my chest. The humming fluorescent light above me is nearly blinding.

Where am I? I don’t even feel bad.

My vision doubles every few minutes—probably because of whatever I was sedated with. I begin to slowly pull the needles out of my arm and disconnect the wiring. I slide out of the bed, my bare feet coming in contact with the icy tiled floor.

Everything fades away.

Beep. Beep. Beep.  
The alarm clock sounds, slicing through the silence.

**5:00 A.M.**

I gasp, transported back to my bedroom. The sound pierces through me, fraying every nerve ending.

Too early. Too cold. That was too real.  
Why would I dream that?

I open my eyes to nothingness and look over to my alarm. The red digits peer at me across the room through my blurred vision.

My head presses deeper into my cold pillow, and I can’t help but wonder if anything will change. The world feels frozen—as if time is absent.

The soft hum of the heater in the corner is just enough to fill the silence. I gently push aside the crisp sheets, letting the cold creep in.

Shuffling over to my desk at the other side of my room, I blindly feel for the string to my lamp and pull. The dim light is just enough to fight the darkness, filling the corner.

My MacBook, textbooks, and notepads are scattered around carelessly on the desk, but then my eyes stop at the leather journal hiding under a stack of crumpled paper.

Dad gave it to me for my seventeenth birthday—just a week ago. He said it would be the perfect place to put my thoughts, memories, and secrets.

I reach for it, its familiar earthy smell—somehow grounding.

I flip it open and start to write.

**\[Lainey’s Journal | 08.09.2026\]**

There is a familiar weight in the air these days. The world feels colder. It has been a little over a month since the CDC announced a national emergency over NOVIRA-26. We’re back in lockdown—just like 2020. There is an intrusive thought woven into me that I can’t quite shake.

Something is different about this time.

My eyes lose focus, the words blurring into each other. I stop writing and listen to my own heartbeat in my ear.

There is a sick feeling in my gut that there is more to this. I’ve been raised to question everything—but this is instinct.

There is a large window overlooking my desk. I push aside the curtains. It is still dark outside—no signs of life.

The window is frosted at the corners. Moonlight patches our long gravel driveway stretching into the dark abyss. The pines sway gently, as if they were passing secrets along to each other.

I push open the window and lean over my desk, letting the cold air hit my face. The moonlight reflects off my slightly tanned skin. The gentle breeze guides shorter pieces of my hair across my face.

Wow.

My parents built a 3,500-square-foot cabin about a mile off a public road, just twenty miles outside of Knoxville, after the panic during COVID-19 hit in 2020. Close enough to the city for good job opportunities, but far enough away to be secluded.

I’m an early person by nature. Getting up early is not enjoyable at first, but I know once I get past the morning grogginess, I’ll be thankful I did it. There’s something about being awake before the world—something special. That feeling of uninterrupted silence, just me and God.

I make my way downstairs, my fluffy socks muffling each step.

Dad’s already awake, sitting on the barstool at the kitchen island, resting his head on his palm. The dim light above illuminates his sun-streaked hair.

The kitchen smells like fresh-brewed coffee and… worry.

I stand at the last step, looking at him.

Why is he awake so early?

His eyes finally find me. He tenses for a second, not expecting me to be there.

“You’re up early.”

I lightly chuckle. “Yeah… I’m always up early, but *you’re* never up early.” I hesitate. “Is there something bothering you?”

“Just thinkin’.”

“You can tell me, you know,” I say quietly.

He runs his hands through his hair, fidgeting a little.

“Nothin’—umm, you hungry?”

I know he’s trying to change the subject. He is frozen for a second, like he just told a lie.

He continues, tension in his voice. “I’m not sure, Lainey. I’ve been noticing things. Patterns. The kind that you don’t notice unless you really look.”

A weight settles in my chest.

What’s going on?

My eyes meet his—a distant gaze, as if it could fill the emptiness between us.

“Follow me, sweetie,” he whispers, rising from the barstool and making his way to the basement.

I trail him down, my hand sliding along the cold steel railing. It gets colder and colder with each step, and the smell of paint and old cement fills my nose. I was never allowed down here until now.

He has a private office down here. A wooden desk sits to the right in the corner against the cinder block walls. On his desk, there is a ham radio, a large monitor, notebooks and pens scattered about, and—of course—a coffee maker, because this is Dad.

He sits down in a mesh office chair and turns toward me, his stormy blue eyes in a steady focus.

“When I was in my late twenties, I worked for the U.S. Army Military Intelligence—Signals Intelligence. I worked with classified radio messages and stuff like that.” He pauses, his fingers fused together. His breaths are deep and controlled.

“Anyway, long story short, I was exposed to some—uh…” He leans forward, closer to me. My emerald eyes search his. “Let’s just say, dangerous things. Information that normal people aren’t supposed to know.” He glances at the ham radio, then back at me.

For a second, I don’t see Dad. I see someone else—someone I’ve never met.

*Who are you?*

“They’re classified HF bands for undercover government operations. If this information is handed to the wrong people, they make sure it doesn’t get out,” he says, his voice deep—gut-wrenching. “Luckily, I had enough sense to know it and left immediately, moved across the country, and laid low.”

*They would’ve killed my dad.*

I swallow a lump in my throat. My chest finally relaxes, and I don’t think I’ve taken a breath since he started telling me these things.

“They transmit the HF bands around 3:00 A.M. EST. They hop between 6.2 MHz and 7.9 MHz to avoid scanners picking up their signals. I have a setup where my monitor is connected to the ham radio. When it transmits, it records the message to the monitor, and I transfer it to a hard drive and delete the audio file,” he says, pointing to the nest of wires between the radio and monitor.

“Unfortunately, though, the receiver only picks up fragments of the message because they hop between frequencies.”

“Last night,” he continues, his tone getting colder by the minute, “something concerning came through.”

He opens a drawer, pulls a matte-black hard drive out, and plugs it into the side of the monitor. A window pops up. He double-clicks an audio file labeled:

**Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot**

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. **The most obvious win is daily energy.** Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? **The science-backed formulation.** You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also **trust built into the brand**—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

# [✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://bit.ly/43Vgv7z)

I also can’t underplay how **natural it feels.** No chemicals, no harsh stimulants, no “detox symptoms.” It slides into your life without disruption, and you forget you’re even taking something until your clothes fit better and your brain works faster.

Now, for the cons. **The price isn’t exactly budget-friendly.** At nearly $69 per bottle if you don’t bulk buy, it’s an investment. I’d argue it’s worth every penny, especially when you factor in skipped coffee runs and fewer doctor visits—but for someone tight on funds, it might sting upfront.

Another minor downside? **Patience is required.** Mitolyn doesn’t promise overnight miracles—and it doesn’t deliver them. You need to stick with it for weeks to start seeing real results. If you're expecting a quick fix, you’ll be disappointed. But if you're committed to real transformation, this will reward you.",1,1748889660.0,Boomer,1,0.66,False

With their previous dog they had a neighbor that would come over and pet sit but she is older and can't deal with taking care of a younger dog with so much energy. My friend found a sitter that was new to the area but had a lot of great reviews from her previous city. They did a meet and greet and everything went really well. It was decided that the Rover would come stay at my friend's house with her husband. As kind of a courteous and offhanded comment my friend said that they were welcome to help themselves to any food in the house.  

So my friends go on their trip and everything seems to be going well. The sitter sent them updates and even groomed my friend's dog. There were some issues with getting the pup to sleep in the bed with them so they were able to work out a playpen situation.

My friends arrived back home really early in the morning so they had a quick debrief with the sitter and went back to bed once her and her husband left. When they got up later that day they went to make some coffee and noticed their whole entire refrigerator and most of their freezer was completely cleared out. Now it doesn't sound that bad but my friends are borderline food hoarders. Every time they make a trip to Costco it's like they're stocking up for the apocalypse (imagine 20 pounds of chicken breast individually vacuum sealed). They're also the type of people to make a lot of extra food to freeze for later and that was all gone too!  My friend was suspicious because a few days before they returned the sitter texted them complaining that they ran out of milk and eggs but said they'd go to the store to get more.

It seems pretty clear that the sitter took a lot of food home with them because I'm telling you it is not possible for two people to go through all of that food in less than two weeks even if they ate all of their meals there. I asked my friend if they saw anything on the Ring camera but they said it's possible they could have loaded the food through the garage where the camera couldn't catch them.  

Should my friend bring this up to the sitter or write it in a review? She feels bad because she did say that they could help themselves but never explicitly stated that they would provide all of their food for the stay. Would you write this off as a misunderstanding or do you believe it's serious enough that other people should be warned, especially since this sitter is new to the area. Thankfully really expensive items like wine and liquor were accounted for but they did say a few of their beers were missing too.",17,1748889539.0,RoverPetSitting,56,0.84,False

I'm a 5'2 southeast Asian guy who's never asked a woman out in my life, having been through 7 serious relationships and over a dozen people dated only thanks to changing attitudes in the last decade and the sheer grace of the incredible women who showed interest in me. Please bear with me as I am mildly autistic (diagnosed, formerly Asperger's) and suspect that my understanding or ability to have romantic relationships is impacted by this.

The ways I've been described within the first few dates:

* Bob Ross (angry military dude -> chill peace lover)
* Sweetest guy they've ever gone out with
* Safe and calming to the nervous system (especially for anxious / neurodiverse people)
* ""The booktok experience"" / ""too pretty""

I've never had a bad date. *All* of my dates have been positive for both myself and the other person - again, I think this indicates something is off with how I approach things. Things have always played out in a similar fashion:

1. Within a few days of being back on Hinge (dating app), I'll have been asked out by several matches so I go with the one who I vibe with most and we connect on Instagram
2. We meet for something casual like coffee, sometimes they're very forward about wanting to go back to mine or theirs but otherwise I don't bring up the topic
3. If we spent the night, I've always been asked for exclusivity immediately. Otherwise, the second date has been where they would decide on continuing as friends / fwb or that they wanted to take things seriously

I know that it seems ""fast"" but each of these people were very forward and certain about what they wanted at that time, while making me feel emotionally safe. I was also genuinely attracted to them; I've tried to debate with myself whether I'm just settling but even in retrospect, these women were absolutely beautiful, kindhearted, and unbelievably generous to me. They've also all stayed connected except for 3 who have had to block me only because they couldn't stop themselves from reaching out after things ended.

Typically in a relationship I'd see them anywhere from once every 2 weeks to once or twice a week, I'd make sure to text them in the morning/night, but never any calls except my most recent relationship who sparked this as she was just the perfect energy that I'm looking for. I've been playfully laughed at by my coworkers (mostly women) who insist that this is NOT a relationship and I suspect that here they have another point; I'll enthusiastically anticipate and respond to bids for attention but I never make my own bids for attention. This might even be related to having never asked anyone out as I am constantly experiencing a sense of ""gosh, *she* wants to spend time with *me*?"" when my *girlfriend* would ask to see me. 

Which means that relationships often stagnated and I know at least one girlfriend was trying to communicate this to me through song lyrics. My suspicion is that there's probably been frustration around this yet at the same time, not knowing how to ""blame"" me for it because it was very much my own fault. My girlfriends would go above and beyond to let me down gently, insisting that it was all positive and not knowing what to say besides ""this isn't it"". The only constructive ""criticism"" I've received has been:

* Love yourself
* You need to realize you're really f\*ing attractive

Recently I broke up with someone who absolutely revitalized my enthusiasm for dating as it was such a great short-lived experience with possibly the most chemistry and most attractive personality so far, yet she had a lot of circumstances which were terrible on paper and ultimately did me a favor because I would've dug her out of her troubles on top of providing for her kids. It's made me happier and more hopeful because now I know what I'm looking for and I know people like her exist out there, yet maybe I'm also scared that I'll forever bounce around great relationships but never finding someone who wants to keep me.",1,1748889491.0,self,0,1.0,False

I know I sound dramatic, but if you grew up in India in the 2000s/early 2010s, you know EXACTLY what I mean. Nothing today even comes close. No other snack can compete, let alone replace those OG legends.

I’ve tried everything—DMing brands, tagging them in memes, tweeting, signing every petition, even trying to replicate the taste at home (spoiler: disaster). I’m now dangerously close to becoming “that person” who makes a documentary called “The Forgotten Flavours of India.”

On a serious note—PLEASE drop real suggestions. Who do we contact? Is there a distributor somewhere sitting on secret stock? Can we start a change.org campaign that actually works? I’m desperate.

We brought back Campa Cola. Surely we can bring back Hippo and Bytes?

I have done a couple of cruise ship contracts so I have my STCW and will be doing my ENG1 next week, so that's no problem. (I'm from the UK)

  
I have my eye on a few Yacht Steward courses, as I have never worked in housekeeping, at a bar or restaurant before, so my skillset is very basic, just from videos I've watched online and cocktails I've practised at home with my kits.

Is it worth me paying over £1000 to do the full training courses? I worry that if I start doing dockwalking in France right now, my lack of formal hospitality experience will stop me from getting any day work. 

My only skill set on my CV is having lived on multiple cruise ships with a cabin mate, and being a professional onboard and beach photographer. I used to be a production assistant for years, so I used to make all the tea and coffee and cheese/fruit boards for everyone. But I don't know how much that will help me when pitching myself on the docks.

I was recently diagnosed with bp2 about 2 months ago. I have known about my ADHD since a kid. I have noticed if I take stimulants (adderall/vyvanse), coffee, pre workout or gamersupps that I will feel great while it lasts but once it’s gone I feel pissed and irritated that I just can’t take anything that makes me feel good/gives me motivation to do stuff. So I just sit here not doing anything and struggling with the easiest tasks for other people. I have a 1 year old daughter and a wife so I’m really struggling with this. At one time I was taking 2 adderall xr a day to keep it going but it was really messing with me. My current psychiatrist pulled me off stimulants as it can have a negative effect with bipolar.

It’s not gonna be published or anything, but it just made me and my friends happy. The name of the story is a horror of a Saturday morning.","The horrors of a Saturday morning

A small town for secrets full of back stories one Saturday  changed everything Saturday was Sarah’s favorite coffee with her friends. Just wish she would’ve got to live to see a few more.

Characters Anna, Sarah’s mom, Noah, Kenzie’s boyfriend, Kenzie, Sarah’s best friend, Maddie, Kenzie, and Sarah’s best friend Dexter, the police officer


Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Shock
Here's how that Saturday morning really went down: Kenzie and I walked into the gas station. My heart sank when I saw Noah and Maddie kissing. Kenzie exploded, yelling and throwing a coffee at Noah. We stormed out of there, leaving them in the dust.



Chapter 2: The Unexplained Encounter
Later, Noah found a way to talk to me. He explained everything, how Maddie had manipulated him, how he was caught completely off guard by the kiss, and that it wasn't what it seemed. He laid out details that made it clear Noah was innocent. He was just a pawn in Maddie's games.




Chapter 3: A Deeper Secret Revealed
In telling me the truth, Noah inadvertently revealed a deeper secret. Because of what Noah told me, I realized something far more sinister was at play. I understood the full extent of Maddie's deception and, more chillingly, Dexter's involvement in something that went way beyond a simple affair. I knew too much. And because I knew the truth, Dexter killed me. As a police officer, he had the perfect cover-up. No one would suspect him.


Chapter 4: Hope's Tragic Connection
And no one did suspect him until Hope knew everything but she didn’t wanna believe it. Hope loved the back stories so sad. She grew up poor without a mother father very disturbed live in an orphanage all of our life foster home to foster home till she turned 13 was adopted by Lily and James. They were the only thing she had. They were the closest thing she had to mother and father. She was a baby when her mother and father died, so she always found comfort in Dexter in high school. They were both very smart, graduated at a young age. They are planning to just be the perfect couple to make up for all the years that were perfect, but Dexter knew Hope knew and he had no choice. My death was a sad story. Hope's life was just down down and then up.



Chapter 5: Unraveling the Truth
Then Noah and Kenzie put all their pieces together. They found my diary. The last time I wrote it was Saturday morning before I was dead. I knew I was going to die. I wrote letters and I said that I love them and I told them who it was, how it happened, because Dexter wanted to plan out this way. He made me write and write so that there’d still be a piece of me with Kenzie and Noah so they’d always feel like that they could’ve saved me. I love you, Kenzie, and I just wish it didn’t have to end like this, but Noah and Kenzie were back together. Maddie and Dexter were both in jail. I was dead, but let it be known Saturday
 will never be the same again.

Ok, so it’s normally hard for non-profits to promote their events. They often don’t have the money big business has or the cool influencers to pitch their “products” as everyone doom scrolls through social media. So, I tried to make a funny video to help spread the word about **The Great Chase**, a citywide scavenger hunt happening now through **Baltimore Main Streets** — a nonprofit that supports small businesses and local neighborhoods across Baltimore.

**Why it matters:** Main Streets Baltimore works with communities like Highlandtown, Hamilton-Lauraville, Pigtown, Waverly, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Belair-Edison to revitalize business corridors, support local artists, host events, and preserve the soul of our city. 

Participating in this scavenger hunt helps highlight these neighborhoods — and brings more attention (and dollars) to the places that make Baltimore, Baltimore. Not just the “typical” go to spots of Fed Hill and Fells (although, they are also a part of the program).

**How it works:**

1️⃣ Sign up for the passport book using the 🗺️ [**Great Chase Sign Up**](https://baltimore.brightrtravel.com/passports/baltimore-city-scavenger-hunt) link up in our profile 

2️⃣ Visit as many landmarks on the passport as you want before June 30th

3️⃣ Take selfies at any of the landmarks then upload your pic to the passport page to prove you were there. 

👉 Each selfie = 1 entry.

👉 There’s no need to visit them all — but every stop you make increases your chances of winning and spotlights another community.

**Landmarks include:**

📍 Billie Holiday mural on Pennsylvania Ave 📍 The Highlandtown Bus Stop Bench 📍 Waverly Farmers Market 📍 Hamilton Gallery 📍 Pigtown’s Racing Pig mural 📍 Zeke’s Coffee 📍 Belair-Edison murals 📍 And more…(all on the website)

**Prizes (donated by area businesses):**

🏨 A one-night stay at the Sagamore Pendry

🍽️ Dinner & breakfast for two

🎟️ Two tickets to a local event of your choice

🚗 Lyft gift card

🛍️ Small biz shopping spree

🎁 A local gift basket

**Why do it?** If you’re already out and about, why not turn your walk into a chance to win a luxury staycation? It’s also a great way for people new to the city to learn more about Baltimore. It's Baltimore’s way of showing off her good side — and yeah, she has a great one.

In the comments, let folks know your favorite restaurants, bars, and/or shops in each Main Street. It help others find cool spots too. Go Baltimore! Enjoy the chase!

I’m very new to disc golf and have only been playing for about 1.5-2 months. I’ve definitely improved a lot but I’m trying to work on getting more distance.

I’m currently sitting around 230-250ish on my midrange shots and maybe about 270ish for my drivers. I’ve topped out at around 310-320 but I can never consistently throw around 300. 

When I’m trying to go for longer shots, I’ve noticed that a lot of my discs will release on a hyzer angle and not flat. This problem is much more apparent when I’m throwing an over stable disc. I’ve tried standing more straight up and this helps sometimes, but once I start going for more power this issue returns. 

Lastly, I’ve also noticed that when I throw a shot that I FEEL like has a ton of power, it usually goes so nose up that I can’t get that big distance. I’ve been doing the “pour the coffee” to help with nose angle and it definitely helps on less powerful shots. 

I’ve attached a video of my form currently that I took today in a field. The shot went about 275ish with a stable driver 

If anyone has any advice for helping me not only generate more power/distance, but also being more consistent, that would greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Or that it was full of damn zombies.,"Bright fluorescents blinded me as they yanked the bag off my head, suddenly lighting up my world that had been dark for hours now. I was sat at a long conference table, the agents who had just taken the bag were withdrawing back to the wall behind me. At the other end of the long, heavy wooden table was an older man.

“Sorry about the shady spy stuff. Can’t have anyone knowing where we operate, y’know.” the older man chuckled. “Can I get you anything to drink? Coffee, tea, water?”

My thoughts were racing. Everything about the past day wasn’t making any damn sense. I was in my cell just a while ago, minding my own damn business, doing some reading, then suddenly the guards come in, throw a sack over my head, and we’re on our way. Then this bastard is the one to greet me…

“Where the hell am I, man?” I asked, unsure of what was going on. 

“Ah, sorry, introductions.” He said, waving a hand. “Name’s Ronald, I’m… well, I’m kind of the guy in charge here. And you’re Vincent! I’ve read your file, great thief, whistleblower for some really messed up stuff the Avarice corporation was doing, probably still is, but that’s for another time. You’ve got a life sentence for trying to help people, am I right?”

I blinked at him.

“See, I think you shouldn’t be punished for trying to help. Unfortunately though I can only pull so many strings before the government is knocking at my door, so, I need to have some help. You’re going to help me, Vincent.” He continued. “You ever wondered if we’re alone in this world?”

“I’ve hoped.” I mumbled back. Feels like there’s going to be a hidden camera reveal any second, some dumbass comedian coming out to tell me I’ve been pranked. No such luck.

“Well, we’re not. The only thing is that it’s not really this world, but another one almost exactly like it. Thousands of them, actually. Each one living out their own existence, unbothered by what’s going on in ours.” He said, motioning to someone outside the door behind him. A woman comes in holding a tray with two coffees, one of which she sets in front of me, the other in front of him. He nods in thanks before continuing, “Now, one of these worlds managed to make a huge breakthrough. Unfortunately, they were beset by some… apocalyptic situations. Now, the breakthrough they’ve made is useless to them, but could end up changing everything if we get hold of it. Are you following me so far?”

“So… what is it that they found out?” I asked.

“Classified. We need your help to retrieve it though.” He said, staring at me as he sipped his coffee.

“If I don’t know what it is how the hell am I supposed to retrieve it?” I almost laughed here. Must have died in my sleep back in the prison. Maybe Avarice finally sent someone to make sure I stop talking about them forever. Jesus…. If this is heaven it’s an absolute joke.

“Oh we’ll give you all the information you need to find it, of course. We’ll also be sending a team with you in order to get it. Highly trained personnel of our own, of course.” He replied. “Do you think we expect you to do this for free? We’re willing to offer you quite a bit.” 

“I’m listening.” Might as well play along. He’s going to offer me a pardon, freedom, typical movie cliches, but he and I both know that as soon as I’m out, Avarice is putting a bullet in my head.

“You get to die.” He said now, making me almost spit out the sip of coffee I was going for. He laughed in response, raising a hand, “In the public eye, at least. We’ll have you ‘killed’ while in prison and get you a new identity. We’re also willing to cover any living expenses you may incur and give a monthly stipend for your services for the rest of your life, so long as you let us keep an eye on you to ensure you’re not… oversharing with anyone.”

I took a moment, considering what he was saying. It wasn’t like they were going to let me out anytime soon, and even if they did, it’s not like Avarice was going to just let me live my life in peace after all was said and done.

A deep sigh was all I could manage, “Fine. When do we leave?”

“Two hours. Do you want to eat first? We can get you anything you want.” He replied, smiling and drumming on the table for a moment before getting up. “Can you guys let him loose? There’s no reason to keep him locked up.”

“Long as the food’s free, I guess…” I sighed. About thirty minutes later someone came walking in with a tray, a huge double cheeseburger with pepperjack and onion rings loaded on it and an order of fries, accompanied by a caramel milkshake sitting on it. Considering I didn’t know what’s about to happen, I’m going to take what I can get.

The rest of the time passed quickly, but I finished my food and started to nervously pace before they came to collect me, providing new clothes and a backpack of some basic supplies I requested. Before I knew it, I was being marched through the dim lights of this facility, finally stopping in front of what appeared to be an empty doorway. Five others were waiting, guns slung over their shoulders and combat gear on.

“Hey, shouldn’t I get one of those too?” I asked the guide who had brought me here. He only nodded, handing me a pistol. I looked at it, ejecting the magazine to make sure it was full before replacing it once more. “That’s it? They’ve got fuckin’ assault rifles, dude.”

“Let us handle the shooting.” One of the guys said. He looked rough, a huge scar running down his forehead, through his eye and onto his left cheek. “You just make sure we can get what we need.”

“Still barely even know what the hell we need…” I grumbled. Suddenly a loud, mechanical whirring began though, and the doorway in front of us was no longer empty. There was a faint purple light coming from it, with darkness beyond. 

“Jump is open. Let’s head in. You-” Another of the soldiers was speaking, now pointing to me. He had a huge bushy beard and sunglasses over his eyes, but I could still feel him staring me down. “Stay in the middle of us at all times.”

I nod, moving further towards the center of the group. Beard and Scarface moved in front of me, stepping through the doorway with a slight buzzing sound as they passed through the dim purple light. The other three lined up behind me, motioning me forward. Before I went through, the guide who brought me handed me an earpiece, motioning for me to put it in.

“Uh, can you hear me?” I say, settling the piece into my ear. All five of the others grunt acknowledgement. 

“Now come through.” I hear Beard say in my ear. Deep breaths, moving through the doorway feels like I’m stepping through a field of static as it engulfs me. My breath catches for a moment, unsure of what I might be getting into, then suddenly I’m clear again. Beard and Scar are waiting there, the dark hallway engulfing them. As they each turn on a flashlight, I can see that this resembles the building we just came out of. The others follow behind me after a moment, stepping forward into the darkness and turning on their own lights. I fumble around in my bag, finally grabbing onto a small, tactical beam of my own to light my way.

We walked through the hallway briefly, darkness almost suffocating on every side. Beard finally raised a hand, motioning for everyone to stop where they were at the moment. We must have been near an exit, because sounds began to make their way towards us, and after a moment, the smell hit along with it.

It was like the worst rot imaginable, everywhere all at once as it filled my nostrils and made my eyes water. I’ve gotten whiffs of some nasty shit in my lifetime but this… god it was like someone took a deep freezer of meat and put it out in the Florida sun for a week unplugged. It was almost painful to smell, and it was unavoidable. I searched deep in my bag, looking for anything I could rip up and stuff up my nostrils. Nothing I had asked for in prep was going to cover this though. God, what the fuck was it that could smell this bad from inside a building? Was it in here? Outside? Was that what we were supposed to be worried about while we’re over here?

“Damn Simms, your mom open her legs again?” One of the soldiers quipped at another, causing the rest to snort with laughter. Simmons, a younger guy with greying stubble, rolled his eyes in the dim light. 

“Your mom ever shut hers, Pierce?” Simmons shot back, making the others nearly lose it. I… couldn’t find the humor considering how overpowering the smell was.

“Alright, alright,” Scar said, raising a hand. He put his pack on the ground, pulling out a map. We were in a small city, not sure what state, but the point Scar marked was right in the middle, surrounded by small outlines of other buildings. He traced a line down the street, turning right three blocks down, and continuing on for about five blocks before marking another building with a massive X. “We’ve gotta make it eight blocks total before we hit our target area. It’s not likely to be a simple walk, so be ready to take care of any threats along the way. Now, I know all of you can smell that out there. That’s what we need to be on our guard against.”

”The hell is out there?” I asked, looking each of them in the eyes in turn. “At least tell me they gave all of you more information on what we were getting into.”

”Fuckin’ zombies, man.” Simmons muttered.

”Seriously? Zombies? Some George Romero bullshit is what’s waiting out there for us?” I asked. When Ronald told me there was danger to the mission I expected like… I don’t know, enemy soldiers or just booby-trapped buildings or something. Jesus…

”The goddamn walkin’ dead, brother.” Pierce mumbled back. 

“Look, it sounds insane but all the zombie rules apply here- don’t get bit, don’t get scratched, aim for the head, and whatever you do- don’t. Get. Bit. Moment I see one of you take a chomp off one of these bastards, I’m putting a bullet in your head. Consider it mercy.” Beard said, deadly serious as he went over the threat awaiting us.

”So what do we do once we reach the target building?” Pierce asked the commander.

”Mr. Mills here,” Scar pointed at me now, “Is going to get into the computer system for us. Place is still running on backup gens, so we’ll have to force our way in through the system. Normally I would say we could just blow our way through with enough explosives but… well, they have failsafes on the lab area that would destroy what we’re after if someone gets too close.”

“We’ll make sure you’re not eaten while you get us in there. Once we’re in though, we grab the target, duck out of the building, and head here-“ Beard points to another X on the map, not far from the target destination, “They’ll have an extraction portal set up for us to jump right through. Let’s make it out of this one alive and get home, understood?”

”Sir!” The others confirmed. I gave my own affirmation, slinging the pack back over my shoulder, hefting the gun in one hand and the flashlight in my other. We continued down the hallway, the sounds from outside growing louder now. Groans, moans, and the occasional scream split the air, telling me that nothing good was waiting for us out there.

Beard opened the door, giving a signal for everyone to move, and we all filed out one by one, unsure of what would be waiting for us out there. The first thing I noticed was the light. It was dark out, not a star in sight, and only the occasional street light was still running to show the way. The sky above had an odd tint to it though, almost scarlet like it was smeared with blood. Ominous clouds moved across occasionally, dark and looking like they were going to burst with crimson rain at the slightest provocation. 

“Stay frosty,” Scar mentioned as we turned, walking down the street. Buildings towered over us on each side, probably ten floors at their tallest, and on occasion a scream of pain and terror would break through the still night air. Somewhere in the distance a fire was glowing, sending up smoke with a smell that would occasionally cut through the stench of rot that filled my nostrils. 

We moved in silence, the smell doing everything it could to choke us. Even when I wanted to open my mouth and say something, the stench forced its way in, settling on my tongue, making me gag within seconds. Before long, we had gone one block, with the rest of the way seeming like miles and miles before us.

”Hello?” A voice came from an alleyway nearby as we passed. “Help me, please.”

”Don’t even think about it.” Beard whispered to the rest of us. We all froze, looking at the alleyway as something moved deep in the darkness. A trash can fell over, louder than thunder as it clattered to the pavement nearby. A small figure walked out, shadows obscuring their entire body as they neared us. ”Don’t trust it.”

”It could be someone living, though.” The fifth soldier mentioned. He didn’t look nearly as battle-hardened as the others, and took a slight step towards the alleyway even as Beard was motioning for him to get the hell back. “We have to help them, right?”

”Step. Back.” Scar muttered as he tried moving forward again. The shadowy figure coming towards us couldn’t be older than a child. Maybe four and a half feet tall, thin and frail looking. As it stepped closer out of the alley the shadows around it began to dissipate, moving towards the young soldier. 

I almost threw up right then and there on the street. It was… it was definitely a kid. Or at least, it was at one time. Now though it was something not quite dead, but not necessarily alive either. The skin was mottled, a sickly, pale white with the same odd sheen as a dead body. That itself wouldn’t have been so bad, but the real horror was the lower jaw and upper body. It’s mouth was hanging wide open, but the lower jaw was split open at the chin, teeth inverting inward like pincers as the maw extended further down, opening into the thing’s neck. Whatever bone it had in there now looked like jagged teeth. It stepped forward, taking the young soldier by surprise and falling on him, jagged teeth from the mouth down to his chest cavity suddenly emerging to tear into his skin.

”So hungry…” It moaned while taking a huge chunk out of the soldier. The rest of us froze in fear as it reared back, getting ready to take another huge bite as massive pincers emerged from the split as it opened up its chest, rib bones extending out to stab into the soldier’s body. Before it was able to, there was a soft pop as Beard emptied a round into the thing’s forehead, leaving behind a crimson dot as it fell over, hopefully dead for real this time. 

“Fucking hell…” Scar muttered, moving towards the young soldier still writhing on the ground. His neck was torn by one of the big pincers, so he couldn’t force air through his windpipe for a scream. Just labored wheezing, desperate to try and live. Scar gave him one brief look before popping a round into his head, ending his misery. “Sorry, kid.”

Screams rose up all around in response to the sounds of our skirmish, more of these things sensing a meal moving around in their turf. Within seconds, we could hear the sounds of rough footsteps, ragged breathing, and the occasional gurgling scream running towards us for their next meal
.
”There’s a grocery store we can cut through right over there. Go, go!” Beard shouted, moving us all towards a supermarket on the corner, maybe a block ahead of where we needed to turn. Guess it was luck that the doors were unlocked… I stopped thinking we were lucky once we got inside.

I don’t know how long this place had been going to hell for, but it was long enough for everything left in this supermarket to become a health hazard. Dry goods and most of the stuff on the general shelves were okay, but the smell of rotting meat and produce was heavy in the air. Even worse, we couldn’t go more than a few feet without an insane amount of flies buzzing all around, making it hard to breathe in the already thick stench of the rot. I zipped my jacket up all the way, sticking the collar over my face. The air was hot and heavier this way, but it was better than taking a ton of flies directly into my lungs as we walked. 

“We need to go through the back. There should be a loading dock that will let us out onto the next street.” Pierce said, scanning the store with his flashlight. Empty registers still had items on them, abandoned midway through checkout. Only the occasional light was on, casting a dim glow over every fifth aisle or so as they flickered. I don’t know what happened here, but the scene that was left only told us that it was gruesome. Puddles of blood lined the small aisle in front of the registers, smeared as whatever had left them behind must have gotten up to leave after being turned.

Our footsteps echoed as we walked, the occasional squeak on the floor nearly making me jump out of my damn skin. After everything that I had just seen, I was ready to make my way back to the damn door we came through and spend the rest of my days in a cell. Fuck this.

“Shh.” Beard raised a hand, motioning for all of us to stop right then and there. I could hear something moving now despite our stillness, something else over the steady buzz of flies in the air. We moved our flashlights around, the bugs only making intense shadows across every aisle and wall in sight as we tried to tell if we were alone. There was something scraping along, sliding on the ground with the occasional squeak as it went over puddles of blood on the floor. 

“The fuck is that?” Simmons whispered as we all shone our flashlights around, trying to tell what the hell was coming towards us. In moments I had the answer. Coming from an aisle only a few feet to my right, something was crawling along the ground. Pale alabaster skin shining in the flashlight beam, red smeared on it from passing through puddles of blood… it wasn’t just one of the things, but many fused together. It was like they got pushed in too close together and instead of just crushing each other started to meld on a cellular level, dead flesh absorbing more and more of their peers. 

Three heads looked at me, lifeless, gray eyes staring straight through my soul in the flashlight beam. Each one suddenly opened their mouth, split lower jaw a wide maw with sharp teeth clamoring out as if. they were each alive looking for something new to devour, and let out a horrible scream. I… I don’t know if their windpipes were fused as well, but it was so discordant that it sounded like someone blowing on a bagpipe without any sense of knowing how to play. It chilled me down to my core as it started crawling faster, masses of legs and arms fused at joints where they shouldn’t be rushing towards us in a mad frenzy.

“Run!” Beard shouted, taking off towards the back of the store as we all rushed to follow. The mass of bodies let out another discordant scream as it gave chase, desperate to catch fresh prey. As we passed the meat coolers, full of flies, maggots, and rotten cuts of beef or pork or whatever they had been, this thing burst through the aisles behind, gaining on us like a bat out of hell. I don’t know how it was so fast when it looked like a mangled mass of limbs, but it was getting closer. Too close.

”In here!” Pierce shouted, motioning towards one of the swinging doors to the stock room. We rushed through, Pierce holding the door open until everyone got in. As he let it swing back closed, it hit the abomination, causing it to let out a grunt of pain from every mouth. Before Pierce could follow behind us though, it pushed through, rearing back for only a moment as the door opened before shooting out a long, spiked tongue that wrapped around his foot.

”Pierce!” Simmons shouted, starting to go back for him before Scar grabbed his shoulder, turning him back. There was an emergency exit door ahead, out salvation to get out of this hellish place. We had to move though. Before any of us could do anything, Pierce looked back, nearly emptying his clip into the creature that still had a grasp on him. More long tongues shot out from the other mouths on it, wrapping around his body as their spikes stuck into his flesh. Before it was able to reel him in, he grabbed the pistol on his hip, putting the barrel to his head and pulling the trigger. His body went limp as the thing staggered forward, throwing itself on top of him and starting to devour his remains. 

“Come on, out here!” Beard shouted, opening the emergency door for the rest of us. As soon as we were through he shut it back, grabbing a nearby dumpster and pulling it over the doorway, keeping that thing inside where it couldn’t come after us.

”Thought you said it was just fucking zombies?!” I shouted at him, falling back against the store wall. We were in a back alley, wider than the others, right next to a small loading dock where trucks could pull in. “That’s not a fuckin’ zombie, man!”

”I don’t know what the hell that was, I’m going off the briefing they gave me…” He responded, almost out of breath. “Doesn’t matter though. We’re here now, we can give Ronald an ass kicking when we get back. But we HAVE to make it back, first.”

The three of us left could only grumble in agreement. Scar and Simmons looked pissed, and I can’t say I blame them. When it comes down to it though, we only have one way out of here. 

“Fine. Let’s keep moving.” Scar mumbled.

We kept going, moving as quickly as possible through the alley and onto the street now, traversing the last few blocks toward the building that was our target. With any luck, we could get in and get out. Luck wasn’t going to be on our side [though](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/gPxFuXq60s).

It is insanity to do the same thing over and over again, and still remain hopeful. 

I matched with a guy, we connected, he is into philosophy and seemed fun. 
We meet for a coffee.
Oh boy. 
I mean, I understand that we all can be a bit nervous when meeting a new person. 
But the guy literally started doing the macho act from the go. Condescending “sweethearts” and “honeys”. 
I’m 34 ffs and he’s like three years younger than me?
I am somewhat bubbly, especially when nervous, but I was hoping for a fun conversation, not an hour long macho posing and talks about how hard his life is, and how he was born to suffer, yet he persists despite life being a shit pit. 
I mean, I’ve been depressed most of my life. I know that life is not a walk in a park. 
He kept going and going, I don’t think he could stop even if he wanted to. 

Finally, I said - so, have you ever thought about therapy maybe? It helped me, you know.
And he goes - I don’t believe in therapy. 
“Honey, you need to know yourself and study philosophy, and that’s it. It has all the answers”.

Then he puts out his cigarette with his fingers, and says it’s okay because he doesn’t feel pain there. 
I don’t want to be in this hostage situation anymore, but I’m too much of a pushover. And I’m kinda worried about the guy.   
I can’t keep my face from dropping, I get flashbacks to my teenage years and my “edgy” friends. He sees that I’m upset and gets even more moody. 
Luckily someone calls him. He says he can stay for some more time, I say if duty calls he better go (please, go). 
He gets even moodier. 
Out of nowhere he blurts out that he makes a lot of money. 
I say, oh that’s nice. 
We sit there in silence. 

I guess it’s not that bad being single.

**What I'm looking for:**

* Ethiopian collaborators who want to create content together.
* People interested in the tech/startup space (coding skills are a huge plus!).
* Genuine interest in building something meaningful.

**What I'm thinking:**

* Document the ups and downs of building something from scratch.
* Share different perspectives and experiences.
* Create engaging and informative content that actually matters.
* Equity based compensation for true partners (no cash upfront, but real ownership if we build something together).

If you're Ethiopian, based in Edmonton (or willing to meet up regularly), and interested in the tech/startup space, let's grab coffee, talk and see if we vibe. Drop a comment or DM me.

1l1pemf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FatTrips/comments/1l1pemf/amanoi_price_inconsistency/,Amanoi price inconsistency,"So i saw some price inconsistencies in the way amanoi structured their price. It seemed to be they are not frank about their price. Also, everytime we ask about a service we need, there were always a price for it ( which we are happy to pay), but is there a price disclosure? A way they calculating it? It’s just seem very scammy and “organized crime” skill. A business model where i feel like a big name resort should not have.

1) room price

I contacted Amanoi via phone to ask about stairs and steps ( because my grandma is old and cant walk much) and also whether a 4 or 5 bd residence would be better suited for us. Amanoi asked whether we are Vietnamese and I said yes we are. They said they had special price for vietnamese residence that is much cheaper than on the website that they can email me. 

The price they emailed me was $500 cheaper than disclosed price on the website for the 5 bd and the 4 bd residence is $1273 cheaper.

2) food

Ok good deal for just supporting your own country’s most luxurious resort- i think to myself. I then asked them: 

“ so the trip is for my birthday. I’ve been living oversea for a long time, i haven’t seen my family for years. So we would want an intimate family dinner at the dining pavilion in our residence. Because of our family dietary restrictions, we will be bringing our own food and just need help from our butler to set up the table and heat up the food if needed”

The email is all in Vietnamese i should say.

They replied back that they’d do that but with 500.000vnd per person. If you want us to decorate, that’d be extra fees. 

This struck me because I thought, with every other aman property, you pay the high price for the services. You go in there, and no matter what you need, and if it’s not overly ridiculous, those service should not be a fee and should not be a charge to the customers. Even if it is a charge, there should be a price disclosing on some big kind of documents that i can access from the website. Like a link to see more under “ more information” or “ disclosure”.

They never disclosed this fee publicly. Everything is secretive and if you dont ask, we dont tell. As a contract lawyer practicing in the US, this kind of business really bothers me. 

I was shock to see it at a big international high end luxurious resort like amanoi. I had only saw this type of pricing in Vietnam at a small homestay in a middle of Ha Giang a few years ago when we were having the free breakfast on site and the owner came to ask us if we wanted any drinks. We said coffee and they brought us coffee, did not say anything; waited until we finished and said: “ your coffee is extra charge, it’d be 25.000d”. We did not say anything and paid because it’s only 25.000, it’s ok. But we really don’t like the unprofessional scammy style of the homestay.

Anyways, is it normal everyone for amanoi? Did anybody have the similar experience with amanoi and their price inconsistencies? ",1,1748888354.0,FatTrips,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I use bags, and other time I measure out some looseleaf tea and use a teaball or a strainer.

I usually don't bother with cream or sugar, though if I am having tea in the morning I'll sometimes put in some cream or milk and call it breakfast (I also will sometimes make southern-style sweet tea, but that's a whole 'nother thing).

I drink it throughout the day (though I often drink coffee in the morning instead), and usually just make myself a single cup unless I have company over, and when I do have company over there's no expectation that I'll serve them tea unless I happen to be making some for myself. I have an electric kettle at work and a stovetop kettle at home, and if I'm just making it for myself I brew it right in the cup (I do have a teapot at home for when company's over).

If I'm on the go, I'll sometimes pick up some bottled iced tea, or maybe stop by a cafe or boba-tea place, depending on where I'm going from.

I drink more tea than most Americans, but I'm hardly the only American who drinks tea. Some of my countrymen will do things I find abhorrent (like microwave it!), but I'm sure there are people who would find my own preparations intolerable.

I understand that there's a very different tea culture in China, including specific traditions and ceremonies. What I'm curious about here is: how much of that tradition effects the daily techniques you use, when you don't want to do historical reenactment and just want some tea.

# India: A Monsoon Marvel

India’s monsoon season, spanning from June to September, is nothing short of magical. The rains awaken the country’s diverse landscapes, turning hills, forests, and plains into emerald wonderlands. Beyond the stunning greenery, the monsoon brings cultural vibrancy, with festivals like Teej and Raksha Bandhan adding color to the season. For those seeking relaxation, Ayurvedic retreats thrive in the rainy weather, offering rejuvenating spa treatments. Top destinations include Munnar in Kerala, where rolling tea plantations and misty peaks create a dreamlike atmosphere, and Cherrapunji in Meghalaya, famous for its dramatic waterfalls and living root bridges. Goa, often associated with beaches, reveals a different side with its lush spice plantations and the majestic Dudhsagar Falls. For adventurous souls, the Mumbai to Goa (NH66) drive offers coastal views and green hills, while the Bangalore to Coorg route winds through coffee plantations and misty valleys. However, travelers should pack waterproof gear, monitor weather reports for heavy rain, and avoid street food to stay healthy. Foreign tourists must carry a valid passport, Indian visa, and travel insurance. As for cuisine, nothing beats the comfort of crispy pakoras with hot chai, or the hearty Dal Baati Churma from Rajasthan.

# India: Mumbai to Goa (NH66)

In India, the Mumbai to Goa (NH66) route is a dreamy journey along the coast, with the Arabian Sea on one side and verdant hills on the other. The rain transforms the landscape into a lush paradise, where waterfalls tumble down cliffs and the ocean mist adds a touch of romance. As you drive, you’ll pass quaint villages and spice-scented breezes, making it an unforgettable experience.

# Thailand: Rainy Season Serenity

From June to October, Thailand’s monsoon season brings refreshing showers and a sense of tranquility. The rainforests and national parks burst with life, making it a paradise for nature lovers. Festivals like Buddhist Lent and the Vegetarian Festival offer a glimpse into the country’s rich traditions, while resorts and spas provide affordable luxury during this off-peak season. Chiang Mai, with its misty mountains and ancient temples, is a must-visit, as is Koh Samui, where quieter beaches and lush interiors await. For wildlife enthusiasts, Khao Yai National Park offers waterfalls and rare animal sightings. The drive from Chiang Mai to Pai is a scenic journey through winding mountain roads, while the Bangkok to Hua Hin route showcases coastal views and pineapple farms. Travelers should avoid flood-prone coastal areas, pack a poncho, and stay updated on weather advisories. Essential documents include a passport, Thai visa (e-Visa or visa on arrival for eligible countries), and travel insurance. When it comes to food, the spicy warmth of Tom Yum Goong soup and the comfort of Pad Thai are perfect for rainy days, while Mango Sticky Rice offers a sweet escape.

# Costa Rica: Green Season Adventures

Costa Rica’s “green season,” from May to November, is a haven for adventure seekers and eco-tourists. The rainforests teem with biodiversity, and the season is perfect for thrilling activities like white-water rafting and zip-lining. Sustainable lodges and tours make it easy to explore the country’s natural wonders responsibly. Monteverde Cloud Forest, with its mist-shrouded trails and rare wildlife, is a highlight, while Arenal Volcano offers hot springs and lush landscapes. Manuel Antonio National Park combines rainforest beauty with playful monkeys and stunning beaches. For scenic drives, the route from San José to Monteverde offers breathtaking mountain views, and the La Fortuna to Arenal drive showcases lush valleys and volcano vistas. Travelers should use insect repellent, pack waterproof hiking boots, and check road conditions for potential mudslides. A valid passport and travel insurance are essential, and an international driving permit is recommended for those planning to rent a car. Costa Rican cuisine shines with hearty dishes like Gallo Pinto (spiced rice and beans) and Casado (a meal of meat, plantains, and salad), while Sopa Negra (black bean soup) provides comfort on rainy days.

# Vietnam: Monsoon Magic

Vietnam’s monsoon season, from May to October, offers a dramatic backdrop for travelers seeking authenticity and beauty. The rain enhances the country’s rice terraces and karst mountains, creating postcard-worthy scenes. With fewer tourists, you can immerse yourself in traditional villages and bustling markets. Budget travelers will appreciate the lower prices for accommodations and tours. Sapa, with its misty rice terraces and hill tribe culture, is a must-see, while Ha Long Bay offers a surreal cruise through rain-kissed limestone islands. Hoi An, an ancient town with lantern-lit streets, is equally enchanting. The drive from Hanoi to Sapa takes you through mountain passes and terraced fields, while the Hue to Hoi An route offers coastal views and fishing villages. Travelers should avoid flood-prone areas, pack quick-dry clothing, and stay informed about typhoon warnings. A valid passport, Vietnamese visa (e-Visa or visa on arrival), and travel insurance are necessary. For food, the iconic Pho noodle soup with fresh herbs is a rainy-day delight, while Banh Mi sandwiches and Goi Cuon spring rolls offer quick, flavorful bites.

The Kathmandu Valley, with its ancient temples and bustling markets, is a cultural gem. For scenic drives, the Kathmandu to Pokhara route offers mountain views, while the short trip from Pokhara to Sarangkot provides panoramic vistas. Travelers should avoid trekking in heavy rain, pack waterproof gear, and check for landslide alerts. A valid passport, Nepalese visa (visa on arrival available), and travel insurance are essential.
