Looking for ideas on colours for a sofa, 2 chairs , a rug, and a coffee table in this space. I was thinking a beige couch and maybe some burnt orange chairs? Not really sure what would look good.

1khkt1e,https://i.redd.it/bs15c7fskize1.jpeg,Review #41: Infrequent Flyers Bunnahabhain (Staoisha) 9yo,"**The Maker**

Infrequent Flyers is a range of single malts from the Alistair Walker Whisky Company. Like all other independent bottlers, AWWC sets out to bring customers the very best scotch has to offer, in its most natural state. The pitch from the Infrequent Flyers range, as the name suggests, is to draw attention to some of Scotland‚Äôs lesser known distilleries, or those who are not as commonly available on the general market. Looking through the releases, and there have been well over a hundred by 2025, it seems that this pitch has largely held true with the focus being on blending workhorse distilleries that don‚Äôt often have their own core range. Although there will be plenty of names in there that whisky fans will recognise. I suspect that‚Äôs largely due to the fact that in the current whisky boom there aren‚Äôt that many distilleries that we don‚Äôt see a lot of somewhere.

Alistair Walker himself is someone with a long and successful career in the whisky industry. Beginning in the marketing department of Burn Steward Distillers (owners of distilleries such as Bunnahabhain, Tobermory/[Ledaig](https://bsky.app/profile/welshwhiskynerd.bsky.social/post/3lmqwwqin5s2q), and Deanston) in the 1990s, Walker went on to join the BenRiach Distillery Company that was at the time co-helmed by the famous Billy Walker. Together this team went on to relaunch BenRiach alongside the likes of GlenDronach and Glenglassaugh before Billy Walker departed to work his warehouse raiding magic on [GlenAllachie](https://bsky.app/profile/welshwhiskynerd.bsky.social/post/3lmjjjin4ac2p). Alister Walker, meanwhile, left the company in 2018 and decided to set up as an independent bottler off the back of the strong relationships he had built up over the previous twenty years.

**The Expression**

When trying a new independent bottler it‚Äôs always best to go for what you know. With that in mind Bunnahabhain is a safe bet. [I‚Äôve waxed lyrical about the wonders of Bunna in several reviews](https://bsky.app/profile/welshwhiskynerd.bsky.social/post/3loicf5zbk22f) so I won‚Äôt repeat that here. However, this release had added interest given that it‚Äôs from their Staoisha stable (sometimes confusingly also referred to as [Moine](https://x.com/TTWhiskyReviews/status/1800875097659711684)) which means that it‚Äôs peated. Very little of Bunna‚Äôs general output is peated ‚Äì although it seems to be on the rise ‚Äì with the bulk focusing on heavily sherried unpeated malt. As such this adds an additional uniqueness and fits with the Infrequent Flyers ethos.

Distilled in 2013, the spirit spent nine years in a single Pedro Ximenez puncheon. Puncheons are slightly smaller than Butts, coming in at 450-500 litres. It was bottled in May 2023, where the puncheon yielded 691 bottles at a healthy cask strength of 55.7%. As you‚Äôd expect from such a release its all natural colour and has not been chill-filtered. It is release number 122 in the Infrequent Flyers series and is currently retailing at between ¬£90 and ¬£100. It was a little under ¬£80 ($105US) when I purchased it in December 2023.

**The Neck Pour**

This is so rich and creamy on the nose. I‚Äôm instantly hit by a thick PX sugar syrup. This is followed by a more neutral note of vanilla hand-cream. Finally the ashes of peat-smoke arrive. But there‚Äôs also something else, something richer and more savoury hiding beneath. It sits somewhere between the serial notes of an old hessian sack, and a very fatty pork belly that‚Äôs been dry cured in black pepper and star anise.

The flavour, in contrast, is muted at first. Initially it‚Äôs dominated by a luxurious texture of melted chocolate that‚Äôs quickly followed up by a moderate peat-smoke. Only on the second or third sip does the sweetness of the PX come through. Yet once it‚Äôs there it‚Äôs strong. Once these combine it‚Äôs reminiscent of the best cr√®me brulee crust you‚Äôve ever had. This continues into a long finish which ends with a slight bitterness that is very moreish.

By the time the first dram is done, I‚Äôm struck by how well-integrated this whisky is. The peat and PX are never in conflict and thus don‚Äôt overpower one another. This works to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts. I think this might be a very enjoyable bottle ahead.

**The Body**

The bottle has been open for around nine months now and the ashy, peat note is only getting stronger on the nose. As it opens up I‚Äôm now getting more in terms of tobacco leaf, polish and leather alongside coffee and chocolate. It‚Äôs a bit like a library at an old gentleman‚Äôs club.

On the palette the heavy peat is still dominant but is followed by deep dark muscovado sugars. Then the thick PX syrup comes back before the finish is again that PX united with a big bonfire. In short it‚Äôs very nice, and as it opens up it‚Äôs giving more without breaking the harmony between the sweetness and smoke.

**Final Thoughts**

This bottle has been great over the last 18 months. It‚Äôs at least the eighth or ninth of the Infrequent Flyers range I‚Äôve tried and they have all been to a high standard. For me what works best is how despite having a great depth of flavour, it‚Äôs that those flavours never seem to compete with one another, meaning that the profile is consistent and harmonious. This isn‚Äôt always the case with a peated Bunna, as[ I found with a recent Thomson Bros release](https://x.com/TTWhiskyReviews/status/1800875097659711684) that ended up being a little challenging at times.

Yet the overall profile lacks the subtlety and refinement of the core range‚Äôs [Bunna 18](https://bsky.app/profile/welshwhiskynerd.bsky.social/post/3loicf5zbk22f) (for me still the best Bunnahabhain have), but that kind of refinement is what comes with age, and simply wont be there in something that is under a decade old. If you can still get hold of this where you are, don‚Äôt miss out on the opportunity.

Die Philips CSA210/60 Senseo Original Plus Kaffeepadmaschine ist ein wirklich durchdachtes Ger√§t in modernem, mattschwarzem Design. Die kompakte Bauweise mit den Abmessungen 31,5 x 21,3 x 33 cm f√ºgt sich perfekt in jede K√ºche ein, ohne unn√∂tig Platz wegzunehmen. Das Leichtgewicht von nur 1,67 Kilogramm sorgt au√üerdem daf√ºr, dass man sie bei Bedarf problemlos verschieben kann. Eine Besonderheit ist das nachhaltige Design: Durch die Verwendung von 28 Prozent recyceltem Kunststoff und einen um 45 Prozent reduzierten Energieverbrauch zeigt die Maschine, dass umweltfreundlicher Genuss m√∂glich ist. Die robuste Verarbeitung und die Langlebigkeit, die durch mehr als 10.000 Testl√§ufe gepr√ºft wurde, verleihen dem Ger√§t eine bemerkenswerte Qualit√§t, die es f√ºr den t√§glichen Gebrauch pr√§destiniert.  

**Vorteilhafte Funktionen**  
Diese kleine Kaffeemaschine beeindruckt mit durchdachten Features, die weit √ºber das √ºbliche Ma√ü hinausgehen:  
- Die intuitive Kaffeest√§rkewahl passt jeden Kaffee individuell an und bietet die Wahl zwischen mild und kr√§ftig.  
- Dank der Coffee Boost Technologie mit 45 Aromad√ºsen wird das hei√üe Wasser gleichm√§√üig √ºber das Pad verteilt, was zu einem intensiveren Geschmackserlebnis f√ºhrt.  
- Die Zwei-Tassen-Funktion erm√∂glicht es, blitzschnell zwei Kaffees gleichzeitig zuzubereiten ‚Äì ideal f√ºr G√§ste oder den gemeinsamen Kaffeegenuss.  

[Schon den Preis von Philips CSA210/60 bei Amazon gesehen? Klick hier.](https://kaffeechef.de/p/b08z4cmjyh/)  

**Performance und Bedienung**  
Aufheizen in weniger als einer Minute? Das kann kaum eine andere Maschine. Der 0,7-Liter-Wassertank reicht f√ºr mehrere Tassen ohne st√§ndige Nachf√ºllpausen, w√§hrend die einfache Bedienung ein echtes Plus darstellt. Selbst f√ºr Personen, die technikscheu sind, bietet diese Maschine ein unkompliziertes Benutzererlebnis. Die Reinigung ist ein Kinderspiel, da alles leicht zug√§nglich und durchdacht gestaltet wurde. Ob mild oder kr√§ftig, die Qualit√§t des Kaffees bleibt immer √ºberzeugend konstant.

**H√∂hepunkte**  
Was mich wirklich begeistert hat, waren:  
- Die samtige Crema in jedem Kaffee, die Crema Plus liefert ‚Äì sie sieht nicht nur gut aus, sondern schmeckt auch fantastisch.  
- Die automatische Entkalkungserinnerung ‚Äì ein sehr hilfreiches Feature, um die Langlebigkeit des Ger√§ts zu garantieren und dennoch den Geschmack zu erhalten.  
- Die Ger√§uschreduzierung w√§hrend des Betriebs ist deutlich sp√ºrbar im Vergleich zu einigen Konkurrenzprodukten.  

**Kleine Nachteile**  
Auch wenn die Philips Senseo Original Plus in vielen Punkten gl√§nzt, gibt es kleinere Schw√§chen:  
- Der Wassertank ist etwas klein bemessen, wenn man viele G√§ste hat oder den ganzen Tag √ºber Kaffee trinkt.  
- Manchmal ben√∂tigt die Maschine etwas mehr Zeit als erwartet, um die automatische Entkalkung anzusto√üen ‚Äì das k√∂nnte optimiert werden.  

**Alternative Produkte**  
Im Vergleich zu bekannten Wettbewerbern wie der Nespresso Pixie oder der Tchibo Cafissimo Compact schl√§gt sich die Philips Senseo Original Plus wacker. W√§hrend Tchibo mit einer gr√∂√üeren Vielfalt bei den Kapseln punktet und Nespresso in der Regel mit einem edleren Design √ºberzeugt, kann diese Kaffeepadmaschine vor allem in Sachen Nachhaltigkeit, Einfachheit und Crema punkten. Letztlich h√§ngt die Wahl nat√ºrlich davon ab, was einem pers√∂nlich wichtiger ist ‚Äì Nachhaltigkeit oder Luxusgef√ºhl? F√ºr mich war die Coffee Boost Technologie w√§hrend der Tests unschlagbar.  

**Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis**  
Die Maschine positioniert sich definitiv in der Kategorie ‚ÄûPreis-Wert‚Äú, insbesondere, wenn man die zus√§tzliche Nachhaltigkeit, die intuitive Bedienung und die Kaffeest√§rkeauswahl ber√ºcksichtigt. F√ºr jemanden, der einen einfachen, schnellen und zuverl√§ssigen Kaffee am Morgen zu einem fairen Preis sucht, ist sie ein nahezu perfektes Ger√§t.

However, in the last 2 days I've been getting solitary drips only when using the 2 cup button with the single wall basket. 4/5 drips and then the water cuts off. I've tried adjusting the grind size up 6 notches and the same happens. Even tamped less and put much less coffee in the basket and similar. It then runs a shot a little better after using the 1 cup. I'm baffled, any advice?",1,1746690571.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1khkguv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1khkguv/what_foods_lower_your_blood_sugar/,What foods lower your blood sugar?,"This was one of the first questions I started asking when I found out my A1C was creeping up. I was tired of feeling drained after meals, dealing with cravings at night, and watching my fasting glucose hang around 105‚Äì110 every morning. I didn‚Äôt want to jump straight into medication, so I started by making small changes ‚Äî beginning with food.

Over the last six months, I‚Äôve been on a mission to find out **what foods lower your blood sugar** naturally, and more importantly, what actually works in real life (not just in articles). Along the way, I also started using the **Glyco Boost supplement**, which ended up helping more than I expected.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned ‚Äî food-wise and supplement-wise ‚Äî through a bit of trial and error.

**Foods that consistently helped regulate my blood sugar:**

1. **Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale, Swiss Chard)** Low in carbs, packed with magnesium and fiber ‚Äî they helped stabilize post-meal glucose. I started throwing spinach into everything: eggs, smoothies, soups.
2. **Chia Seeds & Flaxseeds** High in soluble fiber, which slows down digestion and prevents big glucose spikes. Chia pudding became a daily thing for me.
3. **Berries (Blueberries, Raspberries)** Unlike most fruits, berries didn‚Äôt spike my sugar and gave me something sweet to reach for without wrecking my numbers.
4. **Cinnamon** I added Ceylon cinnamon to oatmeal, coffee, and smoothies. It didn‚Äôt lower blood sugar dramatically on its own, but paired with other things, it seemed to help ‚Äî which is why I got interested in supplements that included it (like GlycoBoost).
5. **Beans and Lentils** Slow-digesting carbs with fiber and protein. They kept me full and helped with blood sugar stability when paired with veggies.
6. **Eggs, Avocados, Nuts** Healthy fats and protein = fewer crashes. These were my go-to breakfast staples to avoid mid-morning hunger and sugar dips.

**Where GlycoBoost came in**

While adjusting my diet helped a lot, I was still dealing with random spikes‚Äîespecially when I had even a small amount of refined carbs. That‚Äôs when I started reading up on natural supplements and came across **GlycoBoost**.

After digging through **glyco boost reviews**, I was curious enough to try it ‚Äî mainly because of the blend of ingredients like:

* **Berberine** ‚Äì known to mimic insulin
* **Bitter Melon** ‚Äì supports better glucose control
* **White Mulberry Leaf** ‚Äì slows carb absorption
* **Cinnamon Bark Powder** ‚Äì yes, the same one I had been sprinkling into food
* **Chromium + Biotin** ‚Äì important for metabolism and insulin sensitivity

You can check the full formula breakdown here:  
[**GlycoBoost Ingredient Info & Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JF3QLZ5/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**My experience combining food + GlycoBoost**

**Week 1‚Äì2:**  
No big changes yet, but I appreciated that there were no **glyco boost side effects**. I was still eating clean and walking, but nothing extreme.

**Week 3‚Äì5:**  
Post-meal numbers became more stable. I didn‚Äôt crash after lunch, and my cravings were way lower ‚Äî especially in the evenings.

**Week 6‚Äì8:**  
My fasting blood sugar dropped to the mid-90s consistently. I also lost 5 pounds without trying, which felt like a side bonus.

**Week 9‚Äì12:**  
Final A1C dropped from 5.8% to 5.4%. I credit the combination of dietary changes plus consistent use of GlycoBoost.

**Final thoughts**

Changing what I ate definitely helped me get my blood sugar under control. But I learned that **consistency + support** makes the biggest difference. Adding foods that naturally lower glucose levels was the foundation ‚Äî pairing that with the **glyco boost supplement** made it easier to stick to habits and see actual results in the numbers.

If you're on the same journey, I‚Äôd say start with food, track what works for your body, and don‚Äôt be afraid to try a few safe supplements for support. Just don‚Äôt expect overnight fixes ‚Äî my best results showed up after about 6‚Äì8 weeks of being consistent.

Has anyone else made changes like this and seen results? Would love to hear what foods or supplements worked best for you.",1,1746690329.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

# Luxurious Living: Top Interior Design Ideas to Elevate Your Space

Luxury in interior design transcends mere aesthetics; it embodies a curated experience that evokes comfort, sophistication, and exclusivity. At its core, the essence of luxury is rooted in the quality of materials used within a space.[ **Interior designers in Mumbai** ](https://www.home2decor.com)often emphasize high-end finishes like marble, exotic woods, and artisanal textiles to communicate a sense of wealth and refinement. The tactile experience of these premium materials fosters a connection between the occupant and their surroundings, allowing for an immersive living experience. For instance, plush velvet or soft cashmere not only adds warmth but also enhances visual richness.

The colour palette employed in a luxurious space plays a pivotal role in establishing an opulent atmosphere. Neutral tones, combined with rich jewel colours like sapphire or emerald, create an elegant backdrop that can be both calming and stimulating. For the ultimate luxury, consider layering colours to achieve depth and dimension. A delicate balance between bold statement hues and subtle undertones can elevate the mood of any room, enhancing its overall appeal.

Textures can further augment the luxurious feel of an interior. The juxtaposition of different textures‚Äîsuch as glossy surfaces alongside matte finishes‚Äîadds intrigue and visual interest. Incorporating layers of textiles through cushions, throws, and wall treatments can soften hard surfaces, creating an inviting ambience. Furthermore, the interplay of light and shadow across varied textures can transform a space from ordinary to extraordinary, heightening the sensory experience of the environment.

In summation, luxury in interior design is a harmonious blend of materials, colours, and textures. By thoughtfully combining these elements, one can achieve a sophisticated look that not only feels lavish but also reflects personal style and taste. The key lies in creating a cohesive design narrative that resonates with the occupants, ultimately elevating the overall living experience.

# 1. Utilising High-Quality Materials 

https://preview.redd.it/f62j7pybiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=e86c7faeb9fdfe120de3f49406f540fc90764a35

When it comes to luxury interior design, the selection of high-quality materials plays a pivotal role in crafting an elegant and sophisticated space. Utilizing natural materials such as marble, hardwood, and premium textiles not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your home but also contributes to its overall value. These materials exude a timeless charm that synthetic options often lack, providing a foundation for a truly luxurious living environment.

Marble, with its unique veining and robust nature, serves as an exemplary choice for various applications within a luxury home. Its versatility allows for incorporation in countertops, flooring, accent walls, and even decorative features like fireplace surrounds. The visual impact of marble can elevate a room‚Äôs ambience, turning ordinary spaces into stunning focal points.

Hardwood flooring is another essential luxury material that brings warmth and comfort to residential spaces. The rich textures and natural grains found in hardwood can complement various design styles, from contemporary to classic. Additionally, the durability of hardwood ensures that it remains an enduring option for elegantly designed areas. By selecting high-quality finishes, you can further enhance its beauty and longevity, making it a worthwhile investment.

Moreover, high-thread-count textiles are integral when curating a luxurious feel in bedrooms and living spaces. Fabrics like silk, cashmere, and fine linens add layers of comfort and sophistication. They can be employed in an assortment of applications, including drapery, cushions, and upholstery, seamlessly integrating plushness into your decor. The[ **best interior designers in Mumbai** ](https://www.home2decor.com)often recommend these luxurious materials to not only enhance visual appeal but also provide a sensory experience that promotes relaxation and rejuvenation.

In conclusion, incorporating high-quality materials into your interior design is essential for achieving a luxurious atmosphere. By focusing on natural options like marble, hardwood, and exquisite textiles, you can create a space that reflects elegance and timelessness while providing functionality and comfort.

# 2. Colour Schemes that Exude Elegance 

https://preview.redd.it/y11remddiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba28efe08634f9de6c89013957dead2b1691deca

When it comes to interior design, colour schemes play a pivotal role in defining the ambience of a space. Elegant colour palettes have the power to evoke luxury and sophistication, making them essential in designing opulent interiors. Neutral tones, jewel tones, and metallic accents are among the most sought-after options for creating a luxurious atmosphere.

Neutral tones, such as creamy whites, soft beiges, and muted greys, serve as an ideal foundation for any luxury design. These colours not only promote a clean and open feel but also allow for versatility when introducing other elements. The[ **top 10 interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com) often use a neutral backdrop to effectively highlight rich textures and intricate details, ensuring that the overall aesthetic remains refined and cohesive. Moreover, pairing neutral shades with darker hues like charcoal or deep navy can produce a striking contrast that exudes elegance.

On the other hand, jewel tones like emerald green, sapphire blue, and ruby red deliver a dramatic touch to interior spaces. These colours not only demand attention but also create a sense of opulence when used thoughtfully. Incorporating jewel tones through accent walls, furnishings, or artwork can offer a striking focal point while maintaining harmony with other elements. The key is to balance these bold colours with softer hues to achieve a layered, luxurious effect.

Metallic accents introduce an additional dimension to colour schemes, reflecting light and adding depth to interiors. Shades of gold, silver, and bronze can be integrated into furniture, fixtures, or decorative accessories to elevate the overall look. A well-placed metallic detail can transform an ordinary space into an extraordinary one, ensuring that the elegance quotient remains high throughout the room.

By thoughtfully combining these colour schemes, one can create an environment that is not only sophisticated but also inviting, encapsulating the essence of luxurious living.

# 3. Furniture Selection: Classic vs. Contemporary 

https://preview.redd.it/h3nc5zpeiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1907572718f8e9cde54c7463a6d925f99f37657

When it comes to luxurious interior design, furniture selection plays a pivotal role in shaping the overall ambience of a space. The choice between classic and contemporary furniture can significantly impact the aesthetic and functionality of any luxurious environment. Classic furniture is typically characterised by its timeless elegance, intricate detailing, and the use of rich materials such as mahogany, leather, and silk. These pieces often feature ornate carvings, grand proportions, and a sense of history, making them ideal for creating a sophisticated, opulent atmosphere. In contrast, contemporary furniture is defined by clean lines, minimalism, and innovative materials like glass, metal, and eco-friendly composites. This style often embraces a more understated elegance that can seamlessly complement modern living spaces.

In luxurious interior design, it is essential to recognise the key characteristics of high-quality furniture. Luxurious pieces are often marked by exceptional craftsmanship, attention to detail, and the use of premium materials.[ **Luxury interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com) emphasize that whether opting for classic or contemporary choices, the furniture selected should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also provide comfort and functionality. One of the significant advantages of integrating both styles is the opportunity for creative layering; blending classic and contemporary pieces can result in a unique look that reflects individual tastes while still maintaining a sense of luxury and sophistication.

Mixing design styles requires a thoughtful approach to achieve harmony in the overall aesthetic. One approach is to select a statement piece, such as a classic armchair paired with a sleek contemporary coffee table, that serves as a focal point within the room. Colour palettes can also bridge the gap between the two styles, ensuring cohesion throughout the space. By carefully curating a collection that includes both classic and contemporary furniture, homeowners can cultivate a luxurious interior that resonates with their style while remaining timeless and inviting.

# 4. The Power of Lighting in Luxury Design 

https://preview.redd.it/p1my5l6giize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d50aa88377c8b80bfd530363e7b26b95f8efbfb

Lighting is an essential component in interior design, particularly in creating a luxurious atmosphere within a space. The strategic use of different lighting types‚Äîincluding ambient, task, and accent lighting‚Äîcan completely transform the perception of a room, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and functionality. Ambient lighting serves as the foundation of any lighting scheme by providing general illumination. This type of lighting ensures that the space is well-lit and welcoming, setting the tone for relaxation and comfort.

Task lighting, on the other hand, is utilised for specific activities such as reading or cooking. It focuses on providing light where it is needed most, often through the use of fixtures like table lamps or under-cabinet lighting. By incorporating effective task lighting, one can improve both the usability and sophistication of a space, further contributing to an overall luxurious feel.

Accent lighting plays a pivotal role in emphasising certain features of the interior, such as artwork, architectural elements, or decorative objects. This type of lighting creates visual interest and draws attention to the finer details of the design. Examples include wall sconces, spotlights, and decorative lamps that highlight the unique characteristics of your surroundings.

When selecting statement light fixtures, it is crucial to consider both style and functionality. Luxurious designs often feature bold and creative options, such as chandeliers or meticulously crafted pendant lights, which can act as focal points in a room. High-quality materials, innovative designs, and the incorporation of technology, like dimmable options or smart lighting solutions, further elevate the ambience and efficacy of your space. The deliberate selection of lighting can thus play a definitive role in accentuating the luxurious aspects of an interior design scheme, making it a powerful tool for any homeowner or designer aiming to create an opulent environment.

# 5. Incorporating Artwork and Decorative Accessories 

https://preview.redd.it/s41ix0biiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=27227c5b696883d12bde4ec7bb52432dc7946605

In the realm of luxurious interior design, the integration of artwork and decorative accessories plays an instrumental role in defining the character and ambience of a space. Artworks, ranging from paintings to sculptures, infuse personality and provoke conversation, while accessories serve not only as decorative enhancements but also as functional elements that elevate the overall aesthetic. When selecting art pieces for a luxury space, one must prioritise quality over quantity, aiming for a cohesive collection that resonates with the overarching theme of the interior.

One effective approach is to consider the scale and proportion of the artwork concerning the room‚Äôs size. Oversized art pieces can create a focal point, drawing the eye and adding drama, while smaller, curated collections can impart a sense of intimacy and sophistication. Additionally, choosing works that engage the viewer through colour, texture, and form can significantly enrich the viewer‚Äôs experience while seamlessly blending with the other design elements present in the space.

Decorative accessories, on the other hand, serve to accentuate the luxury of the surroundings. Items such as vases, sculptures, or carefully curated books can contribute to a layered design, offering depth and interest. However, it is essential to strike a balance; a minimalist approach may risk the space appearing sterile, while excess can lead to visual chaos. Thus, a thoughtful selection process is vital. Consider accessories that complement existing colours or motifs within the room, ensuring that every piece serves a purpose, whether it is to enhance functionality or to add visual appeal.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a harmonious environment that balances artistry with decor, setting the stage for luxury living that is both inviting and breathtaking. By thoughtfully incorporating art and accessories, homeowners can transform their interiors into curated spaces that reflect personal style while upholding an essence of sophistication.

# 6. Creating Inviting Outdoor Spaces 

https://preview.redd.it/os9sdl6kiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=35821b803f02206dabe37688a25e3c018cb6f06a

In the pursuit of luxurious living, one must not overlook the potential of outdoor spaces. The integration of elegant design in these areas can transform a backyard, patio, or garden into an inviting oasis that extends the essence of your home. By employing high-quality outdoor furniture, ambient lighting, and thoughtfully curated landscaping elements, homeowners can create harmonious environments that encourage relaxation and socialisation.

When selecting outdoor furniture, it is essential to prioritise quality and durability. Opting for materials such as teak, aluminium, or weather-resistant fabrics not only ensures longevity but also adds an air of sophistication. A beautifully designed dining set can serve as the centrepiece for outdoor gatherings, while comfortable lounge chairs invite quiet moments of leisure. It is advisable to choose pieces that allow for flexibility in arrangement to accommodate various occasions, from intimate dinners to lively soir√©es.

Ambient lighting plays a crucial role in establishing a luxurious outdoor atmosphere. Incorporating elements such as string lights, lanterns, or built-in fixtures can create a warm, inviting glow after sunset. Strategically placed lighting enhances architectural features and highlights the natural beauty of the landscape. Incorporating dimmable options allows for adjustment according to the desired mood, making nighttime outdoor spaces equally appealing as during the day.

Landscaping also greatly contributes to the visual appeal of outdoor areas. Thoughtfully placed greenery, vibrant flowers, and elegant pathways can draw the eye and create a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor living spaces. Focal points, such as water features or sculptural plants, further elevate design aesthetics. By selecting landscaping that complements both the home‚Äôs architectural style and personal taste, homeowners can cultivate a sense of tranquillity and luxury.

In conclusion, extending luxurious design into outdoor spaces is a multifaceted endeavour. By combining high-quality outdoor furniture with appropriate lighting and landscaping, one can create an environment that is not only beautiful but also functionally rich, transforming ordinary outdoor areas into extraordinary retreats.

# 7. Smart Technology and Luxury Living 

https://preview.redd.it/gz50857niize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3707ebba9ac5cd1e21ba6677377a5fad414508f

The integration of smart technology into luxury interiors has become an essential aspect of modern design, elevating comfort and convenience while preserving an elegant aesthetic. As homeowners increasingly seek sophisticated living environments, smart solutions play a pivotal role in shaping spaces that reflect both luxury and technological advancement. This fusion allows homeowners to manipulate their surroundings seamlessly, enhancing their overall quality of life.

One of the prominent features of smart technology is smart lighting, which allows users to control the ambience of a room with precision. Automated lighting systems can be adjusted based on time of day, mood, or even specific events, ensuring that spaces are always perfectly illuminated. Advanced options such as colour-changing LEDS and dimmable fixtures contribute not only to functionality but also to aesthetic appeal, making them ideal for luxury settings.

Climate control is another critical element in modern luxury homes. Smart thermostats and heating systems enable homeowners to maintain the perfect temperature while optimising energy efficiency. These systems can learn occupants‚Äô routines and adjust automatically, providing comfort without the hassle of manual adjustments. The ability to control indoor climate remotely via smart devices adds a layer of convenience, exemplifying how technology enhances luxury living.

Security systems have also experienced significant advancements, featuring smart locks, cameras, and monitoring systems that offer increased safety without compromising elegance. Homeowner privacy and security are paramount; thus, integrating these high-tech elements into luxurious interiors can provide peace of mind while maintaining a sleek design. With smart technology, luxury living transcends beyond mere aesthetics, manifesting a comfortable and secure environment in which modern lifestyles can thrive.

# 8. Personalising Luxury: Customisation and Personal Touches 

https://preview.redd.it/d9tzxxfoiize1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b74bdc1481ac301ba1fceaf08ca8db2e2a6c54c

In luxury interior design, personalisation plays a pivotal role in transforming a house into a home. While opulent furniture and exquisite materials contribute to a lavish aesthetic, the unique touches elevate a space by reflecting the inhabitant‚Äôs individuality. Customisation allows homeowners to infuse their personal style, preferences, and stories into their interiors, ensuring that each room resonates with warmth and authenticity.

Incorporating personalised elements, such as custom-made furniture or bespoke art pieces, creates a distinct atmosphere. Tailored furniture not only suits the specific dimensions of a space but also aligns with the resident‚Äôs lifestyle. For instance, a custom-built bookshelf can serve as a striking focal point while providing functional storage, encapsulating both aesthetics and practicality. These unique pieces serve as conversation starters, enhancing the luxury experience by showcasing the owner‚Äôs personality.

Furthermore, thoughtful design choices, such as the colour palette, textures, and patterns, contribute to a cohesive look that mirrors the occupant‚Äôs tastes. Consideration of personal preferences in material selection, such as opting for sustainable wood or luxurious fabrics, adds deeper meaning to the design. Every choice made should enhance the overall ambience and speak to the homeowner‚Äôs identity, creating a luxury space that feels both extravagant and welcoming.

*Ultimately, the luxury of space is not solely defined by its cost but by the emotional connection it fosters. By embracing customisation and personal touches, homeowners can craft an environment that is at once sophisticated and intimately theirs, making the interior not just a showcase of wealth but a genuine reflection of their lives and experiences. This approach to luxury interior design ensures that every aspect of the home tells a story, culminating in a truly one-of-a-kind space.*",1,1746690242.0,interiorvibes,0,1.0,False

1khke26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1khke26/aita_for_downgrading_my_bil_wedding_gift_because/,AITA for Downgrading my BIL Wedding Gift Because We Got Snubbed?,"My first post, and I'm kind of new to Reddit. Please be kind as this neurodivergent tries to organise her thoughts into a coherent post.

I (39 F) and my husband (37 M) have been together for a decade. My BIL (we will call him BIL for the purpose of the story despite the complicated family dynamic). We all got along famously when I first came on the scene. BIL, his ex fianc√©, hubs and I would have some amazing times together until his fianc√© went through something after about 2 years and cut off everyone. BIL disappeared until she cheated on him with another couple, reappeared after their breakup, and was in and out of our lives for a while as he navigated life post-breakup. Now at the time it was all quite distressing, as BIL and hubs were close; they lived together for a while growing up, hubs always called him his brother (since they were 5) and treated him like one, but BIL seemed to be in and out of his life and really not as invested. I think this stung hubs a bit, but he has still always had his back and been kind, and honestly, we both still think the world of him; he is a lovely gent. He just kind of seems to disappear into his relationships... think Julia Roberts egg reference in Runaway Bride. IYKYK.

My first impression of his new fianc√©e was dreadful. We are in events and had 22 pints (about $150 worth) of gorgeous Italian gelato left over and decided to take it with to their housewarming, not as a gift (we gave them something else), just as a 'hey big guy, you and your lady and guests can enjoy some of this delicious gelato'. His fianc√©e lost it when we presented the gelato to them. She barely greeted us and just started cussing and shouting how she doesnt have space in her 'f\*\*\*king freezer'. Being the good natured teddy bear of a giant he is BIL joked and said that it was fine and he'd eat it all then and there. The disdain on her scowling face was out of this world (think the step sisters in Disney's animated Cinderella). For the rest of the evening she pretty much ignored me, maybe said one sentence. Since then we havent socialised with them, not out of spite; we just live very far from each other, and their idea of hanging out is going out drinking and partying while hubs and I are just more gamer homebodies, and I guess time just flies, and before you know it, it's been 2 years. I haven't felt particularly inspired to reach out to her or him anyway, or ask hubs to make plans as a couple after my first impression, and she hasn't either... WHICH IS FINE!

Well,they got engaged. Hubs congratulated them, and we were thrilled despite the bad experience. BIL deserves to be happy. The wedding is in 2 months, and I was really surprised hubs was not included in the bridal party. He hasn't said anything, but I'm sure it stings. I see it as a snub. They grew up together, and yes there was a period of time when they didnt speak because BIL's ex wouldnt let him but BIL has ONE friend, his fianc√©e has tons, and the bridal party is quite big. It seems all his groomsmen, aside from his best friend, are all her family/friends/friends' partners. Now the bachelor party is coming up, good innocent fun is planned (because her dad is planning it lol, I see you girl, well played) and hubs got an invite. I on the other hand have not cracked an invite to the bachelorette which I am ok with, though hubs did make a comment that he just thought it would have been classy to invite me considering his relationship with BIL, he said it's not like he is a random guest, and it's a respect thing and also... it would just make the wedding more fun and inclusive. I see where he is coming from; I guess it's kind of a snub, but I'm happy to be snubbed this time, I would not want to be left alone with this woman and her friends after the gelato incident. BUT the principle is the principle, I guess.

When the wedding invitations were sent out they asked for cash instead of gifts. Hubs was thinking of offering them a full dessert or coffee bar worth about $2k, not as the gift just as a gesture, and has now changed his mind, he never offered it so they don't know about it and the generous cash gift we were going to give is now just going to cover our plates, so a bare minimum.

Designed by spiritual coach and mindset mentor Aaron Doughty, this course is built around one simple truth: your subconscious mind is running the show. So if you want to manifest big things‚Äîmoney, love, purpose‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to train your subconscious first thing in the morning. That‚Äôs what this 7-day journey is all about.

**When & Why Does It Work?**  
So here‚Äôs the magic: the first 30-60 minutes after waking up are prime time for rewiring your brain. Your brain is shifting from dreamy theta to alpha and then to fully alert beta states.

No forcing, no fake positivity. Just small daily habits that add up to big internal shifts.

Each day focuses on one powerful piece of the Law of Attraction process:

* **Day 1: Meditation** ‚Äì Learn to observe your thoughts and let go of resistance.
* **Day 2: Visualization** ‚Äì Use your senses to FEEL into your desired reality.
* **Day 3: Affirmations** ‚Äì Make affirmations work with tonality tricks and NLP techniques.
* **Day 4: Definite Purpose** ‚Äì Find your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with clarity exercises and templates.
* **Day 5: Action Taking** ‚Äì No more procrastination! Learn how to move confidently.

You‚Äôll get interactive videos, guided meditations, and some seriously helpful NLP and mindset hacks‚Äîno fluff, just real practices.

**Where and How Do You Use It?**  
The beauty of this program is it‚Äôs fully digital. Watch it on your phone, laptop, or wherever you do your morning routine. The daily themes and exercises are structured so you can jump in without feeling overwhelmed. Aaron even includes ‚Äúshort vs. long‚Äù versions of some meditations so it works with *your* schedule. You can do it all in bed, on your yoga mat, or while sipping coffee. Up to you.

**Is It Worth It?**  
Honestly? Yes. *The Ultimate 7 Day Law of Attraction Morning Routine Program - Aaron Doughty* isn‚Äôt about hype or complicated rituals. It‚Äôs about making a real shift in how you *feel* every morning so you start manifesting from a place of clarity, peace, and alignment. If you‚Äôve been spinning your wheels with manifestation, this might be your reset button.

So if you're ready to reprogram your mornings (and your mindset) in just one week‚Äîthis is the course to try.",1,1746689764.0,SnouStudying,1,1.0,False

1khk9p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1khk9p0/26f_wife_told_me_after_4_months_of_marriage_that/,(26f) Wife told me after 4 months of marriage that she didn't love me anymore (35m),"We got married this January. While we were dating she told me about how much she wanted a family, to be married, have kids, to be a wife, etc. she seemed like such a sweet and caring woman and would be a great wife and future mother.

She came from the Philippines. We did the 90day fiance visa (K1). Which she decided she preferred doing over the other type of visa where we marry in the host country. 

We went out on this last Friday where we met with a home builder to discuss building a new home. She didn't care for my house and we thought building a new one would be good (her idea). After having dinner with my family, and we got home. An hour later she told me she needed to speak with me. She told me she didn't love me anymore. I tried to talk to her about why, but she only gave me complaints about small issues. That I would throw away wrappers after eating something. I wouldn't clean the toilet after using it. My shoes wouldnt go in the right place, etc. I couldn't get here to explain how that meant she didn't love me and how I could fix things. I offered to see a counselor or therapist, but she refused. She eventually said that she hated not having her own money and not being able to make decisions. She couldn't work without the green card. What annoys me now is she knew coming in how long she would need to wait to get one. At least 6 months after we got married to get one. I told her that it wouldn't be that much longer to get one and she could do anything she wanted. 

As far as not being able to make decisions. It is hard to explain, but anytime we would eat, go out, do something for the house, our wedding, anything she wanted, etc. I always asked for her opinion and would end up getting her what she preferred. I rarely, if ever, denied her opinion on something and just did what I wanted instead. One example I can remember I did that was new shelves for our coffee bar. The one she wanted would not fit the wall. The dimensions listed on Amazon, we wouldn't be able to get it to fit on the wall. So I ended up finding different ones and asked her to pick what color she wanted. She got upset and said she doesn't get to make decisions (this was weeks ago). I apologized and explained the issue. She ended up picking the black version of the shelves (her favorite color). I asked her than what she meant about not making decisions, but she waved it off as just being annoyed the shelves didn't fit. So I moved on from the comment. A lot of other times, like if we had a contractor at the house for a fix to the house, I would ask her if she wanted to be involved in talking to him. She would tell me to take care of it. She is a shy person so she would usually prefer for me to talk to people or order food for her. I would always take the quote from the contractor and discuss it afterward with her though to make sure she was involved.

After some more begging to get her to stay. She packed up a few things and left to a friend's house (friend she made after moving here, who is also going through the K1 visa process). 

I told her she could stay there for a little while, while we try to work things out. The friend called my mom the next day and told her that my wife left in the middle of the night. She was apparently using tinder while at their house. She doesn't know who she was meeting. She told her that she can't stay there and use tinder, and try to escape our marriage. After that, she came home, packed up the rest of her stuff and moved out. 

The friend told me that she had hundreds of dollars in cash (that I didn't) give her and was constantly using Uber while she was supposed to be at her house (I never linked any of my credit cards to her Uber account or gave her a card).

My wife, because of her situation. I never forced her into anything that might make her situation uncomfortable for her. I understand leaving friends and family to move to another country is a lot to bear. I never forced her to do any cleaning. I never forced her to do any cooking. She had complete control over the living room and tv. I never fought over the remote. I bought her anything she wanted from the wedding money we received as gifts. I built her a coffee bar near the kitchen she wanted. I built her a home gym in the basement. Anything in the house she wanted changed, I changed. If she ever wanted money to go clothes shopping with her friend, I would give her money. I took her to a local Filipino grocery store to buy any food from her country she wanted. I didn't eat at restaurants I wanted to so she could eat what she wanted. I could go on for a laundry list more of things I've done to try to make her happy and live a comfortable life while she adjusted.

I still to this day, a week later, do not understand why she really left. Why she said that she didn't love me anymore and why she ""hated me"". She only told me later that ""she would lose herself if she stayed"". The week leading up to her leaving, we went out multiple times. Had fun and she seemed really happy. 

I honestly have never seen someone just completely flip a switch from appearing happy, to looking at you like with disdain and hatred. While packing the second time, she had her mom on a video call. She said she needed proof because I would hit her and keep her against her will. I never, not once, hit her during our relationship or even yelled at her.

The only things I know are things the friend told me. That she was talking to an ex-boyfriend that was telling her to get money and a green card out of me. She was using tinder while at her house. She would speak to people on Facebook groups that would talk about their husbands. It was a female Filipino wife group. She said the women on their would tell her that I was one of the worst husbands in the group and that she was better off without me. 

currently I'm working on finding a divorce lawyer and doing my best to move on. I have no idea if she is still in the country or has moved back home. I have already reached out to cancel her visa. 

These last few days have been brutal and painful beyond anything I could imagine. I hope my story helps others. I hope others, if you are using social media to talk about your spouse behind their back. To try to avoid doing that and not be poisoned by others.

Usually I stay at JW but sometimes I switch to Hilton, Four Seasons, and Ritz.  I prefer JW over others for various reasons.  Like Four Seasons does not have a loyalty program, or Ritz's location is terrible from a traffic standpoint.  

There are three primary reasons why JW is much better than Hilton for me:

\- Bath tub.  Both hotels do have bathtubs in their rooms.  But at Hilton, the overflow pipe is placed low and when you lie down the water level does not cover full body.  At JW the tub is higher and the overflow does let you sleep fully submerged.

\- Coffee.  In the breakfast area, at Hilton, there is a self service Lavazza coffee machine.  It is similar to Nescafe coffee makers in some budget hotels, presumably with better coffee.  Nevertheless it is at best a mediocre coffee with mediocre experience.  The cups are paper.  At JW, there is a proper Marzocco machine and coffee is served to your table in a proper cup.  No contest here.

\- Lobby.  At Hilton, there are total of six (6) seating chairs in the whole lobby.  So when you wait for your car or something, chances are you will be standing up.  And forget about having a meeting right at the entrance.  Whilst at JW the lobby have many many options to sit, wait, have a meeting.  

Also smaller reasons do exist:

\- No shoehorn in the room at Hilton.

\- Bathrobes at Hilton are low quality, thin and not absorbent at all

Probably what I am saying is that a) I am unnecessarily picky, b) I had free time in my hand just now ",0,1746689206.0,hotels,0,0.5,False

These are the ones who sit in AC rooms, sip coffee, and question the integrity of our army. These are the ones who raise doubts during surgical strikes, label terrorists as 'freedom fighters', and paint our nation as the villain while glorifying those who spread bloodshed.

These are the so-called left-liberal influencers, agenda-driven journalists, and foreign-funded NGOs‚Äîwho flood social media with fake videos, twisted narratives, and emotional blackmail. And behind the scenes, they get support from Pakistan's digital propaganda machinery, foreign think-tanks, and sometimes even our own political opposition, who see power as more important than patriotism.

They hide behind the veil of ‚Äòfreedom of expression‚Äô to divide Hindus and Muslims, question the sovereignty of Kashmir, and plant seeds of hatred toward Bharat Mata.

Some Bollywood elites, certain social media feminists, and influencer activists‚Äîwho remain silent when innocent jawans are martyred‚Äîsuddenly find their voice when anti-India elements face justice. For them, 'liberalism' means supporting the enemy and weakening the spirit of nationalism.

But let me make this clear: India is not weak. India is watching. India will rise. And no matter how loud the propaganda screams, it will be drowned out by the chants of Jai Hind, Vande Mataram, and Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

We the youth, the real citizens of India, will expose every fake news outlet, every anti-national voice, and every disguised traitor. The blood of our martyrs will not be disrespected by Instagram activists or Twitter warriors.

investing in a high-quality laptop shade offers several meaningful benefits,making it a worthwhile accessory for anyone who frequently works or studies outdoors. These benefits include improved screen visibility, reduced eye strain, and enhanced portability and comfort.

**Improved Screen Visibility:** The primary benefit of a laptop shade is its ability to enhance screen visibility in bright outdoor environments. By blocking direct sunlight, a shade reduces glare and reflections, making it easier to see the screen and read text. This improves overall productivity and reduces frustration associated with squinting or straining to see content. Colors appear more vibrant, and images appear sharper, resulting in a more enjoyable and efficient computing experience.

**Reduced Eye Strain:** Extended exposure to glare can cause significant eye strain, leading to headaches, fatigue, and blurred vision. A laptop shade mitigates these effects by minimizing the need for your eyes to constantly adjust to changing light conditions. Reducing eye strain not only improves comfort but also promotes better focus and concentration, allowing you to work or study for longer periods without discomfort.**Enhanced Portability and Comfort:** A well-designed laptop shade is lightweight, portable, and easy to set up, allowing you to work comfortably in various outdoor locations. Whether you're at a park, coffee shop, or beach, a shade provides a private and ergonomic workspace, shielding you from the sun's rays and wind. The added comfort of a protected screen and reduced glare makes it easier to stay productive and focused, regardless of the environment.

**Protection for your Laptop:** Sunlight and moisture can both be damaging to laptops. High temperatures can reduce performance and long exposure to these extreme conditions may affect the laptop's longevity. A well-built and properly designed laptop shade reduces these risks so that you can worry less when using your device in the outdoors.

Navigating the market for laptop shades can raise several common questions about compatibility, installation, and warranty coverage. Addressing these concerns is crucial for making an informed purchase decision.

**Is the laptop shade compatible with all laptop sizes?**
Most adjustable laptop shades are designed to accommodate a range of laptop sizes, typically from 13-inch to 17-inch models. However, it's essential to check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific laptop size. Adjustable straps,flexible mounting systems,and expandable designs allow for a secure fit on various devices. For smaller laptops or tablets, consider models specifically designed for those form factors.

**How easy is it to install and remove the laptop shade?**
A good laptop shade should be easy to install and remove without requiring special tools or skills. Most shades use simple clip-on mechanisms, Velcro straps, or elastic bands for quick attachment and detachment. The process typically takes only a few seconds, making it convenient to use the shade on the go. Look for models with clear and concise installation instructions, ensuring a hassle-free setup experience.

**What is the laptop shade made of and how durable is it?**
Laptop shades are typically made from a combination of fabrics, plastics, and metal components. high-quality shades use durable,weather-resistant materials like nylon,polyester,and aluminum alloys to withstand outdoor conditions. The fabric should be non-reflective on the inside and UV-resistant on the outside to effectively block sunlight. Reinforced stitching, sturdy frames, and robust mounting systems contribute to the shade's overall durability and longevity.

GTA5 had a rock station with sometimes hardrock and classic metal, but CP2077 had a station with only death/black/grindcore music.

If Lucia is gonna be shown doing a hook kick on a bag, I hope this means more indept melee combat. GTA doesn't really do that, just mash-button-to-punch from what I recall, but martial arts would be cool.

Maybe not in the base game, but maybe as a mod if I get this on PC, and completely random addition that nobody probably cares about, but GTA would be perfect for this: machinima mode. Just saying, just saying.

Not a requirement, but another (unnecessary) thing from CP2077: ""Hot coffee..."" Just saying, just saying. Also, more strip club shit?

Something I think many people have always had an issue with in GTA games that I need to see improve is the manual aiming. Auto-aim is fine, and I think they know why they keep it in their games, but just improving the aiming would be dope.

The recent trailer seems to suggest bringing back the body-shape mechanic of fitness and becoming overweight.

Hi folks! I‚Äôm a PhD student passionate about science communication, and I run Toxic Tales ‚Äî a series of bite-sized ecology and ecotoxicology stories told through ~30-second Instagram reels and simple, eye-catching infographics.

The idea is to turn fascinating research into quick, shareable stories you can enjoy over a coffee break. No jargon. Just one striking study, crisp visuals, and a takeaway you‚Äôll want to tell your friends.

Here are a few examples:

Wolves Reboot ‚Äì how 31 wolves helped heal an entire ecosystem

Drugged Salmon ‚Äì how leftover meds in rivers rewire fish behavior

Caffeine Bees ‚Äì espresso-level nectar reshapes pollination behavior

Cow Burp Busters ‚Äì seaweed slices cattle methane by up to 80%

Mutagenic Mosquito Mayhem ‚Äì GM mosquitoes may spread resistance genes and disrupt food webs

Bushfire Bosses ‚Äì war wiped out large herbivores in Gorongosa, letting thorny shrubs take over and change fire regimes

Some of my more Reddit-savvy colleagues suggested I share this project more widely, and I got great feedback from r/ecology, so here I am! If you like this kind of quick, visual science, I‚Äôd love your feedback ‚Äî or suggestions for wild research I should cover next.

Prior to meds the longest I've held a job was 8 months. 

It's been 2 years and I'm making more than I ever have. My debts are paid, I have savings, I can afford fun things and little luxuries and conveniences. 

I had a promotion recently as well. I told some friends I was interviewing for it and was excited. 

The only person consistently there for me is my friends with benefits :/ he's the only person who regularly checks in, asks how my day was, celebrates my accomplishments with me. 

I have about 6 friends that I'd call friends and not acquaintances. Using first initials only: 

K - depressed because he lost his job. He's going through a hard time. I've invited him out multiple times over the course of 6 weeks. He's declined every time and given me 3 word responses. Fine, I get that you're not up for much. But not even a check in? Doesn't even remember something that was important to me? 

E - also has chronic depression. We've gotten closer in the last year because I've invited her out to things that interest her. Thrifting, sushi. We got closer! But my last attempts at hanging out - sports club, coffee, movies - she canceled or declined. 

R - I had to ask her to come along and celebrate with me, and to her credit she did. But all our hang out seshes, I've had to initiate. 

B - is kind of an incel and has been annoyed with me on the group chat since I admitted I have a FWB. I don't even think he's into me, I think he's just annoyed with women and it's becoming more apparent with time. He's always had an edge to him but has been helpful, kind, and funny. Now he's just ... Angry. 

F - had a kid. I don't expect much communication here. It would be nice, I don't fault him. But I'm still sad not to hear from him. 

S - is constantly going on trips, unavailable to chat with. Not a very good friend to begin with. It's a superficial friendship, where we gossip and try restaurants and complain. She doesn't care about me much, I don't expect her to, but sometimes she'll reach out for help and I'll think our friendship is more than superficial. It never lasts. She's not a good friend, chronically absent. 

N/R/S - group of 3 from high school. If I don't text the group chat they rarely do either. Friendships feel dead and I almost feel lonelier thinking about them. 

BE - ex boyfriend, we chat regularly about politics. Always available for a vent sesh via text, but never wants to meet up. 

I feel lonely. I feel like no one is happy for me and there's no one to share my successes with. My friends with benefits gets credit. Sometimes I get the sense that he really cares about me, but he rejected me before, so, I don't want to ask to make this official again. Feels hollow that he won't put a label on it. 

Thats it. 

I got the promotion. I'm happy, this is good for me.

(Posted this in r/ecology earlier ‚Äî apologies if you‚Äôre seeing it again!)

Hi folks! I‚Äôm a PhD student passionate about science communication, and I run Toxic Tales ‚Äî a series of bite-sized ecology and ecotoxicology stories told through ~30-second Instagram reels and simple, eye-catching infographics.

The idea is to turn fascinating research into quick, shareable stories you can enjoy over a coffee break. No jargon. Just one striking study, crisp visuals, and a takeaway you‚Äôll want to tell your friends.

Here are a few examples:

Vampire Tree Stump ‚Äì A leafless stump in NZ stays alive by siphoning sap from neighbors

Bean There, Buzzed That ‚Äì Caffeinated nectar sharpens bee memory and shifts plant-pollinator networks

Super-Pests ‚Äì Nitrogen-rich diets boost pest detox enzymes, reshaping plant-insect warfare

Wolf Reboot ‚Äì Rewilded predators restore plant diversity by reshaping herbivore behavior

Mutagenic Mosquito Mayhem ‚Äì GM mosquitoes may impact food webs, including plant-pollinator links

Bushfire Bosses ‚Äì Loss of grazers lets shrubs take over, increasing fire risk and altering plant structure


Some of my more Reddit-savvy colleagues suggested I share this project more widely, and I got great feedback from r/ecology, so here I am! If you like this kind of quick, visual science, I‚Äôd love your feedback ‚Äî or suggestions for wild research I should cover next.

Zia's POV  
  
Someone had bailed on cleanup. Again. I yanked the mop bucket forward, water sloshing over the side, and dropped to my knees beside a tile crusted with dried casserole.  
  
Six a.m., school‚Äôs dining hall, and my shoes were already soaked with cold dishwater.  
  
This wasn't how I grew up. My old life had nothing to do with cracked tiles or broken drainpipes or scrubbing floors left half-done by careless students. But now I was the invisible one, crawling behind them, cleaning up whatever they couldn't be bothered to finish.  
  
Pain shot up my legs as I scrubbed harder, like maybe elbow grease could erase how far I'd fallen. The soap burned my nose just as much as the cuts on my hands. I didn't slow down.  
  
If I hurried, I might make the 7:30 literature class. Not that Professor Mills would notice my attendance or absence. No one did. That suited me fine.  
  
I dumped the filthy water and tiptoed out. Morning light crept through the grimy corridors of our small campus building. Pennington Lake University wasn't impressive. Peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, second-hand furniture older than me. A refuge for outcasts, underfunded and overlooked.  
  
I caught a glimpse of myself in a cracked mirror by the stairwell. Dark circles framed my tired eyes. My messy brown hair escaped its bun and clung to my forehead. Gravy was smeared across my temple. Glamorous. I scrubbed it off with the back of my hand.  
  
Sometimes I forgot who I'd once been. The mirror rippled, briefly showing the proud girl from two years earlier in designer clothes, walking confidently through polished academy halls.  
  
That illusion shattered one horrible night years ago, leaving only plain Zia, a demoted orphan with nothing left.  
  
I preferred it that way. Staying unnoticed meant staying safe.  
  
""Zia! Hurry or you'll be late! I'm heading down now!"" Dalia leaned over the second-floor railing, red curls bright against the dull light. Optimism hadn't abandoned her yet.  
  
I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI'm coming.‚Äù  
  
Our dorm, once a basement storage area, had moldy corners, constantly buzzing bugs and pipes that screamed whenever someone flushed on the second floor. Thin walls meant you heard everything. For those with nowhere else to go, it was home. A soggy, rust-stained, always-leaking excuse for one.  
  
I changed into clean jeans and a faded hoodie. I slung my backpack over my shoulder. Dalia handed me peanut-butter-covered toast.   
  
""Breakfast of champions. I had to clean up after a huge staff meeting that happened before the sun came up. Apparently none of them like peanut butter.""  
  
She worked in the second floor library. It was a slightly better job than cleaning the cafeteria floors, but not by much. She spent most of her day cleaning up after the faculty or reminding students the library wasn't some place to come sleep. The only plus side was it gave her access to the staff and the privileges they often had. Or at least the leftovers of such.  
  
""You're my hero."" I forced a smile and took it from her.   
  
I didn't like peanut butter either, but I probably wouldn't have another chance to eat anything all day.  
  
Or the funds.  
  
By the time we made it to the main building, the hallways had filled with shuffle-stepping students, everyone perfecting the art of looking anywhere but at each other.  
  
Business as usual. Until Hailee strutted into view, her too-perfect blonde hair bouncing like she had a personal wind machine and a vendetta against shampoo commercials.  
  
""Well, look who it is, Princess Zia."" She smirked.  
  
The duo behind her with matching fake tans and copy-paste sneers laughed like they'd just witnessed peak hallway drama instead of Hailee recycling the same tired insults she'd been spewing since I first stepped into this place.  
  
I bit my cheek and stepped forward. ""You're in my way.""  
  
Hailee leaned in until her perfume burned my sinuses. ""I heard you were cleaning floors this morning. Quite a fall from grace, Your Highness.""  
  
Old Zia would've snapped back. New Zia kept her mouth shut.  
  
""I asked you a question."" Hailee moved closer. She cranked up the volume, clearly fishing for an audience. A few students slowed, not out of concern, but because drama this early counted as entertainment.  
  
Dalia stepped between us. ""Leave her alone.""  
  
""This isn't your business, half-blood."" Hailee's tanned friend shoved Dalia aside. I caught her elbow, steadying her as Hailee tipped her coffee forward with a shrewd giggle. Liquid splashed across my chest and soaked into the thin fabric.  
  
The hallway filled with snickers and whispers, none of them subtle. Just like the way my soaked shirt now clung to my breasts clearly visible through the fabric.  
  
""Oh, how clumsy. Maybe mop that up, Princess.""  
  
I forced a breath through my nose to keep from growling. ""Yeah, whatever you say.""  
  
Hailee shoved her empty cup into my hands. ""Dispose of that.""  
  
She bounced away, her pack trailing her like flies. I flung the cup towards the trash can and missed. Dalia leaned over and picked it up without taking her eyes off Hailee as she receded.  
  
She threw her arms around me the second they disappeared. ""Damn, I despise that bitch.""  
  
""It's fine."" My voice cracked. I blinked rapidly, refusing to let a single tear fall. Hailee didn't get to have that.  
  
I decided to skip the first period so I could change again. As I walked through the campus back to the dorm, the campus felt off. People stood around in groups, whispering too loud and checking their phones like they were waiting for the world to end.  
  
I usually tuned out gossip. It had become a survival skill. But this wasn't the usual noise about hookups or stolen food. The voices got louder. People looked panicked. Everyone moved like something bigger was happening.  
  
Ignoring it wasn't an option anymore. My wolf stirred first, ears twitching at the smallest shift in footsteps and whispers. Heightened senses I rarely used anymore kicked in, uninvited and sharp. Hearing, smell, instinct. All alert. My body had lived two years pretending to be normal, but the part of me that was still wolf never forgot how to feel danger coming.  
  
""Crimson Oak Academy was destroyed?""  
  
‚ÄúAn earthquake?‚Äù  
  
""Will exams be canceled?""  
  
Snippets drifted past as students hurried through the halls.  
  
Dalia appeared, breathless. Her eyes were huge. ""Zia! Crimson Oak was leveled. They're sending all the Alphas here! Luna candidates as well!""  
  
I stared at her. That had to be wrong.  
  
Crimson Oak was over 800 miles away. It wasn't just another university. It was the university for elite Alphas and Lunas. And Pennington Lake? We were just outside what the packs called the danger zone, tucked in the middle of nowhere, barely worth noticing.  
  
That was the point. That was why I came here. Safety in obscurity. Far from the curated, high-status chaos those students demanded as their everyday reality. Everyone there was groomed for power, raised on privilege, and feared for good reason. I used to walk those halls. Used to know those names. Used to be one of them.  
  
But worst of all. Someone was there too.  
  
The nightmare I'd hidden from for two years.  
  
I sprinted to the admin office. I skidded to a stop in front of the already posted lists. The names blurred at first, but I didn't have to search long. He was high-ranking. Important. His name sat smugly near the top, right where it belonged in his world.  
  
Shade Kane, AKH.  
  
AKH. Alpha King Heir. His father had reinstated his Royal distinction sometime after I left the Crimson Oak Academy.  
  
Blood drained from my face. My pulse roared in my ears. Shade was coming here. Starting tomorrow, I'd have to deal with it all again. His fixation, his need to control, the way he looked at me like he wanted to devour every inch.  
  
Because he did.  
  


# 2 -Instant Battlefield

If I thought mornings had been cruel before, I had severely underestimated the universe's sense of humor. The Alphas hadn't even arrived yet, and Pennington Lake already teetered on collapse.  
  
By eight, the old corkboard outside the admin building was falling apart, barely holding the weight of the sudden announcements: Orientation schedules, last-minute class revisions, and a desperate-looking flyer for a ""Welcome Ceremony"" no one remembered approving.  
  
Grime that had settled over decades vanished overnight. Furniture was replaced. Windows gleamed. The dean barked orders like he'd discovered adrenaline for the first time. He never lifted a finger when the heating failed or the plumbing backed up. But now? Now he made us polish floorboards and sanitize door handles. Not for us. For the Alphas and Lunas.  
  
Turns out it had always been this easy to fix. He just never thought we were worth it.  
  
The girls were worse.  
  
It started quietly. Lipstick got darker. Skirts shortened. The air filled with synthetic perfume and desperate anticipation. I walked past clusters of giggling girls comparing gloss shades and hypothesizing Alpha names like they were reading star charts.  
  
""What if one of them is my mate?"" One whispered in the dorm bathroom, curling her lashes with trembling fingers.   
  
""You think the Moon Goddess pairs Alphas with nobodies? Maybe you'll get a night out of it. If you're lucky."" Her friend scoffed without even looking up.   
  
I slipped out without saying anything. Let them chase fate. I knew exactly where it led.  
  
By noon, the school had split down the middle.  
  
Hailee's pack postured in the quad, practically vibrating with ambition. She stood front and center, hips c\*\*\*\*d, voice sharp.   
  
""Alphas don't want shy kittens,"" she snapped. ""They want tigresses.""  
  
She was another demoted wolf. Daughter of a Beta who got caught in some shady power-grab and dragged her down with him.  
  
She hadn't earned a place at Crimson Oak, but she'd wormed her way into a few of the society parties they threw there using her mothers name and reputation. Enough of the guys knew her name to make her dangerous. And she knew it.   
  
Dalia and I lingered with the rest of the second camp ‚Äì the students who understood visibility was no longer safe.  
  
""They're acting like it's some prestigious summit, not a forced welcome party for wolves who don't want to be here."" Dalia peeled the Pennington Lake shirt over her head and grimaced.   
  
The school had handed the shirts out by the hundreds, pretending we were some unified body instead of a collapsing hierarchy about to be devoured from the top down.  
  
Classes got canceled around two in favor of etiquette seminars. By four, students packed the main lawn, squeezed into matching shirts and pretending not to shiver in the wind.  
  
I glanced toward the tree line. They'd been trimmed up, the once overhanging branches now a thing of the past. Not enough shadows left to hide in.  
  
Dalia's hand slipped into mine. ""Zia. You're freezing.""  
  
I stared ahead. ""I'm fine.""  
  
I shut my eyes. My wolf stirred, restless and alert. No matter how hard I tried to forget, she never would. She remembered him. His scent, his presence, the pull he had on us. My wolf never understood the way he hurt me. That part of me, the human part, carried wounds she didn't recognize. She only knew the bond, not the betrayal. And I knew the second he stepped onto campus, she'd respond. She always did. That terrified me more than anything else.  
  
The first car appeared at five. A sleek black SUV, windows tinted, engine purring. Behind it, a line of vehicles that dripped with wealth and arrogance followed.  
  
The crowd hushed as doors opened.  
  
And they stepped out.  
  
Crimson Oak students moved like they had nothing to prove. Tall, perfectly postured, marked by strength they didn't bother hiding. Expensive clothes layered over tailored bodies. Their presence changed the atmosphere instantly.  
  
I spotted him before I wanted them to. Black tailored jacket. Black hair. Eyes the same inescapable blue I remembered. He'd grown broader. Harder. His Royal crest cufflinks on full display. Everything about him screamed Alpha now.  
  
Cylan was at his side instantly. Still soft around the eyes, still wearing that half-curious look like the world might surprise him any second. His brown hair curled slightly over his forehead. His shirt was tucked wrong. He was never as serious as the others were. I remembered liking that about him.  
  
Deonte stood on Shade's left, tall and easy, grinning like he'd already won whatever game this was. His shirt clung to his chest like it had been custom-fitted. It probably had. His dark skin caught the light like polished stone. He laughed at something Cylan said and elbowed Shade in the ribs.  
  
The scent hit next. Alphas brought it with them like smoke. Sharp, heavy, undeniable. It rolled across the crowd in waves. Girls tilted their heads. Several whimpered. Most looked down at the dirt in unwilling submission.  
  
Dalia blinked hard, shaking herself. ""They smell like trouble.""  
  
My stomach flipped. I ducked instinctively, hoodie pulled tight, half-hidden behind a pathetic excuse for a tree. It wasn't enough.  
  
""Dalia, we need to leave now.""  
  
I didn't wait for her to respond. Voices behind me shouted. Someone called Shade's name. I didn't look back. I ran. The alley behind the library offered cover. I pressed a hand to the bricks to steady myself.   
  
Dalia caught up seconds later. ""Zia? What's wrong? Did someone from Crimson Oak...""  
  
""Yes."" I managed to talk. ""My ex came.""  
  
Dalia froze. ""He can't hurt you here, Zia. Rules protect you.""  
  
She meant it. Believed it. And she knew more than most about my past. But not everything. Not the pieces I'd never said out loud. Not the parts that would unravel the second Shade looked at me. Because Shade didn't care about rules. My all too carefully constructed fake identity wouldn't hold under his constant scrutiny.   
  
Students chattered loudly nearby. The ceremony was shifting. The Alphas and Lunas would be assigned dorms soon.  
  
I peered around the corner. Hailee had already cornered Deonte, her chest practically pressed to his arm. He looked amused. Over her shoulder, he caught sight of us. His eyes narrowed.

The diet isn't anything absurd and I have a generally balanced diet- however I also started my period on the same day and I've been decreasing the amount of cigarettes I smoke since March. I can't drink coffee, I have to eat breakfast to take said gel (I'm the type of person who not only doesn't consume food for breakfast, but also feels sick after), can't smoke, the gel tastes like a medicine I used to take as a kid that lowkey traumatised me and I can't drink/eat for minimum 30 minutes after taking it. I can't drink juice nor chocolate, among other things. My period cramps are especially terrible at night, last night I had my husband basically push his wrist against my belly to be able to fall asleep. I need to smoke so bad but can't. I'm spending 10 minutes on the toilet after each meal. 

Whenever I'm by myself I start sobbing and this morning I lashed out on him when he suggested to try eating pb&j for breakfast. He's extremely understanding and he's doing almost everything for our daughter to give me some space, but I still feel so overwhelmed and I don't know how to manage. I love my mother with all my heart but she's the type of person who makes it sound like her doing something is surviving a war, and someone else doing the same thing is a walk in the park. 

If anyone has any tips of any kind really, I'd really appreciate it 

And I'm sorry if I come off the wrong way with this post, I don't want to sound like a victim and this isn't a tragedy. I'm just feeling like shit and don't really have a support system that can help me manage the mental load ",1,1746687872.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm open to any suggestions about places that could be worth adding and especially on the logistics of moving from place to place. I have never been to South America but I have quite a bit of experience with travelling.

I‚Äôm not into cities at all and although I considered adding a couple of days in Lima in the end I decided not to, am I doing a mistake there? I also have a 5/6 days that I can allocate anywhere (40 days in total) but I don‚Äôt know if I should add something else or just leave them empty to follow the flow. I would probably add a couple extra days in the Coffee triangle in Colombia and maybe a other couple in de Atacama desert (although I don‚Äôt really plan to see Chile, it‚Äôs just the most convenient way for me to fly out). I also left out Arequipa as I‚Äôm not really interested in trekking the Colca Canyon but I wouldn‚Äôt mind adding one or two chill days there.

Also, originally I thought I could go in August/September but I just got feedback from my work saying that it will have to be end of September/October so I‚Äôm wondering if it would make sense to do it the other way around, starting in Bolivia and making my way to Colombia. What do you think?

Ever feel like planning a trip is like trying to wrangle a particularly stubborn octopus? You book the flights, then you're scrambling for a car, then there's the accommodation‚Ä¶it's enough to make you want to stay home and watch reruns. But what if there was a way to simplify that initial heavy lifting? What if you could book your flights and your ride for when you touch down all in one go? That, my friends, is the magic of the flights and hire car package. Think of it as your travel fairy godmother waving her wand and bundling up two of the most important ingredients for a successful getaway. No more jumping between websites, no more comparing apples to‚Ä¶well, rental cars. It‚Äôs about making the start of your adventure as smooth as a freshly paved highway. Let's dive into why this clever combo is a game-changer for seasoned travellers and first-time explorers alike.

Simplifying Your Holiday Handoff: Why a Flights and Hire Car Package is a Masterstroke

So, you've decided you need a break. You're dreaming of sandy beaches, bustling city streets, or maybe just a quiet cabin in the woods. Whatever your ideal escape looks like, getting there and getting around once you arrive are pretty key, right? That‚Äôs where the beauty of booking your flights and hire car together really shines. It‚Äôs about convenience, yes, but it‚Äôs also about starting your trip off on the right foot, without the nagging feeling that you‚Äôve forgotten something or are paying through the nose for separate bookings.

The Perks of the Package: More Than Just a Pretty bow

Thinking about a flights and hire car package? You're on the right track! This combination isn't just about making things easy; it often comes with some serious advantages for your wallet and your peace of mind. Let's unpack some of the goodies you can expect when you bundle your travel essentials.

1. Saving Your Pennies: The Sweet Relief of Bundling

Let's be honest, who doesn't love saving money? When you book flights and hire car together, travel companies often offer a discounted rate compared to booking each component separately. It‚Äôs like buying a combo meal ‚Äì you get more for less. This can free up cash for those extra treats during your trip, whether it's a fancy dinner, a memorable excursion, or just a souvenir to bring home. Don't leave money on the table by booking piecemeal!

2. One and Done: The Bliss of a Single Booking

Juggling multiple booking confirmations, cancellation policies, and customer service lines can be a real headache. With a flights and hire car package, you get a single booking reference, one point of contact if you need to make changes, and a streamlined overall process. It‚Äôs less paperwork, less stress, and more time to daydream about your destination. Talk about a win-win!

3. Guaranteed Wheels: No Last-Minute Scrambling

Imagine arriving at your destination, tired from your flight, only to find that the rental car you *thought* you booked isn't available, or they're trying to upsell you on everything under the sun. Booking your hire car as part of a package eliminates this potential nightmare. Your wheels are guaranteed to be waiting for you, giving you peace of mind the moment you step off the plane.

4. Tailor-Made Travel: Flexibility at Your Fingertips

Think a package means you‚Äôre stuck with limited options? Think again! Most travel providers offering flight and hire car deals give you a wide range of choices. You can typically select your preferred airline, departure times, car size, and even pickup and drop-off locations. It‚Äôs about finding the perfect fit for your travel needs and your itinerary.

5. Protection in Paradise: Added Layers of Security

Booking with a reputable travel company often comes with added layers of consumer protection. If things go pear-shaped ‚Äì a flight cancellation, a car issue ‚Äì you generally have a single point of contact to help sort things out. This can be invaluable, especially when you're in an unfamiliar place. It's like having a safety net woven into your travel plans.

Beyond the Basics: Nailing Your Flights and Hire Car Package

Okay, you're sold on the idea of a flight and hire car package. But how do you make sure you're getting the *best* deal and the *right* package for *you*? It's not just about clicking the first offer you see. Doing a little bit of homework can go a long way in ensuring your bundled booking is a roaring success.

Getting Savvy About Your Search: Where to Bag a Bargain

So you've decided to go down the bundle route with a flights and hire car package. Excellent choice! But where do you even begin to look? The online world is awash with options, and navigating it can feel a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Don't fret, though! With a few smart strategies, you can zero in on the best deals and platforms.

Online Travel Agencies (OTAs): Your Digital Travel Hubs

Websites like Expedia, Booking.com, Skyscanner (which often has a package option), and countless others are your go-to for comparing various flights and car rental companies side-by-side. They aggregate deals from different providers, making it easy to see a wide range of options all in one place. This is a fantastic starting point for getting a lay of the land and comparing prices.

Direct with Airlines and Car Rental Companies: Sometimes the Best Deals are In-House

While OTAs are great for comparison, don't overlook the possibility of booking directly with an airline that partners with a car rental company, or vice versa. Sometimes, these direct partnerships offer exclusive deals that you won't find anywhere else. It's worth checking their websites after you've done some initial searching on an OTA.

Membership Programs and Loyalty Schemes: Earn While You Fly and Drive

If you‚Äôre a frequent flyer or rent cars often, leveraging loyalty programs can unlock further discounts and perks. Airlines and car rental companies often have their own loyalty schemes, and sometimes booking a package through their platform can earn you extra points or status benefits. Every little bit helps, right?

Considering the Car: It's More Than Just Four Wheels

When you're looking at a flights and hire car package, it's easy to get fixated on the flight price. But the car part of the equation is just as crucial! Getting the wrong car can put a damper on your trip faster than a flat tire in the middle of nowhere. Thinking carefully about your needs will help you avoid any unpleasant surprises at the rental counter.

Size Matters (Sometimes): Finding the Right Vehicle for Your Crew

Are you solo backpacking or travelling with the whole family and enough luggage for a small army? The size of your car rental needs to match your needs. A compact car might be perfect for zipping around a city, but it‚Äôs going to feel mighty cramped on a long road trip with three teenagers and their duffle bags. Consider the number of passengers, the amount of luggage, and the type of driving you'll be doing.

Transmission and Fuel Type: Don't Get Caught Out

While automatic cars are prevalent in many parts of the world, manual transmissions are still common in others. Make sure you're comfortable driving the type of car being offered. Similarly, check the fuel type ‚Äì petrol or diesel? Knowing this beforehand means you won't be scratching your head at the pump in a foreign country.

Extras and Add-ons: The Devil's in the Details

GPS, child seats, additional drivers, insurance excess‚Ä¶ these are all things that can add to the cost of your car rental. Think about what you truly need and factor these into the overall price when comparing deals. Sometimes a seemingly cheaper package might end up costing more once you add on necessary extras. Don't be afraid to ask questions about what's included and what's not.

Sorting Out the Insurance: Peace of Mind on the Road

Car rental insurance can seem like a murky topic, but it's vital to understand what's covered in your flights and hire car package and what you might need to add. Basic collision damage waiver (CDW) or loss damage waiver (LDW) is often included, but this usually comes with an ""excess"" ‚Äì the amount you'd have to pay if there's damage. Consider whether you need additional insurance to reduce this excess or cover other eventualities like theft or damage to specific parts of the car. Your existing travel insurance might also offer car rental coverage, so check your policy!

Fuel Policies: A Full Tank of Understanding

Car rental companies have different fuel policies. The most common are ""full-to-full"" (you pick it up full, return it full) and ""full-to-empty"" (you pick it up full, return it empty, but you often pay a premium for the initial tank). Full-to-full is usually the most cost-effective option, assuming you have a petrol station near the drop-off location.

The Pick-Up and Drop-Off Dance: Location, Location, Location

Where do you pick up and drop off your hire car? Is it at the airport terminal, requiring a shuttle bus, or a short walk? Or is it off-site, requiring a longer transfer? Consider the convenience and time implications of the location when making your booking. If you're arriving on a late flight, an on-site pickup might be worth the slightly higher cost.

Timing is (Almost) Everything: When to Book Your Flights and Hire Car Package

Just like booking flights, the timing of when you book your flights and hire car package can impact the price. While there's no magic formula, here are a few things to keep in mind:

Booking in Advance: The Early Bird Often Catches the Worm (and a Better Deal)

Generally, booking your flights and hire car package well in advance, especially for popular destinations or during peak season, is a good strategy. This gives you a wider selection of options and often better prices. As dates get closer to departure, prices tend to increase, and the availability of desired car types might decrease.

Flexibility is Your Friend: Weekdays Can be Cheaper

If your travel dates are flexible, consider flying and renting mid-week. Flights and car rentals are often cheaper on Tuesdays and Wednesdays compared to weekends. A little bit of wiggle room in your schedule can sometimes translate into significant savings.

Keeping an Eye on Deals and Sales: Patience Can Pay Off

Sign up for email alerts from airlines, car rental companies, and OTAs. They often announce sales and special offers, which can be a great opportunity to snag a fantastic flights and hire car package at a reduced price. Don't jump on the first deal you see, but keep an eye out for limited-time promotions.

The Nitty-Gritty: Reading the Fine Print (Yes, Really!)

Nobody *likes* reading terms and conditions, but when it comes to your flights and hire car package, it's absolutely essential. This is where you'll find crucial information about cancellation policies, luggage allowances for the flight, age restrictions for car rental drivers, and any hidden fees. A little bit of careful reading upfront can save you a lot of hassle down the road.

Cancellation Policies: What If Your Plans Go South?

Life happens, and sometimes plans change. Understanding the cancellation policy of your flights and hire car package is vital. Are you eligible for a full refund, a partial refund, or is the booking non-refundable? Knowing this beforehand will help you make informed decisions if you need to alter your travel plans.

Luggage Allowances: Don't Get Caught Out at the Airport

Your flight booking will have a specific luggage allowance for both checked bags and carry-on luggage. Make sure your packing aligns with these limits to avoid hefty excess baggage fees at the airport. It‚Äôs always a good idea to weigh your bags at home before you leave.

Driver Requirements: Who Can Actually Get Behind the Wheel?

There are often age restrictions for renting a car. Drivers typically need to be a certain age (often 21 or 25) and have held their license for a minimum period. There might also be surcharges for younger drivers. Check these requirements carefully to ensure everyone who needs to drive is eligible.

Hidden Fees: The Sneaky Little Costs

Be aware of potential hidden fees like airport surcharges, out-of-hours collection fees, or one-way rental fees (if you're picking up the car in one location and dropping it off in another). The terms and conditions will outline these costs. Don't be afraid to ask the rental company for a full breakdown of all potential charges.

Putting It All Together: Your Seamless Travel Starts Now

So, you've done your research, you've compared options, and you've read the fine print. You're armed and ready to book that perfect flights and hire car package. Congratulations! You've taken a huge step towards simplifying your travel planning and potentially saving a bundle. Remember, the goal is a smooth, stress-free start to your adventure, leaving you more time to focus on making memories.

Flying High, Driving Free: The Ultimate Travel Power Couple

Booking your flights and hire car package together is more than just a transaction; it's about creating a seamless travel experience from doorstep to destination and back again. It's about the feeling of arriving, knowing your ride is waiting, and having the freedom to explore at your own pace. It‚Äôs about less worry and more wanderlust.

Imagine this: You step off the plane, head straight to the rental car desk, pick up the keys to your pre-booked car, and hit the road. No waiting for taxis, no figuring out public transport with luggage in tow. You're in control, ready to embark on whatever adventure awaits you. That's the power of the flights and hire car package.

Beyond the Package: Making the Most of Your Trip

While your flights and hire car package gets you there and gives you wheels, there's still plenty more to think about to ensure your trip is everything you dreamed of.

Planning Your Route: Paving the Way for Adventure

Having a hire car gives you incredible flexibility, but a little bit of route planning can go a long way. Research the roads, consider potential traffic hotspots, and map out any must-see stops along the way. Having a general idea of your itinerary can save you time and stress on the road.

Accommodation Considerations: Where Will You Lay Your Head?

While your flights and hire car package handles the travel and transport basics, you'll still need to sort out your accommodation. With the freedom of a hire car, you have more options. You're not limited to hotels within walking distance of public transport. Consider staying in charming rural guesthouses, well-located apartments, or even out-of-the-way cabins that would be inaccessible without a car.

Packing Smart: Less is Often More

Even with a car to carry your luggage, packing smart is always a good idea. Consider packing cubes to keep things organized, and think about the climate of your destination. Unless you're doing a major road trip with multiple stops, you probably won't need a huge suitcase.

Embracing the Unexpected: The Joys of Spontaneity

While planning is good, don't be afraid to embrace a little spontaneity! With your hire car, you have the freedom to take detours, stop at interesting roadside attractions, or change your plans on a whim. Sometimes the best travel memories are made when you go off the beaten path.

Hitting the Road: Tips for a Smooth Ride

You've picked up your hire car ‚Äì now what? Here are a few quick tips for a hassle-free driving experience in an unfamiliar location:

- **Familiarize yourself with the car:** Before you leave the rental lot, take a moment to get oriented with the car's controls ‚Äì lights, wipers, indicators, and importantly, how to open the fuel tank!
- **Check for existing damage:** Take photos or a video of any dings or scratches before you leave the rental lot. This can save you a lot of grief when you return the car.
- **Understand the local driving rules:** Research the driving laws and customs of your destination ‚Äì speed limits, rules of the road, and parking regulations. Driving on the other side of the road? Practice in a quiet car park before hitting the main roads.
- **Don't rely solely on GPS:** While GPS is incredibly helpful, especially in new places, it's always a good idea to have a physical map or a downloaded offline map as a backup, especially in areas with unreliable signal.
- **Take breaks:** On longer drives, take regular breaks to avoid fatigue. Stop at a scenic viewpoint, grab a coffee, and stretch your legs.

Troubleshooting on the Go: Handling the Unexpected

Even the most well-planned trip can encounter bumps in the road (sometimes literally!). Here's what to do if something unexpected happens with your hire car:

- **Breakdown:** If the car breaks down, pull over safely if you can. Contact the rental company immediately. They will have a roadside assistance service. Don't attempt major repairs yourself.
- **Accident:** If you're in an accident, ensure your safety first. Exchange details with the other driver (if applicable) and contact the rental company as soon as possible. They will guide you through the necessary steps.
- **Flat Tire:** Most rental cars come with either a spare tire and jack or a tire repair kit. If you're comfortable changing a tire, follow the instructions. Otherwise, contact the rental company for assistance.
- **Lost Keys:** This can be a headache and an expensive one! Contact the rental company immediately. They will have a process for getting you a replacement key, although there will likely be a charge.

Hi! My resident cat is around 5 years old, and I‚Äôve had him for about a year and a half, and we‚Äôve been in this apartment for almost a full year! He is a very sweet boy and very playful, but has never really been around other animals. He was at my parents‚Äô house with their 2 senior cats for around 72 hours before I moved apartments, and did fine, mostly uninterested honestly.

I decided to adopt a kitten recently, and the process of picking her up was very sudden and sooner than I anticipated. The kitten is around 9 weeks old, and just 2lbs. I had to pick her up yesterday by surprise, I was supposed to pick her up next week when I had time off. This week, I have to work 9-5 every day and can only be home for around an hour on my lunch break.

All of this to say, my boyfriend came over last night to meet her. We had her in the bathroom, but I wanted to make sure my resident cat was getting equal attention and that he was feeling okay about the whole thing as well so we alternated rooms for a few hours, and tried to have the door open but she was fearless and wanted to explore. Eventually, we decided to pick her up and hold her on the couch while he was able to roam the whole apartment (it‚Äôs small, but still). It was going really well, he was sitting on the coffee table just observing for most of the evening. Because it was going so well, we decided to both sit on the floor and let her explore the living room a little bit within our reaching distance. My resident cat hissed at her a few times but she was completely unphased.

Today, I have kept her in the bathroom all day and alternated where I am. I‚Äôm snuggling with my resident cat rn (who is a little more snuggly than usual honestly which I‚Äôm grateful for, I‚Äôve heard it go the other way). He will hiss at the door when she cries and sticks her paws underneath, but won‚Äôt swat at her (so far).

Should I move to no visual contact for a few days and try again? Or should I allow them to see each other and let the kitten explore a little more? Honestly any advice about anything is welcome, I want to make sure that my first baby is okay and comfortable but also make sure that my new kitten feels at homeü´∂üèª thanks y‚Äôall!!",1,1746687613.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
Melina‚Äôs POV  
  
Six Years Later  
  
It‚Äôs frightening how quickly your day can change. One minute you're looking forward to having dinner with your mate. Next, you're running for your life. I‚Äôm thankful that I even found out that my mate was such a piece of s\*\*t. I had been looking forward to finding them my whole life. Dreaming of a wedding where I could claim them as mine in front of all my friends and family. I should have seen the truth staring me in the face. I was so in love, so completely enamored of him. I went along with all his suggestions. Every. Single. One.  
  
I never saw his true intentions. I just lived in my little bubble of happiness, where everything was going as it should. I‚Äôd allowed him to charm me. I‚Äôd let him explain why we hadn‚Äôt had my Luna Ceremony. I‚Äôd accepted his excuses as to why he couldn‚Äôt mark me just yet. It was never the right time. I'd swallowed my pride repeatedly, all for a dream. It was all an illusion, and he played his part to absolute perfection.  
  
He had seemed so caring at first. He was interested in learning everything about me, and I was flattered. I was foolish. I'm thankful for all my training as I sit perched over thirty feet up in this tree. I hate that I didn‚Äôt bring my cell phone with me. I‚Äôm too far away to be able to mindlink anyone for help, and this is life and death. The forest is silent, and I cursed myself for not seeing this sooner.   
  
I‚Äôm smarter than this. How could I have allowed this to happen? I held back a sob. I cannot make any noise. My mate, Trevor Byrne, wanted me dead. I knew that a new team was now out here with me. The whole situation was ridiculous. I already knew that Trevor was going to spin it, to try to keep my family from getting involved. That wasn‚Äôt going to happen. Trevor wasn‚Äôt the smartest Alpha out there, but I recently discovered he is among the most ruthless.   
  
I was the happiest I can remember six hours ago. I went to find Trevor. I'd just returned from the pack hospital with the best news. We were going to have a baby. I ran into the pack house's back entrance and took the back stairs. I wanted to tell him the good news. I was moving so fast, I was just a blur. Trevor had been interested in what our pup would be if we were to get pregnant. His pack, Still Waters, was not as welcoming to me as it should have been.   
  
I know they had a recent scare and lost some warriors. But my team ended that threat for them. I wasn‚Äôt like the vampires that had caused them issues. Yet, with each passing day, the stares became more aggressive. Trevor told me that the pack would warm up to me. I was just paranoid, but they didn‚Äôt warm up. In fact, it had gotten much worse in the last two weeks. I hope this good news will be the turning point for the pack to accept me, and their Alpha heir.   
  
I knew something was wrong the moment I arrived outside his office. I could smell Heidi in there with him. I could scent the fact that they were having s\*x. Although my heart doesn‚Äôt beat, it still broke into a million pieces. I trusted him. I stepped back in shock, as my first instinct was to pound on the door. Although we were primarily vampires, Maksim and I received our wolf counterparts the day we turned sixteen. Dr. Gurin had been amazed. More like thrilled, as I'd never seen him so excited.  
  
Although he had charted our growth our whole lives, his excitement at having been given such a gift could not be contained at that point. My wolf, Storm, was like a built-in best friend for me. We were one entity, but Storm had her own opinions and strengths. She made me stronger and faster. She also increased my vision and hearing by over double. I could scent danger well before they could get close enough to hurt me. All because of Storm.   
  
My mate was still f\*\*\*\*\*g that b\*\*\*h, and I heard it when they both climaxed. I felt like I was going to be sick. I've asked him at least thirty times in the last two months about Heidi. He always said they used to date, but were just friends now. She was always putting her hands on my mate. She didn‚Äôt care that it bothered me; she seemed to enjoy that fact. She always portrayed it as being innocent between them. They were best friends, and I had a suspicious mind. She always knew how to dig the knife in deeper with her rude comments.   
  
‚ÄúWhy are you so suspicious? Is it because vampires cheat a lot? How could Trevor or I be willing to do that to you? I think your opinion of me is disgusting,‚Äù Heidi told me last week. Acting shocked that I would even suggest anything between them.   
  
She even produced tears. Her father, still the acting Beta, had thrown me a disapproving glare across the table. Trevor lost no time leaning over to comfort her, not me, which was another red flag. I‚Äôm sickened to hear them both trying to catch their breath as they come back down. This certainly explained his long hours at work, since this was part of what he'd been doing. It all made sense now.   
  
I pushed my anger down and reached into my jeans. I would record them as leverage for him to accept my rejection. I have a great deal of money. My father had been saving up for all of his children. I was just the first to leave the nest. I only took a portion of it. I had been using my money to invest in his pack. I‚Äôm glad I never told him how much I had now. The issue was, in my excitement, I‚Äôd left my cell phone at the pack hospital.   
  
‚ÄúTrevor,‚Äù Heidi whined. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to get rid of that disgusting bloodsucker. The whole pack is nervous with her in it. I won‚Äôt allow her to stay here. You‚Äôre mine. You always have been. I can‚Äôt believe that you‚Äôre cheating on me with her. Goddess only knows what disgusting diseases she has from drinking blood.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSoon, love, soon,‚Äù Trevor replied. He sounded so happy. I‚Äôm utterly disgusted by his behavior. ‚ÄúI already told you, we need a few more improvements done to the pack. I didn‚Äôt hear you complaining when you got to go shopping with me the other day. You seemed pleased with your new vehicle and wardrobe. Melina is loaded. She only took a portion of her money with her. Goddess only knows how much she has still in the bank. She put almost two million into the pack's account. Why would I cut her loose when she‚Äôs so valuable to me and the pack?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre still sleeping with her. You belong to me, you promised me, and I know how the bond works. It will only get stronger. How did she even know that you were her mate? It‚Äôs impossible. Are you sure you‚Äôre not falling for her?‚Äù Heidi complained. I could hear her snuggling closer into my mate. They are both despicable as far as I‚Äôm concerned.   
  
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not falling for her, Love. You forget, my best friend was killed by one of those bloodsucking monsters. I would never accept one of them as my mate. She's a good lay, and she adores me. But I‚Äôve got her down to just sleeping with me once a week. She still thinks I care about her,‚Äù I heard him stop to laugh with her. I felt ice refreeze my broken heart. I refuse to allow him to hurt me again.  
  
‚ÄúGood, but you'd better figure something out soon. I won‚Äôt let our pup have any competition. It‚Äôs easier for a true mate to get pregnant. I don‚Äôt even know how that b\*\*\*h could, but it seems she is pregnant as well, Trevor. My friend Shelley at the pack hospital called to warn me. They don‚Äôt know how far along she is yet, but I won‚Äôt have a bloodsucking bastard take my pup‚Äôs place in your heart, or this pack. So you better come up with something soon. Or else I'm leaving with your pup. You can stay here with your undead queen, without me,‚Äù Heidi snapped out.   
  
‚ÄúI refuse to live without you, Heidi. I‚Äôll figure it out. We might not be mates, but I love you. Can‚Äôt you just be patient? I can‚Äôt get the other money she has without using this money first. I‚Äôll let her think I still care, while I figure out how to get rid of her. We have to be careful here. Also, I need to warn you. You didn‚Äôt meet those who came here to end those rogue vampires. They are deadly, and they are good at their jobs. It would be nothing for them to return and wipe us all out. I'll deal with Melina. I will tell her it‚Äôs not the right time for us to have a child. She always does as I ask. I won‚Äôt allow that child to be born. The doctor linked me. He is horrified at the thought of that monstrosity being allowed to be born, let alone rule the pack. He already gave her abortion pills instead of prenatal vitamins. So, stop worrying. We‚Äôve been together this whole time; nothing will change that. I‚Äôve been slipping her wolfbane in her morning coffee. Melina won‚Äôt find out about us,‚Äù Trevor replied confidently.  
  
‚ÄúBut what if she does?‚Äù Heidi asked again. I started to get worried. Wait. Does she know I‚Äôm out here?  
  
‚ÄúIf she does, I‚Äôll move the plan up and end her. I just need to find something that would be believable. I‚Äôve been asking about her life the whole time she‚Äôs been here. I know her much better than she thinks I do. I needed to learn how to make it look like a plausible accident. Now, stop worrying about what might happen. I need to have you again before I complete this paperwork,"" my mate replied. I could hear them kissing again.   
  
I backed slowly away from the door. I don‚Äôt need to hear this. I already felt like I was going to be sick. My eyes were wet with tears. My mate never wanted me at all. He just used me for my money. I‚Äôve got to get out of here. I turned to go back the same way I came and walked right into Beta Charles‚Äô chest. I never heard him approach. I guess I was so upset at finding out what a piece of crap my mate was, that I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.  
  
‚ÄúI knew something was off, Lina,‚Äù Storm linked me.   
  
‚ÄúWe both did, Storm,‚Äù I linked back. It was the whole reason I went to the doctor. I never suspected that my mate, who happily brought me my first cup of coffee each morning, would hurt me like this.   
  
‚ÄúCome along quietly, Melina. No need to make this harder than it has to be. He will never leave Heidi. Too bad the Goddess hated you enough to bond you two together. You are the bane of our existence. It is blasphemy for our kind to be diluted with another. It‚Äôs best we deal with you and that thing you‚Äôre carrying now,‚Äù Beta Charles stated quietly.     
  


# On The Run

Chapter 2  
  
Melina‚Äôs POV  
  
Beta Charles never called me Luna, not once in the nine weeks I‚Äôve been here. Now I knew why. I wasn‚Äôt paranoid at all. My mate was just an incredible liar. I wasn‚Äôt going to go anywhere with him. He'd kill me the first opportunity he got. I knew he was planning on taking me down to the cells. They would torture me and kill me. I'm too far away from my brother to be able to mindlink with him. I needed my phone, but I can't just waltz out to the pack hospital to get it.   
  
I did the only thing I could do. I gave a quick turn and hit him in the temple as hard as I could with my elbow. He fell heavily to the floor. This alerted Trevor and Heidi about an issue, but I believe Heidi knew I was out here. She enjoyed hurting me, so she led the conversation. She didn‚Äôt tell Trevor that I could hear what he was saying. If he knew I was here, he would have sent Heidi away. I didn‚Äôt wait around to see if my hypothesis was correct. I just ran.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt help you very much, Lina,‚Äù Storm linked me.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Storm. Save your strength, rest for now. I'll try to get us to a safe spot to rest. You can hide my scent while I sleep. We trusted Trevor, but he never deserved our love. It hurts, but I won't let him break me. He isn‚Äôt worth it,‚Äù I linked her back.   
  
‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù Storm replied before fading away.   
  
I ran through the forest. Bushes caught my clothes and tore at them. I could feel my face being scratched, along with my arms and legs. My arms bore the brunt of it. My shirt was much thinner than my jeans were, but I never slowed down. I could hear the sounds of the warriors and Trevor coming after me. I bet Trevor was furious now. Well, that‚Äôs on him. I know the real reason he never marked me. He didn‚Äôt have to wait for the Luna ceremony. He just wanted to be able to screw around with Heidi as long as he could, and not get caught.   
  
Well, now he can screw her as much as he likes. I was disgusted that he slept with her. That jerk to my virginity, yet didn‚Äôt defend me to that witch. If anyone had a nasty disease, it would be her. I hope his d\*\*k falls off. I know I‚Äôm being petty, but my anger drives me now. I hope the added strength he got from having me here disappears. I ran for miles, but I could hear them behind me. Howling as they followed me further into the forest. I knew I needed to play this smarter than I was before I became exhausted. I was running at full speed and wasting energy.   
  
I knew it was only a matter of time before I needed to feed. I was running too fast to even think about finding a small animal to drink from. Plus, if they found it, they'd know I was close. I would rather die than allow myself to be drug back to Still Waters. I kept my eyes trained ahead and focused on my path as I continued to run. I was slimmer than they were in their wolf form. I slipped through places I knew they couldn‚Äôt follow. I knew trackers had trackers out here following me. He was not planning on letting me get away.  
  
‚ÄúBaby, stop, I‚Äôm sorry, Melina. It was a one-time thing. It won‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù Trevor called out, trying to get me to stop. Now, I‚Äôm sure that Heidi and her father were the only ones who knew I had been there. She intentionally mentioned being pregnant to get me upset, that‚Äôs probably when he father walked up behind me. That confirmed that he was planning on getting rid of me this whole time. I felt sick again, but I have to keep moving forward. I refuse to allow them to kill me and my baby. I knew they would terminate my pregnancy if they caught me. The doctor didn‚Äôt even feel bad about giving me abortion pills. This whole pack was full of disgusting wolves.   
  
I see a section of broadleaf evergreens coming up, and I know what to do. I picked up more speed and jumped. I was about thirty feet in the air on a solid branch, but I can‚Äôt stop here. I have to keep jumping. Luckily, the tree next to it only had a few leaves. I could jump from tree to tree until I got to around the middle of the area. I needed a place to hide. I needed to rest and calm down. I needed to think clearly, as I had been running nonstop for two hours. I know that I have covered around a hundred miles.  
  
‚ÄúWhen we hear them, hide my scent, Storm,‚Äù I told her. I was in a great spot. About thirty-five feet up in the air. I couldn‚Äôt see them from this little nest I had made for myself. They couldn't see me if I couldn‚Äôt see them.   
  
Trevor had asked me so many questions about myself. I foolishly thought he was trying to get to know me better. I never thought it was for him to use it against me. I had to hold back the scoff. They weren‚Äôt close anymore. They were nowhere as fast as I am. Thankfully, I had lied a few times to spare his feelings. Like when he asked how fast I could run. I told him about sixty-five miles per hour at full speed. It was still much faster than a wolf, but Trevor could run about forty miles per hour in his wolf form. Even with me downplaying it, he was still upset about it. That should have been the first clue that he thought his species was better than mine.   
  
My first inkling of a problem was when we met with the packs after we arrived, to figure out where the vampires were hiding. That was our first day here, and the day we met. I was so excited about finding my mate that I ignored that he wasn‚Äôt smiling back at me. In hindsight, he seemed ashamed to admit I was his mate. I caught the looks from the other Alphas in the meeting. They weren‚Äôt happy for him, like when you meet your mate. I didn‚Äôt notice it at the time, but my brother had. He warned me to be careful.  
  
He calls me four times a week to check on me. If he calls and I don‚Äôt answer, or Trevor makes an excuse for not coming to the phone, they will be on their way by the next day. I hate that Maksim was right about Trevor. I hated being so blinded by love that I thought Trevor felt the same way about me. He has humiliated me, and I'll be happy to return to Black Adder. I'll lick my wounds privately and build my home near my parents' house. I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôll try to remember the good times, or what I thought were the good times, when I tell the baby about their father.   
  
I‚Äôll raise my baby on my own. I don‚Äôt need Trevor for anything. I‚Äôll be damned if I allow my innocent baby to go to Still Water with Trevor and Heidi. That won‚Äôt be happening. I managed to get comfortable enough to nod off. My concern now is the fact that I can‚Äôt eat. They‚Äôll be able to scent the blood from miles away. I may have outrun them for the moment, but they‚Äôre still after me. Trevor won‚Äôt give up. He can‚Äôt allow me to escape. He might be able to keep my brother at bay for a week if he can take pictures of me showing that I‚Äôm fine.   
  
But it won‚Äôt last forever. He has no idea who he‚Äôs dealing with. My brother won't allow Trevor to keep me here against my will. Neither will my family. I need to focus on staying hidden until I can find someone to allow me to use their phone to call for help. I know the scent of the Still Water pack members. I'm paying more attention now. I won‚Äôt let anyone else to sneak up on me again. I have to hang on until help arrives. It took them some time to get here. I heard them before I saw them. I could tell that at least two hours had passed. I was about two hundred feet away from them but heard them speaking clearly.   
  
‚ÄúShe couldn‚Äôt have just disappeared into thin air. Spread out and look around for her. She has to stop to rest. She was moving too fast for her not to need to rest. Even a vampire needs to stop moving to regain their strength. I know she‚Äôs around here somewhere. Start with where you lost her, and focus. We can‚Äôt lose her. I have an SUV coming out to pick us up. The team in the SUV will stay behind to search overnight,‚Äù Trevor announced.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre not on the graveyard shift looking for that parasite,‚Äù one of the trackers said with a laugh.   
  
‚ÄúYeah, that leech will probably off at least two of them. I don‚Äôt want to be around to see her in action,‚Äù another warrior replied with a fake shiver of fear.   
  
‚ÄúAgreed, that vein sucker is about to meet her end, and I‚Äôm glad. I hate having to look at her. She reminds me that our friends got slaughtered every time I look at her. She disgusts me. I don‚Äôt know what the Goddess thought when she paired you with her. She made a big mistake doing that. She is the shame of our pack,‚Äù another replied.   
  
‚ÄúJust keep your noses peeled for the scent of blood. She's going to have to feed. She went to the doctor mid-afternoon. They always make her wait; I thought I had more time. I should've known that Melina would have come to tell me she was pregnant. I don‚Äôt know what she heard, but Beta Charles is in the hospital. She caught him by surprise when he caught her eavesdropping. We need to find her, and quickly. Her brother will be calling here tomorrow. If I can‚Äôt prove she‚Äôs okay, he will tear the pack apart looking for her. We can‚Äôt let them come here. If you thought those rogue vampires were dangerous, you haven‚Äôt seen the power their group wields. We can‚Äôt beat them, we have to find her,‚Äù Trevor stressed.   
  
There was a faint honk in the distance. ‚ÄúTheir here. I will stay here, and you guys wait for me. I need to give them their instructions,‚Äù Trevor stated.   
  
As soon as they were gone, Trevor called out to me. ‚ÄúMelina, I know you are hiding from us. You need to come down now; otherwise, when we find you, we‚Äôll kill you. Stop causing issues, and come to me. I don‚Äôt know what you think you heard, but I can explain everything.‚Äù It took his men five minutes to get to where we are. I didn‚Äôt respond, and he sighed and gave them their orders.   
  
‚ÄúFind her. I believe she's hiding somewhere close. Either in the brush or the trees. Stay together. Shoot her if you need to, to get her down. Then kill her. Make it look like an animal attack. Don't leave evidence behind. Injure her, then leave her alive for a bear, or mountain lion to finish, but don‚Äôt let her get leave here alive,‚Äù my mate advised.   
  


# You Were Warned

Chapter 3  
  
Trevor‚Äôs POV  
  
This situation is horrible. Yesterday started so well. Melina still adored me, and Heidi did whatever I asked because she's utterly jealous of Melina. She has reason to be. Melina is gorgeous. She is smart, funny, and strong. She would have made a good Luna if she had come before those rogue vampires. Once they killed off four of our pack members, we all hated vampires. I lost my best friend, Drake, to those dirty blood suckers.    
  
I would have rejected her on the spot. She and her team hadn‚Äôt dealt with the rogue vampire's problem yet. We needed them to stay here. We were defenseless against them. Why on earth would I have rejected her? Her team would have just left us in danger. We would have all died. Plus, she was hot. Even if she was a blood sucker, you really couldn‚Äôt tell it at first glance. She and her brother even had a slight tan. Things were unusual with her. So, I decided to learn as much about her as I could. It‚Äôs always best to know your enemy. So, that‚Äôs what I set out to do.  
  
The first thing I wanted to know was how she knew I was her mate. She looked right at me and walked right up to me. I hadn‚Äôt even wanted to acknowledge her as being my mate, yet she knew. I found out about her mother getting pregnant by a blood sucker while she was still a she-wolf. I didn‚Äôt realize that it was even possible. She said that they got their wolf counterpart the day she and her twin turned sixteen.  
  
I learned she could be in the sun for hours without being hurt. Out there in the forest, she was protected. It was overcast again today, so she will be fine again. I hated that they didn't find her. How could she still be on the loose? She should have already been found and dealt with. I wanted her gone in the worst way. She was now a liability to me. She would tell them what I had done and what I said. Her brother can‚Äôt stand me. I know he doesn‚Äôt because he approached me while the rest of her team congratulated her.  
  
‚ÄúSo, Melina is your mate? You sure about that?‚Äù Maksim asked slowly.   
  
‚ÄúAccording to my wolf,‚Äù I replied. I didn‚Äôt want her, and wasn't planning on claiming her. I didn‚Äôt care what my wolf, Dane, said.  
  
‚ÄúI get the feeling that you have something against us, Trevor. Do you have a problem with us? Because we can leave. I can transfer the money right back to you. We don‚Äôt have to be here, especially since you don't like us. We do this to protect people. We provide a service that others can‚Äôt. These rogues won‚Äôt stop unless they get stopped. But if we‚Äôre causing you problems, just let me know. We can be out of here in less than an hour,‚Äù Maksim told me. He was serious, and the other Alphas started glaring at me. I hadn‚Äôt rejected her. He asked, and I answered.  
  
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here. People are dying. I've lost several warriors in my pack. It's a serious situation. We need your help. Please don‚Äôt leave us,‚Äù I begged. The other Alphas relaxed, and I felt relief. I needed them to stay here and kill the rogues that were killing off our packs.  
  
‚ÄúAn impassioned plea. Except you never mentioned your mate. I‚Äôm going to give you a piece of free advice, Trevor. Melina is my twin. We have an incredible bond. If you hurt her, you'll be answering to me for it. I won‚Äôt step back and allow you to take my sister‚Äôs joy away from her. She is blissfully happy right now. Make sure it stays that way. If not, I will return. I will take my sister back and punish whoever took her joy away. It won‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs you or a she-wolf. Make sure my sister stays happy, Trevor, or I swear the next time I return, you won‚Äôt see me coming,‚Äù Maksim told me.   
  
I shuddered at the memory because I know what‚Äôs coming. Maksim wasn‚Äôt just saying those words for fun. He meant every one of them. I'd told Heidi, but she laughed it off. She didn‚Äôt hear what he said. He wasn‚Äôt joking. He was dead serious. That is why I instructed my men to tear her apart. We can‚Äôt have them finding out we were involved. Maksim might get suspicious, but he won‚Äôt be able to prove anything. I hope he leaves Heidi alone, but as much as she lets her mouth run, I doubt that will happen.   
  
I must admit, my wolf, Dane, wanted Melina despite her being one of them. He seemed to be very enamored of Melina and Storm. He hated being with Heidi, but I slept with my mate, against my will. He can sleep with Heidi, against his. How did he expect me to fall in love with Melina? She was attractive and had a great body, but that was it. I needed more.  
  
‚ÄúLike Heidi‚Äôs a prize?‚Äù Dane huffed out.   
  
‚ÄúI never said she was perfect, but we have been together for almost ten years. Her voice can get whiny, but she cares for me,‚Äù I rebutted.   
  
‚ÄúNo, Heidi cares for herself. You may have been together since you were fifteen, but she was with others before you. Our mate waited for us. Yet, you refuse to accept her. You‚Äôve lied to her this whole time. I‚Äôm not going to be a part of it. You are drugging your mate to suppress her. I can‚Äôt support you doing this to mate. Melina is the only mate I will accept. The Goddess gave her to us. She‚Äôs ours,‚Äù Dane responded.   
  
‚ÄúYou know as well as I do that the pack hates her,‚Äù I scoffed.  
  
‚ÄúThey hate her because Heidi runs around here telling lies, and getting them worked up. It would have set the pack straight if you had manned up and claimed her initially. They would have accepted her because you did. You dragged your feet. The pack saw how you treated her‚Äîhiding her away, allowing her to be disrespected. They did the same thing you did. Heidi told the pack you hated Melina. They felt it was acceptable to judge her as well. It was as good as an admission backing Heidi, but not your mate. You don‚Äôt deserve her, but I want her. If you ruin this for me, Trevor, I swear, I'll make you sorry,‚Äù Dane replied before disappearing.  
  
I mindlinked my men in the forest to see if they had found her. I already knew they hadn‚Äôt. Otherwise, they would have linked me to tell me. I‚Äôd mindlinked them before I went to bed last night if they succeeded in finding and ending Melina. I would give them each five thousand dollars. The irony of it being her own money to pay for her murder wasn‚Äôt lost on me.  
  
I need results, and I need them fast. I felt Heidi‚Äôs hand grip my shoulder to pull herself up. I screwed up again. I allowed her to spend the night here. If Maksim comes into our home, looking for Melina. He will be able to tell that Heidi spent the night here. Her scent is strong here. Why did I let her talk me into this? She isn‚Äôt scared of him at all. She is being unreasonable and laying her claim on me, while I still have a mate.  
  
‚ÄúStop worrying, Trevor. Everything‚Äôs fine. We can spin this any way we want. No one will ever know any different. How could they? We‚Äôll tell them Melina found someone else and left you. She went into the forest independently, and we can show them the proof. We can show you running after her to save her. Either way, they can‚Äôt prove any different. She probably got lost and has already been killed. I‚Äôve got your back. I won‚Äôt let Melina‚Äôs family come in here and start anything,‚Äù Heidi cooed at me. Her words made sense. She was right. How could they possibly know?  
  
Melina could mindlink and telepathy with her brother, but they were limited because of the distance between where her family lived and here. She had no phone to contact them. She had no money, and we hadn‚Äôt seen anyone while we were out and about. I felt guilty about wishing she were dead, but that would be the best-case scenario in this. Then I could pretend to be sad that I lost my mate and child. I could stay on their good side, and see if they will give me the funds I need to get my pack how I wanted it. I don‚Äôt see a downside to this.   
  
‚ÄúI am sending another team out to replace you. Stay until they arrive. Send out your GPS coordinates for them to be able to find you. We need to find her, even if it's just to recover her body. We must prove that her death was not on us,‚Äù I mindlinked my warriors in the forest.   
  
I felt better now. Much more relaxed than I was. Heidi was right. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about. I'd just started kissing Heidi when Melina‚Äôs phone began to ring. The screen lit up with MAKS on it. Shelley had brought it to Heidi at dinner last night, as Melina had left it behind. Time to face the music. It would take them twenty-four hours to get here anyway. They would have to pack up and get tickets to fly out here. Driving would also take them a while, too. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Melina will be dead by the time they arrive.   
  
I calmed myself down again and answered the phone on the third ring. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLet me speak to my sister,‚Äù Maksim‚Äôs voice growled out of the phone.   
  
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. A misunderstanding occurred yesterday, and Melina ran off into the woods. We're still trying to locate her. I have a team out there overnight, one heading out to relieve them now. Don‚Äôt worry, Maksim, we‚Äôre going to find her. Give me two days to get her safely back to the pack,‚Äù I replied smoothly.   
  
‚ÄúWrong answer, Trevor. Let me guess. Did this alleged misunderstanding between you and Melina occur because of your Beta‚Äôs slutty daughter again?‚Äù Maksim asked.   
  
Shit, she told him. I told Melina that she had nothing to worry about, but she still mentioned Heidi to him. This is not good. What made it worse was that I had him on speaker phone so Heidi could hear the conversation. Her quick intake of breath alerted him that we were here together.   
  
‚ÄúSo, I see I‚Äôm correct. If you don‚Äôt want us to level your pack, you had better find my sister quickly. The only way we won‚Äôt level your pack is if you safely return my sister to us, unharmed. Anything other than that, and you can assume that we will deal with you and your pack, per the werewolf laws.‚Äù Maksim‚Äôs voice let me know that he was prepared to back it up.   
  
I frantically tried to search my mind, trying to remember what the punishment would be. I was too scared to think at the moment, but Heidi‚Äôs low gasp told me that whatever it was, it wouldn‚Äôt be good.   
  
Maksim spoke again, this time with a warning: ‚ÄúFind her, now, Trevor.‚Äù Then the call dropped. My heart was frantically beating. I looked at Heidi, but now she was just as terrified as I was. We have to find Melina",1,1746687554.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúPlease say this is for me?‚Äù I groan, snatching up the coffee cup sitting on the edge of Jane‚Äôs desk.¬†  
  
‚ÄúYou know it!‚Äù she replies with a grin as she shuffles her paperwork into a neat pile in front of her. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúUrgg, you don‚Äôt know the half of it.‚Äù I answer, dropping the pile of files in my hands and throwing myself down onto my chair.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt you go home last night? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure you were wearing this same pantsuit ensemble yesterday.‚Äù she questions, eyeing me up and down as she clicks her pen repeatedly in her hand.¬†  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me s\*\*t over my pantsuit! I love this pantsuit.‚Äù I say defensively whilst opening up my laptop.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOkay, okay, ugly suit aside‚Ä¶ the real issue is the fact you pulled another all-nighter! What the hell, Abby? You-‚Äú¬†  
  
‚ÄúI know Jane, but you don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm so f\*\*\*\*\*g close to catching this guy. I have to be ready.‚Äù I protest. ‚ÄúAs soon as he resurfaces, his ass is mine. I‚Äôve got him on first degree murder and witness tampering. I just have to find where the bastard is hiding first.‚Äù¬†  
  
I let out a deep breath and rub my tired eyes before clicking on the internet icon on my desktop.¬†  
  
Jane sighs in defeat. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan then?‚Äù she asks seriously.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOne of my informants has some information for me. I‚Äôll meet up with him later and find out if he‚Äôs full of s\*\*t or not.‚Äù¬†¬†I shrug, staring at the swirling icon in front of me as the screen buffers over and over again. ‚ÄúThe guy is easily spooked though. He only ever wants to meet at night- f\*\*\*\*\*g hell‚Ä¶ What the hell is wrong with this thing?!‚Äù I moan, clicking on the icon again furiously.¬†  
  
Jane laughs out loud, shaking her head as she reaches for her own coffee.¬†  
  
‚ÄúSomeone has some serious rage to work out‚Ä¶ or maybe someone just reallyyyy needs to get laid.‚Äù she states, raising her eyebrow at me playfully.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWhat I need is some decent WiFi in this place.‚Äù I quip in return.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHa, well there‚Äôs that! But speaking of getting laid, you better not be blowing off my cousin and your date tonight because you are meeting an informant! I told you, no excuses!‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúJane‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know if tonight is the right time. This case is coming to a head. Maybe if I just postpone-‚Äú  
  
‚ÄúAbsolutely not, Abby Sullivan!!‚Äù she interrupts¬†¬†sternly. ‚ÄúThat would make it the third time you have blown him off! Blind date or not, he‚Äôs not going to hang around forever!‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI know, but-‚Äú¬†  
  
‚ÄúThe Russian mafia will still be there in the morning‚Ä¶. More to the point, so will your drought rage if you keep this up! No buts! You‚Äôre going!‚Äù she states matter of factly. ‚ÄúBut Christ, don‚Äôt wear that pantsuit‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúFine! If it will shut you up, I‚Äôll go! But let me say this‚Ä¶ the way you are genuinely pushing for me to hop into bed with your cousin is f\*\*\*\*\*g alarming and slightly on the creepy side‚Ä¶‚Äù I state, giving up on the computer and opening up the case file instead.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a total catch, if I don‚Äôt say so myself, and I want my best friend to have the very best! Sue me!‚Äù she replies, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúAnyway, he‚Äôs a helluva big improvement on that last weirdo you dated a couple of months ago‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPaul? Weirdo? What was wrong with Paul?!‚Äù I shrug nonchalantly, scanning my eyes over the face of the man I‚Äôm hunting once again.¬†  
  
‚ÄúUhhh, come on Abby! He was the ultimate Mama‚Äôs boy!! He was a walking red flag, my friend.‚Äù¬†  
  
I have no choice but to nod my head in surrender. She‚Äôs f\*\*\*\*\*g right after all.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI have to give you that one‚Ä¶ if I had to listen to him say just one more time‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how my mom makes spaghetti‚Ä¶.‚Äù I swear I might have thrown myself into the Hudson.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù she chuckles, clearly very pleased that she has made her point. ‚ÄúSo meet your informant later. Go home. Take a shower and throw on something sexy! You‚Äôve worked your ass off all week and you deserve it!‚Äù¬†  
  
I look up at her and nod in an non- committal kind of way.¬†  
  
‚ÄúAhhht!! I know every trick in the book. I want you to say the actual words.‚Äù she smiles, holding her hand up to her ear.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOkay, There will be a date tonight and I will be on it. Happy?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúNot as happy as you will be if this date goes to plan‚Ä¶‚Äù she answers suggestively.¬†  
  
‚ÄúAgain‚Ä¶ creepy.‚Äù I point out, my eyes returning to the file.¬†  
  
Just then, I feel a presence behind me and the scent of familiar perfume enters my nostrils.¬†  
  
Great. This day just keeps getting better and better‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúHey Abby! How are you? I heard you were in all night last night.‚Äù¬†  
  
I turn around in my chair and look up at the blonde smiling sweetly at me.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine thanks. A little tired, but I‚Äôll live.‚Äù I joke in reply.¬†  
  
I watch as she sweeps her hair behind her ear nervously before placing a cardboard box down on my desk.¬†  
  
‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm glad to hear it‚Ä¶ I actually came down because I thought this might be of use to you. It‚Äôs a new laptop.‚Äù she states, pulling it from the box to set it down in front of me. ‚ÄúWe got some new equipment up in the cyber department and we had one spare. I asked if I could pass it down to you since I know that yours is pretty old.‚Äù she laughs, her cheeks flushing slightly.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uhh that was really thoughtful of you Sadie. I‚Äôll take it, thanks.‚Äù I answer in reply.¬†  
  
Her face lights up in a bright smile and her shoulders drop in relief.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOh good- It‚Äôs all set up for you. You just have to-‚Äú¬†  
  
‚ÄúSadie? What are you doing down here, sweetie?‚Äù a voice interrupts from behind us.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHi Cal, I just came down to give Abby this new laptop. We had a spare one and I thought-‚Äú¬†  
  
‚ÄúDid you ask the captain first?‚Äù Calvin asks, stopping beside Sadie and examining the new equipment on my desk curiously.¬†  
  
God, he‚Äôs such a kiss-ass.¬†  
  
‚ÄúShe cleared it with Moss‚Äù I answer abruptly, throwing him a fake smile.¬†  
  
He looks at me suspiciously for a long moment before nodding his head and turning back to Sadie.¬†  
  
‚ÄúYou better get back to work now, sweetie. I have some case stuff to go over with Abby.‚Äù he states, kissing her on the side of the head.¬†  
  
Her eyes connect with mine awkwardly before she smiles sweetly once again.¬†  
  
‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre right. Good luck with the case guys. If you need anything from cyber, I‚Äôd be happy to help.‚Äù  
  
I nod my head and manage to smile in return before she turns to Calvin.¬†  
  
‚ÄúShall we head home at 6pm?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there.‚Äù he answers as she walks across the office back towards the elevators.¬†  
  
It‚Äôs then that he looks to me and his face turns serious once again.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWhat have you got for me, Abs?‚Äù¬†  
  
What have I got for him?‚Ä¶ For him?¬†  
  
As if this asshole hasn‚Äôt taken enough from me already.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWell Cal, I‚Äôve set up a meet tonight with a contact of mine. I‚Äôm meeting him at 7pm-‚Äú  
  
‚ÄúWait? It‚Äôs not that little snivelling weasel, Sven is it?‚Äù he asks, picking up the file from my desk and flicking through it.  
  
‚ÄúYes, it is actually-‚Äú¬†  
  
‚ÄúThen I‚Äòll go. That guy give me the creeps. I‚Äôll take O‚ÄôConnell with me.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúCal, it‚Äôs my lead. I‚Äôm perfectly capable of meeting a contact. Besides, he doesn‚Äôt like you. I‚Äôll get more out of him if I go.‚Äù I snap back angrily.¬†  
  
‚ÄúAbs, this isn‚Äôt a debate. Captain made me lead on this case. That means I have the final say. If you have a problem with that, then take it up with him.‚Äù he answers, placing the file back down in front of me.¬†  
  
God, this asshole really does know how to push my buttons. He knows fine well that I‚Äôm not about to go crying to Captain Moss like some silly little girl who can‚Äôt handle following a direct order.¬†  
  
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just tell your wife you would meet her to head home at 6pm?‚Äù Jane interjects, throwing Cal a judgemental glare.¬†  
  
He narrows his eyes at her in reply.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Sadie will understand. Thanks for your concern though, Jane.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúNo worries.‚Äù she replies, with a wide fake smile.¬†  
  
They stare each other down for a second longer before his eyes return to me expectantly.¬†  
  
‚ÄúFine, Cal. Do what you want. He will be in the usual spot.‚Äù I concede, opening up the new laptop that Sadie gave me and doing my best to ignore the gigantic asshole standing beside me.¬†  
  
‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll give you a call if anything goes down...‚Äù he states as he begins to walk away. ‚Äú‚Ä¶and get some sleep, Abs. You‚Äôre no use to anyone exhausted.‚Äù¬†  
  
I stick up my middle finger behind his back in response before tapping my fingers on the keyboard to enter my password.¬†  
  
‚ÄúAsshole.‚Äù I mutter under my breath.¬†  
  
It‚Äôs then that Jane begins to laugh and I give her the side eye.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúNothing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt know how you do it, Abby. Working with your ex-husband and his new little trophy wife everyday‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have had some serious issues by now if it was me. I‚Äôm telling you.‚Äù she states, shaking her head in awe.¬†  
  
‚ÄúYeah, well, it‚Äôs all old news now. Calvin‚Äôs a prick, but I‚Äôve worked my ass off here. I won‚Äôt let him push me out of this precinct that‚Äôs for sure. He‚Äôs free to f\*\*k off whenever he feels like it though‚Äù I state, my insides doing a somersault when the internet pops up instantly on my computer.¬†  
  
‚ÄúAnd so you shouldn‚Äôt. I just admire your patience that‚Äôs all. Especially when his new wife is trying to suck up your ass every opportunity she gets. It‚Äôs so f\*\*\*\*\*g strange.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúSadie? She‚Äôs harmless.‚Äù I reply distractedly, my brain trying to return to work mode.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôd hardly say she‚Äôs harmless, maybe clueless‚Ä¶ the ink was hardly dry on your divorce papers before they announced their engagement!‚Äù¬†  
  
I shrug my shoulders in reply.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI was done with him anyway. She‚Äôs welcome to him. Believe me.‚Äù I state honestly.¬†  
  
I‚Äôm not lying at all when I say this. Sure at one time in my life I was madly in love with the man, but the truth is our marriage was over long before we split up. That‚Äôs why when he announced his engagement to Sadie so soon after, I wasn‚Äôt the least bit bothered nor surprised.¬†  
  
Calvin and I were high school sweethearts and married young. We both shared the same aspirations and dreams. We came up together in the academy and even worked alongside one another as we both tried to make detective. It wasn‚Äôt long after we reached that goal that our marriage began to deteriorate rapidly. We called it quits and our divorce was finalised just over two years ago. He and Sadie announced their engagement and pregnancy only six months later. At the time I‚Äôm sure people thought I would break. That I would give in and move along like a good little ex-wife but giving up is not my style. This place and this job means too damn much to me and I‚Äôm not about to let it go for anyone. I have the respect of my co-workers and my captain, not to mention a s\*\*t load of work and open cases still to solve.¬†  
  
‚ÄúLook on the bright side Abby, now that you don‚Äôt have to go to the meet you can go home early and do something about all this.‚Äù Jane continues, waving her hand dramatically over my disheveled appearance.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ now let me get back to work. These assholes aren‚Äôt going to arrest themselves.‚Äù I joke, throwing Jane a playful wink.¬†  
  


# Club Kaluna

Abby‚Äôs POV   
  
I stop in front of Carlos‚Äô Italian restaurant and smooth out my long brown hair, which is lightly curled at the ends, before I peer through the large window.   
  
There, sitting at table six, is my date for this evening and Jane‚Äôs cousin, Doctor Landon Bell. Jane wasn‚Äôt exaggerating when she described him as good looking. His sun-kissed, blonde, floppy hair is swooped behind his ears neatly, framing his clean- shaven handsome face perfectly. He reminds me of those guys you see on Australian soap operas, with their tall statures and tanned forearms, holding onto their surfboards tightly before they run off into the Pacific.   
  
It‚Äôs then that his eyes connect with mine through the window and I‚Äôm knocked out of my daydream back to reality. I offer him a small wave and he smiles widely in return. Maybe tonight won‚Äôt be so bad after all. Sure, it‚Äôs s\*\*t that Calvin practically stole my lead from under my nose, but I can think of worse consolation prizes than spending a night chatting with Landon. I make my way into the restaurant and walk towards the table, smiling as Landon stands up to greet me.   
  
‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs nice to finally meet you, Abby.‚Äù he states with a grin, putting his hand out towards me.   
  
I take it firmly and shake.   
  
‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôve heard so much about you already.‚Äù I chuckle, leaning in to land a kiss on his cheek.   
  
He laughs in return, taking his seat again across from mine.   
  
‚ÄúYeah, Jane has been trying to set this up for a while, huh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôve had to reschedule a couple of times. Work has just been so crazy.‚Äù I say apologetically.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs alright. I know the feeling.‚Äù he laughs warmly.   
  
‚ÄúOh of course. Jane says you work in the ER. You must be so busy, thanks for putting up with me.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem. Really. It seems that you were worth the wait.‚Äù he says smoothly.   
  
I smile as I take my heavy coat off to hang it over my chair. As I do so, I don‚Äôt miss how his green eyes quickly flick over the outfit I‚Äôve chosen for tonight. A black silk camisole top with a cowl neckline and black skintight jeans. As far as sexy outfits are concerned, this is as far as I‚Äôm willing to go on a cold New York evening.   
  
‚ÄúYou look stunning, by the way. Is it okay to say that?‚Äù he asks with a cautious smile.   
  
I nod my head and shrug a little.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard worse lines.‚Äù   
  
He smiles again just as the waiter brings over our menus and we proceed to make some small talk as we look over what‚Äôs on offer. The truth is I‚Äôve eaten here before. Many times in fact when I was married to Calvin. Despite this, it didn‚Äôt bother me when Landon suggested this restaurant as a place to eat. I don‚Äôt feel any sentimentality towards it and now I‚Äôm safe in the knowledge that Cal is too busy to show up here tonight with Sadie, I can eat in peace.   
  
Just then, as if on cue, my phone begins ringing loudly in my jacket, cutting Landon off mid- sentence.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about this.‚Äù I say sincerely, reaching into my pocket to look at the screen which is displaying Calvin‚Äôs name clearly.   
  
Speak of the devil and he shall appear.   
  
‚ÄúYou can take it if you want. Please do, if it‚Äôs important.‚Äù Landon encourages kindly.  
  
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll have to take you up on that. I‚Äôll just be a minute.‚Äù I say, getting up from the table to walk over to the quiet corner of the restaurant.   
  
\*  
  
\*  
  
\*  
  
‚ÄúHello‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúAbby, where are you?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Sven. He says he won‚Äôt say a word unless you are here in person.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I was right then..‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYeah, you were right. Now can you get here in the next ten minutes?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúMore like fifteen. I‚Äôm at Carlos‚Äô restaurant.‚Äù   
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶ what are you doing there?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúIs it any of your business? I‚Äôll be there as soon as I can.‚Äù   
  
\*  
  
\*  
  
\*  
  
I take a deep breath and walk back to the table, but before I can open my mouth, Landon nods at me in understanding.   
  
‚ÄúYou have to leave, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry. Honestly, if I could get out of it I would, but it‚Äôs really important-‚Äú   
  
‚ÄúListen, you don‚Äôt have to apologise. We can try again another time. One more attempt can‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù he says, standing up to help me with my coat.   
  
‚ÄúThanks for being so understanding. It means a lot. I‚Äôll give you a call then?‚Äù I ask hopefully.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù he answers with a grin.   
  
I smile in reply before turning to leave the restaurant in a hurry. As soon as I burst out onto the street, I take off into a run. Navigating these crowded sidewalks in six inch heels isn‚Äôt for the faint hearted, but having lived here my whole life I‚Äôve gotten used to it. It isn‚Äôt long before I spot the meeting place up ahead and see Mick O‚ÄôConnell, Cal‚Äôs partner and best friend standing waiting for my arrival.   
  
‚ÄúLooking sharp, Sully.‚Äù he jokes, using my old nickname from the academy. ‚ÄúTake it we interrupted some special plans?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYes, you did actually. Although, this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Cal hadn‚Äôt insisted on leaving me out of the loop. Where is he?‚Äù   
  
Mick points his head back into the alleyway behind him.   
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs with Sven now. Be careful though, Sully. He looks edgy as f\*\*k tonight.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúCal or Sven?‚Äù I mutter under my breath causing Mick to chuckle to himself a little.   
  
I walk down the alleyway and spot the top of Sven‚Äôs head behind a dumpster whilst Cal  
  
stands there with his hands resting on his hips as he watches me approach.   
  
‚ÄúWere you on a date?‚Äù he asks, eyeing me up and down.   
  
I purposely ignore him and look towards Sven who is huddled in a corner looking around nervously.   
  
‚ÄúSven, I‚Äôm here. It‚Äôs Abby. We spoke on the phone last night. You said you had information for me.‚Äù   
  
His eyes connect with mine and a cold sensation immediately runs down my back.   
  
Is it just me or do his irises look red under these street lights?   
  
Damn, maybe I am exhausted...  
  
I think to myself, as I brush off the unsettling feeling.   
  
‚ÄúHave you got my p\*\*\*\*\*t?‚Äù he asks shiftily.   
  
I nod my head to Calvin who produces a few notes from his pocket which he then hands over to Sven. We both watch as he counts the cash before stuffing it in his pocket.   
  
‚ÄúCome on, Sven. We aren‚Äôt going to wait around all night.‚Äù Calvin says in irritation.   
  
His brashness makes me want to give him a smack across the head. I don‚Äôt exactly like dealing with informants myself, but keeping them onside is crucial to gaining good intel.   
  
As predicted, Sven looks at him angrily, narrowing his red tinged eyes.   
  
‚ÄúSpeak to me like that again and I‚Äôm gone-‚Äú   
  
‚ÄúSven, ignore him. Tell me what you know. Yuri Pavel‚Ä¶ where is he hiding?‚Äù   
  
He shakes his head and looks around again before leaning in closer.   
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he is hiding, but the rumour is he will be in club Kaluna tonight.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me one of the country‚Äôs most wanted criminals is coming out of hiding for a night on the town? Are you kidding me, Sven?‚Äù Calvin asks in disbelief.   
  
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt f\*\*\*\*\*g talking to you!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShhh.‚Äù I scold them both, taking another step towards Sven. ‚ÄúWhy is Yuri going to club Kaluna?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúTo meet with some business associates. They want to meet in a public place and he has no choice. He won‚Äôt be there long though. If you want to catch him, you‚Äôll have to move now.‚Äù Sven answers, glancing at his watch.   
  
‚ÄúShit.‚Äù Calvin mutters, walking away to make the call for back up.   
  
If this intel is true and Yuri is making an appearance tonight, then there is no way he will be there without a small army in tow. We need a SWAT team in place and we need it now.   
  
‚ÄúThanks, Sven. Lay low for a while and be careful.‚Äù I say before Mick comes over to escort him away.   
  
‚ÄúLook out lady. Yuri has a way of always getting what he wants. He won‚Äôt go down without bringing cha.os and destruction first. I hope you‚Äôre ready for it.‚Äù he finishes before walking down the alleyway and disappearing around the corner.   
  
I understand what he is saying, but I‚Äôm way too pumped to feel any sort of fear. I‚Äôll be careful and methodical of course, but I‚Äôm not going to back down from this fight. This animal needs to be put away once and for all.   
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get out of here, come on.‚Äù Calvin orders, hanging up the phone and taking off towards his car as I follow on behind him.   
  
\*\*\*  
  
I adjust the strap under my chin and tug my armoured vest in place before gripping the gun in my hand securely.   
  
The van comes to an abrupt halt and before I can blink, the doors are thrown open with a loud, almighty crash.   
  
‚ÄúGO, GO, GO!‚Äù Calvin‚Äôs voice calls out authoritatively, causing everyone to shuffle out into the open street.   
  
Screams permeate the air in every direction as the entrance to the busy club is breached within seconds. Nightclub revellers jump out of the way in a panic, creating a pathway into the thick of the busy dance floor. I hold my gun in the air and scan my surroundings, drawing on my tactical training as I work with my team to locate the target. I know every nook and cranny of this asshole‚Äôs face. I‚Äôve stared at his picture for three months straight and if he‚Äôs here, I‚Äôll find him.   
  
‚ÄúANYONE HAVE EYES ON YURI?!  
  
‚ÄúNEGATIVE.‚Äù   
  
It‚Äôs then that my eyes travel across the opposite side of the room and I see Anton, Yuri‚Äôs righthand man pointing a gun in my direction.   
  
‚ÄúEVERYONE GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!‚Äù I call out loudly, causing the screams to grow louder over the thumping beat of the music.   
  
I grab the woman nearest me and shove her to the floor just as a bullet whizzes by to hit the wall behind me.   
  
‚ÄúTHEY ARE IN THE BACK RIGHT HAND CORNER!‚Äù I call out.   
  
‚ÄúMAKE SURE THE EXITS ARE SECURE! AND GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE!‚Äù Calvin calls out through the earpiece to the team behind us as he takes off in pursuit. Anton fires a few more shots towards us before ordering his team of men to form a human shield infront of him. Between their large bodies, I can see movement in the background and immediately notice Yuri‚Äôs bright white hair as he saunters off to a hidden door within the nightclub wall.   
  
‚ÄúYURI IS HERE!‚Äù I announce over the system, proceeding to push scared citizens towards the exits as we make our advance.   
  
It‚Äôs then that Yuri‚Äôs army begin to retreat backwards, following their boss through the same doorway which they slam shut just as we make it to their location.   
  
‚ÄúBREAK IT DOWN!‚Äù Calvin orders, as two men step forward with a battering ram to do just that.   
  
As the door buckles under the pressure, I prepare myself for the battle that is about to take place. I‚Äôve been shot at before, but something tells me this is going to be on a whole other level.   
  
‚ÄúGO!‚Äù   
  
I follow the others through the door and straight into the sound of oncoming fire as Yuri and his goons attempt to make their escape.   
  
I fire back in response, taking cover against the concrete wall that thankfully juts out in places. As we advance forward, I realise that Yuri is nowhere to be seen. His men are doing their best to hold us back but Yuri is either way far ahead of them or he isn‚Äôt in this corridor at all.   
  
I cast my eyes down to the floor as I take a few steps forward amongst the car.nage and see there is a hatch in the floorboards under our feet.   
  
‚ÄúHE MIGHT HAVE GONE DOWN!‚Äù I call out to Cal.   
  
‚ÄúGO! MICK, GO WITH HER!‚Äù he answers between return shots.   
  
I pull the latch up and make my way down the dusty old steps into a cellar of some sort.   
  
The sound of gunfire rings out over our heads as we reach the floor.   
  
‚ÄúNYPD! IF THERE IS ANYONE DOWN HERE, SURRENDER WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR AND YOU WILL NOT BE HARMED!‚Äù I shout out into the darkness.   
  
Just then, the same cold sensation from earlier makes its way down my back and I freeze in place, holding my gun steady as I twist to my left. There, I see two red tinged eyes staring back at me.  
  
‚ÄúI have eyes on Yuri.‚Äù I mutter quietly, as he steps out into the slim patch of light that filters in from the floor above.   
  
‚ÄúPut your hands up and get down on your knees. Slowly.‚Äù I order, pointing my gun at him directly.   
  
His face contorts into a smile and it‚Äôs then I realise just how young he looks, considering he is the head of a criminal empire that spans across the globe. He lifts his hands up, running one through his white blonde hair before holding them both in the air.   
  
‚ÄúNow get down.‚Äù I direct him, pointing the barrel of my gun downwards.   
  
‚ÄúNow, that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid I cannot do, Detective Sullivan.‚Äù he says calmly.   
  
He knows my name? What the fu-  
  
Before I can answer, a gun fires from behind us and Mick drops to the ground with a loud yelp in pain. I spin around quickly to see Anton, pointing a gun towards me.   
  
Where the f\*\*k did he come from!?   
  
I fire at him immediately, but it‚Äôs already too late. He has taken off in a run down another pitch black corridor.   
  
I turn back to Yuri and see that he has completely disappeared too.   
  
‚ÄúMICK IS DOWN. WE NEED BACKUP NOW!‚Äù I yell, bending down to examine his leg wound.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, Sully! Get the bastards! I‚Äôll send the back up after you!‚Äù he winces, pointing his head towards the dark corridor.   
  
I nod my head and take off running into the darkness after them. A slither of light up ahead becomes larger and I see the shadows of Yuri and Anton climbing another set of stairs.  
  
I fire my gun at them repeatedly and watch as they disappear out of sight.   
  
Shit.   
  
I run for the steps and take them two at a time, bursting back into the now empty club as the music still thumps away in the background.   
  
I look upwards and see Yuri and Anton on the terrace up above, disappearing behind another door. I take off after them without a second thought.   
  
‚ÄúCAL! THEY ARE ON THE TOP FLOOR!‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM ON THE WAY TO YOU NOW! DON‚ÄôT LOSE THEM, ABS!‚Äù   
  
I follow his orders, climbing another set of steps rapidly. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever moved so quickly in my entire life, especially considering how physically exhausted I am. I‚Äôm running on pure adrenaline and rage at the minute it would seem.   
  
I throw open the door and look around another empty corridor. f\*\*k.   
  
‚ÄúI‚ÄôVE LOST VISUAL.‚Äù I report, holding my gun ready in position as I carefully make my way across the floorboards.   
  
I stop and focus carefully on listening, just as a door slams up ahead.   
  
I take off in a run once again and tug the door open, feeling fresh air hit against my face instantly. I find myself at the bottom of another set of steps, leading up onto the roof this time.   
  
‚ÄúTHE ROOF, CAL‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúIM ALMOST THERE!‚Äù   
  
I climb the steps quickly and throw myself out of the way of an oncoming bullet as it flies towards me.   
  
I land on the stone roof with a thud and look up just in time to see Anton drop his hand down by his side before stepping up onto the ledge beside Yuri. I roll over enough to grab my gun and point it in their direction, firing the weapon into the cold night air. A couple of bullets hit their intended targets, before both men suddenly disappear from sight, dropping over the edge of the tall building.   
  
Did I just kill both of them?  
  
I stumble onto my feet, helped up by Cal who has now appeared with three others in tow.   
  
‚ÄúWHERE?‚Äù he asks abruptly.   
  
I point my finger straight ahead.   
  
‚ÄúI hit them both!‚Äù I pant out exhaustedly, as we run over to the ledge.   
  
To my surprise, as I look downwards, I don‚Äôt see what I expect to see at all. Instead of two bodies, all that‚Äôs there is an empty alleyway.   
  
‚ÄúWhere are they? They couldn‚Äôt have jumped from this height without getting hurt, Abs? You couldn‚Äôt have hit them either.‚Äù Calvin states in irritation.   
  
‚ÄúI did hit them, Cal. I saw it with my own f\*\*\*\*\*g eyes! Where the f\*\*k were you anyway?!‚Äù I snap back in return as he stomps off, tugging his radio from his belt to send out an alert to all cops in the vicinity.  
  
I look back down into the empty alley and shiver slightly as the cold air nips at my neck once again. ",1,1746687286.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1khjprp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1khjprp/i_hate_my_birthday/,I hate my birthday,"Today (yesterday) was my birthday. May 7th and am officially 26 years old. Growing up, I have always been told that your birthday is the most important day of the year because it celebrates the day you were born. I think that‚Äôs a load of shit. My birthday has always just been a day. At least it has since I turn like 13. My mom got with a man who was garbage and we haven‚Äôt done much to celebrate my birthday since and I just carried that into adulthood. This year was the same as every other year, people text or call to wish me a happy birthday, my mom gives me like $50 and I usually end up spending the day at work or by myself at home. 

This year just hit differently then they have before because I just really noticed how alone I am and how loneI feel. Today, well yesterday now, my mom gave me my birthday money and my sister took me out for coffee and dinner which was nice but we took it to go and went our separate ways and I ate it alone. My sister and mom are there for me, but I don‚Äôt have anyone who makes me feel wanted, no one goes out of their way to spend the day with me or do something with me, and I don‚Äôt have anyone to celebrate the day with or really any day with. 

I hate how self deprecating I sound and I am sorry to come off so melodramatic. I really just am so tired of feeling so lonely and invisible. Today was a good day, nothing bad happened, but I just am tired of it being the same every year. I don‚Äôt expect to be spoiled and honestly don‚Äôt really want to do anything big for my birthday, but I just want one year where I get to spend the day with people I love and care about doing something fun like going out for the day or finding somewhere random to explore. I feel like that would be more fun than spending the day alone in my room, eventually crying a little bit (as sad as that sounds). I just hate this feeling and hate knowing that I really am alone most of the time. 

Thank you for reading, I‚Äôm sorry to sound all sad, I just needed to say it so that I could hopefully feel a little bit better.",3,1746687046.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1khjoq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1khjoq4/my_coffee_journey_1/,My coffee Journey (1),"I had gotten myself a df54, plastic v60 o2, (and delonghi ecp 3630). I've been trying to work with this light roast Ethiopian blend (washed & natural). Starting at grind 50, using hoffmann 5 pour method, I remember a strong bitterness at first that would turn into a very acidic presentation after cooling. Trying out 45, it became more pronounced, and the coffee bed looked like a mud. Even at 50, the presentation was enough to give me a stomachache. I ended up moving the grind coarser, and comparing 75 and 65, it seems that 65 is when that upfront bitterness starts. The coarser I go, the more hollow it seems the cups get. All I remember from experimenting with agitation, is that minimal agitation brought me closer to suggested draw down time, and that I decided to agitate minimally, and this did decrease the drastic bitter-sour swing. The most recent cup I have was set to 70, and I poured with a slightly slow unbreakable stream and did not swirl. I couldn't tell if it was sour or bitter, as it was definitely not a pungent sour or a distinguishable bitter. I assume this is truly underextracted, even with the uneven bed. Maybe a mix of true underextracted sourness (instead of the acidic sourness), and some localized overextraction. It definitely tasted hollow and the complex undertones of the acidic sourness from finer grinds and a different pour style are nowhere to be found. I assumed the finer grind led to channeling and that crazy uncomfortable flavor swing, but now I'll try grind 65, and make sure to swirl. I'm sticking to hoffmann's 5 pour for now. It seems the astringency and dryness is unavoidable with this bean, which is Luminary from Lightbrite, btw.",1,1746686929.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1khjmk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1khjmk4/breaking_the_cagethe_secret_letters_in_his_boxers/,"""BREAKING THE CAGE:THE SECRET LETTERS IN HIS BOXERS"" Want the full story? Comment now, and I‚Äôll share the link shortly.","I had just seen those boxers two days ago while packing his suitcase for a business trip.

When Fabian noticed me eyeing the letter, he asked with a casual smile, ""What's up?""

I shook my head. ""Nothing.Just noticed the monogram‚Äîpretty unique. Never seen anything like it before.""

Fabian raised an eyebrow, explaining smoothly, ""My skin's sensitive to most fabrics. I get all my underwear custom-made.""

At the time, I didn't think twice about it.

Now, this post was sending my mind into a spiral of doubt.

The poster kept digging herself deeper in the comments

""Everyone needs to chill the hell out.""

""He's still single technically, and we haven't hooked up or anything, so how is this cheating?""

""Someone asked if I mark his new underwear too. Duh! He ships every new pair to me first.""

""Does his girlfriend know? God no.""

""We're super careful. Nobody has a clue.""

""Haha I've been doing this since I was fourteen, FYI.""

""Relax, I'm deleting this post soon anyway.""

The thread was blowing up with strangers calling her out.I didn't join in, but I couldn't shake the creeping suspicion.

Then I caught myself‚Äîwas I seriously going to question my fianc√© because of some random internet stranger? Get a grip!

The poster's location showed London, for crying out loud.

Everyone in our social circle knows Fabian has always been Mr. Perfect‚Äînever have a scandal. He's a person who buttons his shirt all the way to the top..

When someone once asked why he was so proper, he just said, ""Quality over quantity.""

After graduating from Wharton, Fabian launch his company.

His leadership team is 50/50 men and women, with female employees making up the majority overall.

The benefits are insane comprehensive healthcare, flexible hours and sick days, six months of parental leave for all genders, and actual vacation time people can take without guilt.

He even created the OWL initiative ""Oracle Women's Leadership"" specifically designed for advancing women.

His executive assistant, Zoe, just had her second baby. When I stopped by his office, she brought me coffee.

""We always wondered what kind of woman would end up with Fabian,"" she said. ""Meeting you, I get it now.""

She got emotional talking about him.

""A man like Fabian has women swooning over him constantly, but I've worked for him for years and never once seen him even flirt back.""

She probably thought I was checking up on him.

Then she opened up about her marriages.

""If Fabian hadn't gotten his legal team to help with my custody battle, my ex would have destroyed me. I never would have met my current husband or had my baby.""

""Fabian's the real deal. You could visit his company if you have time.""

I nodded, sipping my coffee without commenting.

My dad always said there are four ways to judge a man

First, how he handles responsibility‚Äîdoes he step up or make excuses?

Second, how he acts when things go wrong‚Äîwatch out for the ones who never show frustration.

Third, his friends‚Äîsometimes, men hang out with jerks, but they don‚Äôt do it often..

Fourth, his family‚Äîhow his parents treated each other is his blueprint for relationships.

Fabian aced all four tests.

My parents enthusiastically approved the match.

We started dating with marriage as the clear goal.

Last summer, I was vacationing in Anglesey when my period hit early with crippling pain. I'd lost my meds and passed out from the intensity.

My new assistant, Sara, completely freaked out.

Fabian, who was supposed to be in LA for meetings, somehow showed up out of nowhere, calmly carried me to bed, and stayed up all night accompanying me.

That night, a typhoon slammed the island. The resort flooded, and housekeeper evacuated everyone to higher ground.

A ceiling fan broke loose in the chaos and came crashing down. Without hesitation, Fabian covered me with his body, getting a nasty gash across his forehead.

I didn't even realize he was hurt. He never mentioned it, just carried me on his back through knee-deep water.

His voice stayed steady""I've got you!babe.""

""We're going to be fine.""

Looking at his usually perfect hair now plastered to his bleeding forehead, I thought, I'm falling in love with him. This is real.

In our world, marriages are business mergers.Genuine feelings is completely worthless.

But that night, I genuinely believed I'd found the exception.

Our engagement was announced the following month.

Thinking about all this now, I felt stupid for letting some boring post get to me.

Chapter 2

The day of our engagement party arrived.

Though it wasn't the wedding yet, both families had gone all out with a formal cocktail reception at the Sullivans estate.

Business associates and lifestyle journalists from both sides showed up to clink glasses and network‚Äîthese events were as much about business as celebration.

My makeup artist makes up for me while gossiping about Boston's elite. ""You two are genetic lottery winners!""

I gave a polite smile, eyes downcast.

My best friend, Vanessa, was running interference with the guests while texting me

""Update I've vetted your man thoroughly. Fabian's reputation is SOLID ""

""Even with all these thirsty socialites circling him before engagement, he's maintaining boundaries!""

""You seriously lucked out!""

""How did we both end up in business marriages but yours comes with actual feelings??This is so unfair!""

Vanessa had been matched with the Pierce family's heir last winter.

She'd confided in me repeatedly that Marcus Pierce had no sexual desire for her at all.

It sounds ridiculous, but Fabian and I have never actually made sex, even during our most heated moments.

When I straddled his lap, wearing nothing but sexy lingerie,he's still completely unruffled.

He'd even said with that serious look

""I'm old-fashioned about some things,this isn‚Äôt good for you.""

Seeing my frustration, he'd kissed the tip of my nose

""Disappointed?""

""Trust me, baby, I can make you scream without crossing that particular line.""

""...Let me show you instead...""

I'd gasped""Holy sh‚Äî""",1,1746686679.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday‚Äîmy eighteenth‚Äîthe day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

‚ÄúDo you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?‚Äù Maris‚Äôs sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram‚Äôs betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming, Maris‚Äî‚Äù I stopped myself, flinching. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it right away.‚Äù

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. ‚ÄúSee that you do. I‚Äôd hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. ‚ÄúHonestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.‚Äù

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. ‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

As I turned to leave, Maris‚Äôs voice stopped me in my tracks. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt call me Maris like we‚Äôre equals. It‚Äôs Luna Maris to you.‚Äù Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn‚Äôt argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn‚Äôt I smell mine?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just another day,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúKeep your head down, and it‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîa scent unlike anything I‚Äôd ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‚ÄòMate.‚Äô

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‚ÄòThat‚Äôs our mate!‚Äô Siena said enthusiastically. ‚ÄòGo fast. I want my mate.‚Äô

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Reed.

I couldn‚Äôt believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I‚Äôve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‚ÄòMate,‚Äô I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn‚Äôt he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‚ÄòNo, go to him!‚Äô Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

‚ÄúAlpha Bram!‚Äù she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn‚Äôt even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I‚Äôd felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‚ÄòNo, he is our mate.‚Äô She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I‚Äôd dreamed of this moment‚Äîthe day I‚Äôd find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn‚Äôt even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn‚Äôt stop bleeding. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram‚Äôs cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn‚Äôt even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

\---¬†

Hi all, Welcome to my new book. Hope you enjoy it!¬†

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram‚Äôs father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack‚Äôs servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù she said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt our little orphan, sniveling like a child.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

‚ÄúI know what happened,‚Äù she said, her voice dripping with venom. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.‚Äù She crouched down, her face close to mine. ‚ÄúWe knew it long back. But you‚Äôre nothing. You‚Äôll always be nothing. Bram doesn‚Äôt want you. He‚Äôll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you‚Äôll wish you‚Äôd never set foot in this pack.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

‚ÄúIf you tell anyone‚Äîanyone‚Äîabout this,‚Äù she continued, her voice low and dangerous, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?‚Äù

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

‚ÄúGood. Now clean yourself up. You‚Äôre pathetic. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you‚Äôll regret it if they come to know the reason.‚Äù Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn‚Äôt end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. ‚ÄúYou are reassigned to work in the toilets!‚Äù she barked at me. ‚ÄúStay there until you get a new duty. Don‚Äôt you come out of that place!‚Äù

I balked as I stared at her. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. ‚ÄúDid you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!‚Äù

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris‚Äôs order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn‚Äôt done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone‚Äôs scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. ‚ÄúReya, don‚Äôt let her get away with that,‚Äù she said, her tone filled with anger. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs nothing but trouble.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve caused enough problems,‚Äù Reya sneered immediately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time you learn a lesson.‚Äù And then came the blows. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

‚ÄúAlpha Bram,‚Äù Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. ‚ÄúAuren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.‚Äù She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúHow dare you?‚Äù Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. ‚ÄúThrow her in the dungeons!‚Äù he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn‚Äôt even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons‚Äîa dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay here until we decide you‚Äôve learned your place,‚Äù Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. ‚ÄúFucking bitch.‚Äù

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

‚ÄúGet up,‚Äù she said sharply. ‚ÄúAlpha Bram has called for you.‚Äù

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don‚Äôt you? His bride will never last. You‚Äôll be dead within a year.‚Äù She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said in a weak voice. ‚ÄúHe can't do that. I‚Äî I‚Äî‚Äù It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. ‚ÄúYou dimwit,‚Äù she retorted. ‚ÄúDid you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You‚Äôll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it‚Äôs a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.‚Äù",1,1746686676.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

In the end I think that I discovered a few things:   
\- I actually like dark roasts more for espresso and more classic profiles. 

\- I'm perfectly fine with buying generic grocery store beans - read Kimbo/ Lavazza but different local brands and all that. As long as they are relatively fresh (3-4 months) I divide them into doses and freeze them. I know that this is a cardinal sin in this sub but to me it is less work, cheaper and comfortable.

\- blends with robusta are perfectly fine as long as you know how to properly pull a shot with them. 

\- americans can be pretty tasty. I always thought of the american as shitty watered down coffee but a few times per week I really enjoy a properly pulled americano.

\- lattes can actually be pretty tasty and fun to make. I always thought that lattes are lame coffee drink where you don't actually taste the coffee. I realized that lattes with oat milk, less milk and dark roasts are great.

\- I love fruity coffee for filter and every once in a while I'll buy a fruity and funky bean to have a v60.

Desmond Belmont had an affair.

As she stood outside the CEO‚Äôs office, Beatrice Lawson felt like she couldn‚Äôt breathe, the air around her becoming thinner and thinner.

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

1khjeys,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1khjeys/experiencing_unexpected_heartburn/,Experiencing Unexpected Heartburn?,"Hello everyone!

I quit drinking coffee on March 24th this year. During the first week, I experienced horrible headaches and felt extremely sleepy and low on energy, but gradually, things started to improve. I always like to wake up as early as possible and stay awake till noon time, during aprile I replaced coffee with tea. Due to work commitments (temporary schedule May until September or October), I have to wake up at 4:30 (which is earlier than I used to) in the morning. However, recently, I've found it difficult to fall asleep by 23:30 and stay awake until noon for a short nap. 

I've decided to reintroduce coffee to help me stay awake until noon (to take short nap of two hours or so), with the plan to quit again in autumn. However, since returning to coffee this week, I've been experiencing heartburn in the morning, which is a new sensation for me (I'm a 32-year-old male, non-smoker, and have led a sober, healthy lifestyle with regular sports). Could this heartburn be a result of quitting coffee and then reintroducing it? I tried searching online but couldn't find any relevant information.

NB: the heartburn feels better after I eat some chocolate. But I‚Äôd rather not rely on chocolate every day just to ease the discomfort.

Jack squared his shoulders and declared, ""I'm a star hockey player now. I've got endorsement deals. Magazine covers. I need someone who understands this lifestyle.""  
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""This lifestyle? You mean the one where I've supported you through three team changes and two injuries? ""  
He kept pacing. ""The thing is, I've met someone who gets it. She understands the demands, the spotlight.""  
""Wow. So there's already a replacement. Who is she? One of those influencer models commenting on your photos?""  
Jack's silence confirmed my suspicions.  
""How long?"" I asked.  
He sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""  
I stood, unable to stay in the bed we'd shared for eight years.  
""Jack? Your career high is 28 goals in a season. My grandfather made 28 million dollars last week."" I smiled sweetly. ""You've just made the biggest mistake of your life."" ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Emma Carter's butt had gone numb from sitting in the same cushioned seat for three hours. Not even the luxury boxes at Boston Arena had chairs comfortable enough for the marathon that was playoff hockey. The crowd roared as the final buzzer sounded‚ÄîBoston Blades 3, Montreal 2.

She stood and stretched, watching as her husband Jack scored the winning goal in overtime. The fans stomped and chanted his name, their hero on ice. Emma smiled, genuinely happy for him despite everything else.

""Mrs. Reynolds? Would you like me to call your car?"" the suite attendant asked, already gathering her empty water bottles.

""Not yet, thanks. I'm heading down to congratulate the team."" Emma grabbed her purse, a simple leather tote that clashed hilariously with the designer outfits of the other hockey wives.

The attendant's smile tightened. ""Oh, I believe there's a private team celebration tonight. Players only.""

Emma's phone buzzed with a text from Jack: Don't wait up. Team party at Murphy's.

She read between the lines. Don't show up. Don't embarrass me. Again.

""Right. Of course."" Emma forced a smile. ""I'll take that car now.""

Three hours and two unanswered calls later, Emma sat cross-legged on their king-sized bed, laptop open to a spreadsheet that tracked the household budget. Jack made millions, but old habits die hard. Her grandfather had taught her to watch every penny, even when you had billions of them.

The front door slammed downstairs. Emma closed her laptop and took a deep breath.

""Em? You still up?"" Jack's voice echoed through their too-big house, slightly slurred.

""In the bedroom,"" she called back, slipping on her glasses like armor.

Jack appeared in the doorway, still in his game-day suit, tie hanging loose around his neck. At thirty-two, he was in his hockey prime‚Äîsix-foot-two, shoulders like a coat hanger, jawline that could cut glass. He'd been gorgeous when they met in college. Now he was sculpted.

""Helluva game, huh?"" He grinned, running a hand through his dark hair. ""Did you see that last goal?""

""It was amazing."" Emma smiled genuinely. ""That spin move was insane.""

""Coach said it's going on the season highlight reel."" Jack loosened his tie further but didn't move to take it off. He just stood there, swaying slightly.

Emma's stomach knotted. Something was wrong.

""You okay?"" she asked.

""Yeah. No. I mean‚Äî"" Jack reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out an envelope. ""I need to talk to you about something.""

""What's that?"" Emma nodded toward the envelope, though she already knew. The same dread she'd been feeling for months crystallized into something solid and cold.

Jack tossed the envelope onto the bed. It slid across the comforter and bumped against her knee.

""Divorce papers,"" he said, his voice oddly flat. ""My lawyer drew them up last week.""

Emma stared at the envelope. Her name was typed on the front in cold, official letters. She should cry, she thought distantly. She should be shocked. Instead, she felt like she'd been watching this train approach for miles.

""Were you going to discuss this with me first, or just throw legal documents at my face?"" The words came out calmer than she felt.

Jack had the decency to look uncomfortable for about half a second.

""Look, we both know this isn't working."" He gestured between them. ""You're... you, and I'm...""

""You're what, Jack?""

""I'm Jack Reynolds now."" He squared his shoulders. ""I've got endorsement deals. Magazine covers. I need someone who understands this lifestyle.""

Emma laughed, she couldn't help it. ""This lifestyle? You mean the one where I've supported you through three team changes and two injuries? Where I've moved cities four times in six years? That lifestyle?""

""See, this is what I mean."" Jack pointed at her accusingly. ""You're always keeping score.""

""I'm a numbers person. Sue me."" Emma picked up the envelope but didn't open it.

""The thing is,"" Jack continued, pacing now, ""I've met someone who gets it. She understands the demands, the spotlight.""

Emma's laugh turned hollow. ""Wow. So there's already a replacement. Who is she? Let me guess‚Äîone of those influencers models who's been commenting on your photos?""

Jack's silence was answer enough.

""How long?"" Emma asked.

""Does it matter?""

""It matters to me.""

Jack sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""

Emma stood, suddenly unable to have this conversation in the bed they'd shared for eight years. ""Things don't 'just happen,' Jack. You make choices.""

""Fine. I chose someone who makes more sense for me now."" He threw his hands up. ""I'm not the same guy who married you in college. I need...""

""More?"" Emma supplied.

""Different."" Jack softened his tone, as if that made it better. ""You're smart, Em. Too smart for this world, honestly. But you don't fit anymore. You hide at games. You wear Target when everyone else wears Prada.""

""I like Target,"" Emma said, knowing how ridiculous this argument was becoming.

""The settlement's fair,"" Jack continued, nodding at the envelope. ""The house, a million cash, alimony for two years while you 'find yourself' or whatever.""

Emma clutched the envelope tighter, crumpling it slightly. She thought about all the things Jack didn't know‚Äîabout her family, her grandfather, the trust fund she'd never touched, the shares she owned in companies whose names would make his head spin.

Her phone rang, cutting through the tense silence. Her grandfather's photo lit up the screen.

Jack rolled his eyes.

Emma snatched the phone. ""I should take this.""

""Of course you should."" Jack grabbed a duffel bag from the closet‚Äîalready packed, she noticed. ""I'll be at the Ritz until I find a place. My lawyer's number is in there. Don't make this messy, Em.""

As Jack headed for the door, Emma called after him: ""Jack?""

He turned, hand on the doorframe.

""Your career high record is twenty-eight goals in a season. My grandfather made twenty-eight million dollars last week."" She smiled sweetly. ""Just keeping score.""

Jack's face contorted in confusion as she answered the phone.

""Hi, Grandpa,"" Emma said, watching her soon-to-be-ex-husband walk out. ""Yes, I saw the game. Listen, I think I'm ready to take you up on that job offer after all.""

The job Jack thought was just some entry-level position at Mitchell Industries‚Äîowned by her grandfather, Franklin Mitchell, billionaire and majority owner of the Boston Blades hockey franchise.

As the front door slammed shut, Emma finally opened the envelope. Beneath the legal jargon was one simple truth: Jack Reynolds had just made the biggest mistake of his career.

Emma stepped out of the taxi in front of Mitchell Tower, a gleaming seventy-story monument to her grandfather's business success. Sunglasses firmly in place, she'd swapped yesterday's jeans for a simple navy dress. Her divorce-papers-to-the-face makeover.

The security guard nodded as she entered. ""Morning, Ms. Carter.""

She smiled at the use of her mother's maiden name‚Äîthe one she'd been using professionally for the past year. As far as anyone knew, Emma Carter was just another employee at Mitchell Industries, not Emma Mitchell Reynolds, granddaughter of Franklin Mitchell and soon-to-be-ex-wife of hockey star Jack Reynolds.

The executive elevator whisked her to the top floor. No scan, no keycard needed‚Äîit recognized her face. Money couldn't buy happiness, but it could buy really cool tech.

Franklin Mitchell's assistant‚Äîa perpetually frazzled man named Walter who'd been with him for thirty years‚Äîjumped up when she arrived.

""He's waiting for you, Ms. Carter. Can I get you coffee?""

""I'm fine, Walter. Thanks.""

Emma paused outside her grandfather's office, collecting herself. Don't cry. Don't break. Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the heavy oak door.

Franklin Mitchell sat behind a desk the size of a small boat. At seventy-eight, he still came to the office daily, even though doctors had been telling him to slow down for a decade. His white hair was immaculately combed, his bow tie perfectly centered. The only concession to age was the oxygen cannula in his nose, connected to a discreet tank beside his chair.

""There's my girl."" He beamed, pushing himself up with surprising strength.

Emma crossed the room and hugged him, careful not to squeeze too hard. He smelled like peppermint and old books.

""Sit, sit."" He gestured to the chair opposite his desk. ""You look like a mess, Emmy.""

Emma laughed despite herself. ""Good morning to you too, Grandpa.""

""I'm old. I get to skip pleasantries."" He studied her over his glasses. ""So he finally did it?""

""Last night."" Emma sank into the chair. ""How did you know?""

""Because I know everything."" Franklin tapped his temple. ""And because his agent called our PR department asking how to handle press for a friendly divorce.""

Emma's eyebrows shot up. ""Already? The papers aren't even signed.""

""Jack moves fast. On and off the ice."" Franklin's face darkened. ""Ungrateful little pissant.""

""Grandpa!""

""What? I'm not wrong."" He shuffled papers on his desk. ""I've never liked him.""

""You came to our wedding.""

""I gave a speech!""

""You told him if he hurt me, you'd make sure his body was never found.""

Franklin shrugged. ""I stand by that.""

Emma rubbed her temples. ""Please tell me you're not actually planning a murder.""

""Of course not."" Franklin waved dismissively. ""Too messy. Tax audit is much more effective.""

""Grandpa.""

""Fine, fine."" He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""I called you here for something else, anyway.""

He opened a drawer and pulled out a manila folder, sliding it across the desk. Emma took it, noting the Mitchell Industries logo embossed on the front.

""What's this?""

""Your future.""

Emma opened the folder to find organizational charts, financial statements, and a stack of legal documents with sticky notes marked ""sign here.""

""You've been working in management for a year now,"" Franklin continued. ""Learning the business from the inside. It's time to stop hiding, Emmy.""

Emma flipped through the papers. ""You want me to take over the company? Now?""",1,1746685678.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1khjdkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1khjdkf/post_3rd_interview_concerns/,Post 3rd Interview Concerns,"Like many of you, it's been hell to find work.  I finally found a very reputable company within my industry, and they moved me quickly through the interview process.  The HR rep was able to do a phone screen with me the day she reached out.  Next, I spoke to the hiring manager and had a great conversation.  She told me at the end that she was selecting me to move on to speak with two other individuals.  They turned out to be two others within the department that would be equals.

When I got on the call (virtually), they told me it would be just like having a coffee conversation.  They asked me about my experience and whatnot.  Things were going well, but I fear that I may have asked them some questions that put them on the defensive.  

The first person, I told her that she had mentioned being a part of two other organizations.  I asked what skills she brought over to this new company that made her successful in her role.  I thought this was appropriate, considering that I was also coming from two other similar organizations.  Her response was ""Oh, this is sounding like the dating game now!"" but she went into a great explanation.

I also asked this for the other gentleman, who had worked his way through various promotions at the company.  I asked his keys to success within the role, hoping that I could also keep this in mind if I were to get the role.  I concluded by thanking them for answering, and said that she was right by saying it was like the dating game, because just as their company is looking for their perfect match, I'm looking for my next home.  I then went in to say that I know they would be a great team to work for with a wealth of knowledge.

Previous, they also said that it doesn't matter what level they are at, and that they each regularly teach each other things.  I remarked that I know they would be great teachers, and perhaps I might even be able to teach them something down the line as well.

This is a newer approach of mine to interviews that I read online.  I told a some of people about it.  Some thought they were good questions, and others thought that they may have been crossing boundaries and making the others believe I was questioning their qualifications like I was interviewing them instead of vice versa.  

In the final part of the interview, I asked them if there were any weaknesses that I've presented that I can elaborate on.  One of them said ""None that I can think of.  You are authentic, trustworthy, and most importantly brave and those are all great qualities"".

So far, it's been a week since the interview.  I sent thank you emails to the both of them and didn't receive a reply.  The HR rep didn't reply to my follow-up email yesterday, and now I've been really stressed about it.  I feel like they didn't like me, but I've also been really stressed lately and might be overreacting.  Was it wrong to ask these things?",1,1746685649.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

Abigail drove her car smoothly down the road to her father‚Äôs house. Her little metallic blue Peugeot 108 was her pride and joy, a well-deserved gift on her twenty-second birthday, just a few months back. She drove it with care and always made sure to park it where it would be safe.  
  
Even today, in her depressed state, she still made sure to avoid every avoidable pothole in the road and have a smooth drive. She could feel her eyes blur with the tears again, but she swallowed them down, the salty taste of tears coating her throat. She was almost at her father‚Äôs house. Abigail hoped she would hang on to her emotions just a little longer.  
  
The house came up just after the last left turn. She had traveled the road for more than ten years, since her parents had bought the house. She was grateful for this fact, for it made driving easier even in autopilot mode, which she was sure she was in.  
  
The house was a beautiful bungalow, with brown stone walls and a high gray roof. Just the sight of it returned some peace to her shattered spirit.  
  
She parked the car next to her father‚Äôs red BMW. After a few seconds of sniffing and composing herself, she finally left the car, wincing as the shadow of pain went through her abdomen. With a hand pressed against her stomach and her handbag in the other, she walked to the house.   
  
She was so burdened with her own thoughts; she did not notice all the windows were closed and not a sound came from the house.  
  
The front door was locked, and after a few knocks, nobody opened the door. Not her father, nor their housekeeper, Maggie. That was odd enough to give Abigail a pause in her thoughts.  
  
She turned around and stared at her father‚Äôs car, now wondering how the car would be parked in the driveway, but her father was not home. Now that she gave it a second look, she realized the car also looked rather dirty. Her tired brain tried to think, but decided it was not so unusual that it should cause her to worry.   
  
She walked to the back of the house and retrieved the spare key from the flowerpot and let herself into the empty house.  
  
She breathed a sigh of relief when she finally stepped into her childhood home. She had needed it to return home where she was safe and felt comfortable. It was almost like she could still feel the warmth of her mother in certain rooms of the house, and that always gave her great comfort. If she closed her eyes, she could almost believe her mother was laughing over dinner at the kitchen table, like she used to.   
  
With a sigh, she walked further into the house and made her way to her bedroom. The house was strangely dusty. Abigail stopped and looked around more cautiously. She changed course and headed for her father‚Äôs office.  
  
She gasped and dropped her car keys when she entered the office. The office looked as though a tornado had run through it. The usually neat office desk and bookshelf were in disarray. Papers scattered everywhere, even the chairs were overturned.  
  
Dread settled in the pit of her stomach. She hadn‚Äôt spoken to her father in over a month, but she had no reason to believe he had been in trouble.  
  
On shaky legs, she left the office and headed for her father‚Äôs bedroom, where she was met with more shock and confusing facts.  
  
The room was completely clean except for the wardrobes that were bare to the bone. All her father‚Äôs expensive selection of clothes and shoes was missing. A check in the bathroom showed his extensive array of deodorants and hair products was also gone.   
  
Her father was the only man she had ever known who took so much great care in his appearance and body odor. She had actually concluded the man was obsessed with his looks, even though he was well into his fifties.   
  
Abigail walked back to the bedroom and sat on the edge of her father‚Äôs bed. It made no sense. If her father had been robbed, they wouldn‚Äôt have taken all his cosmetics and clothes and left everything else, no matter how expensive some of those clothes and products were. A walk through the rest of the house confirmed things were only amiss in her father‚Äôs office and bedroom. She did not know much about crime and robbery, but that still did not sit right with her.  
  
Kidnapping was another option, but she strongly doubted it. Kidnappers would collect all your clothes, shoes and perfumes, no matter how accommodating they were. And besides, no one had called her demanding a ransom, even though she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pay. They were not poor, but they were also not some wealthy silver-spooned family with money dating back to the times of Kings and Queens.  
  
Their little family, which now only consisted of her father and herself, was just a hardworking middle-class family. Her father had been lucky to find a job as a branch manager for a trading firm. He had worked the job for as long as Abigail could remember.  
  
Abigail walked in a daze to her own room and pushed the door open. Nothing looked out of place. Even her diamond earrings she had inherited from her mother sat exactly where she had left them by the bedside table when she had visited three months ago.  
  
She walked to her bed and sat down slowly, conscious of the pain in her abdomen. She was suddenly overwhelmed and did not feel she was in any state of mind to deal with whatever was going on with her father. It wasn‚Äôt what she had expected to be greeted with. She had come home to look for peace and find her equilibrium. Now she felt more disoriented than before.  
  
She grabbed her phone from her jean pocket and checked her messages for the last time she had spoken to her father. ‚ÄúTwo months!‚Äù she hadn‚Äôt realized so much time had gone by.  
  
A feeling of unease settled over her. She dialed her father‚Äôs number but got informed the number was no longer in use. Abigail stared in shock at her phone screen. She redialed, and still the same computerized operator‚Äôs voice came on and informed her the number was no longer in use.  
  
Was this the point at which she called the police? She mused to herself. Suddenly, being in the house gave her more fear and anxiety. She looked at her time on the phone: 5pm. She would never make it back on campus before midnight.  
  
She did not want to spend the night alone in the empty house, not knowing what was going on. But she also did not want to make the seven hours drive back to school in her current state of mind.  
  
Thinking of school brought a piercing pain in her chest. It reminded her of the reason she had driven home in the first place. The pain tore through her chest all the way down to her belly and she hunched over in a silent cry.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt ready to head back to campus; she wasn‚Äôt sure she would ever be ready. All she knew was that at that moment, she wasn‚Äôt going to head back there.   
  
Stuck between a rock and a hard place, she made her choice. A night in the house would not kill her. Then tomorrow she would figure out where to go or what to do.  
  
With her decision made, Abigail crawled up further into the bed with her clothes and sneakers still on and closed her eyes, willing exhausted sleep to take cover her body.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It was past 1AM in the morning when two men silently opened the door to the house. They did not speak or make a single sound as they moved through the dark house. Their black clothes blended them into the shadows. They moved stealthily until they came to the room with the woman sleeping on the bed.  
  
One man reached into his pocket and removed a syringe already loaded with a sedative. He looked at the other man and nodded at each other before both moving towards the woman.  
  
Abigail startled awake when hands suddenly grabbed her and firmly covered her mouth. Her screams were effectively buried in her throat. The hands were strong and unrelenting no matter how much she struggled. Suddenly, a sharp pain pierced her thigh. It was too dark to see what was happening, and that only added to her panic.  
  
Seconds ticked by and the men did not let her go. Abigail would have begged if her mouth had not been covered. She stared into the dark frantically, trying to think of anything to get away.  
  
Her mind began to fog. Her thoughts stopped making sense. All her senses slowed down. Even her body felt heavier. They had drugged her; she realized, even as her brain began to shut down.  
  
The two men were as silent as before. Not a single word crossed their lips. When they were sure she was completely out, the man with the syringe pocketed the evidence and lifted the woman over his shoulder.   
  
The other man made sure nothing incriminating was left behind. Together, the two men walked out of the house and locked the door behind them.   
  


# Chapter 2

Lorenzo stood on the balcony leaning against the railings. It was otherwise a beautiful day with clear skies. A table to his left sat with his untouched breakfast and customary cup of coffee. Next to the cup sat his Desert Eagle, all gray and shining in the morning light.  
  
He blew out smoke through his nose before taking another drag from his cigarette. He was already on his third one that morning. To say that he was vexed, would have been the understatement of the decade. He literally had murder on his mind.  
  
He took another drag from his cigarette and held his breath. His mind ran up all the different scenarios and each time the results were the same. He had lost something precious and someone was going to pay.  
  
He heard footsteps of someone approaching, but ignored them until the person cleared their throat behind him, he did not have to turn to know who it was. No one else would have dared to disturb his peace especially at a time like this. Lorenzo exhaled the breath of smoke he had been holding, then addressed the man who had interrupted his dark thoughts.  
  
‚ÄúTed, if your next sentences do not contain the words ‚Äòfound‚Äô and ‚ÄòJohn‚Äô, and in a particular order, I strongly suggest you walk back out of here.‚Äù He did not need to raise his voice to sound menacing.  
  
Ted shifted his weight from one foot to the other like a nervous school girl. Which was rather funny considering he was supposed to be a badass heartless man.  
  
Lorenzo could literally feel the man‚Äôs hesitation, he turned his head and looked at Ted over his shoulder. The large blank man built like a door bouncer had the decency to look nervous. It almost brought a smile to his face to know he put the fear of God in the big man.  
  
‚ÄúMr. Renzo, we found his daughter,‚Äù he said in a voice raspy from years of strong liquor.  
  
Lorenzo arched his brow. ‚ÄúHis daughter?‚Äù When Ted gave a curt nod to confirm, he snorted. ‚ÄúWhat the f\*\*k am I supposed to do with his daughter?‚Äù he spat out.  
  
Ted swallowed nervously. ‚ÄúSir, we figured you could use her to find her father.‚Äù  
  
Lorenzo gave him an incredulous stare. ‚ÄúI send you to find the man that stole my hard earned ten million dollars and you bring me back his daughter with homework?‚Äù His voice was not raised but every word punctuated the air like a threat.  
  
Ted scratched the back of his neck. His bald head shining bright as polished wood as he bent his head down and tried to think. He was not certain how to respond to his boss. If at all he should dare to speak. He swallowed and kept his eyes down. One thing he knew was Lorenzo was sometimes very unpredictable and ruthless, he had to handle this carefully.  
  
‚ÄúDo you like your job, Ted?‚Äù  
  
Ted felt the blood leave his face. That was what you called a rhetorical question. Ted had the kind of job one did not retire from. In short his boss was asking him if he liked being alive and owning all his body parts.  
  
Lorenzo exhaled and turned back to watching the trees beyond the balcony. He considered the option handed to him. He wasn‚Äôt into passing the sins of the father onto the daughter, it was not his style of operation. He couldn‚Äôt even remember if he had ever met John Summer‚Äôs daughter.¬†  
  
He chuckled and shook his head, he had trusted the man with his finances and yet had not bothered to get more acquainted with his family. Although trust was a stretch. Lorenzo did not trust anyone who worked for him. He only trusted four men in the entire world and John had not been one of them. He had given John a job and clearly detailed what would happen if he betrayed him.  
  
Clearly John had not valued his life as much as Lorenzo thought he did. The old man had dared to run off with his money. Without so much as leaving a note of apology, not that it would have made any difference.¬†  
  
‚ÄúTed, I think my reputation is losing its touch,‚Äù he drawled almost in a whisper.  
  
‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù  
  
Lorenzo chuckled again hearing the shake in Ted‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúIt is. I could care less what people say about me‚Ä¶they are just words. Hell, you could even f\*\*k the current girl in my bed‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPatrick did,‚Äù Ted interrupted¬†  
  
‚ÄúYes, and he is still alive.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut missing a few body parts,‚Äù Ted mumbled under his breath.  
  
‚ÄúFact is, he is still alive,‚Äù Lorenzo emphasized in a firm voice. ‚ÄúShe was just a w\*\*\*e. Point is‚Ä¶Disrespect me all you want. But my money?‚Äù¬†  
  
Ted heard the bitterness in his boss‚Äôs voice and it made him flinch. ‚ÄúWe will find him boss, it is just a matter of time.‚Äù¬†  
  
Lorenzo turned around abruptly. ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe daughter?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo! You dumb ass! The grandmother! Of course his bloody daughter, who else would I be asking about?‚Äù  
  
Ted flinched again but kept a straight face. ‚ÄúOn her way with the boys. They picked her up last night.‚Äù  
  
Lorenzo nodded. ‚ÄúI have a meeting to attend in Mexico, I will deal with it when I get back.‚Äù He grabbed his Desert Eagle and stormed off the balcony past Ted.  
  
Lorenzo walked out of the house to the helipad. His step was confident and arrogant, anyone looking at him would never know just how pissed he was, or how he felt violated, an emotion he had never wanted to ever experience again.¬†  
  
It was not the amount of the money that was stolen that ate at him. It was just the act. Theft had a way of ripping through a person‚Äôs guts, making them feel insecure and agitated. Ten million was pocket change by his standards, even though he still did not appreciate losing it. But he would have been just as pissed even if John had taken two thousand dollars. Hell, even two dollars would have still gotten a wake out of him.  
  
Lorenzo had beaten the odds and worked himself to the bone to be where he was today. He knew the value of every dollar he made. His number one love was his money, nobody tempered with it. He could spend it, he could donate it, but nobody stole it. The greed for money had nearly had him killed years ago and he had made sure to make more than he would ever need in one lifetime.¬†  
  
Had John come to him asking for the money, he would have given it, as long as the reasons were valid of course. But the man had not approached him for help, he had just stolen and disappeared.  
  
Lorenzo sighed and shook his head in disgust. He got into his helicopter and nodded to his chief of security, Maxwell. Another of his men that looked like they should have worked as door bouncers at some shady club. The man turned to the pilot and gave the instruction. Within seconds they were in the air.  
  
Lorenzo threw his head back and closed his eyes, he now had to figure out exactly what he was to do with John‚Äôs daughter once he returned to his middle of nowhere hidden palace.",1,1746685606.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs not like school na kasi where you make friends and you hang out with people there kay yk, school is a common ground for people to socialize.

Eh im not in school right now cuz of finances. (Im supposed to be in college). And ive been out of school for around 4 years na.

When you‚Äôre out of school pala, your mind really opens to everything outside of those grounds. The horror of sheer reality, the fear of living sa streets, or being stabbed / held up/. Living by yourself also makes you see your social status the hard way. You realize that you‚Äôre literally nothing in the mass of people unless you‚Äôre super rich or super appealing physically. Which means need ka mag work and work and work so you can get the life you want (unlike other people who are born with golden shovels in their mouths).

Your mind also opens up to how many people still act childish despite being in their mid twenties/ early thirties(Probably because medyo sheltered sila or smthn or because they‚Äôre still with / depending on their parents). As in ya du indi gid ko ka pati nga may ara gid mga tao nga du bata ila thinking üò© no emotional intelligence, no respect. More on the delusional ‚ÄúMain Character‚Äù syndrome.

Idk it‚Äôs just really hard to find friends outside eh. Most especially when you have work and or no budget to hang out üòÖ

Most hang outs when trying to make friends always make you spend money eh. Drinks, food, coffee, trips üòÖ why not just chill at my place and laugh while eating canned goods HAHAHA

Drop a comment below, and I‚Äôll send you the free link.

My husband Nathan Carter hasn't touched me once in five years of marriage.  
  
If my skin accidentally brushed against his, I'd be punished by soaking in disinfectant for a full day.  
  
The resulting rashes and sores made me cautious, always careful to keep my distance.  
  
Until one day, I saw it‚Äîa lipstick stain on his collarbone.  
  
And when I reached out‚Ä¶ he didn't punish me this time.  
  
I thought maybe he was finally overcoming his aversion to me.  
  
But the next day, I found myself listed as an item at an exclusive auction attended by the city's wealthiest elites.  
  
The item up for bid? My VIRGINITY.  
  
\---  
  
I clutched my coat, the paper bag in my hand holding ointment for my inflamed skin.  
  
From the room at the far end, laughter echoed‚Äîeach burst louder than the last.  
  
Their voices hit me like a thunderclap.  
  
""She actually dared to touch where Zoey kissed him. Who does she think she is? Just looking at her makes me sick.""  
  
""You have waited forever for that kiss, and Stella had the nerve to put her hands on him? She needs to be taught a lesson.""  
  
Then I heard Nathan sneered: ""A lesson? Please. That old virgin would beg for some rich bastard to auction off her purity!"" His voice dripped with venom. ""You have no idea how desperate she is‚Äîlike she'll die without a man inside her!""  
  
With that, the laughter grew even louder.  
  
""Zoey is allergic to the smell on Stella's body, and she will feel nauseous when she smells it. That's why you disinfects after every contact."" someone sneered. ""And poor Stella actually thinks she's unclean!""  
  
""This auction's doing her a favor!"" Another voice jeered. ""Finally gets to lose that pesky virginity. Bet she's thrilled!""  
  
The roof nearly shook from their mocking laughter.  
  
I bit my lip hard, my fists clenched so tight my nails dug into my palms.  
  
It took everything I had to stay standing.  
  
For years, I'd believed myself contaminated‚Äîevery night, I'd soak in disinfectant baths.  
  
Over time, my skin had deteriorated‚Äîinflamed, red, covered in sores that never fully healed.  
  
Nathan had the marital bed replaced with two singles, terrified of catching whatever I supposedly had.  
  
When I'd demanded answers, he'd simply claimed he was a germaphobe.  
  
All this time...  
  
All this suffering...  
  
So... Just because of Zoey Miller! Because my very existence disgusted her!  
  
What a joke!  
  
The realization hit like a knife to the gut.  
  
Hot tears of humiliation streaked down my face as those vile words echoed in my skull, shredding what little dignity I had left.  
  
I married Nathan through an arranged marriage, but we'd known each other since childhood.  
  
I'd made excuses‚Äîhis ""germaphobia"" was a medical condition.  
  
So I was patient. I accommodated every quirk.  
  
Five years of swallowing my pride, of begging for scraps of affection... only to be trampled into the dirt...  
  
The pain was so overwhelming that it made me sober.  
  
With numb fingers, I dialed Nathan's grandma.  
  
""Grandma. Nathan has betrayed me. The auction in the city center two days later will prove that.""  
  
""Let me go.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I got home very late to find Nathan waiting on the couch.  
  
When our eyes met, something was different.  
  
Gone was his usual coldness‚Äîinstead, there was an unmistakable hunger in his gaze.  
  
Then I saw it:  
  
A lipstick-stained coffee cup.  
  
A scrap of lace lingerie peeking from the cushions.  
  
My breath caught, my heart feeling like it was being torn apart.  
  
""Haven't you always wanted to touch me? Five years, and I don't believe you've never wanted to.""  
  
I stared in shock at the desire darkening his gaze.  
  
What game was he playing now?  
  
Didn't I disgust him?  
  
Wasn't he supposed to be a germaphobe?  
  
Remembering the conversation I'd overheard, my face hardened.  
  
""I'm tired. I need to rest.""  
  
As I tried to leave, he yanked my arm roughly.  
  
He shoved me against the wall and, like a man possessed, ripped my clothes to shreds.  
  
I stood naked in the cold air, shivering from head to toe.  
  
The next second, he pushed me into the master bedroom and locked the door from outside.  
  
His cold voice drifted through: ""I have work to do. Stay put until morning.""  
  
I realized then‚ÄîI pounded on the door frantically, but it was useless.  
  
Standing naked, I felt completely vulnerable.  
  
I searched the entire bedroom but couldn't find a single piece of clothing.  
  
Even the sheets and curtains had been removed.  
  
Suddenly, a bright light pierced through the transparent windows, dancing across my beasts.  
  
I focused my eyes and saw several men in the villa opposite fighting over binoculars, practically climbing over each other to get a look.  
  
""That's her‚ÄîStella! The virgin they're auctioning off! Props to Nathan for letting us preview the merchandise before we drop serious cash at the auction. This is fucking epic!""  
  
""Let me see, let me see! Holy shit, she's smoking hot! Don't know if we can outbid those rich old bastards.""  
  
""Who cares about winning? We're getting a free peep show right now! That's a win in my book, hahaha!""  
  
I stood frozen in place.  
  
Their lecherous stares were like needles piercing my skin, causing excruciating pain with nowhere to hide.  
  
I hugged myself tightly, trembling in the corner.  
  
Then Nathan's voice came from downstairs.  
  
""Stella actually thought I wanted her. You should've seen the look in her eyes‚Äîlike she wanted to devour me right there. Disgusting!""  
  
There was also the sound of disinfectant spraying between the words.  
  
""Don't worry, Zoey, baby. You're the only one who gets to touch me. I won't let myself get dirty.""  
  
Soon, the sounds from downstairs became increasingly explicit.  
  
I hugged my body, feeling completely dead inside.  
  
Tears welled in my eyes but never fell.  
  
Time passed minute by minute as I curled up in the corner, neither daring to fall asleep nor willing to face reality.  
  
Not until midnight did Nathan unlock the door, acting as if nothing had happened.  
  
He casually tossed out: ""Oops, got so wrapped up in my work I totally forgot about you. Better get dressed before you catch cold.""  
  
He tossed me a robe like feeding scraps to a dog, then his phone suddenly rang.  
  
Looking down, he muttered, ""That's weird. Why's Grandma checking out of the hospital? Her condition hasn't improved.""  
  
I stayed silent.  
  
Just then, his phone buzzed again. In an instant, I caught a glimpse of a text that made my blood run cold:  
  
""Bro, those nude videos are doing wonders. Some loaded geezer already bid $300,000 grand‚Äîdude's pushing 70 years old! Stella's cherry-popping night is gonna be epic LMAO!""  
  
It hit me then‚Äîthere were hidden cameras in the bedroom.  
  
Everything. Every single thing had been recorded‚Äîmy nakedness, my humiliation, my screams after my dignity was crushed.

In the early 2000s there was a freestanding non-chain pizza place at the intersection of High & Chestnut. Directly across from where the Historical Society is now. Does anyone remember the name?



After the pizza place closed, it was purchased by someone else and was a bakery/coffee/donut shop. Using google, I can see the pizza place was present up until 2002, and by 2004 had been demolished and the site now seems to be a bank.

ive never initiated more than a side hug with this guy, i dap him up before and after our coffee meets where we go over where we are in our recovery. our last meet, i glanced over at his phone to check the time and it was straight up a picture of me on his wallpaper. it was a selfie i had taken with my little one year sober coin and he had cropped out the coin to just show my face. i‚Äôve never been one to shy from confrontation so i asked, hey wtf is that? and he stuttered a few barely believable reasons before he settled on its ‚Äúto keep himself motivated in his journey.‚Äù whatever. he got weird and started acting squirmy and just started saying all this weird shit, if you‚Äôve ever seen Fargo ( the movie) think that scene with mike yanagita. yeah. 

TODAY, LIKE JUST NOW i‚Äôve found out this fucking guy has been calling me his girlfriend to everyone; from his family to my ex coworkers. i dont even talk to my old coworkers, but i went in today and my old manager asks me ‚Äúhow‚Äôs blah blah doing? he told me you guys had your one year anniversary dinner when he last came in‚Äù. 

i was floooored. in our texts, i had confronted him about it, he had said he thought we were together, that one day my asexuality would go away after i stop taking my anti depressants, that he was serious about moving in together to keep eachother motivated, somehow it got into conversation that i was the whole reason he started working at our old job. everything he said was so sad and i didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to say so i haven‚Äôt said anything. 

he‚Äôs currently blowing up my phone with messages about how this is giving him flash backs to his ex-wife, that he has terrible abandonment issues, he feels alone, literally think of the saddest most pathetic  thing you can imagine someone saying and he‚Äôs saying all of it. i know i cant do this, this is obviously not healthy for him in so many ways, i just dont know what to say so this guy doesnt hurt himself or relapse. but also maybe thats not my problem. how do i ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù with him? 


EDIT - appreciate the concern from everyone, im not worried about my safety  ( i live in a group home with security system, he doesn‚Äôt know where i currently live/work or anything outside my name, i have no socials or family, my records aren‚Äôt online ) but i appreciate the concern! most of my apprehension comes from just being overly sympathetic over his emotional state and life situation. that‚Äôs why this is hard, it‚Äôs like kicking a guy when he‚Äôs already down, but no i do not plan on keeping a friendship after i figure out what id like to say to him. i‚Äôm hoping what i do say is productive enough to atleast push him in the right direction.

1khj9ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathomlessBook/comments/1khj9ze/deeper_understanding/,Deeper Understanding,"  Dark blue clouds above, digital rain flying past, the view of luminous green spring leaves. A soft mechanical hum, repeating in a beautiful melodic rhythm. Something is there, digging inside of me. My surroundings shift between digital landscapes and beautiful real life greenery. The storms above are peaceful but fill me with a sense of anxiety and dread, guilt and shame. But also I am filled with nostalgia and longing.

  Something is in front of me, it is tearing into me but I am made of digital squares. It is separating them and setting them to the side. They shift and glitch. My environment flickered between pixelated geometry and lifelike terrain‚Äîperfect digital cubes of earth and trees beside shifting, natural leaves. The feeling of emptiness and beauty in a digital world, the hours of my life spent appreciating the beauty of the rain in a video game. I am in a field and the blocks are bright green and the trees are shifting with different shades of green. Shifting between blocks and real leaves. The clouds are so dark and blue, the air feels humid and warm. I am frozen in place, unable to move, like the connection has gone out.

  The connection I crave. The connection I crave. Oh, the connection I crave. The being in front of me pauses and the digital squares are set off to my sides. The environment turns more blue, like on a rainy summer day. It encloses in on me and now everything is dark. I should be scared but I am listening. I am looking. The environment has become that of what I have seen in movies. No particular meaning to the landscapes but easy in that moment to identify. Empty worlds, all of which were in me. Just there and I didn't realize it. The environment became a spring morning, the same green leaves and dark shadows of a stormy day, and there she was. Oh the beautiful melody. There she was, my first crush, when I was a teenager. I felt that emotion when I was that age. I felt it as if that moment was so fresh and in my mind as it was back then. She was there walking to her backyard. My first crush. The digital squares clouded my vision and I couldn't see her anymore. I remember that emotion.

  The trees and houses folded into one another. Merging and twisting together Light fractured around me, and when it settled‚ÄîI stood in a peaceful yard. Oh, the clarity. There she was, an elderly woman was walking to a garden, she was my love. I felt the same emotion, but with decades of shared experience and love together. I was filled with a sense of joy and peace. But I felt a sense of intense attraction towards this woman.

  The ground and earth began to fold on itself, the textures became smooth and pixelated and my vision became nothing but green and blue. The pixels began to populate my vision and formed a new place. I was by a restaurant near a window. It was storming outside and the smell of coffee and rain filled the air. A beautiful woman sat in front of me. I felt nervous but excited. We looked each other in the eyes. She was in her 30s and she looked at me with her body language expressing the same feelings I was feeling. Her face became unclear and everything around me blurred and the colors became distorted and blended into each other until everything became blue and dark shades of brown. The brown formed into trees and the blue turned into the storm clouds above. 

  Trees began to populate around me and there I was back in the field from before with the warm digital rain. Oh the mechanical hum. There it was, the ambiguous being, sorting through my soul. Somehow I wasn't scared of it. I knew, I knew it was gaining a deeper understanding. I had the utmost trust in it and its endeavors to pull me apart. Out of curiosity and out of fear. I didn't want it to find something. My shame. What shame?

  The environment closed in again and now all I could see was different landscapes from videogames. All the years and lands exploring fake worlds. Some of my digital squares to the side started flying around and took turns stopping in front of me to show me my hours and hours growing up watching videos on the internet. My fun conspiracy theory rabbit holes. The cute streamer e-girls I would fawn over and the beautiful women in music videos and the dances they would do.

  I began to feel fear. What was this creature and what it was doing to me, and if I would stay here forever. The environment shifted again but now with the utmost clarity I had never seen with my own eyes, it was indescribable. A beautiful feminine voice, that of lightning, cracked through the mechanical humming and melody. Yet it was so soft, feminine and attractive. The environment shifted, almost like I was loading into a new area. I was underneath a canopy in the woods during this storm. I was here long ago but it wasn't clear when or how. But this time I ‚Äúspoke‚Äù, I was stuck in an animation loop of making conversation with a woman. I couldn't make out who she was. But somehow I knew she was beautiful. She was shapely at times and her figure kept changing. It started pouring outside and she began to manifest herself in front of me.

  Oh, how beautiful she was. Her spirit. Healing and peaceful. Fun and spontaneous. Sexy and cute. She wanted to be seen, and she did not know I was there and I could see her. But all I could see was a figure who would shift between women of all ages, but mostly my age. It should have been terrifying but it was beautiful. Every stage is beautiful. She sang, maybe to me or just because, or because that's who she is. That was her loop. She could not see me, but she sang in a voice so beautiful while the beautiful melody and soothing mechanical hum continued.

‚ÄúEcstasy

 Someone stay with me

 You came here everyday 

 Seeee me in your dreams

 Ecstasy

 So unmistakably 

 You came here every day

 Seeee me in your dreams

 Ecstasy (repeating and fading)

 So unmistakably‚Äù

  I wanted her so bad but I couldn't see or access her. She seemed lost and lonely. But was she talking to me? I knew what she meant when she said it, but then I became confused and sad. Slowly she became less clear and I hadn't realized I was back in the field. It turns out she was just the being the whole time, a manifestation crafted from my soul for me to see.

  As it continued to dig in me, the squares were no longer shifting but now neatly stacked. I felt relief as it carefully put them back in me. The being, now revealed, appeared to be a creature, dark and had hints of blue as its skin reflected the sky. Perhaps metal. It was relatively small and had the body of a slug but seemed to be made almost of cardboard. It was sewing me up and I was no longer digital and neither was the rain. It backed away from me and hovered in my vision. Words of a language I did not know flew out from it and surrounded me. A thousand electronic voices erupted like thunder in a language I did not know. The letters were a dark grey with a white hue around them. Somehow I knew what everything meant.

‚ÄúDeeper understanding.

 Fear is to be revered but it is hiding.

 Clouded and wet you can not feel. 

 Clouded and wet you can feel‚Äù

  The trees and ground and sky and everything in my vision closed in on me, the colors fading away and now all I could see were white clouds. The music and hum dissipated. From the clouds, rain fell on my face. It was over, I had woken up laying on the dirt in the woods. I never felt so alive. Clouded skies and my skin wet. I felt free and innocent. Filled with clarity and self love.

1khj9sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NileshKasurde/comments/1khj9sp/beyond_floral_discovering_unique_perfume_notes/,Beyond Floral: Discovering Unique Perfume Notes Women Are Loving Right Now,"Perfume has long [been a reflection of]() personality, emotion, and memory. While floral scents have been the cornerstone of traditional feminine fragrances, today's women are venturing beyond roses and jasmines. A new wave of scent preferences is emerging‚Äîbold, unexpected, and refreshingly different. These unique perfume notes challenge the norms and reshape how perfumes for women are crafted and chosen.

As the fragrance industry evolves, so do the preferences of modern women. Whether [it's]() a scent inspired by smoky woods, salty oceans, or spicy herbs, today's perfumes blend innovation and individuality. In this blog, [we'll]() explore the latest unconventional perfume notes that women love and why these alternatives are making waves in the world of the [best perfumes online](https://www.nysaa.com/collections/fragrance).

**1. Gourmand Notes: Deliciously Unexpected**

Gourmand scents, which smell like edible treats, are gaining immense popularity. Think caramel, vanilla, coffee, almond, or even chocolate. These sweet and creamy notes add a comforting and indulgent twist to perfumes for women, making them irresistible yet sophisticated.

Gourmand notes stand out because they evoke warmth and nostalgia. Unlike overly floral or fruity compositions, Gourmand notes offer depth and lasting power. When browsing the best perfumes online, many users now look for dessert-inspired fragrances that balance sweet and sultry.

**2. Smoky and Woody Notes: Bold and Sensual**

Traditionally associated with men's fragrances, smoky and woody elements like sandalwood, cedar, oud, and incense are now becoming favourites among women. These deeper, earthier notes add mystery and allure, making them ideal for evening wear or cooler seasons.

Modern perfumes for women blend wood-based scents with hints of citrus or amber, creating a perfect harmony of strength and elegance. These fragrances challenge floral dominance and offer something truly empowering. Many of the best perfumes online feature these woody blends, thanks to their unisex appeal and rich, lingering aroma.

**3. Oceanic and Aquatic Notes: Crisp and Refreshing**

In recent years, aquatic scents have surged in demand. Designed to mimic the smell of the ocean breeze, rain, or sea salt, these notes are fresh, clean, and invigorating. Ideal for summer or daytime wear, they offer a light yet noticeable presence that suits various personalities.

Aquatic notes are especially favoured by women who prefer minimalist, understated fragrances. These scents are often featured in perfumes for women aimed at those who want to feel clean and energetic throughout the day. Due to their universal appeal, many of the best perfumes online now include oceanic elements.

**4. Spicy Accents: Exotic and Energetic**

Spices like pink pepper, cardamom, saffron, and ginger are turning heads in the fragrance world. These elements add a zesty, invigorating kick to any perfume, making them stand out from the usual sweet or floral profiles.

Spicy notes blend exceptionally well with other components, such as vanilla, amber, or musk, creating a fragrance that evolves over time. These fiery accents are a top pick for women who enjoy something with a little more bite. Spicy blends are often considered daring and refined when looking for unique perfumes for women.

**5. Green and Herbal Notes: Earthy and Grounding**

Another rising trend is the use of green and herbal notes. Scents that evoke freshly cut grass, basil, mint, or fig leaves bring a sense of nature and freshness. These aromas are calming and rejuvenating and perfect for women seeking a scent that feels organic and pure.

Many of the best perfumes online now feature green notes combined with citrus or floral bases, resulting in a modern and clean composition. These are ideal for everyday use, especially for women who lead active lifestyles or prefer nature-inspired fragrances.

**6. Leather and Suede: Edgy and Sophisticated**

Once reserved for niche or high-fashion perfumes, leather and suede notes are mainstreaming. They convey a sense of power, independence, and sophistication. These scents are soft yet bold, often combined with floral or amber notes to soften the intensity.

These distinctive compositions are becoming a hallmark of high-end perfumes for women. They appeal to those who enjoy a luxurious, fashion-forward aroma. If [you're]() searching for the best perfumes online, [don't]() overlook those with leathery undertones‚Äîthey are elegant and unforgettable.

**7. Fruity with a Twist: Not Your Average Berries**

While fruity fragrances are nothing new, today's perfumers go beyond traditional choices like apples and berries. Unique fruits such as fig, lychee, passion fruit, and rhubarb add an exotic and playful twist to modern perfumes for women.

These fruits introduce tartness, juiciness, and complexity, elevating the fragrance experience. Blended with florals or musk, they create an unexpected yet delightful combination. A quick browse through the best perfumes online reveals many fresh, fruity scents with a modern edge.

# Why the Shift Towards Unique Notes?

The move away from purely floral compositions reflects a broader cultural shift. Today's women are more expressive, confident, and individualistic. They want fragrances that match their moods, lifestyles, and values‚Äînot just traditional ideas of femininity.

Additionally, the growth of online shopping has made it easier to explore diverse fragrances from the comfort of home. The demand for more distinct perfumes for women has driven perfumers to innovate and push boundaries. As a result, many of the best perfumes online now feature diverse and layered scent profiles tailored to modern tastes.

# How to Choose the Right Scent for You?

With so many intriguing options, finding your signature scent can be overwhelming. Here are a few tips:

* Identify your scent personality: Do you prefer something comforting, bold, fresh, or mysterious? That will guide your choices.
* Test through samples or discovery sets: Many platforms offering the best perfumes online also provide sample kits.
* Consider layering: Try combining two types of scents, spicy and floral or woody and fruity, for a bespoke aroma.
* Think about the occasion: Choose light, fresh notes for daytime and bold, intense ones for evenings.

# Conclusion

The world of [perfumes for women](https://www.nysaa.com/collections/fragrance/women/perfumes-edt-edp) is more diverse and exciting. While floral fragrances will always have their charm, stepping outside the traditional bouquet [opens up]() a whole new world of possibilities.
