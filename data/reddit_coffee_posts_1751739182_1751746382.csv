1lsiuaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1lsiuaw/serious_highfunctioning_autistic_in_vietnam_my/,SERIOUS – High-functioning autistic in Vietnam] My mom says I never change and just want comfort. But she once promised me so much—and took it all back. Am I truly the only one at fault?,"I’m not writing this to bash my mom, nor to play the victim. I’m just asking:
Am I truly the only one to blame? Or did the way I was raised contribute to who I became?


🟧 1. My mom made big promises – then went back on all of them.

When I was in high school:
	•	She said,
“You can decide whether or not to go to university after graduation.”
But when I finished, she forced me to go, saying:
“If you only have a high school diploma, who will hire you? You’ll embarrass the family.”

Later, in college:
	•	She said,
“I’ll sell some land later so you can have a car and open a small shop.”
I believed her.
But when I dropped out and wanted to open the shop, she told me:
“How much can you earn from selling? Will it cover your living costs? Can it support you?”
Then she listed every possible expense, making me feel like a fool for ever trusting her.

When I brought it up, she said:

“Your grandpa didn’t allow me to sell the land. Just pretend I was rambling nonsense back then.”


🟧 2. My mom always believes she’s 100% right—and I’m just lazy and ungrateful.

She says things like:

“You go to therapy but don’t follow any advice. What’s the point?”
“You want love and marriage, but you don’t want to change. You just want others to do things for you.”
“Stop using autism as an excuse. Other autistic people can live normally. You can too.”

She compares me to:
	•	My therapist’s son – also autistic – who works in design, drives a motorbike, hangs out with friends.
	•	Two autistic children of her friend – more severely autistic than me – yet still live independently, drink coffee, go anywhere they want.

Meanwhile, she tells me:

“I’ve already given you money to join dating apps. Whether you find someone or not, it’s your own problem. If you don’t change, it’s on you.”

I feel like everything is a test I must pass, but if I fail, I’m blamed for not trying hard enough—even though I never had the same tools to begin with.


🟧 3. I was raised in a way that disabled me—then blamed for being “not functional.”

I admit this with honesty:
	•	I was pampered from childhood.
Everything I wanted, my mom did for me.
I never had to do house chores.
I wasn’t allowed to go outside alone.
I wasn’t trained in communication or independence.
My mom would always say:
“Just focus on studying. I’ll take care of the rest.”

Now that I’m older, she turns around and says:

“Why can’t you do anything on your own? You only earn 5 million VND (~$200). That’s not enough to live. Who would want to marry someone like that?”

She wants me to be “independent and admirable” to women—but I was never given the foundation to become that.


🟧 4. I admit my flaws – but also see where they came from.

Yes, I admit:
	•	I’ve been lazy, possessive, easily angry when things don’t go my way.
	•	I’ve thrown things, yelled at my mom.
	•	I used to think:
“If I want a girlfriend or wife, I must have her no matter what—even if I’m not yet ready.”
	•	I resisted change, therapy, responsibility.

I’m not proud of it.
But I’m not evil or incapable. I just lacked direction, consistency, and understanding.

I don’t need others to live for me.
But I do need people to stop comparing me to others, and stop pretending like I had the same life as them.


🟧 5. About dating – she gave me money, but also handed me all the blame.

Recently, my mom gave me money to join dating apps.
She didn’t help me figure out what kind of partner suits me.
She didn’t search for me as she once promised.
She just said:

“Here’s the money. Find someone yourself. If you can’t, it’s because you refuse to change. I’ve done my part.”

I could feel what she really meant was:

“I’m right. You’re wrong. Prove me wrong, or else live with it.”

It’s not support—it’s conditional judgment.


🟧 So Reddit, tell me honestly…
	•	Am I 100% at fault?
	•	Or did the parenting style I grew up with play a role too?
	•	Is it fair to blame me for “not changing” when I was never allowed to learn how to?

I’m trying to change.
But I can’t do it alone.

And I don’t think I deserve to be called a failure just because I’m not at the same pace as others.


🟨 TL;DR:

I’m a high-functioning autistic man in Vietnam.
My mom once promised to let me choose education, give me startup money, sell land for me—but always took it back.
She compares me to other autistic people who are more “functional,” and calls me lazy.
I was pampered as a kid, then blamed for being unable to live independently.
I admit I was lazy and angry before. But now I want to change.
I don’t want to be babied, just understood.
I don’t know if I’m fully wrong, or if my mom is also partly responsible.

The top-tier schools? Yeah, they’ve got the rankings, the reputation, all that. But the vibe? Flat. People rushing to class like they’re in a simulation, eyes down, no spark. The girls are quiet, hoodie up, iced coffee in hand, and zero energy.

Then you hit these other campuses and it’s like you’ve stepped into a different world. There’s music, laughter, sun, life — and the girls? Bro… they’re literally jumping around, tits bouncing like they’re about to shout “I’m sooo drunk!” just like in the movies. It’s wild. They’ve got that wild, free energy that makes you forget there’s even such a thing as stress.

And here I am, torn as hell.

Do I go for the “responsible” choice and spend four years in a vibe vacuum, or do I dive into the chaos and fun and just live for once? I’m not trying to base my whole future on bouncing boobs and sundresses, but I also don’t wanna look back and realize I missed out on the best years of my life.

Anyone else feel me on this? Is there a way to get both — a school that hits on brains and beauty?

I (31M) am about 3 weeks into my first cycle, and this has been a very valuable resource to help me get through it. You guys are warriors. 

Although these past few weeks have been amongst the most difficult in my life, it sounds like I’ve been dealt a better hand than many in this sub. After figuring out how to stay away from my triggers in week 1, I only experienced 1 attack per day in week 2, usually around bed time. Today is day 7 of not getting a full-blown CH (2 days ago I woke up with what I would describe as a “mini attack”, but it went away after I drank my morning coffee). 

I was officially diagnosed with CH by a neurologist 4 days ago. By then, it was day 3 without a headache so the doc wanted to wait before prescribing prednisone. Next morning I get that mini attack, so a day later he went ahead and prescribed a 10 day supply. So I’ve been taking those for a couple days now and I plan on taking the rest. 

So with that context I return to my question: 
How do you guys know when your cycle is over? Do you experience anything noticeable that signals the end of your cycle? Do you drink a beer and see what happens? (joking, kinda)

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share!

1lsirkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/1lsirkn/my_life_keeps_getting_worse_and_worse/,My life keeps getting worse and worse.,"My life with ADHD used to be manageable with drugs/alcohol (crazy right?), but it became time to quit. I even cut way back on caffeine. I used to be able to drink cup after cup of coffee and propel myself through life that way, but since hitting my late 30's the positive effects just disappeared. 

Since trying to quit alcohol and drugs my life has gotten worse, rather than better. It feels like I'm continuously going downhill. I lost jobs that I couldn't handle. I overdosed on benzos and woke up in hospital. I lost my driving licence, and now I've been out of work for 18 months. 

My GF and I split and she took her friends with her.

The only thing really keeping me going is the thought that I'll finally get prescribed medicine for ADHD soon. I've had two psychiatrists assess me over a total of eight hours, and it was grueling. I worked very hard to get a diagnosis. With the help of a mental health nurse I managed to expedite treatment because the symptoms impact my life so severely. I've even been registered as disabled. 

But honestly,... the idea of taking stimulants every day scares me a little. And I say that with experience of drug use. I know they're prescribed at medicinal levels, but I'm not naive about the effects of long term amphetamine use. I'm wary I'm just 'kicking the can down the road' for some catastrophe at age 50-60 when they stop working. I'm already prescribed an antidepressant I just *cannot stop taking,* and the idea of having to take multiple pills just to function is scary. Neurology reacts in complex ways we don't yet fully understand.

I go to therapy and work at it, but I don't even know who I am any more. Will I be the same person if I'm taking stimulants every day? Does it even matter? What about all these years of my life struggling - were they the real me? 

I used to have ambitions. I used to want to get a degree (I tried several times), build my own house, move abroad.

My ambitions are pretty modest now. I would like friends to go to events with, or maybe that text first. I want a job that I want to go to each day. I want my driving licence back.",1,1751745912.0,getting_over_it,0,1.0,False

I am looking for someone to take over my son’s lease for the 2025-26 school year (8/21/2025-7/31/2026). He withdrew from school after signing a lease so we now need to sublease his room.

The lease will be for a 1 bedroom with  private bathroom  in a furnished 4bd 4ba apartment where you will share a living room, kitchen and in unit laundry/dryer. There are 3 other undergrads (CS majors)  in the other rooms. The complex has a pool, gym, dance room, theatre, etc. 

The complex is called “Campus Circle”. It is close to the computer engineering department (0.3 mile away) and has a bus stop for the MTD bus lines (22/6 Orange )

The rent is $879 per month. There will be an application fee of $200 from Campus Circle. There is a one time WiFi fee of $95 and a monthly separate electric bill. Rest of utilities are covered.

Please dm me if interested. I am open to discounting the rent if you take over the whole year lease before the start of school year

I bought a all in one mouthwash to rinse my mouth out and it seems to work as a disinfectant.

I been using buyable tooth pastes but since I started using baking soda I feel like my teeth are auctully clean, and the stains are going away. 

I do remember a history teacher saying people use to mix baking soda with various things to make some made tooth paste. One thing I remember hearing was baking soda and peroxide. Though I'm skeptical of the peroxide as I don't want to poison myself. 

If I wanted make home made tooth paste using baking soda, what else could I try adding to it?

I wanted to get perspectives on the pros and cons of each location.

On our vacations we like doing the typical site seeing, but also like good food, coffee, and shops. We are also open to having some downtime this trip, but wouldn't want to do so at the expensive of seeing some of the sites, which is one thing that we are wary of when considering the resort.

I have been doing some fiddling and cleaning and have managed to get to a stage where water is now coming through the shower screen in a normal fashion rather than the one sided spray I was given it as. After fixing that i tested out the portafilter with no coffee and water is managing to get through alright however when i put 14g of coffee in and try to pull a shot the machine appears to struggle to get much coffee out. This run left me with a really small coffee that took a long time to pull.

For background info my parents don’t really care to know how to use the machine properly and tend to just pile a random amount of pre-ground coffee into it and hope for the best so my suspicions are that the portafilter baskets are clogged beyond repair as everything about the machine seems okay up to that point.

and witness hundreds of thousands praying there freely, with no checkpoints, no fear?

These are the questions that fill my mind.

Sometimes I wonder. 
Will I ever see my father walk again?
He gave his life to teaching   more than 37 generations of high school students  and now he lies in pain, trapped.

Will this genocide truly end?
Will I ever see Khaled grow up free 
walking, laughing, playing with his generation?

Will the injured heal?
Will the land be replanted?
Will the homes be rebuilt?
Will people return to work  and life?

Will the children play again, freely, without fear?
Will I get married?
Will I see any of it?

I think of all this every day.
And deep inside… I often answer myself:

Maybe I won’t see any of it. Maybe my helplessness is stronger than my hope.

But I still write these words.
Because writing is all I have left.
Maybe someone will listen.
Maybe someone will care.

Please…
Don’t scroll past our pain.
Don’t let this become normal.
Don’t let our dreams die in silence.

1lsilf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1lsilf6/saw_something_at_the_park_the_other_day_that_made/,Saw something at the park the other day that made me rethink how I’m raising my boys,"Took my boys to the park the other morning. One of those slow mornings where you grab coffee, let them burn energy, and you get to just watch them be kids.

There was another dad there with his kid, maybe four or five. The kid was trying to climb the slide the wrong way, slipping, frustrated, looking back at his dad for help. Dad didn’t move. Didn’t look up from his phone. The kid tried again, slipped, tried again, slipped, then sat down in the sand, defeated, picking at pebbles. Eventually, the dad looked up and yelled, “Come on, just go around!”

That kid’s face stuck with me for most of the day.

I’m not judging the dad. I’ve been that dad. Tired. Burnt out. Thinking a quick scroll is harmless. But it made me realize how often we tell our kids “you can do anything,” but we don’t show them. We tell them to try, to work hard, but we’re too distracted to see them when they look back for us.

And how many moments like this slip by? How many times do they look for our eyes to find the belief to try again, and we’re not there? I walked over to my boys, put my coffee down, and said, “Show me how fast you can go up.” They lit up. They wanted me there. They wanted to be seen.

I know we’re all tired. I know we’ve got a million things to do, and sometimes we need that scroll just to feel like we exist outside of snacks and bedtime routines. But man, these moments? They’re not small. They’re the whole thing. One day they’ll stop looking back to see if we’re watching. One day they’ll climb on without us, or won’t bother trying at all because they learned we’re not really there.

I needed to see that. Maybe you do too.",30,1751745456.0,Parenting,8,0.89,False

He gave his life to teaching   more than 37 generations of high school students  and now he lies in pain, trapped.

Will this genocide truly end?
Will I ever see Khaled grow up free 
walking, laughing, playing with his generation?

Will the injured heal?
Will the land be replanted?
Will the homes be rebuilt?
Will people return to work  and life?

Will the children play again, freely, without fear?
Will I get married?
Will I see any of it?

I think of all this every day.
And deep inside… I often answer myself:

Maybe I won’t see any of it. Maybe my helplessness is stronger than my hope.

But I still write these words.
Because writing is all I have left.
Maybe someone will listen.
Maybe someone will care.

Please…
Don’t scroll past our pain.
Don’t let this become normal.
Don’t let our dreams die in silence.

Hi gang! This is the first chapter of a novel that I've been working on for the past few weeks. I'm about three quarters of the way to the end. I'm having so much fun writing it (and re-reading and editing, but come on, I'm biased!). I have two main questions for this critique (but please feel free to leave any feedback you'd like! even if you didn't like this at all!, that's super helpful):

1. Does this excerpt make you want to read more of the book (i.e. does this hook you in or fall short of that?)
2. Does the dialog come off as ""how people would talk?"" (I love writing dialog, but I always worry that the characters don't sound like...people if that makes sense?)

Thank you all so much, and I sincerely appreciate any and all feedback.

# Chapter 1: The BBQ Diplomacy Crisis

A wise man once said: Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it's a start. Anthony Bourdain never had to mediate between a vampire coven and a werewolf pack arguing over South Philadelphia hunting rights, but I'm pretty sure he'd have appreciated the irony of using slow-smoked brisket as a peace treaty.

Right now, I've got five vampires glaring across my best picnic table at three werewolves who keep unconsciously baring their teeth every time the wind shifts and carries the scent of my burnt ends their way. Between them sits Tommy Chen, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else in the supernatural world than representing his pack in what's being generously called a ""territorial negotiation.""

The GPS in my truck (which has opinions about everything and the personality of a sarcastic teenager) chimed in twenty minutes ago with, ""You know, Mac, most food trucks just worry about running out of napkins.""

""Not helping,"" I'd muttered back, checking the internal temperature on a rack of ribs that might be the only thing standing between South Philly and its first supernatural incident since the Great Pixie Uprising of 2019.

The vampire delegation leader, a woman in an immaculate charcoal suit who looks like she stepped out of a corporate boardroom rather than a crypt, taps one perfectly manicured fingernail against my aluminum table. ""Mr. Sullivan, while we appreciate your... hospitality, this matter requires immediate resolution.""

""Ms. Castellano,"" I say, setting down a plate of brisket that's been smoking since four this morning, ""everything requires immediate resolution until you've had a proper meal."" The meat glistens with a bark that took me three years to perfect, and I watch her nostrils flare slightly despite herself. Vampires always claim they don't eat food, but I've yet to meet one who doesn't appreciate good craftsmanship.

Tommy shifts in his seat, and I catch the telltale sign of claws extending briefly before he forces them back. Kid's nervous. Hell, I would be too if I'd been thrown into pack politics at twenty-three with all the diplomatic training of a golden retriever.

""The issue,"" says Jimmy Rivera, Tommy's pack second and the only werewolf here old enough to remember when I was running around with Garrick saving the world, ""is that this new mortal truck is disrupting established patterns.""

He gestures toward the corner of Marconi Plaza where a gleaming silver food truck with ""Philly's Best Pit"" painted in aggressive red letters has been parking every day for the past two weeks. Even from here, I can see the line of eager South Philly residents waiting for what I'll grudgingly admit smells like decent barbecue.

""Disrupting patterns,"" Ms. Castellano repeats, her voice carrying the kind of corporate disdain usually reserved for quarterly earnings reports. ""Mr. Rivera, they're creating a public nuisance. The smoke interferes with our hunting coordination, and worse—"" she pauses, and I catch the slight embarrassment in her tone, ""—some of our younger members have been... distracted by the scent.""

Tommy perks up. ""Wait, you guys have the same problem? Because Jake and Danny keep sneaking over there during their breaks, and yesterday Danny actually bought a—""

Jimmy cuts him off with a look that could stop a charging bull. ""Tommy.""

""Right. Sorry. Shutting up now.""

I slide another plate toward the werewolf side of the table. This one is pulled pork with my signature coffee rub (made with house roasted beans from a little joint called Morghan Rake’s up in the Poconos…killer coffee) and watch Tommy's eyes widen. The kid's been coming to my truck for six months, ever since his first transformation when he discovered that post-change hunger hits different when you've got supernatural metabolism to feed.

""Here's what I'm hearing,"" I say, settling into the camping chair I keep for occasions exactly like this. ""Both of your communities have legitimate concerns about territory, hunting patterns, and maintaining the balance that's kept South Philly peaceful for the last decade. And both of you are treating this like the new guy is the enemy instead of a potential solution.""

Ms. Castellano raises one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. ""Mr. Sullivan, I fail to see how a mortal food vendor constitutes a solution to supernatural territorial disputes.""

I take a bite of my own brisket: never serve anything you haven't tasted yourself, another Bourdain rule. I let the silence stretch just long enough to get uncomfortable. In my old life with Garrick, this would be the moment where he'd launch into an inspiring speech about cooperation and the greater good. These days, I find that good barbecue and strategic silence work just as well.

""Tommy,"" I say finally, ""what time does your pack usually run this route?""

""Uh, after midnight? We start at the playground and loop through the residential streets toward—"" He stops, glancing nervously at Ms. Castellano.

""Toward the old church on Tenth Street,"" she finishes smoothly. ""Which is where my people have been gathering for coordination since 1987.""

""And what time does Philly's Best Pit close up shop?""

""Eight-thirty,"" Tommy says immediately, then blushes furiously when everyone looks at him. ""I mean, I might have noticed. In passing. While walking by. Definitely not while buying a sandwich.""

Jimmy sighs deeply. ""Tommy.""

""It was a really good sandwich!""

The moment hangs in the air like smoke from my chimney, and I can practically see the gears turning in everyone's heads. Well, everyone except Tommy, who's still looking mortified about his sandwich confession.

""So,"" I continue, refilling Jimmy's sweet tea without being asked (werewolves always run hot and need the hydration), ""we've got a mortal truck that closes at eight-thirty, vampires who need the area after nine, and werewolves who run after midnight. Anyone else see the obvious solution, or are we all going to keep pretending this is rocket science?""

Ms. Castellano's fingernail stops tapping. ""You're suggesting a time-share arrangement.""

""I'm suggesting that maybe…and I know this is radical thinking: you could try talking to Dave instead of talking around him.""

""Dave?"" Jimmy asks.

""Dave Kowalski. Owns Philly's Best Pit. Third-generation South Philly, learned to smoke meat from his grandfather, lost his job at the Navy Yard last year and sank his savings into that truck."" I gesture toward the gleaming vehicle with the kind of fond respect one craftsman gives another. ""He's not some corporate invader trying to muscle in on your territory. He's a guy trying to feed his family by feeding his neighbors.""

Tommy's ears (which are slightly more pointed than they should be this close to the full moon) perk up with interest. ""Have you talked to him?""

""Kid, I talked to him the day he showed up. Professional courtesy. His dry rub needs work, but his smoking technique is solid, and his heart's in the right place."" I pause to check the ribs again, more out of habit than necessity. ""He's also got no idea he's parked in the middle of supernatural Switzerland.""

""And you propose we... what? Introduce ourselves?"" Ms. Castellano's tone suggests she'd rather gargle holy water.

""I propose you stop thinking like predators marking territory and start thinking like neighbors sharing a community."" I stand up, pulling the ribs off the grill with the kind of flourish that would make Garrick proud. The meat falls off the bone perfectly, and the smell makes even the vampires lean forward slightly. ""Tommy, your pack runs after midnight, right? When's the last time anyone bothered Dave after he closed up shop?""

""Never?"" Tommy ventures. ""I mean, the plaza's pretty empty by nine.""

""Ms. Castellano, what time do your people usually finish... coordinating?""

""We're typically concluded by eleven-thirty,"" she admits reluctantly.

""Great. So we've got Dave serving food from noon to eight-thirty, vampires doing vampire things from nine to eleven-thirty, and werewolves doing werewolf things from midnight onward. The only overlap is Dave potentially staying late for cleanup, which,"" I pause dramatically, the way I learned from watching Garrick work a crowd, ""could be solved if he had some friendly neighbors willing to help him pack up faster in exchange for occasional samples. That should give enough time for the uh…interfering scent of smoke to clear out.""

The silence that follows is broken by Tommy's stomach rumbling loudly enough to wake the dead. Which, given present company, might not be entirely metaphorical.

""Sorry,"" he mumbles. ""Transformation week always makes me hungry, and that smells really—""

""Here."" I load up a plate with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork, adding a generous scoop of my maple-bourbon beans. ""Growing werewolf needs proper fuel. Jimmy, you're eating too, don't even try to argue. Ms. Castellano—""

""I don't eat food, Mr. Sullivan.""

""You don't *need* food. Doesn't mean you can't appreciate it."" I slide a small plate toward her with a single perfect slice of brisket, the bark glistening and the smoke ring visible in cross-section. ""Call it professional consultation. I'd value your opinion on the seasoning balance.""

She stares at the meat like it might bite her back, but I catch the way her fingers inch toward the fork.

Tommy, meanwhile, has achieved a state of barbecue-induced bliss that's making his wolf instincts happy in a way that's probably visible from space. ""Oh my god,"" he says around a mouthful of ribs, ""this is incredible. Mac, how do you get the bark so—""

""Trade secret,"" I say, but I'm grinning. ""Though I might be willing to share some techniques with Dave if someone were to introduce us…properly.""

Jimmy pauses mid-chew. ""You want us to vouch for you with a mortal.""

""I want you to help me help him understand that his new neighborhood comes with some... unique considerations. In exchange for which, he gets the protection of both your communities, some advice on improving his operation, and the kind of customer loyalty that only comes from supernatural metabolism.""

""And what do we get?"" Ms. Castellano asks, though she's definitely holding that fork now.

""You get a neighbor instead of a problem. You get someone who understands the rules without needing to know the details. And—"" I pause for effect, ""—you get Dave's maple bacon burnt ends, which I've had, and which are absolutely worth protecting.""

Tommy's eyes go wide. ""He has maple bacon burnt ends?""

""Tommy,"" Jimmy warns, but he's fighting a smile.

""What? I'm just saying, if we're talking about community benefits—""

Ms. Castellano finally takes a bite of the brisket. Her expression doesn't change, but she chews slowly, thoughtfully, like she's conducting a scientific analysis. After a long moment, she swallows and sets down the fork.

""The coffee rub is... sophisticated,"" she admits. ""Well-balanced. Though perhaps a touch heavy on the brown sugar.""

Coming from a vampire, that's basically a five-star review.

""I'll take that under advisement,"" I say solemnly. ""So. Do we have an agreement? Dave gets introduced to his new neighbors, everyone gets a schedule that works, and South Philly continues its proud tradition of solving problems with food and common sense?""

Jimmy looks at Tommy, who's nodding enthusiastically while working his way through what might be a record-setting amount of barbecue. Ms. Castellano takes another small bite of brisket, her corporate mask slipping just enough to show genuine curiosity.

""There would need to be protocols,"" she says finally. ""Clear boundaries. Consequences for violations.""

""Absolutely. We'll draw up a proper agreement. Something everyone can live with.""

""And if Dave doesn't want supernatural neighbors?"" Jimmy asks.

I grin. ""Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But in my experience, most people are more reasonable than you expect once they've had a good meal and someone's taken the time to actually talk to them.""

The GPS chooses that moment to chime in: ""Hate to interrupt this heartwarming moment of community building, but you've got three customers waiting at the window. And one of them is definitely not human.""

I glance toward the truck where, sure enough, three figures are waiting with the patient politeness of people who've learned not to interrupt Mac Sullivan when he's mediating supernatural politics. The GPS wasn't wrong about one of them: the tall woman in the flowing dress has the kind of ethereal quality that screams ""fairy"" even from a distance.

""Duty calls,"" I say, standing and wiping my hands on my apron. ""Tommy, finish eating. Jimmy, make sure he doesn't make himself sick. I know what werewolf metabolism looks like when it meets good barbecue. Ms. Castellano, think about what we discussed. I'll set up a meeting with Dave for tomorrow evening, after he closes but before your people need the space.""

""And if he refuses?"" she asks, though she's eyeing the remaining brisket like she's considering a second helping.

""He won't,"" I say with more confidence than I feel. ""Trust me. I know people.""

As I walk toward the truck, I hear Tommy say, ""Is it weird that I'm actually excited about this? I mean, we're going to have a mortal neighbor who makes maple bacon burnt ends!""

""Tommy,"" Jimmy sighs, but there's fondness in it now.

The fairy at my window (and she is definitely a fairy), with those too-bright eyes and the way flowers seem to be blooming in her hair, smiles as I approach. ""Mac Sullivan,"" she says in a voice like wind chimes. ""I hope we're not interrupting anything important.""

""Just preventing a supernatural incident through the strategic application of barbecue,"" I say, pulling on my serving gloves. ""The usual Tuesday afternoon. What can I get you, Lily?""

Lily Moonwhisper (yes, that's her real name, and yes, she picked it herself when she immigrated from the Summer Court twenty years ago) is one of my regulars. She runs a flower shop in Queen Village that somehow always has the exact blooms people need, often before they know they need them.

""The usual for me,"" she says, ""but I'm also ordering for my companions. This is Roberto—"" she gestures to a nervous-looking young man who's definitely human ""—and this is Ms. Chen.""

The older woman next to Roberto gives me a slight bow. ""Mr. Sullivan. I've heard excellent things about your establishment.""

Something about her formal politeness and the way she carries herself makes me think martial arts, but there's also an energy around her that feels... old. Practiced. Like she's been managing power for longer than most people have been alive.

""First time at The Crossroads Kitchen?"" I ask, already pulling ingredients for Lily's order (a surprisingly hearty sandwich for someone who survives primarily on nectar and morning dew).

""Indeed. My grandson has spoken very highly of your food, though he seems particularly fond of your maple cookies.""

It takes me a second, then— ""You're Tommy's grandmother.""

She nods serenely. ""Helen Chen. I thought it was time I met the man who's been feeding my grandson properly.""

I glance back at the picnic table where Tommy is indeed still eating, Jimmy watching him with amused exasperation while Ms. Castellano appears to be conducting a detailed analysis of my barbecue sauce.

""He's a good kid,"" I say, starting on Helen's order without asking what she wants. Something tells me she's the type who appreciates when people pay attention. ""Anxious, but good instincts.""

""Anxiety runs in the family,"" she says dryly. ""As does a tendency to get involved in situations larger than ourselves. I understand he's representing the pack today?""

""First time. He's doing better than he thinks.""

Roberto clears his throat nervously. ""Um, excuse me? I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering... are you really *the* Mac Sullivan? From the Aurora Crisis?""

And there it is. The question I get at least once a week, usually from young humans who grew up hearing stories about Garrick the Hero and his trusty sidekick. I've developed a standard response that's polite but deflecting, designed to redirect attention back to the food and away from my brief career in world-saving.

But something about Roberto's earnest expression stops me. He's not looking for gossip or bragging rights. He looks like someone who genuinely needs to know that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.

""Yeah,"" I say simply. ""That's me. Though these days I'm more interested in preventing crises than solving them. Much better hours, and the pay is steadier.""

Roberto's face lights up like I've just confirmed that Santa Claus is real. ""That's... wow. I mean, I grew up reading about you guys. My mom used to tell me stories about how you saved the world.""

""Garrick saved the world,"" I correct automatically. ""I just made sure he ate properly while he was doing it.""

""But you figured out how to stop the Aurora Protocol!"" Roberto insists. ""The books said you were the one who realized the containment field needed to be inverted instead of—""

""The books exaggerate,"" I cut him off gently, but I'm starting to understand why Helen brought this kid here. There's something desperate in his enthusiasm, like he's clinging to the idea of heroism. ""Trust me, most of what we did was just showing up and trying not to make things worse. The real magic was in the boring stuff. You know, research, planning, making sure everyone had what they needed to do their jobs.""

I slide Helen's order across the counter. A simple sandwich that I've somehow known exactly how to make, as if the truck itself told me what she needed.

""Like feeding people,"" Lily adds with a knowing smile.

""Like feeding people,"" I agree. ""Roberto, what can I get you?""

He orders nervously, clearly still starstruck, and I find myself wondering what Helen's angle is. Fairy godmother types like Lily don't just randomly bring humans to supernatural food trucks, and overprotective werewolf grandmothers definitely don't introduce strangers to their family's favorite haunts without good reason.

""Roberto is starting graduate school at Penn in the fall,"" Helen says casually, as if that explains everything. ""Anthropology, with a focus on folklore and urban legends.""

Ah. There it is.

""Interesting field,"" I say, keeping my voice carefully neutral as I assemble Roberto's order. ""Planning to focus on any particular region?""

""Actually, I'm hoping to study the supernatural communities of major American cities,"" Roberto says, his excitement overriding his nerves. ""There's so much oral tradition that's never been properly documented, and with climate change and urban development changing traditional gathering places—""

""Roberto,"" Helen interrupts gently, ""perhaps you should eat first. Food always tastes better when it's hot.""

The kid takes the hint and bites into his sandwich. Pulled pork with my Carolina-style sauce, and his eyes go wide with the kind of wonder that makes all the prep work worthwhile.

""This is incredible,"" he mumbles around a mouthful of food. ""The smoke flavor is perfect, and the sauce has this tang that—"" He pauses, suddenly self-conscious. ""Sorry. I get excited about food. My mom says I'm worse than a restaurant critic.""

""Never apologize for appreciating good cooking,"" I tell him. ""Your mom sounds smart.""

Helen is watching this exchange with the kind of satisfied expression that makes me think I've just passed some kind of test I didn't know I was taking.

""Roberto is looking for a research advisor,"" she says casually. ""Someone with practical experience in supernatural community dynamics. Perhaps even someone who's successfully mediated conflicts between different groups.""

Behind me, I hear the GPS snort with electronic laughter. ""Subtle, Helen. Really subtle.""

I ignore my truck's commentary and focus on the implications of what Helen's suggesting. Because she's definitely suggesting something, and knowing Tommy's family, it's probably more complicated than it appears on the surface.

""That sounds like important work,"" I say carefully. ""Though I imagine it would require a lot of trust from the communities being studied. The kind of trust that takes time to build.""

""Indeed,"" Helen agrees. ""It would require someone who understands that the best research comes from genuine relationships, not academic extraction. Someone who sees supernatural beings as neighbors rather than subjects.""

Lily laughs, the sound like silver bells. ""Helen, dear, you're being about as subtle as a brick through a window.""

""Subtlety is overrated,"" Helen replies serenely. ""Mac, Roberto would like to learn how to build those relationships. I thought perhaps you might be willing to share some wisdom about community building. Nothing formal, of course. Just... guidance.""

I look at Roberto, who's gone very still except for his continued methodical demolition of his sandwich. The kid is clearly brilliant (you don't get into Penn's graduate program without serious academic chops) but there's something vulnerable about the way he's waiting for my answer.

""Can I ask you something, Roberto?"" I say finally. ""Why supernatural communities? There's a lot of safer folklore to study.""

He swallows his bite of sandwich and considers the question seriously. ""Because they're real,"" he says simply. ""Because they're here, and they're part of our world, and most people pretend they don't exist. But they have stories and traditions and problems just like everyone else, and ignoring them doesn't make them go away. It just makes everything more complicated.""

From the picnic table, I hear Tommy laugh at something Jimmy said, the sound bright and genuinely happy. Ms. Castellano is still eating my brisket with the focused attention of someone conducting important research.

""Plus,"" Roberto adds, grinning suddenly, ""my girlfriend is a selkie, and she got tired of me asking stupid questions about her family's customs. She said if I was going to be curious about supernatural culture, I should do it properly.""

That startles a laugh out of me. ""Smart girlfriend.""

""The smartest. She's the one who told me to talk to Helen, actually. Said the Chens know everyone worth knowing in the supernatural community.""

Helen beams with obvious pride. ""We've been in Philadelphia for six generations. You learn things.""

""Like which food truck owner doubles as a supernatural diplomat?"" I ask dryly.

""Among other things,"" she agrees.

I study Roberto for a long moment, weighing Helen's carefully orchestrated introduction against my own instincts about the kid. There's something genuinely earnest about him that reminds me of Tommy. Maybe that combination of intelligence and enthusiasm that can either lead to great things or spectacular disasters, depending on the guidance they get.

""Tell you what,"" I say finally. ""Why don't you come back next Tuesday around this time? I'll introduce you to some people, let you see how these things actually work. But Roberto—"" I fix him with the kind of serious look I used to reserve for Garrick when he was about to do something heroically stupid. ""This isn't academic fieldwork. These are people's lives, people's communities. You treat them like research subjects instead of neighbors, and you'll find yourself persona non grata faster than you can say 'dissertation proposal.'""

His face lights up like I've just handed him the keys to the supernatural kingdom. ""Really? You'd do that?""

""I'd give it a try. Helen vouching for you goes a long way, and anyone dating a selkie has probably already learned the importance of respectful curiosity."" I pause, glancing at Helen. ""Though I suspect this whole introduction was less coincidence and more carefully orchestrated community networking.""

Helen's smile is absolutely serene. ""I have no idea what you mean.""

""Uh-huh."" I hand Roberto his receipt. ""Bring your girlfriend next week if she's available. Selkies always have interesting perspectives on community dynamics.""

Lily claps her hands together, and actual flower petals fall from her fingertips. ""Oh, this is lovely! Roberto, you're going to learn so much. Mac has the most wonderful way of helping people understand each other.""

""I just feed people and try not to let anyone start a war in my dining area,"" I protest, but I'm already thinking about which community members might be good for Roberto to meet. Maybe Dolores. She's got teenage daughters and a practical approach to supernatural parenting that could give him good insights into generational change in supernatural families.

As my new customers head off with their food, Helen presses a small wrapped package into my hands ""for later, when you have time to appreciate it properly,"" I make my way back to the picnic table where my diplomatic crisis is reaching its natural conclusion.

Tommy has reached that state of post-barbecue contentment that werewolves achieve when they've finally gotten enough protein to satisfy their supernatural metabolism. He's leaning back in his chair, eyes half-closed, looking more relaxed than I've seen him since the full moon cycle started.

Ms. Castellano, meanwhile, has somehow managed to finish her entire plate of brisket while maintaining perfect posture and professional composure. The only evidence of her meal is a slight softening around her eyes and the way she's looking at my sauce bottles with obvious interest.

""So,"" I say, settling back into my chair. ""Have we reached any conclusions while I was conducting customer service?""

""We've been discussing logistics,"" Jimmy says, though his tone suggests the discussion was more productive than he'd expected. ""Ms. Castellano has some practical concerns about implementation.""

""I want to understand Mr. Kowalski's long-term intentions,"" she says precisely. ""Is this a temporary business venture, or does he plan to establish permanent presence in the plaza?""

""Permanent,"" I say without hesitation. ""Dave's got two kids and a mortgage. This isn't a hobby for him, it's how he's going to build a future. Which means you'll want him invested in the community's success, not feeling like he's on borrowed time.""

Tommy perks up. ""What if we helped him succeed? I mean, like really succeed. Word-of-mouth advertising in the supernatural community is incredibly powerful.""

Jimmy raises an eyebrow. ""You want to turn a mortal food truck into a supernatural hangout?""

""Not exactly,"" Tommy says, warming to his theme with the confidence that comes from a full stomach and a successful first diplomatic negotiation. ""But think about it—we're already talking about sharing the space. What if we made it a real partnership? Dave provides good food and maintains the space during the day, our communities provide security and customer base during our respective time slots.""

Ms. Castellano tilts her head thoughtfully. ""An intriguing proposition. Though it would require significant trust on all sides.""

""Trust builds over time,"" I say, echoing something Garrick used to say during our diplomatic missions. ""Start small, prove reliability, expand the partnership as everyone gets comfortable.""

""Plus,"" Tommy adds with a grin that's definitely more wolf than human, ""if the rest of Dave's food is half as good as Mac's, some of the younger pack members might actually start showing up for community meetings instead of finding excuses to run solo.""

Jimmy laughs despite himself. ""Tommy, you can't solve pack engagement issues with barbecue.""

""Can't I?"" Tommy challenges. ""When's the last time we had full attendance at anything?""

""He's got a point,"" I admit. ""Food brings people together. It's universal language, even across species.""

Ms. Castellano checks her phone with the kind of precision that suggests vampire punctuality is not a stereotype. ""I need to return to my office shortly, but I believe we have the framework for an agreement. Mr. Sullivan, you'll arrange the introduction with Mr. Kowalski?""

""Tomorrow evening, seven-thirty. After he closes but before your people need the plaza."" I stand, already mentally planning how to approach Dave about his new neighbors. ""I'll handle the initial conversation, make sure he understands the... unique aspects of the situation without overwhelming him.""

""And if he's not receptive?"" Jimmy asks.

""Then we try a different approach. But Dave's a reasonable guy, and he cares about his community. Once he understands that cooperation benefits everyone, he'll come around.""

Tommy bounces slightly in his seat. ""Can I be there? For the introduction, I mean. I promise I won't say anything stupid.""

""Tommy,"" Jimmy warns, but he's smiling.

""I think that's a great idea,"" I say, ignoring Marcus's look of surprise. ""Dave should meet some of his neighbors, and you did good work today. Consider it part of your diplomatic education.""

The kid practically glows with pride, and I catch Jimmy nodding approvingly. Good. Tommy needs confidence more than he needs protection, and giving him responsibility is the fastest way to build both.

""Very well,"" Ms. Castellano says, standing with fluid grace. ""Tommy, it's been... illuminating working with you today. You show considerable promise for inter-community relations.""

Tommy stammers out a thank-you while turning approximately the color of my barbecue sauce, and I bite back a grin. If anyone had told me six months ago that I'd be watching a vampire corporate executive compliment an anxious werewolf college kid on his diplomatic potential, I'd have suggested they lay off whatever they were drinking.

These days, it's just Tuesday afternoon at The Crossroads Kitchen.

As my customers pack up and head their separate ways…vampires back to whatever corporate empire Ms. Castellano runs during daylight hours, werewolves back to their day jobs in construction and food service…I start my own cleanup routine. The GPS has been unusually quiet during the negotiations, but as I load the last of the dishes into my mobile wash station, it finally speaks up.

""Not bad for a Tuesday,"" it says with electronic satisfaction. ""Though I still think you're crazy for getting involved in community politics.""

""Says the GPS that insisted on taking the scenic route through a fairy ring last week.""

""That was a shortcut! And technically, we got there faster.""

""We also got there covered in glitter that took three days to wash off.""

""Details,"" the GPS sniffs. ""Besides, you like the glitter. Adds character to your whole 'reformed adventurer' aesthetic.""

I laugh despite myself as I secure the last of my equipment. The truth is, I do like this life. After years of chasing cosmic threats and mystical artifacts, there's something deeply satisfying about problems that can be solved with good food and patient conversation. Garrick's off somewhere saving this world or that one with a new team, and I'm here in South Philadelphia making sure vampires and werewolves can share a plaza without bloodshed.

Different kinds of heroism, maybe, but heroism nonetheless.

""Where to next, boss?"" the GPS asks as I settle into the driver's seat.

I check my mental map of regular customers and community needs. ""Fishtown. Dolores texted that her youngest is having pre-transformation anxiety again, and nothing helps teenage werewolf nerves like my chocolate chip cookies.""

""Ah, the magic cookies that cure supernatural adolescence. I still say you should patent that recipe.""

""Magic's not in the recipe,"" I say, pulling out of Marconi Plaza with one last glance at Dave's truck. Tomorrow evening, Dave Kowalski is going to learn that his new neighborhood comes with some very interesting neighbors. If I've learned anything from six months of supernatural food service, it's that most people are more adaptable than they think. Especially when someone takes the time to explain things over a good meal.

""It's in the caring,"" I add, more to myself than to the GPS.

""Philosophical as always,"" the GPS replies, but its tone is fond. ""Route calculated to Fishtown. ETA twelve minutes, assuming we don't get distracted by any more diplomatic crises.""

As we roll through South Philadelphia toward our next stop, I find myself thinking about Roberto's research project and Helen's careful orchestration of community connections. The supernatural world is changing, adapting to urban development and climate shifts and the simple reality of living alongside humans who are increasingly aware that magic is real.

Maybe having someone document those changes isn't such a bad idea. Maybe having a bridge between academic understanding and lived experience could help everyone navigate the future a little better.

1lsifym,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialParis/comments/1lsifym/meet_up/,Meet Up,"Hi everyone, British guy in Paris (moved here a year ago for work).

I moved here with my wife and our Dog (Labrador Retriever for anyone interested!). From London.

Honestly found it difficult to find/connect with people, life is so busy for everyone, and it’s been tough juggling everything that comes with moving countries! So I just thought I’d give this a go!

A bit about me / us - working in Event Production / PR currently, with a past in everything from theatre / film, to music / festivals. Love film, food and travel and of course Dry British humour. Our dog doesn’t work, although the way she acts you’d think shes really hard done-by.

So, If anyone is interested in meeting for a coffee or drink on the weekend (maybe the 19/20 July). I thought I’d get myself, my wife, and maybe even the dog over to a bar or cafe to meet with anyone who’s up for it! If nothing else, it’s 100% worth meeting our Dog, who is very nice to be around!

Happy to meet French-only speakers too of course, I speak okay French, but it might be a little slow - I’m learning!

So I guess leave a comment or feel free to DM, and I’ll gather a group together, maybe build a WhatsApp group or something more convenient.

Sorry if I’ve broken any rules on this sub!

When will I be able to chase *even one* of my dreams?

When will I travel with my father to Egypt so he can finally get the surgery he's needed for the past 1 year and 9 months  since he lost all ability to walk?
Imagine: doctors here in Gaza cannot operate  not because they lack knowledge, but because they don’t even have basic sterilizers, painkillers, or surgical tools.
An entire people suffering  simply because even medicine  is being blocked.

When will we live again in a home that has a roof, real walls, a fan, and a window?
When will we feel that simple feeling of normal life. again?

When will I return to my land  plant fruit trees, citrus, and vegetables with my own hands?

When will I harvest our olive trees, press them into gallons of golden oil  our symbol of life in Palestine?

When will I go back to the electricity company  sit with the engineers in the morning, drink coffee before work, and head out with a smile to build and repair what we can for our people?
When will I go home afterward to have lunch with my parents, hear their prayers for me, and feel that my hard work meant something?

When will I be able to treat my nephew Khaled 
whose little legs are now bent and weak from hunger and lack of calcium?
He can’t stand. He can’t walk.
Will he ever live a childhood without pain?

When will I be able to play with my nieces and nephews, buy them toys, and celebrate Eid with them as they deserve?

When will I marry the woman I’ve loved for years 

the woman I can’t marry because I cannot even afford her dowry?
Sometimes I even tell myself I’m lucky I didn’t.
because how could I feed a wife or children in this life?

When will I look at my family and see them full, safe, and warm 
drinking juice, laughing, sitting around the fire in winter roasting potatoes like we used to?

When will my people live without bombs, without tents, without hunger?

When will my homeland be free  no more land stolen, no more forced displacement, no more massacres?

When will I see the flag of my country fly over Al-Aqsa Mosque 
and witness hundreds of thousands praying there freely, with no checkpoints, no fear?

These are the questions that fill my mind.

Sometimes I wonder…
Will I ever see my father walk again?
He gave his life to teaching  more than 37 generations of high school students  and now he lies in pain, trapped.

Will this genocide truly end?
Will I ever see Khaled grow up free 
walking, laughing, playing with his generation?

Will the injured heal?
Will the land be replanted?
Will the homes be rebuilt?
Will people return to work  and life?

Will the children play again, freely, without fear?
Will I get married?
Will I see any of it?

I think of all this every day.
And deep inside . I often answer myself:

Maybe I won’t see any of it. Maybe my helplessness is stronger than my hope.

But I still write these words.
Because writing is all I have left.
Maybe someone will listen.
Maybe someone will care.

Please…

1lsid2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lsid2t/june_bugs/,June bugs,"I was seventeen when I dropped out, and I’d be lying if I said it was for any noble reason. I wasn’t chasing a dream or escaping abuse or burning with some artistic vision—I was just bored, and school felt like a long hallway that never led anywhere. I remember the day I left: I walked out mid-lecture during AP Government, lit a cigarette I'd stolen from my uncle's trailer, and never went back. No one stopped me.

Two weeks later, I was living with my cousin Danny in a busted-up trailer near the New Mexico border. The air out here is thick with heat and dust and regret. The land doesn’t give you much, and it sure as hell doesn’t take kindly to being asked. Danny, who’d once done a stint in juvie for lighting a fire under a priest’s car, got me a job at the Sunrise Palms Motel.

It wasn’t the kind of place that showed up in travel brochures.

Twelve rooms, all rotting from the inside out. A cracked pool out back that hadn’t seen water since before 9/11. And a neon sign that read ""S URIS PA MS,"" buzzing like an insect trying to remember its own name.

The owner, a woman named Mags, ran the place with the kind of grim pride you see in war veterans and funeral directors. She was leathery, chain-smoked Virginia Slims, and wore her sunglasses even at night. Said her eyes were too soft for this world.

“You’ll do the linens, clean the rooms, man the desk from dusk to midnight. Don’t talk to the guests unless they talk to you first. If someone knocks after midnight, you didn’t hear it. If they try to give you something—don’t take it. Not money, not a tip, not a smile. You understand me?”

I nodded.

“You’ll hear things here. That don’t mean they’re your business. You hear me again?”

I nodded again.

It started slow. The first few days were uneventful. A lot of dusting, scrubbing mildew off toilets, chasing out spiders big enough to hold conversations. I’d find things left behind in the rooms—half-burnt Polaroids, prescription bottles with no labels, once even a baby tooth under a pillow like someone thought the Tooth Fairy still made house calls.

The guests didn’t stick around long. They came in looking empty and left looking emptier. People on the run. People who’d already stopped running but hadn’t realized it yet. One guy checked in with a bleeding suitcase. Another woman had a crucifix tattooed on each eyelid and never blinked.

Then there was Room 6.

Room 6 was always locked. Mags never let me clean it. ""No one goes in there,"" she said. ""No one has.""

I asked once, and she looked at me with her lips pursed so tight they could’ve cracked. “You want to keep your tongue, don't ask again.”

Fair enough.

But the door was warm. Always. Even when the AC kicked on or rain passed through. It pulsed like skin. Sometimes I’d walk by and swear I heard breathing inside. Not deep, not human. Something wet and steady, like a dog dreaming underwater.

One night, I was manning the front desk, flipping through an old paperback someone had left behind—The 37th Parallel and Other Government Lies—when a girl walked in.

She couldn’t have been more than nineteen. Pale. Barefoot. Wore a white summer dress stained at the hem with red dirt. Her hair hung in loose black ropes that looked soaked even though it hadn’t rained in days. She didn’t say a word. Just dropped a wad of bills on the counter and pointed to the far end.

I gave her Room 9.

When I handed her the key, her fingers brushed mine. Ice cold. I pulled back instinctively, but she didn’t flinch. Just looked at me like she’d already seen me die.

“Need anything else?” I asked.

She shook her head and walked out.

I watched her disappear into the night, her white dress swallowing moonlight.

Around midnight, I heard screaming.

It wasn’t normal screaming. Not the kind that comes from a fight or a bad dream. It was ragged, primal. The sound something makes when it realizes it’s not coming back whole. It was coming from Room 9.

I stood up, grabbed the spare key from the pegboard, and froze.

Mags’ voice in my head.
If someone knocks after midnight, you didn’t hear it.

But no one knocked.

I walked to Room 9.

The door was cracked. Inside, the girl was sitting on the edge of the bed, facing away from me. Her back was covered in scratches. Long, deep ones like something had tried to write a poem in her flesh.

The air in the room smelled like flowers left too long in a vase. Sweet and wrong.

I was about to speak when she turned around.

Her eyes were gone. Just black, weeping sockets. Her mouth opened, but instead of words, a sound came out—low, metallic, like someone dragging chains through a tunnel.

Then she was gone.

Just like that.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat behind the desk and stared at Room 9 until the sun came up.

When Mags came in the next morning, she didn’t ask why I looked like I’d seen a ghost. She just handed me a coffee and said, “If she comes again, don’t follow her.”

“How did you know—”

“I always know. Clean the room. Then burn the linens.”

I tried to quit the next day. Packed my bag, told Danny I was heading out, maybe to Tucson. But as I walked past the motel, I saw something.

Room 6.

The door was wide open.

No light came out. Just dark. Dark so thick it seemed to suck in sound.

And inside... something moved.

Not walked. Moved. Like roots curling through soil.

I should’ve kept walking. Should’ve gotten in that rusted truck and never looked back.

But I didn’t.

I stepped inside.

The temperature dropped ten degrees. My breath came out in clouds.

There was a bed. Made perfectly. A dresser, untouched. A mirror—cracked in the corner but still reflecting everything except me.

And in the far corner, curled into itself like a fetus, was a thing.

It wasn’t a man. It wasn’t not a man. It was thin and tall, too tall, with skin that looked like wax melting off old bone. It had no eyes, but it knew me.

I felt its knowing slide into me like a needle. I collapsed.

When I woke up, I was in my trailer. Mags was sitting at the table.

“You’re not ready for that room,” she said.

“What was that?” I asked.

“Something old. Something we owe. This place is a throat, and every now and then, it needs to swallow. That's how it stays hidden. That's how we stay alive.”

I wanted to scream at her. Hit her. Burn the place to the ground.

But I just nodded.

And I stayed.

Because something changed in me that night. I started hearing things in the air. Whispered names. Forgotten songs. My dreams were full of salt and flies and a voice that sounded like my own mother begging me to come home even though she’d been dead for three years.

I started seeing people before they arrived. I’d dream of a man with broken fingers, and the next day, Room 4 would check in under “Mr. Smith,” fingers twitching like he couldn’t forget what they’d done.

The girl in white came back once. Just once. She didn’t say anything, but she left a flower on the counter. One I couldn’t identify. Blue petals, oily sheen, smelled like static.

I didn’t touch it.

Mags burned it that night. Said if you let those things linger, they find ways to root.

Weeks bled into months. Summer scorched the land into cracked parchment. The motel kept breathing, swallowing, remembering. I started keeping a journal, but it never stayed written. Pages would turn blank. Or worse—rearranged, filled with handwriting that wasn’t mine, spelling things backward.

Eventually, I stopped trying to make sense of it.

One night, Danny didn’t come home.

I found his truck parked out back, engine still warm. The door to Room 6 was ajar.

Inside, there was nothing.

Just a faint hum.

And the mirror, now cracked in the other corner.

Mags didn’t say a word. Just handed me a new ledger, told me I was promoted.

“People like us—we don’t find these places. They find us. And they don’t let go.”

I’ve been here two years now. Or maybe twenty. Time doesn’t mean much anymore. The sun still rises, but sometimes it comes up blue. Sometimes the roosters crow in Spanish or speak in riddles.

I’ve stopped questioning it.

I clean the rooms. I watch the desk. I warn the new ones.

And sometimes, late at night, I sit outside with a cigarette and watch the desert breathe.

There’s beauty in it, too. In the awful. In the broken.

The motel isn’t evil. It’s just hungry.

And I’ve learned to feed it gently.

Like brushing the hair of a dying god.

Like whispering lullabies to the thing under the bed so it doesn’t wake too fast.

I dropped out of school thinking I knew how the world worked.

But it wasn’t until I started working at the Sunrise Palms Motel that I realized...

The world is much bigger.

And some corners should never be dusted.

The sun rises blood-red again today. Room 6 is breathing louder.
I think it remembers me.

I had to quit my job due to not being able to do my job like I used to. And my boyfriend took me in. However, my boyfriend lives with his parents who are both sick. He’s a veteran. Doesn’t have work. Lost custody of his child after the divorce. Ever since he played games almost 24/7 and haven’t worked even after leaving the military. He went to school but stopped because he realized he wasn’t interested and kept failing because things happen in his life. Meanwhile, I am a single mom of two and the only provider of my 2 children as their fathers doesn’t have the balls to support them financially. I rely on my unemployment and school refund as of the moment. Continously looking for a job. Had interviews these past week but couldn’t get hired. I become depressed and anxious to the point I barely slept at night. So I sleep during the day at times. My only motivation is going to coffee shop to get things done because I will stay in bed so my going to coffee shops to be productive costs me. I do their laundry, clean their house, clean the toilet as my form of contribution for taking me in. And now he points out my going out to be productive and my need to nap due because I couldn’t sleep thinking about how and where to get money and a job and how to send money to my kids who are in another country. Meanwhile, he plays on his phone a lot, not earning anything, doesn’t apply for jobs and always have  strong resistance to everything. I get that he takes care of his parents and he experience being paralyzed due to being overwhelmed after so long of not working. He said we’re partners but why do I feel like I’m the only one who needs to find a way to earn? He criticize me of my spending habits when he doesn’t share our expenses together. He felt I’m disconnecting because I couldn’t communicate these to him without him being angry. And because he has anger issues, I’m afraid of him when his tone changes because the last time he grabbed me over and over on my forearm, which eventually hurt, to get me out of the room so he could do his stuff in his computer.

So I’ve had a lifetime of figuring out routines, coping, etc. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to de-clutter. It’s the biggest obstacle and I struggle very hard with just not having things out in common areas. It’s empty cups, lose mail, pill bottles, just things that should go in the trash or in their own home. I know myself pretty well and I think the issue boils down to a combination of lack of motivation and not putting stuff “back where it goes” whether that be in the sink, in the trash, or in a cupboard. My sister even helped me out once and cleaned my kitchen/dining room bc I had been working a lot of hours and was struggling to stay on top of household chores. Within a week the clutter was back. I don’t even realize it’s there until it’s bad. Like, there’s no place to sit at the table, or I go to set a cup on the coffee table and there’s no space. The only thing I can think is to have no surfaces which is obviously ridiculous and not a real suggestion lol. So what are some things y’all have done to minimize clutter in this way? Is it having better routines? Working on motivation? I do take medication but it only helps so much and I think I may need to up my dose. I’m just tired of the clutter.

My home is completely tiled. I grew up here and it had wall to wall carpets in the bedrooms and living room and a couple other rooms.  I’m in the Southern California desert, so sand was always an issue. My Dad, Brother, and I eventually got all the carpet removed and tiled everything.  Removing the carpet fixed my mom’s allergies, and got rid of my SIL’s asthma attacks in the house, highly recommend hard surface flooring for health!

Under the living room carpet I removed two five gallon buckets of sand! The room is pretty big, 12x20, but it was vacuumed weekly and still!  

Now my parents have passed and I inherited the house. I got a price quote to have the grout professionally steam cleaned. I know it’s really dirty as it was originally a cream color, but now it’s closer to coffee. They quoted me $4,700 to clean all the visible space, I think that’s crazy.

I’ve used bleach before to clean it up, but the fumes aren’t a good thing, and doing a whole house that way would be unhealthy, even with all the exhaust fans running. Please don’t lecture me about this option; I’m an industrial chemist, I know about toxicity.

Would dissolved Oxi-clean work to restore all this grout? Has anyone tried this?

Building a company isn't all ""hustle porn"" and TechCrunch headlines. After burning my fingers (okay, my whole hand) building in this crazy startup world, here's what nobody tells you:

**Your head will mess with you**  
\- Some days you feel unstoppable. Others? Like a total fraud  
\- Everyone looks like they know what they're doing. Spoiler: They don't  
\- You'll switch between ""we're gonna be huge"" and ""we're totally screwed"" 5 times before lunch  
\- Pro tip: Get a therapist before you think you need one

**Time is brutal**  
**-** Those ""quick meetings"" and ""casual coffees""? They're killing your company  
\- Stop saying yes to stuff just to be nice  
\- Your calendar is like your diet - garbage in, garbage out  
\- Every hour spent with time-wasters is an hour your competition spends building

**Real talk about people**  
\- News flash: Everyone's replaceable (yep, even you)  
\- Cheap hires are like cheap shoes - you'll pay for it later  
\- ""Culture fit"" isn't just startup buzzword bingo  
\- You know that person you're hesitating to fire? Do it yesterday

**The customer truth**  
\- Your cheapest customers will give you the biggest headaches  
\- They'll argue about $10 and demand million-dollar service  
\- Bad customers are like bad relationships - expensive and exhausting  
\- When someone shows you they're a pain, believe them the first time

**Market stuff nobody admits**  
\- That ""huge market"" you're targeting? Everyone else is too  
\- Just because it's a billion-dollar market doesn't mean you'll see any of those billions  
\- Being too early feels exactly the same as being wrong  
\- Find the people who actually want to pay you (novel concept, right?)  
\- Money talk∙ If nobody's complaining about your prices, they're too low  
\- Revenue is like oxygen - you'll notice it most when you don't have it  
\- Profitable beats popular every time∙ Your pricing strategy shouldn't be ""whatever makes everyone happy""

**The team and advisors reality**  
**-** Want equity? Cool. Show me your check first  
\- Trust takes forever to build and seconds to break  
\- Clear beats clever every time  
\- Alignment isn't about everyone being friends  
\- it's about everyone being honest

**VC truth**  
**-** Most VCs are just well-dressed ghosters  
\- ""Let's keep in touch"" = ""No""  
\- They have their own game to play  
\- Your emergency isn't their emergency  
Bottom Line? Stop trying to make everyone happy. Focus on building something real. Something that lasts.

**Quick hits that cost me**  
\- Your gut feeling is usually right (but verify with data)  
\- Sleep isn't optional

1lsi4ai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsi4ai,"Auberge de L’Ill, Alsace (**)","Today I enjoyed a lunch at the venerable Auberge de L’Ill. The building, in an idyllic location on the banks of the river Ill, has been owned by the Haeberlin family for over 150 years and the restaurant itself has held one Michelin star or more continuously since 1952. The food reflects that - classical and full of flavour.

Your meal begins with an aperitif and a couple of nibbles on the picturesque outdoor terrace before being invited inside. At the end, if you’d like coffee or tea you can sit and relax outdoors again to take in the Alsatian countryside.

Today my dining partner and I opted for the “menu tradition” and between us ate the following:

* Amuse bouches and bread
* Breton lobster with spiced fennel salad
* Salmon soufflé with puff pastry and tomato concasse in a Riesling sauce
* Sea Bass with courgette cream.
* Veal filet mignon with artichoke barigoule
* Pigeon and Foie Gras wrapped in cabbage with black truffle
* Petit Fours
* Chocolate with peanut brittle and peanut sorbet
* Fresh raspberries with crème brûlée, grilled almonds, almond milk foam and raspberry coulis
* Coffee and iced chocolates

Particular highlights for me were the salmon soufflé - very simply presented but wow, the flavour combination is incredible and it pays tribute to traditional Alsatian cooking - and the pigeon dish which was just a testament to the chef’s ability to juggle the powerful flavours of pigeon, foie gras and truffle.

Those two dishes are worth the visit alone, though the supporting cast were absolutely nothing to sniff at either.

Overall the Michelin suggestion that two stars means “worth a detour” is probably right - I took a detour here after travelling from Southern Germany on my way to Strasbourg, but the detour was absolutely worthwhile. The on-site Hotel des Berges is also superb, by the way.",25,1751744166.0,finedining,2,0.96,False
1lsi44v,https://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/1lsi44v/summer_meet_up/,Summer Meet up,"Hi everyone, British guy in Paris (moved here a year ago for work).

I moved here with my wife and our Dog (Labrador Retriever for anyone interested!). From London. 

Honestly found it difficult to find/connect with people, life is so busy for everyone, and it’s been tough juggling everything that comes with moving countries! So I just thought I’d give this a go! 

A bit about me / us - working in Event Production / PR currently, with a past in everything from theatre / film, to music / festivals. Love film, food and travel and of course Dry British humour. Our dog doesn’t work, although the way she acts you’d think shes really hard done-by. 

So, If anyone is interested in meeting for a coffee or drink on the weekend (maybe the 19/20 July). I thought I’d get myself, my wife, and maybe even the dog over to a bar or cafe to meet with anyone who’s up for it! If nothing else, it’s 100% worth meeting our Dog, who is very nice to be around! 

Happy to meet French-only speakers too of course, I speak okay French, but it might be a little slow - I’m learning! 

So I guess leave a comment or feel free to DM, and I’ll gather a group together, maybe build a WhatsApp group or something more convenient. 

Sorry if I’ve broken any rules on this sub!

1lsi41e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lsi41e/find_out_if_the_keurig_kcafe_coffee_maker_truly/,Find Out If the Keurig K-Cafe Coffee Maker Truly Delivers Quality Brews Review,"**Compact Design Makes a Statement**  
The Keurig K-Cafe Single Serve Coffee, Latte, and Cappuccino Maker in Dark Charcoal immediately caught my eye with its sleek and modern design. It fits beautifully on my kitchen counter without taking up much space, which is a bonus for those of us with limited room. At approximately 14 inches in height and 17 inches in width, it feels right at home amidst my other kitchen gadgets. The matte finish adds a touch of sophistication, and surprisingly, despite its sturdy build, it’s not overly heavy, which made unboxing and setup smooth. I didn’t find myself grumbling as I tried to move it around to find its ideal spot. The overall look? Definitely feels premium for a coffee machine intended for daily home use.  

**Convenience at Your Fingertips**  
Once set up, I tested its fully automatic operation mode. The controls are incredibly straightforward. I inserted my favorite K-Cup pod, pressed a single button, and *poof*—freshly brewed coffee in minutes. Not only can it brew regular coffee, but its SHOT button function creates a concentrated espresso-like cup perfect for lattes or cappuccinos. I appreciated the versatility since mornings have become a mix of needing quick plain coffee and an occasional indulgent cappuccino. 

[Check Keurig K-Cafe K-Cafe price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07c1xc3gf/)  

**More Than Just Coffee**  
One of the standout features I couldn’t ignore is the built-in frother. I’ve used it to froth everything from skim to almond milk, and it performs exceptionally well. Cappuccinos with perfectly foamed milk and iced lattes with chilled froth—it covers all the bases. I especially liked its cold frothing setting, which many machines I’ve used lack. No more using old-school frothing tools for iced drinks! Best of all? It’s dishwasher safe. After several uses, cleanup requires little more than popping it into the top rack.  

**Highlights**  
- Simple button controls make it user-friendly.  
- Works with any K-Cup pod for added flexibility.  
- The SHOT button creates concentrated coffee for specialty drinks.  
- 60oz water reservoir means fewer refills between uses.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Lacking custom programmable settings for temperature control.  
- Despite its versatility, it doesn’t quite deliver the richness of a true espresso shot.  
- Some might find the frother smaller than needed for larger servings.  

**Performance Factor: Brewing Beyond Basics**  
There’s a reason why specialty drinks like cappuccinos can feel complicated to replicate at home, but this unit simplifies the process. The Smart Start feature ensures the machine brews immediately after heating up, seamlessly blending convenience with speed. However, I did find the Strong Brew function to be more suitable for enhancing coffee rather than addressing espresso-like robustness. The 12oz cup of coffee tasted bold enough, but if you’re a stickler for powerful espresso-esque flavor, you might notice a difference compared to dedicated espresso machines. For day-to-day use, though, it delivered consistent results without the need to babysit the machine.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this with other coffee machines in the mid-range category, I’ve tried Nespresso’s VertuoLine, which no doubt offers richer espresso shots, but its pods are pricier and lack the compatibility with third-party alternatives. Similarly, the Breville Bambino Plus delivers better milk steaming capabilities; however, it requires manual operation, which can be daunting for beginners. What the K-Cafe really nails is being the middle ground—simple, multifunctional, and reliable. If easy cleanup and an automatic frother are non-negotiables for you, this will likely edge ahead in that decision-making process.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering its all-in-one coffee, latte, and cappuccino brewing capabilities, this machine feels like you’re getting quite a bit for your investment. Many cheaper coffee machines may brew a decent cup of joe but never come close to offering this level of versatility. On the other hand, machines in a slightly higher price bracket will offer refined features but rarely come disk-shaped pod compatible or as user-friendly. The 60oz water reservoir and removable tank save precious minutes during rushed mornings, making it a practical addition.

First time below 200lbs in 10+ years","I started carnivore on April 9th 2024. I am a 29yo male. I knew weightloss was a possibility but it was never my primary reason for starting the diet. I felt like shot 24/7 and had no energy for exercise. I gave it a shot.

Within the first month: all IBS symptoms were gone, all acid reflux/GERD was gone. I had gout due to being a soda and carb addict. This flared for the first week or so, but then it was gone.

More healing came down the road: depression I didn't know I had lifted, brain fog lifted, my energy and sleep improved, all inflammation was gone by month 3, and physical recovery improved.

Like I said, I wasn't doing this for weight loss, but it was an added benefit. I started at 265. And today after a year and 3 months in, I weighed in at 198.  I wish I had the insight to take before pictures but I didn't.

I'm strict carnivore. I eat only Chuck steaks as my red meat. I will usually have eggs, goat cheese and bacon. I also do cow cheese as a steak topping but I'm very careful as I get pretty blocked up from it. I started with cooking everything in Kerrygold butter, then ghee, now I only cook in tallow.

I VERY occasionally drink alcohol. Like a glass of whiskey or two for speciall occasions. My only other 2 vices are caffinee pouches (think Zyns but instead of nicotine, it's caffeine) and the occasional cup of butter coffee.

I joined revero about a month ago to see if they could help fine tune my diet and get me as optimal as they can. This resulted in 3 supplements. 10k IU D3 (nightshift worker that doesn't see sunlight), Omega 3, and Magnesium Glyconate.  I also take a beef organ complex cause I can't stand liver or other organ meats. I'm fine with taking these as blood work does show those levels as low.

I can honestly say, I have no desire to go back to a normal way of eating. Even if the doctors turn out to be right, and this shortens my lifespan, I'd rather live a shorter life feeling how I currently feel, than living to 120 the way I used to feel. ",6,1751743986.0,carnivorediet,2,1.0,False

1lsi1ul,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsi1ul,Banff Trip Report (June 28-July 5),"Sitting on the plane at Calgary sadly getting ready to depart from the most incredible one week stay in Banff national park. Thought I would share our itinerary/highlights/some things we would have done differently ☺️

June 28
- Flew into Calgary (9pm arrival)
- Shuttle to Hotel Clinique 
- Dinner at Tonic Kitchen & Bar in hotel (open until 1am, great for late arrivals)

June 29
- Rented car and headed to Banff!! (parked in train station lot which was free and 10min walk to town)
- Breakfast at Farm & Fire - solid!
- Explored town, rented bear spray from Monod Sports (comes with holster, $45 CAD)
- Cascade Gardens (free but not a must)
- Stroll along Bow River to Bow Falls Viewpoint (quick and great payoff, loved!) 🌟 
- A beer and a bite from Block Kitchen + Bar 
- Drove to Canmore to check into stay at Spring Creek Vacations/freshen up
- Back to Banff for gondola to Sky Bistro for dinner and walk around Sulphur Mountain boardwalk 

**Amazing sweeping views from the top and many grazing big horn sheep. Gondola is expensive/needs to be booked ahead/still a 30min wait. Restaurant was good but not a standout! Overall still worth it. Alternatively you can hike up. 

June 30
- Sunrise tour to Moriane and Lake Louise through ViaVia tours 🌟 🌟 
- Pricey but a highlight. Picked up at our hotel at 3:30, made it to Moraine by 5am, and enjoyed the sunrise with provided blankets and hot drinks. Then shuttled to Louise at 7am and walked the lakeshore trail sans crowds for 1 hour and left at 8:30. We were snug in bed for a mid morning nap by 10am. 
- Lunch at Bridgette Bar, Canmore (excellent!)
- Walk along Policeman’s Trail 🌟 
- Explored Canmore Town and drink/snack at Grizzly Paw Pub
- Evening at Lake Minnewanka 
***Regret not completing Stewart Canyon Trail. I got spooked by a warning of black bear with cubs frequenting area.
- Drive along Minnewanka scenic drive to Two Jack Lake (love this- beautiful at golden hour)🌟 🌟 

July 1/Canada Day 🇨🇦
- Rocky Mountain Bagel Company - highly recommended but busy and meh to us (we’re from NY)
- Grassi Lakes 🌟- lovely 1.5 hour easy/moderate hike with two beautiful turquoise lakes at the top 
- 11am arrival — busy parking lot given the holiday and time, but only took 5min to get a spot. Need a Kananaskis Conservation Pass. 
- Three Sisters Viewpoint 👎 - only a 15min detour but not worth it to me
- Evening SUP at Banff Canoe Club (we went along the creek to the beaver dam - bring bug spray! River may be easier to do with kayak or canoe)
- Dinner at Lupo - no wait and tasty!

July 2
- 9am shuttle from Lake Louise Inn via Fairview Limousine to Lake Louise 
- Hiked to Lake Agnes, Little Beehive, and Big Beehive - loved 🌟 🌟 
- Wanted to go back to Moraine for midday views and possibly Consolation Lakes but partner was too tired 
- Lunch at Banded Peak Basecamp near Park and Ride - surprisingly good! (Had planned on Whitehorn Bistro but didn’t know you needed to take gondola to get there)
- Drove on Bow Valley Parkway leaving Lake Louise instead of the trans Canada highway and spotted a grizzly! 🌟 

July 3
- Breakfast at Chez Francois (good eggs bene and crepe combo!)

- Icefields Parkway Drive 
- Herbert Lake (easily accessible, but less exciting/small)
- Bow Lake — weather took a turn and very gray/raining. Spent some time in the cafe getting tea but only 3 standing tables
- Mistaya Canyons - great stop to stretch legs as it’s a 15min walk to canyon. Just as cool with the bad weather. 
- Athabasca Glacier — spent about 40min here, hiked to toe of glacier.
- Peyto Lake - another 15min walk to the viewpoint. Strikingly blue despite the gray day. Busy viewpoint

- Dinner at the Grizzly House in Banff. About 15min wait with no reservation. Fondue is always fun. 

July 4
- Coffee at Beamer’s 
- Was between Ha Ling and EEOR — decided to try to do the first “easier” half of EEOR to the viewpoint of Whitemans Pond and Ha Ling peak. 
- The path was a lot steeper/gravely than expected and not well marked. Also not many people so I was scared of bears. Decided to turn back.
- Hiked Tunnel Mountain instead. Easy and more populated. Spotted a red fox!🦊 
- Happy hour at Hello Sunshine Sushi in Banff
- Walked around Canmore again 
- Tasting menu at Ankor in Canmore 

July 5
- Early drive to Airport to catch flight 😢 


All in all, an incredible time and we will definitely be taking more trips to the mountains in the future. I wish we had better planned to have visited Emerald Lake, Takakkaw Falls, a Canmore River raft cruise, and e biking. Alas, we were exhausted by the end of the week despite not doing everything!!! Cue the post vacation blues.

I have few Pics in my profile, also feel free to snoop around! I want you to feel like you know me before I know you haha, also I'm good with people in india and outside of india as well!(not in a desperate way but in a ""I'd love to hear more about you"" way)

P. S I'm open to LDR as long as we feel we vibe :)

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. I coded something that I really thought was genius haha(check my post on indianfinancialmarkets if you want to see it!) . finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch(please suggest me some movies!)

I feel like I have to address a few red flags because of the people who have reached out to me until now, Whereas I met a lot of wonderful people, I also met a few of the people that are making me add these **red flags**.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official. (after repeatedly telling me that they like me..? I want someone to be like the same way I'm being with them.)

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

\-Third thing, the pics I keep in my profile are my average one's I keep the really good one's in my phone because while I believe that looks matter, one should check for emotional compatibility as well. Hence the reason why I keep average photos for my profile and keep the really good one's in my phone.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up? 

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you. 

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!) 

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

Do you know you can't feel your tongue while smiling, haha got you! there you gooo ....smile a bit and have a nice day :)",1,1751743912.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1lsi0oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_konstantly_here/comments/1lsi0oq/the_stuff_no_one_warns_you_about_when_building_a/,the stuff no one warns you about when building a company,"Let's get real. Building a company isn't all ""hustle porn"" and TechCrunch headlines. After burning my fingers (okay, my whole hand) building in this crazy startup world, here's what nobody tells you:   
  
**Your head will mess with you**  
\- Some days you feel unstoppable. Others? Like a total fraud  
\- Everyone looks like they know what they're doing. Spoiler: They don't  
\- You'll switch between ""we're gonna be huge"" and ""we're totally screwed"" 5 times before lunch  
\- Pro tip: Get a therapist before you think you need one  
  
**Time is brutal**  
**-** Those ""quick meetings"" and ""casual coffees""? They're killing your company  
\- Stop saying yes to stuff just to be nice  
\- Your calendar is like your diet - garbage in, garbage out  
\- Every hour spent with time-wasters is an hour your competition spends building  
  
**Real talk about people**  
\- News flash: Everyone's replaceable (yep, even you)  
\- Cheap hires are like cheap shoes - you'll pay for it later   
\- ""Culture fit"" isn't just startup buzzword bingo  
\- You know that person you're hesitating to fire? Do it yesterday  
  
**The customer truth**  
\- Your cheapest customers will give you the biggest headaches  
\- They'll argue about $10 and demand million-dollar service  
\- Bad customers are like bad relationships - expensive and exhausting  
\- When someone shows you they're a pain, believe them the first time   
  
**Market stuff nobody admits**  
\- That ""huge market"" you're targeting? Everyone else is too  
\- Just because it's a billion-dollar market doesn't mean you'll see any of those billions  
\- Being too early feels exactly the same as being wrong  
\- Find the people who actually want to pay you (novel concept, right?)  
\- Money talk∙ If nobody's complaining about your prices, they're too low  
\- Revenue is like oxygen - you'll notice it most when you don't have it  
\- Profitable beats popular every time∙ Your pricing strategy shouldn't be ""whatever makes everyone happy""  
  
**The team and advisors reality**  
**-** Want equity? Cool. Show me your check first  
\- Trust takes forever to build and seconds to break  
\- Clear beats clever every time  
\- Alignment isn't about everyone being friends   
\- it's about everyone being honest  
  
**VC truth**  
**-** Most VCs are just well-dressed ghosters  
\- ""Let's keep in touch"" = ""No""  
\- They have their own game to play  
\- Your emergency isn't their emergency  
Bottom Line? Stop trying to make everyone happy. Focus on building something real. Something that lasts.  
  
**Quick hits that cost me**   
\- Your gut feeling is usually right (but verify with data)  
\- Sleep isn't optional  
\-  Numbers don't lie, but they do hide  
\- The best pitch deck can't save a broken business",1,1751743888.0,u_konstantly_here,0,1.0,False
1lsi0h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1lsi0h4/need_critiqueadvice_on_my_current_supplement_stack/,Need critique/advice on my current supplement stack.,"Hey everyone, I recently added NAC and few other items on top of my current supplementation stack (details below)

In a few days, this is what I plant to take at different parts of the day. I am somewhat concerned about the interactions making some supplements ineffective.

Upon Waking Up (Empty Stomach, In order):

* NAC ~500mg [New Addition] (And wait 10 Minutes after)
* L-Tyrosine [New Addition] (600mg)
* Huperzine-A [New Addition] (50 Micrograms, starting low and slow)
* L-Theanine [New Addition] (100-200mg)

I am concerned about NAC and L-Tyrosine negating each others affect.

After approx 90Minutes, I have breakfast:

* 4-5 Whole eggs for Choline
* Omega 3 (also contains some Astaxanthin)
* Omega 7
* Vit. D3 + K2 (2000-3000IE/day)
* Zinc Bisglycinate (25mg)
* Ashwagandha KSM-66 (300mg)
* Vitamin C Powder(200mg)


4-5 hours later, I head to the gym for an intense session (Usually only hypertrophy work , Kickboxing 1x a week, HIIT 1x a week (usually on rest days[I just dont lift weights on rest days]))

30 Minutes prior heading to the gym, I consume:
* 5 grams of creatine
* Fast Carbs
* Strong cup of coffee

Post workout:

* Whey + 10g Collagen Powder (I dont take Vit. C along with it to not blunt the bodys adaptation after the heavy workout)

And approx an hour pre sleep I will take:
* Magnesium Bisglycinate


I work and study a lot of hours a week (Average around 70 and need to be locked in constantly to achieve my goals. I sleep on average 7,5 hours a day and exercise almost every day. 24M)
Any critique would be greatly appreciated, I am mostly concerned about taking both NAC and L-Tyrosine on an empty stomach!

1lsi06c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/1lsi06c/how_i_set_up_a_docker_pihole_connected_to_stubby/,How I set up a Docker Pihole connected to Stubby [Windows Only],"This took me like \~8 hours to figure out so no problem for the time saved.

First off you want to install wsl by going to admin powershell and typing ""wsl --install"" (Will only work if you're on win 10 or 11), don't worry about anything linux for now, all you need is just the framework. (If you have difficulties installing please refer to: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) )

After you install wsl (and finish questioning why nobody told you that you could merge windows and linux) you will want to install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) and make sure its on the wsl2 framework.

After you do that, create a directory for the pihole and make a file named ""docker-compose.yml"" inside of it, next go to [https://docs.pi-hole.net/docker/](https://docs.pi-hole.net/docker/) and paste that into your file, uncomment the 67:67/tcp and MAKE SURE TO SET A PASSWORD (you CAN'T use ""Admin"") and have NET\_ADMIN in your cap\_add,

Next you will install the latest version of stubby from: [https://dnsprivacy.org/dns\_privacy\_daemon\_-\_stubby/installation/windows\_installer\_for\_stubby/](https://dnsprivacy.org/dns_privacy_daemon_-_stubby/installation/windows_installer_for_stubby/) make it an autorun, select your desired upstream servers by uncommenting them (don't use the gui), and next A VERY IMPORTANT STEP - under the listen address's add ""- 127.0.0.1@5353"" (with the proper spacing of course) otherwise you will not be able to resolve the dnsmasq error.

After that you will launch pihole by navigating to it's directory in powershell and running ""docker compose up -d"", if you get any port usage errors, check whats causing them with netstat. If everything booted up good, go back to powershell (in the same dir) and shut pihole down with ""docker compose down"", go to the etc-pihole folder it made and start editing the pihole.toml file, you will need to find ""dnsmasq\_lines"" and enter \[""server=127.0.0.1#5353"", ""except-interface=nonexisting""\] inbetween the brackets.

You're almost done now, now press win+r, type ncpa.cpl and go into ipv4 properties on your wifi/ethernet. Assign yourself a static ip address (use ipconfig to find your subnet mask and default gateway).

Now your IP is a DNS server that anyone on your internet can use, have fun and I'm gonna go drink some coffee.",2,1751743849.0,pihole,0,1.0,False
1lshzxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TarotReadersOfReddit/comments/1lshzxz/psychic_dad_saturdays_readings_vibes_and_probably/,"Psychic Dad Saturdays: Readings, Vibes, and Probably Capri Sun","It’s giving heatwave. It’s giving Lisa Frank mood swing. It’s giving “your aura just asked me for SPF 50 and a boundary.”

Welcome to **Psychic Dad Summer**, where the tarot is hot, the vibes are questionable, and your spiritual guidance is being delivered by a man in vintage Reeboks who once had frosted tips on purpose.

# 💿✨ TODAY’S DEALS – DISCOUNTED & DEEPLY UNHINGED (IN A HEALING WAY)

🃏 **3 Card Spread – $1**0 *(reg $15*)  
*A fast, spicy lil read when you don’t have time for a full meltdown.*  
Great for:

* “Should I text them?”
* “Is this a red flag or am I just bored?”
* “What fresh chaos is this energy giving?” Think of it like spiritual lip gloss—quick, glossy, and slightly flammable.

🌀 **30 Minute Reading – $2**5 *(reg $40*)  
*A deep-dive but still casual, like crying in a Target parking lot but with answers.*  
Perfect for when you want:

* Love tea
* Career insight
* General “please explain my entire life, but gently” We'll pull cards, talk truths, and probably drag your ex just a little.

⏳ **60 Minute Reading – $40** *(reg $60)*  
*The Big One™. Full spread, full spiral, full clarity.*  
This is the reading for:

* Transformation moments
* Emotional crossroads
* That feeling when you’re crying into cold coffee asking the Universe for a sign and it gives you 11 angel numbers and a headache I’ll map it out. You’ll breathe again. We’ll both survive.

🧠 **Spiritual Counseling – $4**5 *(reg $65*)  
*Basically if tarot and emotional support had a baby and raised it on Mariah Carey ballads.*  
This is deep. It’s real. We’ll talk trauma, healing, shadow work, and how your guides are tired of you pretending you’re fine.

1lshxgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lshxgp/aitah_for_saying_that_we_cant_play_hide_and_seek/,AITAH for saying that we can't play hide and seek in my small apartment?,"(Sorry in advance if I spelt something wrong, english is not my first language.)
So, today me (18F) and my friend (18F, let's call her Maya) decited to hang out at my apartment. We were supposed to just hang out, play board games and chat about life. We first started with playing board games, then I made us a cup of coffee and we ate cookies. (Everything was still fine at this point) Then she asked if we could play hide and seek. I said ""My appartment is pretty small, i have no hiding places. I barely have even furniture."" 

Some things you might wanna know: My apartment is 59 m², I have no clue how big that is in sq ft. My only furinture is: two shelves, a bed (you can't fit under it), a couch (you can't fit under it either) A small dining table, it fit's max four people. Four chairs, a washing machine and a small desk/table that is for work and has a bunch of work stuff on and under it. Maya has autism and adhd. She has violent outburst's sometimes (this was the first time I've seen one myself) Her mom comes and checks up on her/comes to talk to her by coming to where she lives 3-4 times a week.

""Have you even tried? I think not"" Maya answers.

I say ""Yeah, I acctually have with one of my other friends and it didn't work.""

""Can't we even try?"" She asks.

I heasitate, but cave in ""Okay we can try, but I don't think this is going to work""

She starts counting. She counts to 20 but I still haven't found a good place to hide, so i panic and jump in my bed and under the covers. She sees me instantly. ""I saw you jump under!"" Maya yells across my small apartment.

""I knew this wasn't going to work"" I say as she's walking to where my bed is.

""You didn't even try!"" 

""Yes, I did. There is just no hiding places here"" I say.

""Well you need to use your imagination! You need to be creative!""  She says almost yelling now.

""You know I'm not that creative. Especially not these kind of things. Can you tell me at least one hiding spot, please"" I tell her. 

""You just need to be creative!"" She yells slightly angily.

I grew up with only one friend, and I never, not once got in a argument/fight with him so I don't know how to handel this. So I just walk away and take a cookie. She sits down on my floor beside my bed. We are silent for maybe 3-ish minutes, then her mom calls her (I guess her mom was supposed to come to her today, and she was already at her apartment door waiting) Maya ask's her mom if she can come to my apartment because we got in an argument. Now I'm like ""What is she doing?"" Maybe 2 minutes go by, I hear my doorbell ring, I open my door. She comes in and taked her shoes off and goes to where Maya is sitting. She ask's Maya what happened. Maya tell's her that we got into a argument. Fast forwards a bit, now Maya is angry at her mom and starts yelling. I get slightly scared and my hads started to tremble a bit because I don't like people yelling. So I try to distract myself from the yelling by taking dominoes (the game) and build them. I don't think her mom saw that I was scared. Maya kept yelling at her mom. She finally calmed Maya down and asked her if she just wanted to go home, she say's yes and they go home. Even 15 minutes later my hands were still tremeling a bit.

I haven't heard from her or her mom since. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for saying we can't play hide and seek in my small apartment? Be honest.",1,1751743645.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1lshx4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lshx4s/christmas_from_hell_by_r_l_mathewson/,Christmas from Hell  by R. L. Mathewson:,"Chapter 1  
  
  November 26, 2015  
  
  Thanksgiving Day  
  
  “I fucking loved you, you fucking bitch!” the man wielding the carving knife screeched, making Duncan’s headache a hell of a lot worse and making him wish that he hadn’t volunteered to work today of all days, but he’d needed a break from his family and the walking disaster that lived next door.  
  
  “Sir,” he said tightly, shifting to the side to come between the incredibly pissed off man in front of him and the naked couple cowering on the bed behind him.  
  
  Not that he could really blame him, Duncan absently thought as he shifted to the left, wondering when the police were going to finally show up so that they could take over and he could put an end to this fucked up day from hell.  
  
  “How could you do this to me?” the man wielding the large knife shouted, sounding more hysterical with every passing second, which Duncan knew from experience was not a good thing.  
  
  “Son, now calm down,” the elderly man trembling on the bed behind him said, temporarily distracting Duncan as his words registered.  
  
  There was no fucking way that-  
  
  “Don’t tell me to calm down, Dad! You fucked my fiancé!”  
  
  Okay, perhaps there was a chance that this could get more awkward, he realized as the understandably pissed off man lunged to the left, desperate to get his hands on his father or the bitch that had cheated on him. Duncan wasn’t sure which one this guy was more pissed at, but it didn’t matter. It was Duncan’s job to stop him before he did something stupid that he’d regret later.  
  
  Praying that this didn’t end with him landing in the Emergency Room tonight getting stiches, or worse, Duncan grabbed the man by his arm, twisted it and forced him to drop to his knees while he applied just enough pressure to make the man drop the knife.  
  
  “Ow! Get the hell off me!”  
  
  “What the hell is wrong with you? Get your hands off my son!” the elderly man snapped, reminding him just how stupid people could be.  
  
  “Get back, sir,” he said calmly as he kicked the knife to the opposite side of the room and forced the hysterically sobbing man to the ground.  
  
  “Get your fucking hands off my son!” the elderly man said, coming over to pull him off his son, but Duncan had had more than enough bullshit to last him a lifetime tonight.  
  
  “Back the fuck up, sir!” he snapped at the asshole, truly not caring if this ended with a write-up or a fucking suspension, because he refused to add wrestling with a naked old man to the ground to his day.  
  
  Today he’d had more than enough bullshit to last him several lifetimes.  
  
  “You can’t talk to me like that!” the old man said in outrage while the other moron tried to get out of his hold, most likely to throttle his father, which once again, Duncan really couldn’t blame him for.  
  
  “I just did, sir. Now step back and put some clothes on,” he said, turning his attention to the woman pouting on the bed, “you too.”  
  
  “You can’t-”  
  
  “Now!” he snapped when the asshole opened his mouth to argue with him, startling the old man enough to get him to shut the hell up and do as he was told.  
  
  Duncan just needed to keep this situation calm and then he could-  
  
  “What is going on in here?” an elderly woman demanded from the doorway.  
  
  He opened his mouth to yell for his partner when everything went to hell.  
  
  “Jane, I can explain,” the elderly dumbass said, yanking up his pants just as the woman on the bed said, “We’re having a baby!”  
  
  And just like that, his night got a hundred times worse.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “Is there a reason why you’re standing there, staring out the window and watching the neighbors? Are we preparing to kill them and drag them down to the basement and bury them alive?” Grandpa asked, making her smile despite the butterflies going wild in her stomach as she searched for his truck.  
  
  “No,” she said, rolling her eyes as she turned around to find her grandfather perusing the sweets that she’d worked all day making. “You know that you’re not allowed anything sweet.”  
  
  “It’s Thanksgiving,” he murmured with a dreamy little sigh as he stared down at the orange and yellow cupcakes that she’d just finished frosting.  
  
  “So?” she said, deciding that this was probably a good time to place the covers on the food and set them carefully in the cart.  
  
  “So, it means that I can indulge a little bit,” he said with a slight pout that had her rolling her eyes, because he should really have known better than to try to bullshit her by now.  
  
  “No,” she said, standing on her tiptoes so that she could kiss his whiskered cheek, “it really doesn’t.”  
  
  “Well, it should,” he said, heavily as he gave the platters of cupcakes, brownies and cookies one last glance of longing and reached for the bowl of fruit that she kept well stocked for him.  
  
  “Tell that to your doctor,” she said with a wink as she grabbed a tray of extra large double chocolate chunk cookies and placed them on the cart’s bottom shelf.  
  
  His eyes narrowed dangerously. “I thought we’d agreed that you weren’t going to call my doctor anymore.”  
  
  “I crossed my fingers,” she admitted with a shrug as she grabbed a tray of double chocolate brownies with fudge frosting and placed it on the next shelf.  
  
  Somehow he managed to narrow his eyes even further. “You’re fired,” he said tightly, making her roll her eyes, because really, that was just never going to happen.  
  
  “Uh huh,” she murmured absently as she glanced around the kitchen, wondering where that last tray of cupcakes had disappeared to when she realized that her grandfather was leaning back against the pantry doors, trying to avoid making eye contact with her.  
  
  “Really?” she asked with a sad shake of her head.  
  
  “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said, managing to keep a straight face.  
  
  “I don’t have time for this,” she said, shaking her head in annoyance as she walked over, grabbed his arm and gave it a gentle pull, which did absolutely nothing since he outweighed her by at least fifty pounds.  
  
  Closing her eyes in defeat, she said, “Move or I’m calling your doctor right now and telling him that you’re trying to eat junk food again.”  
  
  “You’re bluffing.”  
  
  She opened her eyes and met her grandfather’s hard grey eyes head on, grey eyes that had been known to make grown men cry, and matched it with a glare of her own. She was the only one, besides her grandmother that is, whom he couldn’t intimidate.  
  
  He’d tried.  
  
  God, how he’d tried, but since she was a baby she’d always managed to give it right back to him without hesitation, which was probably why she’d always had a special place in his heart. Well, normally she did, but not right now since she was coming between him and sweets.  
  
  “Am I?” she asked, cocking a brow in challenge, because they both knew that she wouldn’t hesitate calling his doctor and telling on him if he kept pushing her.  
  
  A little muscle in his jaw began to tick, which really wasn’t a good sign. But, then again she wasn’t afraid of him like everyone else was. Granted, most people had a good reason to be afraid of her grandfather. Even though he was in his sixties, you wouldn’t know it by looking at him. He was still physically fit, six-two, two hundred pounds of muscle, and a retired Marine Drill Sergeant. He had very little patience for stupidity and never gave anyone a second chance. If you crossed him or someone he loved, Heaven help you, because no one else would.  
  
  He was also about three-dozen cookies away from becoming a diabetic or having another heart attack.  
  
  That muscle in his jaw jumped double time as he glared down at her. “I’m fine,” he finally growled.  
  
  Well, snarled really, obviously making one last attempt to get her to walk away and leave him in peace so that he could indulge his sweet tooth.  
  
  “Then those two heart attacks meant what exactly?” she asked, standing her ground.  
  
  “They were nothing,” he said tightly, clearly on the verge of giving up.  
  
  “Uh huh,” she said, gesturing for him to move aside so that she could grab the last tray.  
  
  “I knew it was a mistake to teach you how to talk,” he said with one last glare as he walked over to the fruit bowl, grabbed an apple and took a large, unsatisfying bite. />  
  “I love you, too, Grandpa,” she said with a chuckle as she opened the pantry door and-  
  
  Sighed heavily with disappointment.  
  
  “Really?” she asked, shaking her head in disbelief as she stared at her grandfather’s stash.  
  
  “I don’t know how those got in there,” he said in a monotone voice as he took another bite of his apple.  
  
  “Yeah, I’m sure you have no idea how two dozen donuts from our bakery ended up in the pantry,” she said, chuckling because there was just something so endearing about a man like him trying to talk his way out of trouble.  
  
  “I really don’t.”  
  
  “I’m sure that you don’t,” she said, chuckling as she loaded the final tray onto the cart. Standing up, she sighed with relief. “It’s ready,” she said, gesturing to the cart in question with a sweep of her arms, relieved that it was finally done so that she could call it a night.  
  
  Mid-bite, her grandfather paused and stared at her blankly. “Why are you telling me?”  
  
  “Because you’re supposed to take it next door,” she reminded him as she reached back and undid her apron.  
  
  “No, I’m not,” he said, looking mildly confused.  
  
  “Yes, you are,” she said, in absolutely no mood to play this game with him, because they both knew that she would never willingly go next door.  
  
  “I don’t remember discussing this.”  
  
  Her eyes narrowed suspiciously as she considered her grandfather. “You asked me to do this as a favor for Danny and Jodi. You said that you would bring the food next-door when it was done.”  
  
  He shrugged, as he shifted his focus back to the apple in his hand and admitted, “I lied.”  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “Did you really tell a sixty-five year old woman to, and I’m quoting here, ‘Shut the fuck up?’” his captain asked as he looked up from the incident report in his hands to shoot Duncan a questioning glance.  
  
  “No, sir,” he said as he shifted on the stretcher, trying to get comfortable, which he already knew from experience was impossible. “I told her husband to shut the fuck up, sir.”  
  
  “I see,” the captain said, glancing back down at the incident report, but not before Duncan saw his lips twitch with amusement. Well, he was pretty sure that his lips twitched, but then again he probably wasn’t the best person to ask at the moment, not with blood still running down his face, making if difficult to see anything out of his left eye.  
  
  “Let’s move on to the next complaint,” the captain said, looking down the long list of complaints that he’d received regarding Duncan’s last call.  
  
  “Let’s,” Duncan said, giving up on trying to get more comfortable and pressed the icepack back against his forehead, earning a glare from his boss.  
  
  “Duncan,” the captain said in a hard tone as he looked up from the incident report to shoot Duncan a warning glare.  
  
  “Timothy,” Duncan shot back in the same hard tone, laughing when his best friend shook his head good-naturedly with a chuckle and returned his attention back to the list of bullshit in his hands.  
  
  “It was a fucked up call,” Duncan pointed out, closing his eyes as he willed his headache to go away, but that probably wasn’t going to happen anytime soon thanks to the lovely concussion that he’d received when he was forced to release the angry son and drag the guy’s mother off the little home wrecker, who’d announced that she was not only pregnant, but that she’d fucked every guy in their family.  
  
  That hadn’t gone over well.  
  
  At least not for him since for whatever reason the whole family had turned on him at that point and had decided that he was somehow to blame for this bullshit. They’d ganged up on him, hitting him with whatever they could get their hands on and when Duncan’s partner came in with the police, they’d decided to double their efforts before their punching bag was taken away from them.  
  
  The thing that had pissed him off the most was that even though he’d been getting his ass kicked, he hadn’t been able to make himself take a swing, terrified that he’d hit one of the women. So, he’d done his best on restraining the men, which again had only made them madder.  
  
  It had taken ten cops, five firemen, and three EMTs to pull them off him. It had definitely been a Thanksgiving for the books, he thought with a pathetic groan as sharp pain shot through his head.  
  
  “You know that I have to investigate their claims, right?” Timothy asked, not sounding particularly happy about it, but right now Duncan could honestly say that he didn’t give a flying fuck. His head was killing him, every fucking muscle in his body was screaming in pain, he was starving, had missed having Thanksgiving dinner with his family and now he had to get his fucking head stitched up thanks to the old woman who’d decided to slam an old baseball trophy into his head.  
  
  “Do what you have to do,” Duncan said, trying to breathe through the pain, but it was fucking difficult when every noise made his head feel like it was about to explode. The bright lights overhead weren’t helping either. All he wanted to do was get his head stitched up, go home and lock himself in his room for the next week.  
  
  “I’m going to have to put you on paid suspension for a month while we investigate,” Timothy said, adding a special note to his day.  
  
  “Not fucking happening,” Duncan said, refusing to take the hit to his personnel file and screw up any chances at promotions or raises in the future.  
  
  “It will disappear as soon as the month is over,” Timothy reassured him.  
  
  “They attacked me,” he reminded his boss and best friend.  
  
  “And they’ve all been arrested and charged with Federal assault on a Firefighter,” he said, sounding pissed and for good reason.  
  
  They risked their fucking lives for people, worked insane hours, survived on very little sleep and this was how some fucking people thanked them. Some days he felt like saying fuck it and going to work for his Uncle and then there were other days when he loved his job and couldn’t imagine doing anything else.  
  
  Today just wasn’t one of those days.  
  
  “Mr. Bradford, I see that you’re going to need a few stiches,” a very unhappy, uptight woman said as she pushed open the privacy curtain and entered the examination room.  
  
  “We want his ribs looked at as well,” Timothy said, using that hard tone of his that had helped him to rise so quickly through the ranks to Captain.  
  
  “I don’t see any reason to do that,” the Doctor said dismissively, obviously annoyed about the fact that she had to work on Thanksgiving Day.  
  
  “Well, I do,” Timothy said firmly, looking seriously pissed off as he glared at the Doctor.  
  
  “I do as well,” the familiar voice said, sounding just as pissed as Timothy as he strolled into the room and took the chart away from the woman that looked like she hadn’t been laid since the eighties just as Duncan finally gave in and closed his eyes.  
  
  “Hey, Dad,” Duncan said, keeping his eyes closed as he tried to focus on his breathing and not on the pain shooting through his entire body.  
  
  “I’ll be taking over here, Doctor,” his father said in a tone that let Duncan know that his father had already dismissed the Doctor without a second glance.  
  
  Duncan heard the sounds of hard heels clicking angrily away as he laid there, praying that his father gave him something to knock him the fuck out, but that would mean spending the night in the hospital and he didn’t want that. He wanted to go home, climb in his bed and get some fucking sleep for once.  
  
  “You’re late for dinner,” his father absently said, making him chuckle until the pain in his head had him turning over and vomiting on the floor.  
  
  “Sorry, Dad,” he managed to get out as he rolled over onto his back and promptly passed out.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “We are no longer speaking, sir!” Necie yelled over her shoulder at the man standing there, sipping a cup of coffee and looking quite pleased with himself.  
  
  “That’s fine,” Grandpa said with a wink as he took another sip of his coffee.  
  
  She glowered at him for another few seconds, contemplating switching his coffee to decaf, but just as quickly she decided against it. As much as she would love to get him back for this, she really didn’t want to deal with him without his caffeine. So instead, she returned her attention to all the cars parked in the driveway next-door as well as the ones lined up and down the street, terrified that she’d see his truck even as excitement coursed through her, making her rethink this whole thing.  
  
  She didn’t want to see him, talk to him or see that look in his eye as he was forced to acknowledge her existence in some way when it was clear that all he wanted to do was to pretend that she didn’t exist. Not that she could blame him since every single one of their unfortunate encounters always left him…cranky.  
  
  Cranky was probably the most fitting word to describe the state that he was usually left in after one of their encounters.  
  
  Mostly because he couldn’t stand her.  
  
  Not that he’d ever flat out told her that he hated her. He was much too polite to say it, but then again with the way he looked at her and reacted every time that she was around, it wasn’t all that difficult to figure out.  
  
  Which was why she really didn’t want to be out here, standing in the cold, hoping to catch a glimpse of him when she knew that she should get this cart next-door as fast as humanly possible and make a quick retreat before she could make things between them any worse. Not that, that was humanly possible, she reminded herself with a pathetic little groan that had her moving her butt and pushing the cart the rest of the way across her freshly shoveled driveway, careful of the black ice threatening to knock her on her ass.  
  
  When she made it to the other side of their driveway, she sighed in relief, because she was halfway there and she hadn’t-  
  
  “No!” she shouted when the front wheel of her cart suddenly caught on a patch of black ice, slid forward a little faster than she’d expected and took off before she could stop it.  
  
  Without thinking, she ran after it and-  
  
  Slipped on the same patch of black ice that had stolen her cart from her and fell on her ass, making her gasp in pain. Grimacing, she forced herself back to her feet and ran after the cart. As she slipped, stumbled and tripped her way down the long drive  
way, watching the large metal cart barely miss car after car, she cursed her grandfather for his manipulative ways and prayed that the cart landed safely in a snow bank.  
  
  But, of course that’s not the way it happened, mostly because she was a walking disaster. She watched in horror as the cart raced down the end of the driveway and-  
  
  “Mother fucker!” she heard the painfully familiar voice shout just as her foot caught on another patch of black ice and sent her stumbling forward. She tried to regain her footing, but it was too late. Before she could stop herself, and she really wished that she’d been able to stop herself, the pavement was rushing forward and-  
  
  Oh, God, that really hurt, was her first coherent thought after she hit the ground, slid down the icy pavement for what seemed like hours, scraping her hands, arms, legs, stomach and somehow managing to whack her chin before she was finally able to come to a stop. Unfortunately for her, the stop probably did more damage than her lovely trip down the driveway had.  
  
  “Ouch,” she whispered weakly as she managed to roll over away from the back tire of what appeared to be a really large pickup truck.  
  
  When the snow chains stopped her escape attempt, she closed her eyes, winced, whimpered and gasped in pain even as she had to admit that it would probably be a good idea to get snow chains put on the delivery van, especially with all this snow that they’d been getting.  
  
  It would certainly make it easier to take delivery orders when the weather turned sour, she absently agreed as she tried to roll away from the back of the truck, realized that her sweatshirt, part of her bra and possibly some of her boob was being pinched and held hostage by the snow chains. She tried to move away from the wheel again, this time more slowly and, yup, the chain definitely had some of her boob pinched beneath it, making it impossible to go anywhere.  
  
  Slowly exhaling, mostly because she was trying not to move and find out just how much it hurt to have part of her boob ripped off, she laid there, shivering as she contemplated her options. Reach into her back pocket and grab her phone and call for help? A slight wiggle of her ass let her know that probably wasn’t going to happen since she couldn’t feel the comforting weight of her cellphone in her pocket.  
  
  So, calling for help was definitely out.  
  
  She could yell for help from her grandfather, but that would result in him laughing his ass off at her as he took pictures of her on his phone since she’d foolishly taught him how to do that last month, or worse, he’d go break out the old camcorder and make a video to upload to Youtube, again, something else that she’d regretted showing him. There was also the possibility that he would fall and hurt himself, but she immediately dismissed that idea since it didn’t seem as though she’d inherited her klutz gene from him.

  She really rather not make another appearance on YouTube, so that left her with little choice but to lie there and freeze to death. It wasn’t an easy decision to make, but really? What choice did she have?  
  
  The long, heavy, seriously annoyed sigh that she was unfortunately all too familiar with, let her know that she not only didn’t have a choice in the matter, but she’d just given the man that she was in love with another reason to hate her.

  Happy fucking Thanksgiving to him, he thought as he tilted his head back and stared up at the cloudy black sky, wondering what the fuck he did to deserve this.  
  
  Seriously, he couldn’t figure it out. He wasn’t a bad person, he paid his taxes on time, voted, was always willing to help out someone who needed his help and so far, he was the only Bradford in the history of their family not to get personally banned from a restaurant. He didn’t count Lucifer’s restaurant, Fire & Brimstone simply because his brother was an asshole, but still…  
  
  What had he done to deserve having this annoying pain in the ass in his life?  
  
  Don’t get him wrong. He wasn’t perfect. He’d fucked up in his life, broken a few hearts, had a few selfish moments in his life, but he could honestly say that he’d never done anything to deserve having this nightmare of a woman living next-door to him.  
  
  The sad thing about it was that she wasn’t even making his life a living hell on purpose. Not once in the last year, and God, had he really survived a year living next to the little disaster? had he ever felt that any of the really fucked up things that happened to him because of her had been done on purpose. It would probably make his life so much easier if she was fucking him over because she was a bitch, but sadly she was just pathetic.

However, like most regulated trading platforms, Zentrixol restricts access in certain countries due to legal or regulatory reasons. If you’re outside the supported list, you might run into issues signing up or funding your account.

It’s always a good idea to check the platform’s official website or customer support for the latest on country availability before getting too invested in the sign-up process.

## Zentrixol – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of Zentrixol’s standout features is its **real-time market analysis**. This means you get up-to-the-second updates on price movements, volume changes, and market trends. The platform offers charts, technical indicators, and predictive analytics that help you spot opportunities or risks quickly.

For traders, having this kind of instant data can make the difference between catching a good trade and missing out. The interface presents this without overwhelming the user, striking a nice balance between depth and clarity.

The platform avoids jargon-heavy language and presents complex data in digestible chunks so you can focus on making informed decisions rather than figuring out how to use the tool.

This is a handy tool for traders who can’t stare at charts all day but still want to stay informed and ready to act.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Zentrixol doesn’t limit you to just cryptocurrencies. You can trade across a variety of assets including:

- Forex currency pairs

This variety allows users to diversify their trading strategies within a single platform, which is a real bonus for those who like to spread risk or explore different markets.

## Is Zentrixol a Scam?

Straight up — **Zentrixol is not a scam**. It operates like many legitimate trading platforms with SSL encryption and claims to follow regulatory compliance depending on the user’s region. User reviews generally indicate a positive experience with withdrawals and customer service.

That said, no platform is perfect. Some users note the minimum deposit is a bit high, and there’s limited transparency about the company’s origins. But these are common issues across many trading apps. Just remember, trading always carries risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Zentrixol?

To start trading on Zentrixol, you need to make a minimum deposit of **$250**. This is pretty standard among similar platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, balancing accessibility with enough capital to engage in meaningful trades.

If you’re new to trading, this amount might feel a bit high, but it also discourages very small, potentially unprofitable trades. Just make sure you’re comfortable with the amount before committing.

### Zentrixol Customer Support

Customer support on Zentrixol is available 24/7 via:

- Live chat
- Email
- Phone support

I tested their live chat during off-hours, and the response was quick and helpful. Having reliable support is crucial in trading, especially if you run into technical issues or have questions about your account. Zentrixol scores well here compared to some competitors who only offer email support.

## How do you start trading on Zentrixol?

Getting started is pretty straightforward, even if you’re a complete trading newbie.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the Zentrixol website, fill out the registration form with your basic info (name, email, phone), and create a password. You’ll get a confirmation email to activate your account.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Next, you’ll need to verify your identity by uploading some documents (passport, driver’s license) to comply with regulations. After verification, deposit the minimum $250 via supported payment methods like credit card, bank transfer, or e-wallets.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you’re ready to explore the platform. Use the real-time tools to analyze markets, set your alerts, and place your first trades. Zentrixol also offers demo modes on some accounts if you want to practice first.

## How to Delete a Zentrixol Account?

If you decide Zentrixol isn’t for you, deleting your account is straightforward:

1. Contact customer support via live chat or email.
2. Request account deletion explicitly.

1lshtqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lshtqi/am_igetting_tired_of_mil/,Am I…Getting tired of MIL,"Just for some backstory, my wife and I have been together for 3 years and married for a couple of months as of making this post (we also have a newborn). We decided to get a home with the help of her uncle, at first I was hesitant of having her mother move in with us because of the fact we got the home to help her (MiL). The last home her (MiL) lived in she decided to harbor cats bc she claims to love animals and all that stuff. Unfortunately she allowed the previous home to get destroyed from the cats (never cleaned their litter boxes, never got them fixed) so you can tell there was a lot of damage and neglect. Poo all over the floor and urine smell even by just walking near the home. 

So we decided to get the home and have her move in so she can start a new life and not have to deal with all that. I spoke to her about her situation and how she needs to get therapy for it since it’s an issue family cannot fix. She agreed but never followed thru, fast forward 4 months and we find out my wife is pregnant. 

Her MiL decided to harbor kittens in her room, never got the fixed or vaccinated. Her bedroom started to smell like cat urine and poop. Just like her previous home, and at first I kept my peace by not intervening bc my wife said she would handle her mother. Well she would talk to her and let her know but her mother never kept up with her word. 

Back in Feb ‘25 I sat down and had broke my silence and addressed the issue. I mention to her that if she was an animal lover as she claimed to be she wouldn’t allow those cats to live like this. She doesn’t bother cleaning their litter boxes. (It takes 5 minutes to scoop the litter and toss out the bag of poop and urine.) right? I have my own two cats and I do this every night after I get home from work. 

She has openly expressed that she is lazy, and it’s been an emotional roller coaster with my wife and I bc if I say anything to (MiL) she goes behind my back and starts an argument with my wife. At this point I feel disrespected. I also mention that she had a grandchild on the way and this is no way for my child to live in a home that I’m embarrassed to have company over. She said she would clean her room.

She did ok for a few weeks and has gone back to the same old routine of being lazy. Since all this (MiL) sleeps on our couch in the living room and leaves dishes and cups on the coffee table and anywhere instead of getting up n walking 5 ft to the kitchen. She has a trash bag full of garbage next to her bc she won’t get up n throw her trash away. 

My child is now 2 going on 3 months, and my (MiL) still hasn’t changed her ways. Am I the A-hole if I take her to court for destruction of property and animal neglect? She is an income provider bc I can’t pay all the bills by myself so we rely on her income as well to help manage our mortgage and electric, so I want to kick her out but I know it’ll hurt us financially. 

But I’m getting tired of the negativity, the laziness, and disrespect she has shown since she has been living here. It’s our home, our name on the mortgage (not my MiL) and it came to a point where it was driving a wedge between my wife and me. 

I need to know how I can get her to change her ways or am I the POS for taking her to court and forcing her to clean her (MiL) bedroom. Which she  will not sleep in bc I know she knows the state it is in and chooses not to do anything about it. 

If we say anything to her she gets defensive and will start getting loud and angry. What do I do bc I want to raise my child and take care of MY FAMILY without (MiL) being the way she is. 

I need some insight on how to handle this. ",1,1751743366.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Hey there,

I’m a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I’m all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it’s a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you’re the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who’s as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn’t afraid to let her playful side show.

When I’m not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you’ll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you’re craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let’s see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

1lshr8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lshr8o/the_fix_by_david_baldacci/,The Fix by David Baldacci:,"  Chapter  
  
  1  
  
  IT WAS NORMALLY one of the safest places on earth.  
  
  But not today.  
  
  The J. Edgar Hoover Building was the world headquarters of the FBI. It opened in 1975 and had not aged well—a blocks-long chunk of badly dilapidated concrete with honeycomb windows, and fire alarms and toilets that didn’t work. There was even safety netting strung around the top of the building to catch chunks of crumbling concrete before they could fall to the street below and kill someone.  
  
  The Bureau was trying to build a new facility to house eleven thousand employees, but a new location hadn’t even been chosen. So the opening of a new headquarters was about two billion dollars and seven years away.  
  
  For now, this was home.  
  
  The tall man striding down the tree-lined sidewalk was Walter Dabney. He had taken an Uber to a coffee shop down the street, ordered some food, and was now walking the rest of the way. He was in his sixties, with thinning salt-and-pepper hair parted on the side. It looked recently cut, with a bit of cowlick in the back. His suit was expensive and fit his portly frame with the touch of a tailored hand. A colorful pocket square adorned the front of his dark suit. He wore a lanyard around his neck loaded with clearances sufficient to allow him access into the inner sanctums of the Hoover Building with an escort along for the ride. His green eyes were alert. He walked with a determined swagger, his briefcase making pendulum arcs in the air.  
  
  A woman was coming from the opposite direction. Anne Berkshire had taken the Metro here. She was in her late fifties, petite, with gray hair cut in parentheses around her long, oval face. As she approached the Hoover Building she seemed to hesitate. There was no lanyard around her neck. The only ID she possessed was the driver’s license in her purse.  
  
  It was late morning and the streets were not as crowded as they would have been earlier. Still, there were a great many pedestrians and the street hummed with activity as cars passed up and down with some vehicles making their way into an underground parking garage at the Hoover Building.  
  
  Dabney picked up his pace a bit, his Allen Edmonds wingtips striking the stained pavement with purpose. He started to whistle a cheery tune. The man seemed not to have a care in the world.  
  
  Berkshire was now walking faster too. Her gaze went to the left and then swung right. She seemed to take in everything with that one sweeping glance.  
  
  About twenty yards behind Dabney, Amos Decker trudged along alone. He was six-five and built like the football player he had once been. He’d been on a diet for several months now and had dropped a chunk of weight, but he could stand to lose quite a bit more. He was dressed in khaki pants stained at the cuff and a long, rumpled Ohio State Buckeyes pullover that concealed both his belly and the Glock 41 Gen4 pistol riding in a belt holster on his waistband. Fully loaded with its standard thirteen-round mag, it weighed thirty-six ounces. His size fourteen shoes hit the pavement with noisy splats. His hair was, to put it kindly, disheveled. Decker worked at the FBI on a joint task force. He was on his way to a meeting at the Hoover Building.  
  
  He was not looking forward to it. He sensed that a change was coming, and Decker did not like change. He’d experienced enough of it in the last two years to last him a lifetime. He had just settled into a new routine with the FBI and he wanted to keep it that way. Yet apparently that was out of his control.  
  
  He stepped around a barricade that had been set up on the sidewalk and that stretched partway into the street. A manhole cover surrounded by an orange web barrier had been opened and workers were congregated around the area. One man in a hard hat emerged at the opening of the manhole and was passed a tool by another man. Most of the other workers stood around, some drinking coffee and others chatting.  
  
  Nice work if you can get it, thought Decker.  
  
  He saw Dabney up ahead but didn’t focus on him. Decker didn’t see Berkshire because he wasn’t looking that far up the street. He passed by the garage entrance and nodded at the uniformed FBI security officer in a small windowed guard shack situated on the sidewalk. The ramrod-straight man nodded back, his eyes covered by sunglasses as his gaze dutifully swept the street. His right hand was perched on top of his holstered service weapon. It was a nine mil chambered with Speer Gold Dot G2 rounds that the FBI used because of their penetration capability. “One shot, one down” could have been the ammo’s motto. Then again, most ammo would do that so long as it hit the intended target in the right place.  
  
  A bird zipped across in front of Decker, perched on a lamppost, and looked down curiously at the passersby. The air was chilly and Decker shivered a bit even in his thick pullover. The sun was hidden behind cloud cover that had materialized on the horizon about an hour before, passed over the Potomac, and settled upon Washington like a gray dome.  
  
  Up ahead, Dabney was nearing the end of the block, where he would turn left. The FBI’s “business appointments” entrance was located down there. Years ago public tours were freely given and people could view the famed FBI lab and watch special agents practicing their aim on the shooting range.  
  
  In the modern era of terrorism that was no more. After 9/11 the tours were canceled but then restarted in 2008. The FBI had even put in an education center for visitors. But a request for a visit had to be filed at least a month ahead of time to allow the FBI to do a thorough background check. Most federal buildings were now simply fortresses, hard to get into and maybe harder to get out of.  
  
  Dabney slowed as he approached the corner.  
  
  Berkshire, by contrast, quickened her pace.  
  
  Decker continued to lope along, his long strides eating up ground until he was only about ten yards behind Dabney.  
  
  Berkshire was about five yards on the other side of Dabney. Moments later that distance was halved. A few clicks after that, they were barely three feet apart.  
  
  Decker now saw Berkshire because she had drawn so close to Dabney. He was about ten feet behind the pair when he started to make the turn too.  
  
  Berkshire glanced over at Dabney, seemingly noticing him for the first time. Dabney didn’t look back at her, at least not initially.  
  
  A few seconds later he saw her gazing at him. He smiled, and if he’d been wearing a hat, he might have even doffed it to her in a show of courtesy.  
  
  Berkshire didn’t smile back. Her hand went to her purse clasp.  
  
  Dabney slowed a bit more.  
  
  Across the street Decker spotted a vendor selling breakfast burritos from a food truck and wondered if he had time to buy one before his meeting. When he decided he didn’t and his waistline would be worse off for it he looked back; Berkshire and Dabney were now beside each other.  
  
  Decker didn’t think anything of it; he just assumed they knew each other and were perhaps rendezvousing here.  
  
  He looked at his watch to check the time. He didn’t want to be late. If his life was going to change, he wanted to be on time for it.  
  
  When he looked back up, he froze.  
  
  Dabney had fallen two steps behind the woman. Unknown to Berkshire, he was aiming a compact Beretta at the back of her head.  
  
  Decker reached for his weapon, and was about to call out, when Dabney pulled the trigger.  
  
  Berkshire jerked forward as the round slammed into the back of her head at an upward angle. It blew out her medulla, pierced her brainpan, banged like a pinball off her skull, and exited through her nose, leaving a wound three times the size of the entry due to the bullet’s built-up wall of kinetic energy. She fell forward onto the pavement, her face most  
ly obliterated, the concrete tatted with her blood.  
  
  His pistol out, Decker ran forward as others on the street screamed and ran away. Dabney was still wielding his weapon.  
  
  His heart pounding, Decker aimed his Glock at Dabney and shouted, “FBI, put your gun down. Now!”  
  
  Dabney turned to him. He did not put down his gun.  
  
  Decker could hear the running footsteps behind him. The guard from the shack was sprinting toward them, his gun also out.  
  
  Decker glanced quickly over his shoulder, saw this, and held up his creds with his free hand. “I’m with the FBI. He just shot the woman.”  
  
  He let his lanyard go and assumed a two-handed shooting stance, his muzzle aimed at Dabney’s chest. The FBI uniform ran up to stand next to him, his gun pointed at Dabney. “Put the gun down, now!” the guard shouted. “Last chance, or we will shoot.”  
  
  It was two guns versus one. The response should have been obvious. Lie down and you won’t fall down.  
  
  Dabney looked first at the guard and then at Decker.  
  
  And smiled.  
  
  “Don’t!” shouted Decker.  
  
  Walter Dabney pressed the gun’s muzzle to the bottom of his chin and pulled the trigger for a second and final time.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  2  
  
  DARKNESS. IT AWAITED us all, individually, in our final moments. Amos Decker was thinking that as he sat in the chair and studied the body.  
  
  Anne Berkshire lay on a metal table in the FBI’s morgue. All her clothes had been removed and placed in evidence bags to be later analyzed. Her naked body was under a sheet; her destroyed face was covered as well, although the fabric was stained with her blood and destroyed tissue.  
  
  A postmortem was legally required even though there was no doubt whatsoever as to what had caused the woman’s death.  
  
  Walter Dabney, by an extraordinary twist, was not dead. Not yet, anyway. The doctors at the hospital to which he’d been rushed held no hope that he would recover, or even regain consciousness. The bullet had tunneled right through his brain; it was a miracle he had not died instantly.  
  
  Alex Jamison and Ross Bogart, two of Decker’s colleagues on a joint task force composed of civilians and FBI agents, were with Dabney at the hospital right now. If he regained consciousness they would want to capture anything he might utter that would explain why he had murdered Anne Berkshire on a public street and then attempted to take his own life. Dabney’s recovering to the point of being questioned was simply not going to happen, the doctors had told them.  
  
  So for now, Decker simply sat in the darkness and stared at the covered body.  
  
  Although the room was not actually dark for him.  
  
  For Decker it was an ethereally bright blue. A near-fatal hit he’d received on the football field had commingled his sensory pathways, a condition known as synesthesia. For him, death was represented by the color blue. He had seen it on the street when Dabney had killed Berkshire.  
  
  And he was seeing it now.  
  
  Decker had given statements to the D.C. police and the FBI, as had the security guard who had joined him at the scene. There hadn’t been much to say. Dabney had pulled a gun and shot Berkshire and then himself. That was crystal clear. What wasn’t clear was why he had done it.  
  
  The overhead lights came on and a woman in a white lab coat walked in. The medical examiner introduced herself as Lynne Wainwright. She was in her forties, with the compressed, slightly haunted features of a person who had seen every sort of violence one human could wreak on another. Decker rose, showed her his ID, and said he was with an FBI task force. And also that he had witnessed the murder.  
  
  Decker glanced over as Todd Milligan, the fourth member of the joint task force, entered the room. A fifth member, Lisa Davenport, a psychologist by training, had not returned to the group, opting instead to go back to private practice in Chicago.  
  
  Milligan was in his midthirties, six feet tall, with close-cropped hair and a physique that appeared chiseled out of granite. He and Decker had initially butted heads, but now the two men got along as well as Decker could with anyone.  
  
  Decker had trouble relating to people. That had not always been the case, because he was not the same person he had once been.  
  
  In addition to the synesthesia, Decker also had hyperthymesia, or perfect recall, after suffering a brain trauma on the same vicious hit in his very short career in the NFL. It had altered his personality, changing him from gregarious and fun-loving to aloof and lacking the ability to recognize social cues—a skill most people took for granted. People first meeting him would assume he was somewhere on the autism spectrum.  
  
  And they might not be far off in that assumption.  
  
  “How you doing, Decker?” said Milligan. He was dressed, like always, in a dark suit with a spotless crisp white shirt and striped tie. Next to him, the shabbily attired Decker looked borderline homeless.  
  
  “Better than she is,” said Decker, indicating Berkshire’s body. “What do we know about her so far?”  
  
  Milligan took out a small electronic notebook from his inside coat pocket and scrolled down the screen. While he was doing that Decker watched as Wainwright removed the sheet from Berkshire’s body and prepared the instruments necessary to perform the autopsy.  
  
  “Anne Meredith Berkshire, fifty-nine, unmarried, substitute schoolteacher at a Catholic school in Fairfax County. She lives, or rather lived, in Reston. No relatives have come forward, but we’re still checking.”  
  
  “Why was she down at the Hoover Building?”  
  
  “We don’t know. We don’t know if she was even going there. And she wasn’t scheduled to teach at the school today.”  
  
  “Walter Dabney?”  
  
  “Sixty-one, married, with four grown daughters. Has a successful government contracting business. Does work with the Bureau and other agencies. Before that he worked at NSA for ten years. Lives in McLean in a big house. He’s done very well for himself.”  
  
  “Did very well for himself,” corrected Decker. “His wife and kids?”  
  
  “We spoke with his wife. She’s hysterical. The kids are spread all over the place. One lives in France. They’re all coming here.”  
  
  “Any of them have any idea why he would do this?”  
  
  “We haven’t spoken to them all, but nothing pops so far. They’re apparently still in shock.”  
  
  Decker next asked the most obvious question. “Any connection between Berkshire and Dabney?”  
  
  “We’re just starting out, but nothing as yet. You think he was just looking to shoot someone before he killed himself and she was the closest?”  
  
  “She was definitely the closest,” said Decker. “But if you’re going to kill yourself why take an innocent person along? What would be the point?”  
  
  “Maybe the guy went nuts. We might find something in his background to explain his going off the deep end.”  
  
  “He had a briefcase and an ID. It seems he was heading to the Hoover Building. Was he going to a meeting?”  
  
  “Yes. We confirmed that he was meeting to go over a project his firm was handling for the Bureau. All routine.”  
  
  “So he goes off the ‘deep end’ but he could still put on a suit and come downtown for a routine meeting?”  
  
  Milligan nodded. “I see the inconsistency. But it’s still possible.”  
  
  “Anything’s possible, until it’s not,” Decker replied.  
  
  Decker walked over to stand next to Wainwright. “Murder weapon was a Beretta nine mil. Contact wound at the base of the neck with an upward trajectory. She died on impact.”  
  
  Wainwright was readying a Stryker saw that she would use to cut open Berkshire’s skull. She said, “Definitely jibes with the external injuries.”  
  
  “If Dabney dies will you be doing the post?”  
  
  She nodded. “The Bureau is taking the lead on this since Dabney was a contractor for them and it happened on their doorstep. So I’m your girl.”  
  
  Decker turned away from her and said to Milligan, “Has the FBI assigned a team to the case yet?”  
  
  Milligan n  
odded.  
  
  “Who’s the team? Do you know them?

  
 “I know them very well, because they’re us.”  
  
  Decker blinked. “Come again?”  
  
  “Bogart’s team, meaning us, has been assigned to the case.”  
  
  “But we do cold cases.”  
  
  “Well, that’s what the meeting today was about. They were changing our assignment. Cold to hot cases. And since you were on the scene of this one, it made sense to let us work it. So we’re a go.”  
  
  “Even though I’m a witness to the crime?”  
  
  “It’s not as though there’s going to be any doubt as to what happened, Decker. And there were lots of witnesses to what he did. They don’t need you.”  
  
  “But I came here to do cold cases,” protested Decker.  
  
  “Well, we don’t get to decide that, Decker. The higher-ups do.”  
  
  “And they can just pull the rug out from under us like that? Without even asking?”  
  
  Milligan attempted a smile, but when he saw the troubled expression on Decker’s face, the look faded. “It’s a bureaucracy, Decker, and we have to follow orders. At least Ross and I do. I guess you and Jamison could call it quits, but my career is locked up with the Bureau.” He paused. “We’ll still be catching bad guys. Just for newer crimes. You’ll still get to do what you do so well.”  
  
  Decker nodded but hardly looked appeased by Milligan’s words. He looked down at Berkshire’s body. The pulse of blue assailed him from all corners. He felt slightly sick to his stomach.  
  
  Wainwright glanced over and registered on the name on Decker’s ID. “Wait a minute. Amos Decker. Are you the guy who can’t forget anything?”  
  
  When Decker didn’t say anything, Milligan said quickly, “Yes, he is.”  
  
  Wainwright said, “Heard you guys have solved quite a few old cases over the last several months. Principally the Melvin Mars matter.”  
  
  “It was a team effort,” said Milligan. “But we couldn’t have done it without Decker.”  
  
  Decker stirred and pointed to a purple smudge on the back of Berkshire’s hand. “What’s that?”  
  
  “Let’s have a closer look,” Wainwright said. She gripped a magnifying glass set on a rotating arm and positioned it over the mark. She turned on a light and aimed it at the dead woman’s hand. Peering through the glass, she said, “Appears to be a stamp of some sort.”  
  
  Decker took a look through the glass. “Dominion Hospice.” He looked at Milligan, who was already tapping keys on his notebook.  
  
  Milligan read down the screen. “Okay, got it. It’s over near Reston Hospital. They handle terminal cases, obviously.”  
  
  Decker looked down at Berkshire. “If the mark is still on her hand, presumably she went there today. A shower would have taken it off.”  
  
  “Do you think she went to visit someone?” asked Milligan.  
  
  “Well, she wasn’t exactly terminal, until Dabney killed her.”  
  
  He abruptly walked out without another word.  
  
  Wainwright looked at Milligan with raised eyebrows at this sudden departure.  
  
  “He kind of just does that…a lot,” said Milligan. “I’ve sort of gotten used to it.”  
  
  “Then you’re a better person than I am,” replied Wainwright. She held up the Stryker saw. “Because if he kept walking out on me like that, I might just clock him with this.”  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  3  
  
  WALTER DABNEY’S CHEST rose and fell with the spasmodic twitch of someone not long for this world. It was as though the lungs were the weary rear guard holding out as the spirit prepared to exit the body.  
  
  Alex Jamison was in her late twenties, tall, slim, and pretty with long brunette hair. She sat on the right side of the hospital bed in the CCU. Ross Bogart, an FBI special agent in his late forties, with a bit of gray the only thing marring his perfectly combed dark hair, stood ramrod-straight on the left. His fingers clutched the bed’s safety rail.  
  
  Dabney lay in the bed, hooked up to a complex array of monitoring lines and tubes carrying medications. His right eye was an empty crater because the bullet he’d fired into his chin had burst from there after catapulting through parts of the brain. His facial skin was deathly gray, where it wasn’t swollen and stained purple by burst capillaries. His breathing was erratic and the monitor showed his vitals to be fluctuating all over the place. He was in the critical care unit, the place designated for the sickest and most badly injured patients at the hospital.  
  
  But he wasn’t just injured; Walter Dabney was dying.  
  
  The doctors who had been in and out during the day had all confirmed that it was simply a matter of time before the brain told the heart to stop pumping. And there was nothing they could do about it. The damage was such that no medicine and no surgery could bring the man back. They were just counting down the time until death.  
  
  Mrs. Eleanor Dabney, better known as Ellie, had arrived thirty minutes after the FBI had told her what had happened. They would have to question her, but right now the woman was simply a grieving widow-to-be. She was currently in the bathroom throwing up, a nurse assisting her.  
  
  Bogart eyed Jamison. She seemed to sense his attention and glanced up.  
  
  “Any word from Decker?” he asked quietly.  
  
  She checked her phone and shook her head. “He was going to be at the morgue with Berkshire’s body.” She thumbed in a text to him and sent it off. “I copied Todd on it,” she said.  
  
  Bogart nodded. “Good. He’ll keep Decker on track.”  
  
  They both knew that Decker was not always the best at communicating. In fact, he pretty much sucked at it.  
  
  Bogart looked down at Dabney again. “Nothing in the guy’s record to indicate something like this happening. And no connection that we can find to Berkshire.”  
  
  Jamison said, “There must be something unless it was completely random. And that doesn’t make much sense either.”  
  
  Bogart nodded in agreement and then glanced at the monitor. The dying man’s heart rate and respiration danced around like bare feet on sizzling coals.  
  
  “Chances are very good he’s going to die without saying anything.”  
  
  “But if he does say something we’ll be here,” replied Jamison.  
  
  The bathroom door opened and out came the nurse and Ellie Dabney. She was tall and broad-shouldered, with long legs and a slender waist and narrow hips. Her features were quite attractive, the jaw elegantly structured, the cheekbones high and firm, the eyes large and a pleasing light blue. Her hair was long and she had let it go naturally silver. She looked like she might have been quite the athlete in her youth. Now in her early sixties, the mother of four grown children with three grandchildren and one mortally wounded husband, the stricken woman appeared about as close to death as one could get without actually being dead.  
  
  Bogart placed a chair next to the bed for her as Jamison rose and helped the nurse guide Ellie over to the chair, into which she fell rather than sat.  
  
  The nurse checked the monitor, gave Bogart an ominous look, and left, closing the door behind her. Ellie had reached through the rails and gripped her husband’s hand, her forehead resting against the top of the bed rail.  
  
  Bogart stepped back and Jamison resumed her seat. They exchanged glances while listening to the woman’s quiet sobs.  
  
  “Mrs. Dabney, we can arrange to have your children brought here when they get into town,” he said after a few moments.  
  
  She didn’t respond to this at first but finally nodded.  
  
  “Do you have that information or is there someone else we can—?”  
  
  She lifted her head and without looking at him said, “My daughter, Jules, she…she’ll know that.” She pulled a phone from her pocket, tapped some keys, and passed it to him. Bogart wrote the phone number down, handed Ellie her phone back, and walked out of the room.  
  
  Jamison put a hand on the older woman’s shoulder and said, “I’m so very sorry, Mrs. Dabney.”  
  
  “Did he…did Walt really h-hurt someone? The FBI…they…they said…”  
  
  “We don’t have to talk about that now.”  
  
  Ellie turned her tear  
stained face to Jamison. “He couldn’t have. Are you sure someone didn’t shoot him? You see, Walt wouldn’t hurt anything. H-he…” Her voice trailed off and she placed her forehead back on the rail.  
  
  The monitor started to beep and they both glanced at it, but the device quieted down.  
  
  “We are sure, Mrs. Dabney. I wish I could tell you otherwise. There were a lot of witnesses.”  
  
  Ellie blew her nose on a tissue and said in a firmer voice, “He’s not going to recover, is he?”  
  
  “The doctors aren’t hopeful, no.”  
  
  “I…I didn’t even know he owned a gun.”  
  
  After studying the woman for a few seconds, Jamison asked, “Did you notice a change in your husband recently?”  
  
  “In what way?” Ellie said absently.  
  
  “Mood? Concerns at work? Appetite changed? Maybe he drank more than normal? Any signs of depression?”  
  
  Ellie sat back in her chair, wadded the tissue up in her hand, and stared down at her lap.  
  
  Outside the door footsteps could be heard, along with occasional running feet, the sounds of a monitor alarm, voices over a PA, and equipment and patients being rolled up and down the corridor. The air smelled like hospitals always did: antiseptic. And the air was perpetually chilly. There was also an ominous tenseness present in the CCU, as though only a monitor’s sudden warning screech separated the living from the dead.  
  
  “Walt didn’t talk about business at home. He didn’t really drink at home either, although I know that he did at business dinners and industry events, that sort of thing. I attended some with him. But he only drank enough to socialize, to get deals done, build contacts, you know, that sort of thing.”  
  
  “I understand. Were there any financial worries?”  
  
  “Not that I knew of. But Walter handled all that. We never had any bill collectors show up at the house, if that’s what you mean.”  
  
  “Did his mood change?”  
  
  She dabbed at her eyes and shot a glance at her husband before quickly looking away, as though she was uncomfortable conveying information about him to a stranger. “He had a variety of moods. He worked very hard and when business was good he was happy, when it was down, he got depressed, just like anybody would.”  
  
  “So nothing out of the ordinary?”  
  
  Ellie balled up the tissue even more and then tossed it into the trash can.  
  
  With finality.  
  
  She turned to Jamison, who waited patiently. If being around Amos Decker had taught her anything, it was patience, for both positive and negative reasons.  
  
  “He went on a trip recently.”  
  
  “Where?”  
  
  “That was the unusual thing. He didn’t tell me where. He had never done that before.”  
  
  “How long was he gone?” Jamison asked.  
  
  “I think about four days. It could have been longer. He was on another trip in New York and left from there. He called me and said something unexpected had come up and that he had to attend to it and wasn’t sure how long he’d be gone.”  
  
  “Plane, train? Another country?”  
  
  “I don’t know. He did tell me it had to do with a potential client. He had to smooth over something. The way he described it the matter didn’t seem too significant. I suppose his office would have handled the travel arrangements.”  
  
  “Okay, and he mentioned nothing to you about it when he got home?”  
  
  “Nothing. I just assumed it was business. But from that day on, there was something, I don’t know, off.”  
  
  “And when was this?”  
  
  “About a month ago.”  
  
  “And your husband has his own government contracting firm?”  
  
  Ellie nodded. “Walter Dabney and Associates. It’s located in Reston. Everything they work on is pretty much classified. It started out with just my husband, but now about seventy people work there. He has partners at the firm, but Walter is president and owns a controlling interest.” Her eyes widened. “Oh my God, I guess I’ll own it now.” She looked in alarm at Jamison. “Does that mean I’ll have to run it? I don’t know anything about his business. I don’t even have a security clearance.”  
  
  Jamison gripped her hand. “I don’t think you need to worry about those details right now, Mrs. Dabney.”  
  
  Ellie relaxed and looked back at her husband. “What was the person’s name again? That Walter…? They told me, but I can’t remember. Everything is just a blur right now.”  
  
  “Anne Berkshire. She was a substitute teacher at a Catholic high school in Fairfax. Do you know her?”  
  
  Ellie shook her head. “I never heard of her. And I don’t know why Walt would know her either. High school teacher? Walt and I had our children fairly early. Jules, our oldest, is thirty-seven. And our oldest grandkid is only in first grade. And they don’t even live in Virginia anyway. And we’re not Catholic. We’re Presbyterian.”  
  
  “Right. Well, thank you for the information. You’ve been very helpful.”  
  
  “Will I need to get a lawyer?” Ellie blurted out.  
  
  Jamison looked uncomfortable. “I’m really not the one to advise you about that. If you or your husband used a lawyer or know one, you should check with that person.”  
  
  Ellie nodded dumbly and then reached through the rails and gripped her husband’s hand once more.  
  
  A minute later Bogart came back in. “It’s all taken care of, Mrs. Dabney,” he said. “According to your daughter, everyone except Natalie will be in by tonight.”  
  
  “Natalie lives in Paris. I tried to phone her but no one answered. And it wasn’t…it wasn’t something I could leave on a voicemail or tell her by email.”  
  
  “Your daughter Jules reached her and told her the situation. She’s trying to get a flight here as soon as possible.”  
  
  “I really can’t believe this is happening,” said Ellie. “When Walt left this morning everything was…perfect. And now?” She looked up at them. “It’s all gone. Just like that.”  
  
  Just like that, thought Jamison.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  4  
  
  THEY HAD TRAVELED from a place filled with dead bodies to a place filled with dying people.  
  
  After making inquiries at the front desk, Decker and Milligan had been given over to the director of Dominion Hospice, Sally Palmer. The woman was shocked to hear of Anne Berkshire’s death.  
  
  “She was just here this morning,” she said as she faced them from across the desk in her small, cramped office.  
  
  “That’s what we understand,” said Decker. “And it’s why we’re here. We saw that her hand was stamped with the name of the hospice.”  
  
  “Yes, we do that as part of our security procedure.”  
  
  “Does this place need much security?” asked Milligan.  
  
  Palmer looked at him sternly. “Our patients are weak and on heavy medications. They can hardly protect themselves. It falls to us to do that, and we take that matter very seriously. All visitors are checked in through the front entrance. The hand stamp is easily seen and we change the color every day. That way at a glance our staff knows if a visitor has been properly cleared through or not.”  
  
  Decker asked, “Did Berkshire have a family member who’s a patient here? Is that why she was here this morning?”  
  
  “Oh, no. Anne was a volunteer. She would come and spend time with certain patients. Oftentimes the patient’s family may not live in the immediate area, and visits aren’t so frequent. We have volunteers, carefully vetted of course, who come in and talk to the patients, read to them, or just sit with them. It’s not easy dying. And it’s even harder dying alone.”  
  
  “Did Berkshire talk to anyone in particular today?” asked Milligan.  
 “I can certainly find out. Excuse me for a minute.”  
  
  Palmer rose and left.  
  
  Milligan took out his phone and checked messages. “Dabney’s wife is at the hospital with her husband. Alex says he hasn’t regained consciousness and probably won’t.”  
  
  “Did the wife tell them anything?”  
  
  “She didn’t know Anne Berkshire and was pretty sure her husband didn’t either. She also knew nothing about her husband’s business and had no idea why he would do what he did. But Alex texted again. Mrs. Dabney said her husband had taken an unexplained trip about a month ago and that he didn’t seem the same afterwards.”  
  
  “Not the same how?”  
  
  “Different mood apparently. And he wouldn’t tell her where he went.”  
  
  “Okay.”  
  
  Milligan looked around the small office. “Do you really think we’re going to get a lead from this place?”  
  
  “People are killed by strangers, but most people know the one who kills them.”  
  
  “Well, that’s always comforting,” said Milligan dourly.  
  
  The men lapsed into silence until Palmer returned a few minutes later.  
  
  “She met with three patients early this morning. Dorothy Vitters, Joey Scott, and Albert Drews.”  
  
  “Were they people she normally would visit?” asked Decker.  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “You said she came in early this morning. Did she usually come in at that time?”  
  
  “Well, no, come to think of it. She usually came in around noon. Our patients are generally more alert then.”  
  
  “Can we speak with them?” asked Decker.  
  
  Palmer looked taken aback. “I’m not sure what they can tell you. They’re very ill. And weak.”  
  
  Decker rose. “I appreciate that, but Anne Berkshire was murdered this morning and it’s our job to find out why. And if she came here at an unusual time shortly before she went downtown and was killed, then we have to run that possible lead down. I hope you can understand that.”  
  
  Milligan added quickly, “We’ll be as gentle as possible.”  
  
  “Do you have to tell them that Anne was killed? That will be extremely upsetting for them.”  
  
  Milligan said, “We’ll do our best to avoid that.”  
  
  Decker said nothing. His eyes were already on the hallway.  
  
  Dorothy Vitters was in her late eighties, frail and shrunken in the last bed she would occupy. Because of patient confidentiality, Palmer had not told them what specific illness she might have. She left them in the doorway and walked back to her office.  
  
  Decker stood in the doorway and looked around at the small, sparsely furnished space.  
  
  “You okay?” said Milligan in a low voice.  
  
  Decker was not okay, not really.  
  
  What he was seeing here wasn’t the flash of electric blue he associated with death but rather navy blue. That was a first for him. But when he looked at the terminally ill Vitters he could understand why. Near death was apparently represented in his mind simply by another shade of blue.  
  
  Well, that is interesting. My altered mind keeps throwing me curves.  
  
  He didn’t want to be here when Vitters died, because he didn’t want the navy to abruptly change to electric blue.  
  
  “I’m good,” he finally said.  
  
  He walked into the room, pulled up a chair, and sat next to the bed. Milligan stood next to him.  
  
  “Mrs. Vitters, I’m Amos Decker and this is Todd Milligan. We’re here to talk to you about Anne Berkshire. She was in to see you this morning, we understand.”  
  
  Vitters looked up at him from deeply sunken eyes. Her skin was a pale gray, her eyes watery and her breathing shallow. Decker could see the port near her clavicle where her pain meds were administered.  
  
  “Anne was here,” she said slowly. “I was surprised because it was earlier than usual.”  
  
  “Do you remember what you talked about?”  
  
  “Who are you?”  
  
  Decker was about to take out his creds when Milligan stopped him. Milligan said, “We’re friends of Anne’s. She asked us to stop in today because she wanted to come back and keep talking to you but then found out she couldn’t make it.”  
  
  The watery eyes turned to alarm. “Is she…is she all right? She’s not sick, is she?”  
  
  “She’s feeling no pain at all,” said Decker quite truthfully. He was counting on the fact that whatever meds the woman was on would slow her mental processes somewhat, otherwise Vitters might figure out that nothing they were saying made much sense.  
  
  “Oh, well, it was just the usual things. Weather. A book she was reading and telling me about. My cat.”  
  
  “Your cat?” said Milligan.  
  
  “Sunny’s dead now. Oh, it’s been ten years if it’s been a day. But Anne liked cats.”  
  
  “So nothing other than that?” asked Decker.  
  
  “No, not that I recall. She wasn’t here that long.”  
  
  “Did she seem okay to you? Nothing out of sorts?”  
  
  Her voice grew more strident. “Are you sure she’s all right? Why are you here asking these questions? I might be dying, but I’m not stupid.”  
  
  Decker saw the watery eyes turn to flint before flickering out again.  
  
  “Well, if you have to know the truth, the fact is—”  
  
  Milligan cut in. “We know you’re not stupid, Mrs. Vitters. As my colleague was about to say, the fact is, Anne fell down and hit her head today. She’ll be fine, but she’s got short-term amnesia. And she needs to remember the passcode to her phone and her apartment’s alarm system and her computer. She sent us here to find out what she was talking about to people so that we can tell her and maybe jog her memory. The doctors said that that might do it.”  
  
  Vitters looked relieved. “Oh, well, I’m so sorry she fell.”  
  
  Decker glanced at Milligan for an instant before gazing back at Vitters and saying, “So anything you can tell us would be appreciated.”  
  
  “Well, again, we didn’t talk about much. Although, it did seem that Anne was preoccupied. She usually led the conversations we had but today I had to prompt her a few times.”  
  
  Milligan glanced sharply at Decker, but Decker kept his gaze on Vitters.  
  
  “Did you ask her if anything was wrong?”  
  
  “I did actually. But she said everything was fine. She just had something on her mind, but she didn’t say what.”  
  
  “Do you know if you were the first person that Anne visited today, or were there others before you?”  
  
  “I think I was the last. She mentioned she had to leave after seeing me. She had somewhere to go.”  
  
  “She didn’t mention where that was?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  Decker rose and turned to leave.  
  
  Milligan said hastily, “Thank you for your help. Is there anything we can do for you?”  
  
  Vitters smiled grimly. “Put in a good word for me with the man upstairs.”  
  
  As they left, Milligan whispered, “Hey, Decker, you need to go a little easy with these folks, okay? They’re dying.”  
  
  He passed by Decker, who turned and looked back at Vitters lying in the bed, her eyes now closed. He walked back over to her and looked down. The navy blue image in his mind was starting to turn electric blue. Decker didn’t believe he could foresee someone’s death, but his mind was obviously making the logical leap with the terminally ill Vitters.  
  
  He reached down and adjusted the woman’s pillow to make her head rest more comfortably. His hand grazed over the white hair and then he said in a low voice, “I’m sorry, Mrs. Vitters.”  
  
  He didn’t see Milligan watching him from the doorway. The FBI agent hurried off before Decker turned around.

She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no — and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party — so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking — she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

I can't deal with this even with therapy

**Crosses to Bear**

The golden morning sunlight eased its way into my eyesight, coaxing me back to the land of the living. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, a pounding headache greeted me; last night's escapades, clearly taking effect. I looked downward to see Chris still asleep. He groaned softly as he rolled over onto his side. I stood to stretch my legs and find some water, but noticed a blanket draped over the bench seats that I hadn't seen before. I grabbed the blanket and gently placed it on Chris before walking over to the breakfast buffet in the center of the room. I stood in a line that was formed, flanked by two men and a young woman. I reached the front of the line and grabbed a bottle of water, a cup of black, aromatic espresso, and a blueberry muffin. Everything smelled delicious despite my growing nausea.

""Can you hand me a fork?"" The young woman behind me asked. She was thin as a rail and had jet-black hair that caught the sunlight, causing it to shimmer. I handed her the utensil, and she thanked me. ""Rough night?"" she asked.

""You could say that,"" I answered with a forced smirk.

""I saw you and that other guy come in late last night. The spooks force you back here, too?""

""Spooks?"" I asked.

""The staff."" She replied. I remembered last night, the ominous warning the bartender gave Chris and me, echoed in the back of my mind.

""Uh, yeah. Chris had a little too much to drink last night and caused a bit of a scene. I kinda got roped into it."" I answered matter-of-factly.

""Yeah, they don't take too kindly to anything but partying up there."" She said, a forlorn look in her eye. ""I'm Misty Guillard, by the way."" The young woman said, offering her hand to shake.

""Nice to meet you, Misty, I'm...""

""Oh, hey Newbie, you're awake. Save any coffee for me?"" Chris interrupted. ""Oh, hi there, I'm Chris. Pleasure to meet you. Chris shook her hand.

""Good to meet you, too, Chris. Your friend here was just explaining how the two of you ended up back here.""

""Oh, that whole ordeal was a load of shit,"" Chris answered flippantly. ""I got a little inebriated and divulged a bit too much of my past. My eyes started to sweat a little, and that, I guess, is a major no-no up there in party land."" He said, with a wave of his hand.

I looked over at him with a knowing glance. He was downplaying the whole ordeal, either not remembering or purposefully leaving out how much of a gibbering mess he was. ""But hey, don't mind me, I'm gonna go get me some breakfast and mingle a bit."" He said, with a grin, and turned his heels toward the back of the line. Misty and I grabbed our breakfasts and sat together at the nearest unoccupied bench.

""Your friend seems..."" she trailed off

""Helpless?"" I answered.

""I was going to say eccentric."" She said with a giggle. ""Have you known each other long?""

""We met yesterday, and he's already getting me in trouble,"" I stated, a tinge of resentment apparent in my voice. ""I haven't been on this bus for twenty-four hours, and I've already been threatened by security. What about you? When did you get here?""

""Oh, I uh, I don't really know how long I've been here."" She said, looking intently at the floor. ""Could be weeks, maybe months."" She said, under her breath. I got the feeling it wasn't something she wanted to talk about, so I changed the subject.

""So, where are you from?"" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation toward a more mundane topic.

""I was born in Toulouse, France, but moved to Nashville when I was eight. My dad got a job in the States that paid much better than his previous job, so we relocated to Tennessee.""

""That must have been a culture shock,"" I answered, sipping my coffee.

""Not for me, I was so young, I remember very little of France. I don't even have much of an accent."" She said, staring out the window.

""It still must have been hard. Did you leave behind any family, any friends?"" I asked. Her face turned pale, as if all of the blood in her body turned to ice, all at once.

""No...no friends."" She muttered. Again, despite myself, it seems I struck a nerve.

""I hope I didn't poke into a sore subject,"" I said apologetically. I was met only with silence. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I was about to say something else when Misty said,

""I don't deserve friends."" She grabbed her dirty dishes and walked away. I sat there stumped. Was it something I said? What did she mean by not deserving friends?

As I sat there, in contemplation, the pianist in the background played a jazzy tune. Everything was rather peaceful until Chris walked up to me with two lit cigars.

""Oh, great,"" I thought to myself.

""Hey, Newbie. I brought an apology gift. The staff were handing these out, so I grabbed one for each of us. I guess it's my way of saying sorry for how last night...you know. He said, trailing off.

I wasn't really up for smoking. I'm not much of a fan of cigars, but with the apologetic eyes Chris was giving me, I couldn't say no.

""Thanks,"" I said, apprehensively reaching for the stogie. He plopped down next to me and inhaled deeply.

""This sure is the life. Not a care in the world, just two friends relaxing, smoking some of the finest Cuba has to offer."" He said, a wide grin forming from ear to ear.

While he prattled on and on about the finer things in life, I was scanning the room, my eyes searched for Misty through the crowd. I finally spotted her, sitting alone in a corner, her face buried in her hands, seemingly crying.

"".....and that's why I only eat grass-fed beef, am I right, Newbie?"" I stood, ignoring Chris's inane babble, and cut through the crowd where Misty was sitting. I gently placed my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. She jerked away, in a startle, and looked up at me, her eyes red and puffy from tears.

""I'm sorry if I upset you. That wasn't my intention. But if you want to talk, I'm a good listener."" I said softly.

""Why do you care?"" She asked incredulously. ""Everyone on this bus is here for one reason or another, and I'm no different. I'm sure you have your reasons, and you don't see me bothering you about it!"" She was clearly very upset, and her tone mirrored the tumult of emotions she was facing. She sniffled and wiped tears from her cheeks before speaking again. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. You're only trying to help. I guess I'm just going through a lot lately.""

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, taking my seat next to her. She sat in silence for a moment, gathering her thoughts.

""I guess I'll start from the beginning. When I first moved to the US, I was an outcast. I didn't have any friends or anyone, for that matter, to speak to. I barely spoke the language, so meeting new people was out of the question, and my parents were never home because of their busy schedules.""

""I would go to school, struggle to understand what was taught to me, go home, do homework, eat a frozen dinner, and go to sleep. Day after day, month after month, year after year, it was the same routine. Because I spoke so rarely, some of the more rude kids thought I had some kind of learning disorder and were rather mean to me. I was bullied relentlessly. Kids and teachers alike would talk behind my back, and when they did speak to me, it was with an air of condescension.""

""One day at lunch, when I was around twelve, a particularly abrasive student grabbed my cell phone out of my backpack. He waved it around, putting on a mocking French accent, saying, 'Mother, why did you pack snails in my lunch box? I wanted frog legs!' All I could do was cry. But that only egged him on.""

""Each of his friends was laughing at me. All but one, Joseph McCollum."" She sighed deeply after saying his name, as if even mentioning him weighed on her shoulders. ""He stood up from his seat and grabbed my phone from his friend, told him to stop being an ass, and gave it back to me. In an outburst of emotion, I hugged him. Coming to my senses, I was so embarrassed that I ran off. But it stuck with me. Because of him sticking up for me, a social pariah, his friends ostracized him.""

""A few days later, I was sitting alone at lunch, and he came up to me. He asked to sit next to me, and I, being too stunned to speak, nodded vigorously. From that day on, we were inseparable.""

""We had a lot in common, such as hiking and biking. Every weekend, we would bike down nature trails and hike up hills and small mountains.""

""Even our family dynamics were similar. My parents were always gone because of work, Joseph's were never there to begin with. He told me his mom would get high and sleep all day, and his father told him he was an 'unlovable drain' before he walked out on the family. I felt bad for him, but as long as we were in this boat together, we would never be alone again.""

""Once high school came around, we tested our relationship to see if we were more than friends. It didn't work out, though."" She said with a thoughtful smile.

""We were just too close to risk what we already had. We still spent nearly every day together. We would take turns walking each other home from the bus stop, helping one another with assignments, and goofing off together when we had the time. Every day with him felt like a privilege. Due to his influence, I slowly started coming out of my shell. I was more confident when speaking to people and being in social settings in general. With my newfound confidence, Joseph and I applied to the local university. I'll never forget the day Joseph and I received our acceptance letters. We were so excited, we played music as loud as we could and danced through my house all day. We even got matching tattoos."" She pointed to a black chain tattoo wrapping around her wrist. A small glint of pride and sadness flashed in her eyes.

""We made all sorts of plans, such as: what courses we would take, what our majors would be, and what extracurriculars we would pursue. We even found a small apartment to share within walking distance of the school. We settled in nicely but once school started, we began to see less and less of each other. It started slowly,"" She said, melancholy dripping from her voice.

""At first, we hung out every weekend. Then, every other weekend. By the time Christmas break started, I had seen him once in the last three months. The worst part is that I had convinced myself I didn't miss him. I had made new friends this year, and they were taking up my time. I was sure he had too.""

""A girl in my physics class, Rebecca, invited me to a Christmas party her sorority was throwing. It sounded like a ton of fun and just the release I needed from the stress of school. I ran home to get changed, and I saw Joseph. He was so excited to see me. He ran to me, saying,

'Misty! I've got a surprise for you! I've rented out this beautiful B&B in the forest for the break. There are these breathtaking lakes and hiking trails that take you to the foot of the Smokies. Pack a couple of bags, we can leave in the morning!'""

""His eyes were wide with excitement, but I hadn’t expected him to make such a big plan without telling me first. Suddenly, I felt cornered. I hadn’t really thought about it until he asked, but my priorities had changed. A year ago, I would have jumped at the idea, but now… I had new friends and a new life. Part of me was afraid to go back to the way things used to be, afraid that it would pull me back into that old version of myself.""

""'You did all that without asking me? 'I've already made plans.'""

""I could see the joy drain from his face, replaced by hurt and disbelief. He looked at me like I’d just slapped him.

""'You...you made plans? With who?'""

""'Rebecca, from my physics class,' I answered casually, but guilt gnawed at me and I avoided his eyes.""

""'Rebecca, you just met her last week, and you didn’t think to ask if maybe I wanted to do something? You just… replaced me.' His voice was quieter, but the bitterness was starting to creep in.""

""'She invited me, Joseph. You can't just expect me to drop everything because you made plans without asking.'""

""His face twisted, something darker stirring beneath the surface. 'Drop everything? That's rich coming from you. Lately, you've barely acknowledged I exist. Ever since you made all of these new friends, I’ve been an afterthought. Maybe you’re too good for me now, huh?'""

""I rolled my eyes, feeling my frustration mounting. 'This isn’t about you! I’ve just been busy. We both have.'""

""'Busy?' He nearly spat the word out. 'Busy ditching me at every turn! It’s like the second you found a group that wasn’t bullying you, you decided I was expendable!'""

""His words stung, and I snapped back, 'I’m not your emotional crutch, Joseph. You can’t just expect me to be there for you every second like I owe you something.'""

""'So that’s what I am now, huh? Some albatross around your neck, some burden? That’s great, Misty. All these years, that's what you reduce me to.' His voice was rising, and his face was flushed with anger.""

""'You know what, maybe you are!' I shouted, the words spilling out before I could stop them. 'God, it’s like every time I’m with you, you drain the life out of me with your endless need for validation. You don’t need me, Joseph, you just don’t want to be alone, and I’m tired of feeling guilty for living my life!'""

""His face turned pale. His lips trembled, and when he spoke, his voice was deadly quiet. 'At least I needed you, Misty. You don’t need anyone, do you? That’s why you’re so damn heartless.'""

""'Oh, heartless?' I shot back, sarcasm dripping from every word. 'Is that what you tell yourself? Maybe you’re just so unlovable that you cling to whoever shows you the slightest bit of affection because deep down, you know they’ll all leave you just like your dad did! That’s why you’re so obsessed with me, I’m the only one who’s ever cared enough to stick around.'""

""His eyes widened in shock. I could see the impact of my words hit him like a freight train. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. I had crossed a line, and we both knew it.""

""'I…' he started to say, but the hurt in his eyes quickly turned to rage. 'Well, guess what? You didn’t stick around, either. You're just like everyone else who walks out of my life. Turns out you’re even worse because I thought you were different. But no, you’re just a cold, backstabbing bitch.'""

""My heart was racing, my vision blurring with anger, but I felt like I had to win this fight, even if it meant going too far. 'And you know what? Maybe I was just being nice to you all these years because I felt sorry for you. Everyone else saw it, you’re pathetic, Joseph. You’re just too scared to admit it.'""

""There was a tense, deafening silence between us. His shoulders slumped, his face pale as if all the life had drained out of him. When he looked at me, his eyes were hollow, like I’d ripped the last piece of hope from him.""

""He walked away from me, into his room. I stood there for a moment, collecting my thoughts before I, with a huff, stormed out of the apartment.""

""I went to the party, but my mind was elsewhere the entire time. I knew I handled Joseph and I's argument poorly. I needed to apologize.""

""I went back to the apartment to try and smooth things over, but when I opened the door, I found him there, hanging from the curtain rod,"" Misty said, tears freely flowing from her eyes. ""A note protruded from his pocket with only three words written. 'You were right.'""

Misty was openly sobbing, her words only coming out in short, raspy breaths. She looked at me, her heart seemingly torn from her chest. ""The last thing I told him was he was pathetic."" She wheezed. ""I caused this, it's all my fault he died!""

I sat there in stunned silence, not sure what to think or say. My initial reaction was to reach out and hug her. She clung to me like a drowning man does a lifeboat, searching my eyes for hope, for a lifeline.

""It's not your fault. He, obviously, had some demons in his life that he was fighting. You didn't kill him. He did."" My mind was racing as I said the words. In the back of my mind, I did feel as if she had a part to play in the tragedy, but I couldn't vocalize these thoughts. The last thing she needed was a complete stranger to add to her already mounting guilt. As I held her, time stood still. I knew my attempts at consoling the poor woman were futile. She needed time to process, to grieve. After what felt like hours, she broke the hug and stood from her seat.

""You're just saying that to make me feel better,"" She said, sniffling. ""I'm not some stupid child, I don't need you to talk down to me! I'm no better than a murderer!"" A deep, void-like silence permeated the otherwise quiet room.

I struggled to find the words to say, but when nothing came, she said, with a blank, dead-eyed stare, ""I need to use the restroom.""

She walked past me, into the crowd of people that I came to assume all had similar issues they were running from, mistakes they were too afraid to correct. Could I be one of them, I thought, for a fleeting moment, reminding me of the argument my sister and I had before I began this journey?

Of course not, I was in control. I decided to come here to process my emotions and regroup; these people came here as an excuse to run away. My focus now should be to do everything in my power not to fall for the same traps they did.

I made my way back to my seat, deep in thought. Had I said enough? What was the point of saying anything at all? I slumped into the back of my seat with an exhausted sigh. Whether I wanted to be caught up in people's drama or not seemed irrelevant. Maybe that is why I was here, I pondered. Maybe helping others was my purpose. If that's true, however, I don't know if I'm equipped to do that.

As my thoughts raced, I was greeted by Chris, coming to sit with me with a hearty lunch of chili and cornbread, steaming in his bowl.

""You look pretty rough, Newbie. You sleep ok?"" He asked, mouth full.

""I don't know,"" I said dismissively. Part of me wanted to brush him off, but another part needed some form of validation. ""What do you do when there's nothing you can do?"" I asked, turning my eyes to Chris.

""There's always something you can do, Newbie,"" Chris said, shoveling more chili into his mouth. ""Nothing is ever completely out of your control; you just have to decide what steps are available to you."" I pondered what he said for a moment.

""But what if someone doesn't want you to do anything? What if you made things worse? I'm worried for he..."" I trailed off, not wanting to say more than I should.

""Then change your approach. Find out what you did wrong and do something different."" I mulled over what he said, as he chewed loudly, blissfully unaware of the torment Misty and I, by extension, were under.  What the man lacked in decorum, I thought, he made up for it in wisdom.

""Thanks, Chris,"" I said, shutting my eyelids in hopes of a small nap.

""Any time, that's what friends are for.""

**Chapter 8**

**Gone**

A low hum of murmurs pulled me from sleep, voices growing louder until they boiled into an argument. Blinking groggily, I sat up, the dim light outside signaling the sun’s retreat beyond the horizon. My head throbbed, a dull ache from last night’s chaotic emotions and restless dreams.

""Chris,"" I whispered, nudging his shoulder. He stirred, groaning softly, but didn’t wake. His snores continued, heavy and unbothered, while the noise in the room grew.

Reluctantly, I stood, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. As I stretched, I noticed a small gathering of passengers near the back of the bus, their faces etched with concern. Something wasn’t right.

“Excuse me,” I said to a man as I approached the edge of the crowd. “What’s going on?”

The man, his face lined with years of wear, turned to me. “It’s the girl. The one with the black hair.”

“Misty?” My stomach twisted.

“Yeah, her,” he said. “She’s gone to the back.”

My heart dropped. “The staff took her?”

He shook his head, glancing nervously toward the others. “No. She went on her own.”

“What?” The word escaped before I could stop it, my voice cracking with disbelief. “She just… walked back there?”

“That’s what’s got everyone riled up,” he muttered, his hands wringing his hat. “I’ve been on this bus for a long time. Seen folks get sent to the back more times than I can count, but I ain’t never seen nobody choose to go.”

The world around me spun. My mind raced with questions, with dread. Why would Misty go willingly? She had been upset earlier, sure, but…

“Did she say anything?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the lump forming in my throat.

He hesitated, guilt flashing in his eyes. “She sat next to me for a bit before she left. Looked like she wanted to talk, but… I didn’t say nothing. Just kept reading my book.”

“You ignored her?” The words came out harsher than I intended.

“I didn’t know!” he snapped back, his voice trembling. “I didn’t know what she was planning to do. I thought she just needed some space.”

I wanted to yell, to berate him for his cowardice, but the truth was like a stone in my gut; I wasn’t any better. I hadn’t checked on her after our conversation that morning. I’d left her to deal with her pain alone, and now…

A ding-dong chime echoed through the room, silencing the murmurs.

“Attention passengers of Section Two,” came the driver’s disembodied voice, calm yet chilling. “It seems some of you are struggling to follow the rules of this journey. Let me remind you: disruptions will not be tolerated. For those who continue to test boundaries, my staff is fully equipped to handle such matters. For everyone else, relax and enjoy your escape. This is your final warning. Thank you and have a nice day.”

The tension in the room was suffocating. Slowly, the crowd began to disperse, passengers returning to their seats with hushed whispers and anxious glances.

The old man turned to me, his shoulders slumped under an invisible weight. “I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he said softly before shuffling back to his seat, head hung low.

I stood there, frozen. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at the door to the back of the bus. The driver’s warning replayed in my mind, his words heavy with menace.

This isn’t your fight, a voice in my head insisted. She made her choice. You don’t owe her anything.

But another voice, quieter yet more insistent, whispered a different truth: What if it were Mom? What if someone could have saved her and didn’t?

The thought hit me like a punch to the chest. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as the weight of guilt pressed down on me. I clenched my fists, struggling to breathe through the storm of emotions raging inside me.

I glanced back at Chris, who was now awake and watching me. His face was unreadable, his gaze shadowed with something I couldn’t quite place. When our eyes met, he quickly looked away, pulling his blanket tighter around him.

Desperation clawed at my throat. I couldn’t just sit here, couldn’t do nothing. But what could I do? If I went after her, I risked drawing the ire of the driver and the staff. If I stayed, I’d carry the weight of this choice forever.

My chest tightened, the air around me feeling thinner with each passing second. My thoughts spiraled, each one louder and more chaotic than the last. I felt trapped, cornered by my own fears and failures.

But beneath it all, that quiet voice still lingered: What if it were Mom?

**Chapter 9**

**Something Different**

I found my way to a secluded bench seat, my brows furrowed, bloodshot eyes, unblinking. I stared at the door to the back section, watching for any inconsistencies in the staff's movements and the passengers' routines. My temples thumped like a war drum, adrenaline coursing through every fiber of my being.

Every movement was noted in the back of my mind. The elderly passenger nearest to the door was engrossed in the book he told me about, and rarely looked up. The pianist unceasingly played his jazzy tunes, lulling anyone near them to sleep. The door, I noticed, remained starkly unguarded but was damn near impossible to get close to without being seen.

I scanned across the width of the room, noticing Chris chatting with other passengers. It seemed to me that Misty's disappearance had no effect on him, and I rolled my eyes with disgust. ""How could he care so little about someone's life being in danger?"" I thought to myself.

I quickly banished the thought. Chris's uncaring attitude only served to distract me. I refocused and looked at my watch. It was getting close to dinner time. My stomach rumbled furiously. The last thing I had eaten was breakfast this morning, but I couldn't allow it to hinder me.

The staff began rolling out carts of food toward the buffet. The small closet-like door they came from was tucked, almost imperceptibly, into a dark corner of the lounge. My mind reeled at the possibilities. If this were a staff access corridor, it must be connected to nearly every room on the bus. If I could find a way to sneak in, I would be able to move freely throughout the entirety of the vehicle.

""That's a big 'if',"" I muttered under my breath. Staying undetected in a staff-only passageway was all but impossible. I groaned and slouched back in my seat, rubbing my eyes. My stomach rumbled again, refusing to be ignored. I came to realize that being hungry was becoming more of a distraction than taking a few minutes to eat. I stood from my secluded perch and made my way to the buffet, where I bumped into Chris.

""Oh, hey Newbie,"" Chris said, with his signature oblivious smile. ""You ok? You seem a bit out of it.""

""No, Chris, I'm not ok. I just....I got a lot on my mind."" I answered with a sigh.

""I understand if you're all tore up about the whole Maddie thing..."" He started.

""Misty!"" I exclaimed, then lowered my voice. ""Her name was...is Misty, and if I can't help her, who will?""

""Alright, fine, I get it. You're upset about Misty. But being upset isn't going to solve the problem."" He said with a sly wink.

""And doing nothing will?"" My blood was boiling; I knew exactly what to expect from Chris's emotional intelligence, but by some miracle, he still found a way to let me down. ""I finally have a chance to do something meaningful in my life, and you're telling me to just bury my head in the sand? No! I'm not going to sit idly by. I'm not going to run away like you did with Cindy!"" The words tasted like vinegar as they left my mouth. As soon as I said them, I wished I could take them back.

""I'm sorry, Chris. That was low, and I shouldn't have said that. I'm scared. For Misty...for us.""

Chris looked up at me, his eyes filled with empathy. ""It's ok, Newbie, I get it. Eat some food, get some rest,” Chris said, his voice quieter now, almost distant. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe someone needs to do something. Just… don’t burn yourself out, okay?”

He took his food and, without another word, turned and left. With my appetite well and truly gone, I grabbed a double shot of espresso for what I knew would be a long night.

Before heading back to my seclusion, I grabbed my phone from my backpack and opened the notes app. 09:00 pm, the staff cleaned up what was left of dinner. 09:15 The staff took drink orders and handed out cigars. 09:45 The old man, reading, got up to use the restroom. 09:50 The old man returned. On, and on my notes went, meticulously, typing out every movement made.

The next time I glanced at my watch, it was well past midnight. Silence washed over the cabin like a heavy blanket. All were sleeping, all but Chris.

He furiously jotted down on a notepad, his eyes darting from time to time to the door and to me. Once he finished writing, he quickly stuffed the note in my backpack. He took a deep breath and, in a flash, made a beeline toward the door. I was too stunned to react, my mouth dropped open as the whole world seemed to slow to a crawl. Chris reached his destination and fumbled awkwardly at the handle. To his and my utter horror, it didn't budge. Immediately, staff from all over the room swarmed his position. Chris screamed loudly as he rushed the staff, shouting profanities and throwing wild punches. None of them connected as the staff member expertly dodged his blows like a well-trained boxer, bobbing and weaving each sloppy swipe.

They wrestled Chris to the ground in an instant, never attacking him, only deflecting his wild punches and swiftly restraining him. I stood from my seat, every fiber of my being screaming to help him. But I hesitated. If I tried to intervene now, I'd share whatever fate the staff had in mind for him.

His eyes, wild with fear just moments before, were now steeled with defiant determination. The staff lifted him effortlessly, as though they’d done this a hundred times.

“Let me go!” Chris roared, thrashing in their grip. “Fight me like a man, you bastards! I won’t go down without a fight!”

I could only stand there, paralyzed. The other passengers stirred, whispering loudly among themselves.

“There is nothing to see here,” one of the staff members said, gripping Chris by the arm. “Go back to sleep. We will deal with this interruption.”

The door slid open, and they ushered Chris through. He glanced over his shoulder at me, flashing a wry grin and a wink, like this was all part of some grand plan only he understood.

“What just happened?” a woman nearby whispered, her voice shaky with confusion. I hesitated, still reeling from the chaos.

“I... I don’t know,” I muttered, brushing past her. I needed space, needed answers.

I hurried to my backpack, where I’d seen Chris stash the note earlier. After a quick search, I found it, crumpled into a ball. Unfolding it with trembling hands, I read the hastily scrawled words:

Hey Newbie, if you're reading this, my plan worked! I got sent to the back! Or they killed me, and it didn’t work. Either way, what you said stuck with me. I’ve lived my life scared for far too long. I had to do something, or I’d never forgive myself. Once I find Misty, I want off this bus. I think I got what I came for anyway. Thanks for being there for me, Newbie. No matter what happens, I’m glad I met you.

My heart skipped a beat. Had he done this... for me?

Ding Dong.

The PA system crackled to life, the bus driver’s voice slicing through the heavy silence. “Twenty-four hours. You idiots couldn’t behave for twenty-four hours. I asked one simple thing from you all, and this is how you respond?”

His cold, calculated delivery sent chills down my spine.

“It seems I have to make an example out of the fool who caused this. I will not tolerate insubordination on my bus. I decide what happens here. Me. If any of you think you know better, try this stunt again. I dare you.”

The intercom cut off abruptly, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

One by one, the other passengers retreated to their seats. The weight of the driver's threat pressed down on us all, and soon the cabin was eerily quiet, everyone too afraid to speak. I crumpled down in my seat, the weight of all that had happened finally catching up to me. All I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and disappear. But that was off the table.

1lshop0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rctoys/comments/1lshop0/best_portable_generator_need_something/,Best Portable Generator? Need something lightweight and solar ideally.,"I spent the last year testing a stack of popular portable generators, from micro 150 Wh packs you can fit in a daypack to heavyweight 1 kWh+ units that can keep a fridge cold through an overnight outage. Below is a straight, no-sponsor rundown of what actually worked in the field, what flopped, and how to match a power station to the stuff you need to run. Hope it helps anyone searching for the best portable generator before summer trips or hurricane season hits.

I review electric ride-on toys, scooters, and RC gear for a living, so portable power is kind of my side hustle. Over the past twelve months I’ve logged:

* 23 nights of tent or RV camping
* 6 backyard blackout simulations (full house fuse pulled)
* 100+ charge cycles on ten different power stations

Every unit below survived at least three charge-drain cycles under real load—fans, CPAPs, mini fridges, e-scooters, and in one case a coffee grinder because priorities.

# Quick scorecard (capacity, weight, inverter power)

* **Jackery Explorer 240** – 240 Wh – 6.6 lb – 200 W
* **Bluetti AC50** – 500 Wh – 13.6 lb – 300 W
* **EcoFlow DELTA** – 1,260 Wh – 30.9 lb – 1,800 W
* **Flashfish G300** – 300 Wh – 5.6 lb – 200 W
* **BigBlue 250 Wh** – 250 Wh – 5 lb – 250 W

* **Tacklife P50 500 Wh** – 500 Wh – 13.4 lb – 500 W

# How to choose the right size

* **Under 200 Wh (NusGear, Westinghouse)** – Day hikes, phones, cameras, small LEDs. If it weighs more than your water bottle, skip it.
* **200–500 Wh (Jackery 240, Flashfish, BigBlue, Bluetti AC50, Tacklife P50)** – Weekend camping, CPAP machines, tablets, e-bike chargers. Sweet spot for most families.
* **500–1,000 Wh (OMMO 555, Aeiusny 288 in high-draw mode)** – Mini fridges, multiple ride-on cars, projector movie nights, small power tools.
* **1,000 Wh and up (EcoFlow DELTA)** – Whole-day outages, full-size fridge for 8–10 hours, heavy power tool use, full-time RV power buffer.

# Field notes on the standouts

**Jackery Explorer 240**

Still king of “throw it in the trunk and forget about it.” Ran my drone charger, two phones, and camp lights on a three-day trip with 20 % left. Solar Saga 100 panel refilled it in a lazy afternoon.

**Bluetti AC50**

Wireless phone pad on top saved me twice when someone misplaced their cable. Two AC outlets and five USB ports kept three kids’ tablets alive during a rainy weekend.

**EcoFlow DELTA**

Absolute monster. Pulled my fridge plus a box fan for six hours in a planned outage test, then hit 80 % on wall power in sixty-two minutes. Weighed as much as my cooler, but worth it if you live where storms knock lines out.

**Flashfish G300**

Ultralight champ. Five-and-a-half pounds, three AC outlets, quick USB. Perfect for drone days or picnic power.

# Things the spec sheet won’t tell you

* The fan noise on mid-range packs varies a ton. Jackery is whisper-quiet; OMMO’s fan is noticeable when wall-charging at full speed.

* Pure sine matters if you’re charging camera batteries, MacBooks, or CPAPs. All ten listed here passed a voltage ripple test, but off-brand clones on Amazon often don’t.
* Solar input ratings are best-case. Even a “100 W” panel will top out around 70 W on a clear day unless you track the sun.

For most families who just need reliable off-grid juice for phones, lights, and one electric ride-on, the Jackery Explorer 240 remains the easiest recommendation. If you want one box that can rescue a fridge and still be portable, the EcoFlow DELTA costs more but punches way above its weight. Everyone else will find a comfortable middle ground in the Bluetti AC50 or Tacklife P50.

1lshnvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1lshnvt/perfect_comeuppets/,perfect comeuppets,"Okay story time, so at work I had a co-worker. Let's call her AG, she was nice to me at first as most people are. We even went shopping one time, we would talk at changing of shift, and things like that. So at one point both of us were single and we would talk about guys that we were talking to on dating apps. Well there happened to be one guy that we ended up both matching with and she had went on a date with him and was technically kind of dating him but not really. And so when I told her I matched with him and showed her a picture she had told me that she's been dating him. So I said no problem and I ended talking to the guy. Never brought it any further.
 Anyways there was a guy that I would talk to on the phone at work, let's call him JL, I was helping him at his place of business which was similar to mine. We hit it off on the phone and ended up meeting up in person for coffee. So I told AG about JL that I started talking to him and even showed her a picture of him. Me and JL were kind of off and on. Anyways, he was doing a training course that would be 3-6 month, give or take. Because I knew how strenuous that training period was going to be. I told him to focus on that and if he needs help or whatever I'm here and we can talk about actually dating once he's done. 
So during this period of time JL and I talked almost every day, to include sending (spicy) photos, video chats and occasional meeting up in person. 
During this same time AG started causing issues towards me in secret. For example at work I had a drawer that I kept candy in all year long, I mean I was spending $20 to to $40 US dollars on candy a week. So all of my coworkers would be welcome to grab some throughout the day. No one really gave me money to contribute. I did this out of pocket every week for years. So when AG was at work her and another coworker that I wasn't too familiar with at the time because he was new and worked on her shift. Took all the candy out of the drawer and sealed it into individual bags by candy type. Meaning that they had five pieces of candy in each little bag sealed shut, and then on top of that they Left a note on top that said No Candy your gonna get fat. So when I came into work that's what I found about 13 little bags of candy sealed shut so I had to cut open each one and basically I know calling me or anyone that opened the drawer fat. I was kind of pissed at this point because not only did they make me cut open all of that candy but basically they called me fat. And to mess with the candy that I'm spending say $100 a month on give or take and to disrespect me like that. So I emptied out the drawer and took the candy that was left over home with me. And then when all of the co-workers came and asked what happened to it, I told them that someone disrespected the candy and called me fat. It took less than 2 days for everyone to figure out who did it both AG and the other co-worker basically got The wrath of everybody almost on why not to f*** with the candy and they were both told to apologize to me. 
AG sent me a message to call her. And I sent ""If it's about the candy drawer it's A moot point. You guys did that stupid prank or whatever that was and I took it personal. So if you guys don't want candy as your sign said, then no candy. Then Stupid games win stupid prizes. ""
She back texted this, ""Okay, well it wasn't anything toward you. It was directed towards me. The sign that it.. I just didn't take it out when I left.. it's the same thing we say when I want to go to the vending machine. I'm trying to hold myself more accountable and the paper helped when my partner isn't there to say it to me.  Sorry if you took it the wrong way. the candy was bagged to see if it stopped the bugs In the bubble. We had a few different bugs over the weekend. We also threw away the rotting oranges that were moldy, dripping juices, and smelled horrible to see if that helped too. An article I read said those could be the causes..  I was just trying to figure it out.. rather than spraying bug spray since the exterminator won't be there for a while to ask.. I was going to try peppermint oil/ spray but I didn't know if anyone has any allergies to it.  I was just trying to figure something out. "" 
Mind you, the candies came in their own wrappers cuz I bought the fun-sized ones so they were perfectly sealed. At no point of ever having that candy drawer over the years had any bugs gotten into there. To me I took this as she was just making up an excuse after the fact and trying to cover her tracks. But she mainly tried making it sound like it was only her because her coworker got the brunt of the upset since the majority of my co-workers were male and he was a male co-worker. So he heard some very aggressive things in the male locker room. To the extent of don't mess with ""op"".
Anyways, back to the story so that was one of the many stupid things that she kept doing that somehow pointed back towards her. Anyways, so right near the end of right near the end of JL's training. I texted him asking if he's ready to start talking about dating or what else. And he sheeply  said that He's kind of talking to somebody else as well. Well I kind of dropped it cuz he wasn't fully my cup tea anyways. There was a few things wrong with dating him like he would come up with these like random, weird excuses why he couldn't come over like ""he had to stay at his sister's on a cot instead of in a nice queen size bed"" . And the""spicy"" relations were just average nothing over their top. So I said whatever it's fine I don't care. And ended it around end of November kind of December. AG started being even weirder to me which was whatever I figured she was trying to play some girl games which I don't really like girl games so I didn't really care and didn't participate.  But a couple months after I was talking to a different coworker and he started talking about AG dating JL to the point that they were dating before December. And something about that. They started talking on the phone and started dating. Mind you remember I told her his name showed her a picture and told her where he worked saying that I was talking to him. So she can't say she didn't know about him which is kind of what she hinted at when it came up.
Because when this coworker told me about AG and JL he saw the moment of realization on my face of. I just got f***** over and he apologized. He thought I already knew about it. And tried backing out of the conversation because he felt like he f***** up by telling me. So I apologize to him saying it's not his fault that I was right she was playing girl games and that is the lowest amount of girl game you could do. 
Then the next week she magically brought it up in conversation about her and JL dating so I pretended I didn't know anything about til she said something and then she started trying to ask questions about how much me and JL dated and some other stuff. I just basically acted pretty nonchalant about it cuz at that point I had calmed down and I wasn't dating him now anyway, but I also didn't want to give her any other fuel to try and burn me another way. Like I said, I hate girl games and this was the ultimate girl game and a huge level of disrespect. So I was kind of done with her. I ended up changing to a different work building half because of her and half because of somebody else. Shortly after all of this I started dating my now husband, and I told him all of the tea. When we first started dating. Because he would come to the work area to fix things. So I told him specifically if she talks to him either end the conversation or don't talk to her at all because she's probably going to try the same thing with you. 
She did go out of her way a couple times to talk to him and then realize that he wasn't going to indulge her past actual work stuff and so she dropped it. But like I said, I ended up working at a different work building and I had met a mutual coworkers of JL's. And when we were talking about tea he mentioned that during that same time he wasn't just seeing AG and ending things with me, there was another chick at their work building. That JL was known that he was possibly sleeping with. And when me and him were dating, he hadn't mentioned that one of his ex's work there and it would be awkward. Well apparently it wasn't an ex and apparently it wasn't that awkward since he would go out of his way to go do different work duties specifically with her. I kind of just laughed about it because it was perfect Comeuppets. 
But in the end I'm very happy with my husband now, we have a perfect little child, and happy that AG and JL are no longer in my life. Cuz I don't need that drama. ",1,1751742932.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

I haven’t been to their house (by choice) for about a year, but just went there again and need to dump.

Their house is disgusting. MIL is a hoarder who loved the Dollar Tree and tiny chachkies that can’t really be cleaned. FIL is an animal hoarder - while he has 10 acres, the animals (chickens, emus, a pony, outdoor dogs, ducks, parrots, baby possums, other birds) are all right up against the house. Inside there’s three dogs that don’t go outside, just pee and poop on mats that take up the entire “dining room.” There’s a few birds that also litter the floor with excrement. 

The smell is horrendous. I could only make it about 20 minutes before I had to call it quits due to nausea and lightheadedness. All the animal poop from outside is tracked inside on their shoes. The dogs only go on the mat half the time. Even in the parts of the house where animals aren’t allowed, the floor is smeared with urine and feces. 

The state of the animals makes me so emotional. Dogs that never go outside, including a poodle puppy that just wants to run. A tortoise in a 2ftx3ft plastic container with nothing but a water bowl. The air itself isn’t fit for them to be breathing, let alone fit for the humans. 

There’s medication everywhere, loaded guns just chilling, and a random taser on the coffee table. 

It’s their dream for their (hypothetical) future grandkids to visit the farm. MIL says we will never have to have daycare, they can do it all. I know it will be a nuke to them that my kids won’t be allowed in that home. 

I’m just sad for them and the animals to be living that way. I can’t really do anything about it, I’m just sad.",2,1751742891.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

This is tough to write, but I believe in being real — I’m currently in a situation where I’m about to be homeless. I’ve fallen behind on bills and don’t have family or anyone to turn to. But instead of giving up, I’m doing everything I can to work my way out of it.

One of my closest friends (who owns a marketing agency) saw how much I was struggling and offered me a way out. He said if I could help find people who need websites, social media help, or content work — and build up their online presence — I could earn a commission and finally start catching up on my bills.

This is my shot to turn things around. I’m not asking for handouts — I’m just asking for a chance. (I have a job, but it’s not enough to survive on.) I live here in Grand Rapids and I’m ready to help if you or someone you know needs any of the following:
	•	A clean, professional website or online store
	•	Content creation or growth help for IG/TikTok (artists, barbers, etc.)
	•	Branding help for startups, coaches, or small businesses

I don’t charge anything upfront — I only earn through commission. Everything’s professional and handled through my friend’s agency. He’s worked with several businesses here in Grand Rapids and owns a well-known coffee shop too. I can send over portfolio work 

If you’re willing to give me a shot or just want to chat, please feel free to message me. Thank you for reading — it means more than you know.🙏

1lshkb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lshkb1/the_scandal_by_john_grisham/,The Scandal by John Grisham:,"Chapter 1  
  
  Theodore Boone woke up in a foul mood. In fact, he’d gone to bed in a foul mood, and things had not improved during the night. As a few rays of morning sun lit his room, he stared at the ceiling and tried to think of ways to avoid this entire week. Generally, he enjoyed school—his friends, the teachers, most of the classes, debating—but there were times when he just wanted to stay in bed. This was one of those times, the worst week of the year. Beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, and running through Friday, he and every other eighth grader would be stuck at their desks taking a series of dreadful tests.  
  
  Judge knew something was wrong, and at some point had left his spot beside Theo’s bed and assumed his spot on top of the covers. Mrs. Boone frowned on the idea of the dog sleeping in Theo’s bed, but she was downstairs having her quiet time with the morning newspaper and wouldn’t know. Or would she? Occasionally she noticed dog hair on the covers and asked Theo if Judge was sleeping with him. Most of the time Theo said yes, but quickly followed the admission with the question: “What am I supposed to do?” He couldn’t watch the dog while he, Theo, was sound asleep. And, to be honest, Theo didn’t really want the dog in the bed with him. Judge had the irritating habit of stretching himself out smack in the middle of things and expecting Theo to retreat to the edges, where he often came within inches of crashing to the floor and waking up with a sore head. No, Theo preferred that Judge sleep on his little doggy bed down below.  
  
  The truth was, Judge did whatever he wanted to do, and not only in Theo’s room but in every room in the house.  
  
  On days like today, Theo envied his dog. What a life: no school, no homework, no tests, no pressure. He ate whenever he wanted, napped most of the day at the office, and seemed unconcerned about most things. The Boones took care of his needs, and he did anything he wanted.  
  
  Reluctantly, Theo got out of bed, rubbed his dog’s head, said good morning, but not with as much enthusiasm as usual, and went to the bathroom. Last week the orthodontist had readjusted his braces, and his jaws still ached. He grinned at himself in the mirror, took stock of the mouthful of metal that he despised, and tried to find hope in the fact that he might get the braces off just in time to start the ninth grade.  
  
  He stepped into the shower and thought about the ninth grade. High school. He just wasn’t ready for it. He was thirteen and quite content at Strattenburg Middle School, where he liked his teachers, most of them anyway, and was captain of the Debate Team, almost an Eagle Scout and, well, thought of himself as a leader. He was certainly the only kid lawyer in the school, the only kid he knew of who dreamed of being either a big-time trial lawyer or a brilliant young judge. He couldn’t make up his mind. In the ninth grade he would be just another lowly freshman at the bottom of the pile. Freshmen got no respect in high school. Middle school was okay because Theo had found his place, a place that would disappear in a few months. High school was all about football, basketball, cheerleaders, driving, dating, band, theatre, large classes, clothes, shaving, and, well, growing up. He just wasn’t ready for it. Most of his friends wanted to hurry along and grow up, but not Theo.  
  
  He stepped out of the shower and dried off. Judge was watching him and thinking about nothing but breakfast. Such a lucky dog.  
  
  As Theo brushed his teeth, or rather cleaned his braces, he admitted that life was changing. High school was slowly rising on the horizon. One of its most important and unpleasant warning signs was standardized testing, a horrible idea cooked up by some experts far away. Those people had decided that it was important to give the same tests at the same time to every eighth grader in the state so that the folks in charge of Strattenburg Middle School and all the other schools would know how they stacked up. That was one reason for the tests. Another reason, at least in Strattenburg, was to separate the eighth graders into three groups for high school. The smartest would be fast-tracked into an Honors program. The weaker students would be placed on a slower track.And the average kids would be treated normally and allowed to enjoy high school without special treatment.  
  
  Yet another reason for the tests was to measure how well the teachers were doing. If a teacher’s class did really well, he or she would qualify for a bonus. And if the class did poorly, all kinds of bad things might happen to the teacher. He or she might even be fired.  
  
  Needless to say, the entire process of testing, scoring, tracking, and evaluating teachers had become hotly controversial. The students, of course, hated it. Most of the teachers didn’t like it. Almost all parents wanted their kids in the Honors classes, and almost all were disappointed. Those with kids on the “slow track” were mad, even embarrassed.  
  
  And so the debate raged. Mrs. Boone was firmly opposed to the testing, so, of course, Mr. Boone supported it. The family had talked about testing for weeks, over dinner and in the car, and even while watching television. For a month, the eighth-grade teachers had been preparing the students for the tests. “Teaching to the tests,” was the favorite description, which meant no creative teaching was being done and no one was having fun in class.  
  
  Theo was already sick of the tests, and they had not even started.  
  
  He dressed, grabbed his backpack, and went downstairs, Judge at his heels. He said hello to his mother, who, as always, was curled up on the sofa in her robe, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper. Mr. Boone always left early and joined his friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown diner.  
  
  Theo fixed two bowls of Cheerios and put one on the floor for Judge. They almost always ate in silence, but occasionally Mrs. Boone joined them for a chat. She did this when she suspected something was bothering Theo. Today, she entered the kitchen, poured more coffee, and took a seat across from her son. “What’s up today?” she asked.  
  
  “More reviewing, more practicing how to take the tests.”  
  
  “Are you nervous?”  
  
  “Not really. I’m just tired already. I don’t do well on these tests, so I don’t like them.”  
  
  It was true. Theo was almost a straight-A student, with an occasional B in the sciences, but he had never done well on standardized tests. “What if I don’t make the Honors track next year?” he asked.  
  
  “Teddy, you’re going to excel in high school, college, and law school, if you choose to go there. Don’t worry about where they put you in the ninth grade.”  
  
  “Thanks, Mom.” Her words felt good in spite of the fact that she called him “Teddy,” a little nickname that, thankfully, only she used, and only when they were alone.  
  
  Theo had friends whose parents were turning flips and losing sleep over the tests. If their kids didn’t make Honors, the parents were convinced their kids were headed for miserable lives. The whole thing seemed silly to Theo.  
  
  She said, “I suppose you know that there is a backlash across the country against these tests. They are becoming very unpopular, and there appears to be widespread cheating.”  
  
  “How do you cheat on a standardized test?”  
  
  “I’m not sure, but I’ve read about some of the cheating. In one district the teachers changed answers. Hard to believe, isn’t it?”  
  
  “Why would a teacher do that?”  
  
  “Well, in that case, the school was not very good and on probation with the district. Plus, the teachers wanted to qualify for a bonus. None of it makes any sense.”  
  
  “I think I’m getting sick. Do I look pale?”  
  
  “No, Teddy. You look perfectly healthy.”  
  
  It was eight o’clock, time to move. Theo rinsed both bowls and left them in the sink, same as always. He kissed his mom on the cheek and said, “I’m off.”  
  
  “Do you have lunch money?” she asked, the same question five days a week.  
  
  “Always.”  
  
  “And your homework is complete?”  
  
\>   “It’s perfect, Mom.”  
  
  “And I’ll see you when?”  
  
  “I’ll stop by the office after school.” Theo stopped by the office every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked.  
  
  “Be careful,” she said. “And remember to smile.”  
  
  “I’m smiling, Mom.”  
  
  “Love you, Teddy.”  
  
  “Love you back.”  
  
  Theo stepped outside and said good-bye to Judge, who would ride in the car with Mrs. Boone to the office where he would spend his day sleeping and eating and worrying about nothing. Theo jumped on his bike and sped away, once again wishing he could be a dog for the next four days.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  At 8:40 the bell rang and Mr. Mount called his troops to order. Usually, on Mondays, they were fairly rowdy and gabbing nonstop over whatever happened during the weekend. Today, though, they were more subdued. The truth was that everyone in the eighth grade, from the kids to the teachers to the administrators, maybe even the secretaries and janitors, was dreading the week to come.  
  
  Woody raised his hand and said, “Say, Mr. Mount, I have an idea. Since I don’t want to be on the Honors track, and since I’m far too smart for the slow track, why can’t I just take a pass and be normal and skip all these tests?”  
  
  Mr. Mount smiled and said, “Because the school says you have to take the tests. It’s one way of making sure our school is doing well.”  
  
  “Our school is in the top ten percent in the state, or at least that’s what we’re told all the time around here,” Woody replied. “Of course we’re doing well. We have great teachers, brilliant students, the works.”  
  
  “Sorry. Look, guys, I’m not crazy about these tests myself, but I’m not making the rules.”  
  
  Woody was on a roll. “Okay, but just look around the room. We know that Chase and Joey and Aaron and maybe Theo will score high and make Honors. We also know that the slow ones—Justin and Darren and, of course, Edward—will end up in the slow group. Why can’t the rest of us just admit that we’re normal and skip the tests?”  
  
  Amid the hissing, Edward said, “Speak for yourself, you idiot.”  
  
  “My IQ is much higher than yours,” Darren shot from across the room.  
  
  “You almost flunked phys ed,” Justin yelled from the back.  
  
  “Okay, okay,” Mr. Mount said, holding up both hands. “That’s enough for now.”  
  
  “I think I’m going to puke,” Woody said. “I’m really getting sick.”  
  
  “Knock it off. First period will be with Ms. Garman to review math. Next will be language arts with Ms. Eberlee, then a fifteen-minute break. I know you guys are excited. Let’s go.”  
  
  They moaned and groaned and trudged out of the room, as if headed for a firing squad.  
  
  After three hours of torture, the students were especially happy to gather in the cafeteria for a thirty-minute lunch break. Theo wanted to get away from the boys and happened to see April Finnemore sitting alone. He took his tray of spaghetti and salad and eased into the chair next to her. “Having any fun?” he asked.  
  
  “Hello, Theo,” she said quietly. They were close friends, nothing romantic or anything like that, though Woody and the others often teased Theo about his weird girlfriend. April was different, not weird. She was serious, often moody, and often misunderstood by her classmates. She dressed more like a boy than a girl, wore her hair very short, and had no interest in fashion and teen gossip and social media and all the other stuff she deemed trivial. She loved art and wanted to be a painter, in Paris or Santa Fe, somewhere far from home because home was not a happy place. Her parents were nuts. Her older brother and sister had already fled. She was often alone and left to fend for herself.  
  
  Theo was about the only kid in the eighth grade who tried to understand her. “Are you as bored as I am?” he asked.  
  
  “Totally. I can’t wait until Friday afternoon and these tests are behind us.”  
  
  “Are you nervous?” he asked as he shoveled in a load of spaghetti.  
  
  “Yes, very. I have to make the Honors track, Theo, because it offers more art programs. I don’t care about anything else. The art classes are small, and the best teachers are in Honors.” She spoke softly as she pushed some salad around her plate. She had the appetite of a bird. She hadn’t touched her roll, and Theo had his eye on it.  
  
  “You’ll do fine, April. You could make straight A’s if you wanted to.” She didn’t, because neither parent pushed her at home. She was absent more than any other student, and when she was in class she was often unprepared. She made perfect grades in French and Spanish but was uninterested in everything else. Except art.  
  
  “How are things at home?” he asked, glancing around. It was a loaded question because the answer could be anything. The Finnemores lived in a rental house in a lesser part of town, and April kept her other friends away from the house. But Theo understood.  
  
  “Okay, I guess. About the same. I just stay in my room, do art, and read books.”  
  
  “I’m glad things are okay.”  
  
  “Thanks, Theo. You’re going to do fine on the tests.”  
  
  “I don’t really care.”  
  
  “Yes, you do. You’re a good student and you’re competitive. You want to be at the top of every class, including law school. Don’t tell me you don’t care.”  
  
  “Okay, maybe a little. But law school seems like a long way off.”  
  
  “It is. Let’s get through high school first.”  
  
  “Deal.”  
  
  A boy named Pete approached them from the other side of the cafeteria and looked as if he wanted to say something. He was an eighth grader from another section, a kid Theo hardly knew. His hands were empty; he had no lunch tray, no brown bag. Slowly, he sat down and glanced nervously at April, then at Theo. “Hi, Pete,” Theo said.  
  
  “Can I talk to you?” he said timidly, as if April had suddenly vanished.  
  
  “Uh, sure. What’s up?”  
  
  “Can we talk, just the two of us?”  
  
  “Just finishing up here,” April said as she grabbed her tray and stood. “See you later, Theo.”  
  
  “Sorry,” Pete said after she was gone. “I didn’t mean to interrupt.”  
  
  Well, you sure did a fine job of it, Theo thought, but said nothing. The kid had a bruise on his cheek and looked frightened. “Can we go outside?” he asked.  
  
  “Have you eaten?” Theo asked.  
  
  He nodded slightly, as if he wasn’t sure. “Yes.”  
  
  Theo stuffed his mouth with as much spaghetti as possible and took his tray to the counter. They stepped outside onto the playground and walked around the edge, far from the other kids. They walked and walked and Pete seemed unable to speak, so Theo finally broke the ice with, “What happened to your cheek?”  
  
  “You know all about lawyers and stuff, right?”  
  
  “I guess. Both of my parents are lawyers. I’ve sort of absorbed a lot. What’s going on?”  
  
  “My dad drinks a lot, does some drugs. He came home late Saturday night drunk, and he and my mom got into a big fight. He smacked her around, busted a lip, there was some blood. I’m the oldest kid, two younger sisters, and I tried to help my mom. He slapped me a few times. My sister Sharon, she’s ten, called 911 and the police came. They arrested my dad and took him away. It was terrible, just terrible. He’s in jail, and now my mom, and me and my sisters, too, are really afraid of what will happen when he gets out.”  
  
  Theo listened carefully as they continued walking. “Has this happened before?”  
  
  “Yes, but he’s never hit me. A few months back, my mom threatened to call the police and he settled down. He said he would kill her if she ever told anyone. But if she tells the police now, then he’ll just go to jail and lose his job. We don’t have much money, Theo. My mom works two part-time jobs, and, well, I guess we’re just in big trouble. What’s my mom supposed to do? Keep it quiet and keep getting beat up until he kills her, or tell the police everything and put him away in jail? We don’t know what to do, Theo.”  
  
  Theo was only thirteen.  
These questions would stump any adult. “He’s still in jail?”  
  
  “Yes. He called the house last night from jail and said he would get out today. My mom is scared to death. So am I.”  
  
  “Does your mom know a lawyer?”  
  
  Pete grunted. What a ridiculous question. “We can’t afford a lawyer, Theo. That’s why I’m talking to you.”  
  
  “I’m not a lawyer, and I can’t give legal advice.”  
  
  “I know that. But what should we do?”  
  
  Theo wasn’t sure what to do, but he had to do something. If he did nothing, Pete’s mother and maybe Pete himself could be in real danger. Theo said, “My mother will know what to do. She’s the best divorce lawyer in town, and she’s not afraid of anything. Can you and your mom come to our office this afternoon?”  
  
  “I don’t know. I’m not sure my mom will do that because if my dad finds out she’s talking to a lawyer he might go crazy again. She’s trapped, Theo. My mom is trapped and doesn’t know where to go or what to do.”  
  
  Theo stopped and put a hand on Pete’s shoulder. “Here’s the deal, Pete. I’m not sure what to do and you’re not sure what to do, but we’re just kids, right? My mother deals with this stuff all the time, and she’ll give your mom the best advice possible. She will know exactly what to do. Trust me, and trust her. I’ll give you the address of our office, and I’ll talk to my mother. I’ll meet you there this afternoon, and things will start to get better. I promise.”  
  
  Pete’s lip quivered and his eyes were moist. “Thanks, Theo,” he managed to say before his voice choked up.  
  
  An hour later, Theo was suffering through a review of basic biology when his mind drifted back to his conversation with Pete. The poor kid was living a nightmare, afraid of getting punched by his brute of a father and afraid for his mother’s life. How was a kid like Pete supposed to sit through four days of testing, concentrate on the exams, and score well enough to get properly placed on the right track for high school? And that placement could well determine his future. It made little sense, at least to Theo.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  When the last bell rang, Theo grabbed his backpack and fled the school. He jumped on his bike and raced away. Ten minutes later he slid to a stop in front of Boone & Boone, a two-story office in what was once a family residence on Park Street. He pushed his bike up the front sidewalk and parked it on the porch. He took a deep breath and walked inside, where he was immediately assaulted by Elsa, the law firm’s ancient secretary and receptionist. She also considered herself to be Theo’s second mother. When she saw him she gushed, “Well, hello, Theo!” and jumped from her chair to grab him. She hugged him tightly, then pushed back, looked at his attire, and said, “Didn’t you wear that shirt last Friday?”  
  
  “I did not.” He found it so irritating to be examined daily by Elsa. He was thirteen; he didn’t care what he wore. Why should she?  
  
  “How was your day?” she said, pinching a cheek.  
  
  “Awful. Just awful. And it only gets worse tomorrow.”  
  
  “Now, Theo, just think of all the unlucky kids around the world who don’t have nice schools and good teachers and healthy lunches. You should always count your blessings and—”  
  
  “I know, I know,” Theo said, stepping back. He got so tired of these little lectures. “What’s in the kitchen?” He was always starving by three o’clock in the afternoon, and there was always something to snack on in the firm’s kitchen. Judge finally got up from his bed under Elsa’s desk, one of his many resting places throughout the offices, and walked over to say hello. Theo rubbed his head. What a life.  
  
  “I think Dorothy brought some brownies,” Elsa said.  
  
  “Not those little peanut butter things. They taste like cardboard.” Not even Judge would touch Dorothy’s brownies.  
  
  “Now, Theo,” Elsa said, already losing interest and eager to get back to work. Elsa was skinny and had no appetite, and she liked to show off her thinness by wearing all manner of tight pants and sweaters. Mrs. Boone said that Elsa wore things that only she could get by with because she was at least seventy years old.  
  
  “Is my mother in?” he asked.  
  
  “Yes, but she’s with a client.”  
  
  “I need to book an appointment with her.”  
  
  “Theo, you don’t have to make an appointment to see your mother.”  
  
  “It’s not for me, Elsa, but for a friend. I’m not getting a divorce yet.”  
  
  Elsa glanced at a large calendar in the center of her desk. It was her daily planner, a terribly important sheet of paper because it kept track of everything from meetings with clients and court appointments to vacations and Theo’s visits to the orthodontist. “She’s free at four thirty.”  
  
  “Thanks,” Theo said. “If a guy named Pete Holland calls, let me talk to him.”  
  
  Theo bounded up the stairs to the second floor, the domain of his father. As usual, Mr. Boone was sitting behind his large cluttered desk, pipe in his mouth, tie pulled loose, with the look of a man who’d been plowing through paperwork for days. He smiled and said, “Hello, Theo, a good day at school?”  
  
  Theo fell into a chair and Judge sat beside him. “Just awful, Dad, terrible. I’m sick of school.”  
Well, dropping out is not an option. I suggest you stop the whining and get tough. These tests are important, and you need to do well.”  
  
  Thanks for nothing, Dad. They talked for a few minutes until the phone rang. Mr. Boone reached for it and said, “Now shove off and go do your homework.”  
  
  Perhaps the only good thing about the week was that there would be no homework. Theo went downstairs, rummaged through the refrigerator, found nothing but some stale doughnuts, and eventually wandered back to his small office where he killed some time. Bored, he was soon sleepy, so he put his feet on his desk, kicked back in his chair, and was about to doze off when his mother tapped on his door and stepped in.  
  
  “Hello, Theo. Elsa said you needed to see me.”  
  
  “Sure, Mom. There’s a kid at school who needs your help.”  
  
  “What’s the problem?”  
  
  “It’s a long story, but the kid and his mother might be in danger.”  
  
  “Let’s go to my office and talk.”  
  
  It was almost five p.m. when Pete Holland arrived with his mother and two younger sisters. The little girls were wide-eyed and seemed too frightened to speak. Pete, at thirteen, was trying to be the man of the family, but he, too, was overwhelmed. His mother, Carrie, had a swollen eye and a cut on her upper lip. She looked like she had been crying for hours and began again as soon as Mrs. Boone introduced herself and said she could help. She led Carrie into her office and closed the door. Theo pointed to the conference room and said, “Let’s wait in there.” Pete and his sisters followed Theo while Elsa hurried to the kitchen. She returned with the same stale doughnuts and some soft drinks. Even Judge seemed concerned and allowed the girls to rub his head.  
  
  Pete said, “My dad got out of jail this afternoon and he’s looking for us. My mom’s really scared and doesn’t know what to do.”  
  
  Sharon, the ten-year-old, finally spoke and said, “Mom says we can’t go home.” Sally, the seven-year-old, chewed on a doughnut and looked at Theo as if he had two heads.  
  
  “What are we going to do?” Sharon asked, as if Theo had all the answers.  
  
  Elsa, who had been through similar dramas, said, “Mrs. Boone will know what to do. Right now, let’s just have a chat and talk about school. Did you bring your backpacks? Maybe we could do some homework.” They shook their heads. No backpacks.  
  
  Since it was Monday, Theo called his uncle Ike and said he couldn’t make their usual Monday meeting. He promised to stop by later in the week.  
  
  Mr. Boone stopped by to say good-bye and quickly realized that perhaps he should hang around for a while. He took off his coat, sat at the table, and began convincing Sally that she should chat with him. In spite of the law firm’s efforts to comfort the children, the mood was still awkward, even tense. Their mother was talking to a lawyer, and their lives were unsettled.  
  
  After an hour, the door to Mrs. Boone’s office opened. She and Mrs. Holland walked out and entered the conference room. Mr. Boone introduced himself properly; Mrs. Holland was too upset to say much. Her eyes were wet, and she dabbed them with a tissue. Mrs. Boone looked at Elsa and Mr. Boone and said, “Mr. Holland posted bond this afternoon and was released from jail around two. He’s charged with assault and has a court date next week. He’s been calling Mrs. Holland nonstop and leaving some messages that are threatening. It appears as though he’s driving around town, searching for his family.”  
  
  Mrs. Holland interrupted with, “And he’s drinking, I can tell.”  
  
  Mrs. Boone nodded and continued, “I’ve talked to the police, and they are looking for him. I have advised Mrs. Holland not to go home tonight and she agrees. There is a friend or two the family could possibly stay with, but her husband would probably find them. I’ve called the shelter and there’s no available space, at least not for tonight.”  
  
  “So we have to hide?” Pete asked.  
  
  “We’re hiding now,” his mother said.  
  
  “I just want to go home,” Sharon said, and began crying.  
  
  “We can’t go home,” Pete said sharply.  
  
  “What’s the plan?” Mr. Boone asked.  
  
  “I think we should go to our house and have a pizza party,” Mrs. Boone replied. “We’ll watch television and see what happens.”  
  
  “Great idea,” Mr. Boone said.  
  
  “I’ll get the pizza,” Elsa said, jumping to her feet.  
  
  Sally looked at Mr. Boone and managed to smile.  
  
  Two hours later, the Boones’ den was covered with quilts, pillows, and kids. The pizza was long gone. Sally huddled with her mother on the sofa while Pete, Sharon, Theo, Elsa, and Judge were sprawled about the floor, all watching reruns of Everybody Loves Raymond. Mr. Boone was in his study reading a book, and Mrs. Boone eased from room to room, occasionally talking quietly on the phone in the kitchen. Theo met her there and whispered, “What’s going on, Mom?”  
  
  She whispered back, “The police have not been able to find Mr. Holland. They can’t go home tonight; it’s just too dangerous. He’s probably drinking, probably drunk by now, and who knows what will happen. They’ll have to stay here tonight.”  
  
  Theo understood and didn’t mind protecting the family. “But what about tomorrow?”  
  
  “Mrs. Holland’s parents live about four hours from here. That might be an option, maybe for a few days. The police will eventually find Mr. Holland and arrest him again for making threats. I’ll probably go to court and ask the judge for a protective order. As of now, she says she wants to file for a divorce and get him out of the house, but that might not be so easy. I don’t know, Theo, we’ll just have to wait and see. Things could change by the hour. The important thing is to keep them safe.”  
  
  “She’s crazy if she doesn’t get a divorce.”  
  
  “It’s never that easy, Theo, believe me. A lot of women put up with abuse because they think they have to. They can’t afford to live without their husband and his job. I see this all the time.”  
  
  “I’m not going to be a divorce lawyer.”  
  
  “Let’s talk about that later, okay?”  
  
  “Sure, Mom, and thanks for doing this. I feel like I’m responsible.”  
  
  “You did the right thing, Theo. Lawyers have to get involved in unpleasant cases to help people. Who else could help at this point?”  
  
  “The police.”  
  
  “And they’re trying. You guys can sleep in the den and watch TV until late. Let’s try and make it fun.”  
  
  “Does this mean I can skip school tomorrow?”  
  
  “It does not.”  
  
  Chapter 4  
  
  When Judge began growling at 2:14 a.m., he was standing near Theo’s head and staring at the front door less than twenty feet away. Theo woke up and knew something was wrong. He crawled to a window and saw a pickup truck parked at the curb by the mailbox. Then he saw a shadow move near the front steps.  
  
  “What is it, Theo?” Mrs. Holland whispered. She was on the sofa, wrapped up in a quilt with Sally. It was no surprise she had not been sleeping.  
  
  “Someone’s out there,” Theo said. He scampered to the foyer and turned on the outside lights. A split second later, a loud boom rattled the front door, again and again. A very angry man was yelling and banging with his fists. Judge began barking loudly as everybody in the house panicked and bolted upright. Mr. Boone yelled, “Call the police!” and Mrs. Boone went for the phone.  
  
  “Open up!” the man yelled as he banged away. “I know you’re in there, Carrie!”  
  
  “It’s Randy,” Mrs. Holland said. “Good old Randy. Drunk as a skunk.”  
  
  “Take the kids to the kitchen,” Mr. Boone said. He walked to the door and said, “We’re calling the police, Mr. Holland.”  
  
  “Open the door! I have the right to see my wife and kids.”  
  
  “They don’t want to see you right now. Please stop banging or you’ll wake up the neighbors.”  
  
  “Don’t really care. I want my family!”  
  
  “Why don’t you leave, and we’ll sit down tomorrow and discuss everything? There’s nothing to be gained by causing a bi  
g scene in the middle of the night.”  
  
  Judge was barking like an idiot but not advancing on the door. Mr. Boone growled, “Shut up, Judge. Theo, get the dog!”  
  
  “The police are right around the corner,” Mrs. Boone said softly as she stepped in from the kitchen. “Keep talking to him.”  
  
  Mr. Boone cracked the door but left the chain hooked. He looked at Randy through the glass of a metal storm door. When Randy saw the crack, he began banging away again. “Open the door! I want my wife and kids!”  
  
  “Please settle down, Mr. Holland,” Mr. Boone said. From across the street, the lights of the Ferguson home came on. Suddenly, Randy picked up a large rock from the flower bed and crashed it through the glass of the storm door. Mr. Boone managed to slam the wooden door just as everything shattered. Judge bravely retreated to a safe spot behind the sofa, whimpering. In the kitchen, Sally and Sharon were crying as Pete tried to console them.  
  
  “He’s crazy,” Mr. Boone said in shock.  
  
  “I told you so,” Carrie said from the kitchen doorway. “Crazy and drunk.”  
  
  “What a cheap door!” Randy yelled, and he began laughing. Theo was hiding behind a chair and peeking through the blinds. The man was indeed frightening. He was thick and burly, with a beard, and long hair sticking out from under a cap. He was weaving and staggering, obviously intoxicated. He took a step back and bellowed, “You think you’re so smart, don’t you, Carrie? Well, you’re pretty stupid. I found you by tracking your cell phone. Pretty stupid.” He almost fell off the stoop but caught himself on an iron railing.  
  
  Mr. Boone cracked the door about an inch and calmly said, “Mr. Holland, I’ve called the police and they are on the way. Now would you please settle down?”  
  
  “I don’t care who you call,” he yelled. “Call the cops, call the sheriff, call the FBI, hell, call the Marines for all I care. I just want to see my family.”  
  
  Calmly, Mr. Boone said, “Well, they don’t want to see you, and you’re headed back to jail if you don’t leave.”  
  
  “I ain’t leaving, okay, mister? Not without my wife and kids. You have no right to keep them in there.”  
  
  More lights from across the street. Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson were standing on the front porch in their pajamas. Randy tried to pick up another rock from the flower bed but lost his balance and fell into some shrubs. As he scrambled to get up, mumbling and cursing and wiping off dirt, he noticed the Fergusons watching him. This upset him, so he yelled, “Why don’t you folks just mind your own business?”  
  
  The Fergusons said nothing.  
  
  Randy pointed at them and yelled, “Bunch of nosy people in this neighborhood, that’s what I think. I might just come over there and throw a rock through your door. How would you like that?” But as he walked across the Boones’ front lawn, he lost his balance again, then tripped over his own feet. Down he went, tumbling and clawing to get up.  
  
  Thankfully, blue lights appeared at the end of the street.  
  
  Randy Holland surrendered without a fight, and when the policemen slapped on the handcuffs and led him to the patrol car, his family was watching from the front window, and all four were in tears.  
  
  With her husband back in jail, Mrs. Holland decided to return home and put the kids to bed. She thanked the Boones repeatedly, as did Pete and Sharon, and they left around 3:30. As Theo was helping his parents straighten up the den, he said, “Gosh, there’s no way I can go to school tomorrow. I’m already exhausted.”  
  
  To which his mother said sternly, “Then I suggest you get upstairs right now and go to sleep.”  
  
  “And take your dog with you,” Mr. Boone said. “What a great guard dog.”  
  
  “But what about school?”  
  
  “You can sleep until seven thirty,” Mrs. Boone said.  
  
  “Wow. Thanks. You guys are really sympathetic.”  
  
  “Knock it off,” Mr. Boone said. “I’m tired of the whining.”  
  
  Chapter 5  
  
  The mood in the auditorium was somber early Tuesday morning as the entire eighth grade filed in. Ten perfect rows of seventeen desks each covered the floor, with four odd ones along the back wall. Each homeroom adviser showed his or her students to their places. Mr. Mount’s gang was in row two, and they sat in alphabetical order. Theo was third from the front, with Ricardo Alvarez and Edward Benton in front of him. To his right was a girl named Tess Carver; to his left was a girl whose first name was Lellie. He didn’t know her last name. There were 174 in all, and Theo knew most of them, but it was impossible to know everyone, especially the girls. The school was in its third year of an experiment that separated the eighth-grade boys and girls.  
  
  Theo nodded at Pete, who was four rows over and half the way back. He wondered if Pete was as tired as he was. Probably so. What a night. He himself was still rattled by what had happened. He couldn’t imagine the confused state of mind Pete was in.  
  
  The principal, Mrs. Gladwell, made a few opening remarks, boring standard stuff about trying to relax and trying to work efficiently. They would be on the clock, and it was important to finish each section, and so on. This had already been covered more than once. The tests would last for three hours, with only two short breaks, then lunch. They would then spend three hours each afternoon prepping for the next day’s tests. Friday afternoon seemed like a year away.  
  
  The teachers passed out the exams as quickly as possible. Theo had a knot in his stomach as he took his. When every student had an exam, Mr. Mount, the head proctor for the day, told them to begin. As the students began, their teachers fanned out through the auditorium in a display of force. The message was clear: Keep your eyes on your own exam.  
  
  The room was silent. The agony had begun.  
  
  During the lunch break, Theo ate hurriedly and went to find Pete. They walked the same path as the day before, along the edge of the playground and away from anyone else. Pete said he couldn’t go back to sleep after he got home, and he was too tired to think. He was blowing the exam and didn’t care. His mother had talked to the police, and they had assured her Mr. Holland would remain in jail for a few days, so at least they would be safe. “What’s a felony?” Pete asked.  
  
  “It’s a more serious crime. Misdemeanors are small crimes. Felonies are not. Why?”  
  
  “The police said he’s charged with a third-class felony called malicious destruction of property. I guess that means a lot of jail time, right?”  
  
  “Probably, but I doubt if he’ll get a long prison sentence. Just a few weeks in the county jail. Who knows?”  
  
  A divorce, a jail sentence, the loss of a job; it was a lot for a kid to comprehend. “Thanks for last night, Theo.”  
  
  “It was nothing.”  
  
  “My mom is supposed to see your mom this afternoon, I guess to talk about the divorce. I can’t believe this.”  
  
  “My mom is very good at finding ways to avoid divorce, Pete. She almost always gets the couple to agree to meet with a marriage counselor. Don’t give up yet.”  
  
  “Thanks, Theo.”  
  
  “And don’t give up on these tests either.”  
  
  “I’d like to run away right now.”  
  
  Me too, Theo wanted to say, but instead he played tough and said, “Can’t do that, Pete. You gotta buckle down and concentrate.”  
  
  “I’ll try.”

She is a very kind and lovely person who is good fun to be around. Ever since my baby was born (her first grandchild) I have felt a strain on our relationship due to her boundary pushing and imposing on me. 

My baby is now 5m old. I see my MIL minimum once a weeks, sometimes twice or three times. She has been so excited about having a grandchild that often I have felt her excitement has taken over her awareness around my feelings. 

Several times now she has directed comments about wanting to use ""her pram"", all whilst making these comments speaking to my baby, instead of me. Prior to the birth of my child she went and bought a pram etc. for when she would help out. However, I do not feel in a position where I want to hand over my baby for days out etc just yet but these comments are making me feel really pressured to do so. I find she is quite imposing, asking to collect my baby and take her to a picnic with her work friends so they can all meet her. I feel like she doesn't consider how I am feeling sometimes and is making these requests for her own benefit. Rather than mine or my baby's (as she doesn't need to meet a group of people who I haven't even met myself). She will often message unexpectedly or call asking to drop things off and will always stay for a coffee. The other day she was due to come round, my baby's started teething and was very unsettled crying hysterically. I called whisky my baby was crying and said that I needed to just get baby home for a bottle and bed. Her reply was ""I'll only pop by for five mins I need to drop something off"". I explained again and she repeated (in a friendly way) ""oh don't worry I'm only popping by"". This infuriated me as I settle my baby upstairs and would be disruptive (going downstairs and opening doors and getting baby back up from being settled). 

I have had issues with my MIL in the past with boundaries (as she doesn't have any) which makes her fun and good company on one hand but also very intrusive in another. 

My partner is very defensive of his family, so even if I say things in a constructive way, it will often cause a disagreement. We have broached this and he has said he will not be defensive but always is. He feels I'm constantly pushing back on my in laws. 

Am I being unreasonable? What can I do? She is a lovely person but has no concept of boundaries whatsoever. I feel I cannot broach this with my partner again. 

Also just to add she will be an amazing grandparent to my baby but I just need to know how to manage her as if she could she would FaceTime every night and visit 3 times a week. I love her but sometimes I do need a social battery to be around her.",11,1751742460.0,inlaws,7,1.0,False

I called her aunty at first but even called her didi and maa couple of times. She was very fun, was very qualified and interested in science and technology just like me.  
We spent a lot of time together talking, eating out, went out for movies etc (together with my mom).  
However a month ago she suddenly blocked us out of nowhere, I was terribly hurt as I am very much attached to her.

We did talk very normally on Insta and Call that to pretty regularly but parallely we were blocked on WhatsApp and she lied out to us. Now a bit of context is my parents were divorced when I was mere 2 years old (my dad had an affair and my step sis is about 2 months younger to me about whom I came to know recently) I literally have no one to call as family after my mom, maybe M was the one.

I sneaked up my mom’s phone and found out a shocking truth, I had 2 elder step-brothers and M was the girlfriend of my eldest brother. (My mom had him when she was 16)

M had lost her mom at a very young age and he had told everyone that her mom’s no more as well however to her he revealed this truth.  
She searched the social media and found out my mom and messaged her and tried her best to made them reconcile, my mom made his favorite food which he hadn’t had for years, however he still holds immense hatred for my mom which I understand.

I knew about them during my childhood but later my memory became very fuzzy, Regarding my mom I had been very upset that she had hid this from me maybe she had made several mistakes but I am really proud of the life she gave me! She raised me single handedly covered all my expenses ad we have been living in rent for past 21 years (my father gave nothing).

My Brother made M block us on WhatsApp and send him an SS and made her promise she will never contact us again, my brother already moved on from her and started dating someone however still made her do this.

We went out for coffee (Me and M) and she told me that I remind her of my step brother and my characteristics and looks match exactly with him. She told she will keep us blocked on whatsapp due to her promise but definitely be in touch.

Cut down to today, she rarely picks up my call and mostly ghosts my text and insta messages. I have endured immense trauma from my childhood and couldn't make much close friends. All this had been too much for me but now and distancing with her had broken me off immensely, now I feel like she always thought of me as her boyfriend's step-brother where I though she thought of me as her own brother.

hi girlies - 

after years of trying, i’ve finally found an effective treatment plan for both my bipolar and adhd. it’s working so well, but everything i’m taking has reduced my appetite to literally 0.

every morning i can force myself to drink a protein shake before my coffee but i’m usually not hungry again until 7-8 at night. even then, i’m just not that hungry. i’ll have some small portions of vegetables, fruit, or cheese and crackers and MAYBE a little steak or chicken. 

there are many days where the protein shake and coffee are all i eat. i tracked what i ate last week and most days i’m averaging 200-500 calories, which is definitely not sustainable long term. 

the only thing that sometimes helps is smoking 🍃, but i still get full very quickly or food just doesn’t sound good still.

any advice would be helpful, i know there’s medications i could go on but i’m not trying to gain weight, and i’ve been focusing on holistic/lifestyle changes unless medication is the only solution. tia!

edit for clarification: i am medicated, not just treating everything holistically. i’m taking lamictal, wellbutrin and ritalin daily, with gabapentin and doxepin as needed. i just prefer holistic *if possible* prior to changing adding meds. ",5,1751742137.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

I have pretty gnarly depression that creeps up and tends to take me down for days, sometimes weeks at a time, and being an avid news reader HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL for my mental wellbeing AT ALL. 

I’m struggling to see any positives in the future currently, BUT that doesn’t mean I don’t want to make something of this group! It’s why I think I need this group, and perhaps others who joined feel the same? 

Im guessing we need community more than ever, but for so many of us, it’s hard to get motivated or have the energy to meet new people.

I have mentioned a blood drive previously, but with the way I keep getting too depressed to function, perhaps I need to aim lower? I’ve read that there’s a botanical garden on the strip, I forget which hotel, and was wondering if some of yall would be down to meet up at the garden, grab a coffee or beverage and hang while perusing the plants? It’s too damn hot for outside stuff(right? Or is it me?), so I’m trying to think of large+cool indoor environments to meet up at since I’m thinking these events will start small and hopefully once we meet, we can come up with bigger, better ideas for future meetups? 

Are weekday afternoons possible for those who are interested? If not, has anyone been to the botanical garden and can say whether meeting on the weekend is doable? Also, I’m very open to suggestions on places to meet and things to do since I’m new here! 

Hoping to meet some of you soon! 

Hope you have a nice weekend🫶🏻",1,1751742081.0,childlesscatpeopleLV,0,1.0,False

At 75, Grandma Rosa moved with the vitality of a woman half her age. One summer afternoon, while helping clean the kitchen, Lena noticed an odd-looking bottle tucked away in the pantry.

""What’s this, Grandma?"" she asked, holding up a murky liquid with a faint apple scent.

Grandma Rosa chuckled. ""That, my dear, is magic in a bottle—apple cider vinegar!""

Lena frowned. ""Vinegar?[ How is that magic?](https://0de09vm7je0l3-7bu3geo8v65j.hop.clickbank.net)""

Grandma poured them both a cup of herbal tea and began sharing the top 10 ways ACV had transformed her health and life.

1. Boosts Digestion & Gut Health ""Remember how I never complain about bloating?"" Grandma said. ""A tablespoon of ACV in water before meals helps my stomach break down food better. It’s all about the probiotics and acetic acid!""

Lena recalled how Grandma never needed antacids, unlike her friends.

1. Supports Weight Loss ""Your cousin Mia started drinking it daily,"" Grandma continued. ""She lost 15 pounds in three months! ACV helps control blood sugar and reduces cravings.""

Lena made a mental note to text Mia later.

1. Lowers Blood Sugar & Fights Diabetes ""After your Grandpa’s diabetes diagnosis, we both took ACV. His blood sugar levels improved, and the doctor reduced his medication!""

Lena was amazed—something so simple could help with such a serious condition?

1. Improves Heart Health ""Cholesterol and blood pressure matter, dear,"" Grandma said. ""Studies say ACV helps lower bad cholesterol. My last check-up? Perfect numbers!""
2. Natural Detox & Liver Support ""Remember when I did that cleanse? ACV helps flush toxins. My skin glows because my liver isn’t overloaded!""

Lena thoughtfully touched her own breakout-prone cheeks.

1. Enhances Skin & Hair Health ""You think I buy expensive creams?"" Grandma laughed. ""I dilute [ACV and use it as a toner](https://0de09vm7je0l3-7bu3geo8v65j.hop.clickbank.net). No wrinkles, no acne! And your Aunt Rita rinses her hair with it for shine.""
2. Fights Infections & Sore Throats ""Instead of running to the doctor for every cold, I gargle ACV with warm water. Kills germs instantly!""

Lena remembered how Grandma rarely got sick, even during flu season.

1. Relieves Acid Reflux & Heartburn ""Your Uncle Joe used to pop antacids like candy. Now? A sip of ACV water fixes his heartburn in minutes.""
2. Boosts Energy & Reduces Fatigue ""That’s why I’m never tired!"" Grandma winked. ""The enzymes and potassium in ACV fight fatigue. Better than coffee!""
3. Natural Household Cleaner ""And it’s not just for health!"" Grandma grabbed the bottle. ""I clean countertops, wash veggies, and even remove stains with ACV. No chemicals!""

Lena’s eyes widened. ""So… it’s like a superhero in a bottle?""

Grandma laughed. ""Exactly! But remember—always dilute it, never drink it straight, and choose raw, unfiltered ACV with ‘the mother’ for maximum benefits.""

That night, Lena mixed a teaspoon of ACV with honey and warm water. As she sipped it, she imagined her future self—healthier, glowing, and full of energy, just like Grandma.

The End.

1lshama,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lshama/existence_by_abbi_glines/,Existence by Abbi Glines:,"Chapter One  
  
  Don’t look at him and he’ll go away. I chanted in my head, as I walked toward my locker. It took an extreme amount of willpower not to glance back over my shoulder. Not only would alerting him I could see him be pointless but it would also be stupid. The halls were already full of students. Although, if he’d followed me inside the school I would have seen him easily enough through the throngs of people. He would stand out just like they always did, unmoving and watching.  
  
  “GAH! Have you seen Leif? I mean honestly can he get any hotter? Oh, yes he can.” Miranda Wouters, my best friend since elementary school, squealed as she grabbed my arm.  
  
  “No, I haven’t seen him. Football camp must’ve agreed with him,” I replied, forcing a smile. I couldn’t care less how hot Leif Montgomery looked. Miranda rolled her eyes and opened the locker beside mine.  
  
  “Honestly, Pagan, I don’t get how you can be so immune to such intense hotness.”  
  
  I managed a genuine laugh and slipped my bag over my shoulder. “Hotness? You didn’t just say hotness.”  
  
  Miranda shrugged, “I’m not an endless well of descriptive words, like you are.”  
  
  I chanced a peek over my shoulder. The halls were full of normal people, living people. They were talking, laughing, and reading over their schedules. It was all very real. I let out a sigh of relief. This was the first day of my senior year. I wanted to enjoy it.  
  
  “So, what class do you have first?” I asked, relaxing for the first time since I’d spotted the dead guy lounging outside on the picnic table staring directly at me.  
  
  “I have Algebra II, blah! I so enjoyed Geometry last year. I hated Algebra my freshman year and I can already feel the negative vibes coming from my textbook.” Miranda’s dramatic flair for life never failed to make me smile.  
  
  “I’ve got English Lit.”  
  
  “Well, we all know you’re loving that. OH, look, look, look, there he is,” Miranda managed to squeal in a hushed tone while nodding her head toward where Leif stood talking to other football players.  
  
  “Hate that I can’t hang around and bask in the presence of greatness with you, but this is my stop.” Miranda glanced back at me, rolled her big brown eyes, and gave me a wave before making her way over to Leif.  
  
  Empty rooms were places I usually avoided at all cost. Given the fact the bell wouldn’t ring for five more minutes, this room would no doubt remain empty for the next four minutes. If I’d stayed out in the hall, I would have been dragged by Miranda over to where Leif stood surrounded by his chosen few. I knew without a doubt he wasn’t interested in talking to Miranda. We’d been going to school with Leif since we were eleven. Since his move from somewhere up north to the coastal town of Breeze, Florida, never had he acknowledged either of us. Not that I minded. He wasn’t my type. I walked over to the desk closest to the window and put my bag down.  
  
  A movement, out of the corner of my eye, caused the hairs on my arms to prickle. I’d known better than to stay in this empty room. But I was here now and running would make it worse. I turned to face the same soul from outside sitting in a chair at the back of the classroom with his feet propped up on the desk in front of him and his arms crossed casually over his chest. How had he known I could see him? I’d given no indication outside. Normally ghosts needed a little clue from me to realize I wasn’t as blind as the rest of the world. Something was different with this one. I dropped my gaze and started to turn around. Maybe I should go join Miranda and the jock squad out in the hall. If I acted like I didn’t see him and casually made my way back into the hallway then he might think he’d made a mistake and float away or walk through a wall or something.  
  
  “You don’t really want to subject yourself to such pointless company do you?” a cold, smooth voice broke the silence.  
  
  I gripped the hard plastic chair beside me so hard that my knuckles turned white. I fought down a startled little cry— almost a scream—in the back of my throat. Should I ignore him? Should I respond? Alerting him that his hunch was right might not end well. But ignoring this was going to be impossible. He could speak. Souls never talked to me. From the time I realized that the strangers who frequently watched me or appeared in my home and wandered the halls were not visible to anyone but me, I’d started ignoring them. Seeing dead people wasn’t a new thing for me but having them talk to me was definitely a new twist.  
  
  “I pegged you with more guts. Are you going to let me down too?” His tone softened. There was a familiar drawl in his voice now.  
  
  “You can speak,” I said looking directly at him, I needed him to know I wasn’t afraid. I’d been dealing with wandering souls, which is what I like to think of them as, all my life. They didn’t frighten me but I liked to ignore them so they would go away. If they ever thought I could see them, they followed me. He continued to watch me with an amused expression on his face. I noticed his crooked grin produced a single dimple. The dimple didn’t seem to fit with his cold, arrogant demeanor. As much as his presence annoyed me, I couldn’t help but admit this soul could only be labeled as ridiculously gorgeous.  
  
  “Yes, I speak. Were you expecting me to be mute?”  
  
  I leaned my hip against the desk. “Yes, as a matter of fact, I was. You’re the first one who has ever spoken to me.”  
  
  A frown creased his forehead. “The first one?”  
  
  He appeared genuinely surprised he wasn’t the first dead person I could see. He was definitely the most unique soul I’d ever seen. Ignoring a sou  
l who could talk was going to be hard. However, I needed to get over his ability and get rid of him. Talking to invisible friends could hinder my social life. I’d end up looking like some crazy chick who talked to herself.  
  
  “Pagan Moore, this must be my lucky day.” At the sound of my name, I spun around to see Wyatt Tucker sauntering into the room.  
  
  I forced a smile as if I hadn’t been speaking to an empty room. “I guess it is.” I tilted my head back to meet his eyes. “You just keep growing, don’t you?”  
  
  “Can’t seem to stop it.” He winked and then slung a long leg over the chair across from mine before sitting down. “What have you been up to this summer? I haven’t seen much of you.”  
  
  I chanced a peek back toward the soul to find an empty chair. A mixture of relief and disappointment washed over me. Wanting to ask him more questions wasn’t exactly a good idea, but I couldn’t help it. I'd asked other souls questions before like, ""Why are you following me?"" or, ""Why can I see you?"" and they always remained mute. Often times they disappeared when I began asking them questions.  
  
  Turning my attention back to Wyatt, I forced a smile before replying, “I stayed up in North Carolina all summer at my Aunt’s horse ranch.”  
  
  Wyatt leaned back in his chair and shook his head. “I just don’t get why people would want to leave all summer when we live on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.”  
  
  For me it hadn’t been a choice really but I didn’t want to explain the reason to Wyatt or anyone else. More students started entering the room, followed by our English Literature teacher, Mr. Brown.  
  
  “Wyatt, what’s up, Slim,” Justin Gregory called out as he made his way toward us. He plopped his bag onto the desk across from Wyatt. For now, Wyatt’s attention was off me thanks to Justin’s interruption. As I turned toward the front of the class, my eyes once again found the soul. Leaning against the wall directly diagonal to my desk, he stood watching me. I glared at him and he seemed to find my obvious dislike entertaining. His dimple appeared and I hated the fact I found it sexy. This wasn’t a human, well not anymore. It took extreme willpower to turn my gaze away from him and focus my attention on the board where Mr. Brown had written our assignment. I’d always ignored these pesky souls before and they’d gone away. I’d just have to get over the fact this one could talk to me. If I didn’t ignore him I’d be stuck with him stalking me.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  “Hate it, I mean, like hate it in a big way,” Miranda grumbled as she dropped her lunch tray down on the table with a loud clank. “If I have to sit through Algebra and Chemistry all morning, you’d think that I at least could’ve a little eye candy in one of my classes. But noooooo! I get Gretchen with her relentless sniffles and Craig with his gas issues.”  
  
  I choked on my sandwich and grabbed my bottle of water to take a quick gulp in order to wash down my food. Once I felt sure I wasn’t going to choke to death, I glanced up at Miranda’s concerned face. “Do you have to say things like that when I’ve got a mouth full of food?” I asked.  
  
  She shrugged. “Sorry, I’m just sayin’ is all. I didn’t mean for you to forget to chew your food.” She reached over and squeezed my arm. “There goes his perfectness now. Do you think he’s going to hook back up with Kendra this year? I mean they really had a bad breakup last year with all the cheating and stuff. Surely he’s going to move on.”  
  
  I took another bite of my sandwich, not wanting to answer her question. I didn’t care who Leif Montgomery hooked up with but, yes, I felt most certain he would hook back up with Kendra. They happen to be the ‘golden couple’. Everyone knew this and expected it. Their type always lived up to their name.  
  
  “Pull your tongue back in your mouth, Miranda. You look like a dog in need of water.” Wyatt sat down across from us, chuckling at his own joke while Miranda scowled at him.  
  
  “I don’t have my tongue hanging out, thank you very much.”  
  
  Wyatt winked at me and shrugged. “Looked like it to me. What do you think, Pagan, was she drooling or what?”  
  
  I crammed another bite into my mouth. I wasn’t getting in the middle of this one. Wyatt started laughing as I pointed to my overstuffed mouth. Miranda elbowed me in the side. “Don’t go taking his side. He’s just mean.”  
  
  With a large gulp of water I washed down my food, and then stared pointedly at Miranda. “You two can hash this out all you want but I’m not getting into this. Ever since you decided to take friendship a step further last year and it came crashing down around you, all ya’ll want to do is take cheap shots at each other. Not my fight. Leave me alone.” I quickly took another bite so I wouldn’t be asked to say anything else. When the two of them realized that they drove each other nuts because they hadn’t gotten over one another, it would make my life easier. Then again, I’d be the one alone. My boyfriend, Jay Potts, had moved away months ago and I hadn’t spoken to him since before I’d left for my Aunt’s this summer.  
  
  “That’s not what this is about! I could care less that he couldn’t keep his tongue out of Katie’s throat when I wasn’t looking,” Miranda said angrily.  
  
  “I didn’t have my tongue down anyone’s throat but yours, Miranda, but you don’t believe me and I’m tired of defending myself.” Wyatt stood and yanked his tray of untouched food up before stalking away.  
  
  “Asshole,” she murmured, watching him relocate to the jock table.  
  
  I hated seeing them like this. The three of us had been friends since third grade. Back then, Wyatt had been all arms and legs. Now, he towered over everyone with his long, muscular body. Miranda hadn’t been immune to his sudden stud qualities last year. Now, she couldn’t stand him.  
  
  “Listen, Miranda, I was thinking, maybe if you two talked about what happened without you accusing him, things might work out.” I’d tried this before and she always ignored me.  
  
  Sure enough, she started shaking her head causing her brown curls to bounce back and forth. “I know what happened, Pagan. I don’t want to talk it out with him. He’s a big, cheating liar.” She took a violent chomp out of her Granny Smith apple and continued glaring in Wyatt’s direction. “Look at him acting like he fits in over at that table. I mean, really, who does he think he is?”  
  
  I followed her gaze. Wyatt sat leaning back in a chair, laughing at something another basketball player was saying. They all seemed pleased to have Wyatt in their presence. Normally he sat with us. This year things would be different. I sighed, wishing I didn’t have to be the one to point out the obvious to Miranda. “He is the only guy in this school who has college scouts coming to his basketball games to watch him play. That’s who he is. Leif may be the big Kahuna on the football field, but I don’t see any college scouts knocking on his door. You can be mad at Wyatt, but he belongs at that table more than anyone else.”  
  
  Miranda turned her glare on me and instantly it transformed into a frown. “Well, he can go to college on a basketball scholarship and cheat on all those cheerleaders, then. I should warn them all.” Her voice had taken on a defeated tone as she stood up and walked toward the garbage cans. I watched her, wishing I could find a way to fix this thing between the two of them.  
  
  Someone sat down beside me in the chair Miranda had just vacated. I turned in my seat, half expecting to see the soul. Imagine my surprise when it wasn’t the unwanted soul but the arrogant jock.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  “Hey, Pagan, Mr. Yorkley said I needed to come talk to you.” Leif’s voice seemed to snap me out of my momentary shock. If Mr. Yorkley sent him, he needed some sort of academic help. However, I wasn’t sure I wanted to help, nor did I intend on making this easy for him. I managed a “so what” expression and waited in silence. Leif cleared his throat and rubbed his hands on the knees of his jeans, as if he were actually nervous.  
  
  “Uh, um, well,” he began, “I mean, that is, I need some help in Speech. It isn’t my thing and Mr. Yorkley said you were the one to talk to about getting some assistance.” He stared straight ahead as he spoke. He hadn’t even glanced over at me. I  
really didn’t like this guy. He finally turned his gaze my direction. I was sure he bestowed this pitifully hopeful expression on females everywhere, in order to get what he wanted. My stomach betrayed me and quivered from the affect his pleading baby blue eyes evoked. I hated that he could make my body react to him at all, other than to hurl of course.  
  
  “This is the first day of school. How can you need help already?” I asked in a voice I hoped sounded annoyed. I wasn’t a simpering idiot who could be moved by a few bats of his long eyelashes, even if my double-crossing body didn’t seem to agree. Surely I was imagining the faint blush on his cheeks.  
  
  “Um, yeah, I know, but I, well, that is Mr. Yorkley and I know I’m going to struggle,” he said a little defensively. Leif had always been a good student. I’d been in a few classes with him.  
  
  “Why do you both think you’ll struggle? Surely, you’re not afraid to speak out loud in class.”  
  
  He shook his head and stared straight ahead again. “No, that’s not it.” I waited but he didn’t say anymore. Interestingly enough, I became intrigued.  
  
  “I don’t really know why you need my help. It’s really simple. You write speeches about the topics assigned and then give them orally. Simple, basic, no fancy strings or hard equations.”  
  
  He turned his gaze back toward me with a sad smile. “It isn’t so easy for me.” He paused and acted like he wanted to say more, and then he shook his head and stood up, “Never mind, forget I asked.” I watched him walk past the table of his admiring fans and head outside through the double doors. I experienced a minute pang of guilt for being so hard on him. He’d come to ask for help and I’d basically just made fun of him. I reached for my tray, angry with myself for acting like a jerk. ‘Jerk’ belonged in his job description, not mine.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  My book bag landed on the kitchen counter with a heavy thump, announcing my return. I headed for the fridge. The fresh squeezed orange juice I’d worked so hard on yesterday sounded good.  
“Pagan, honey, is that you?” My mom’s voice called from down the hall. She was huddled in the corner of her office with a large cup of coffee, typing away on her computer. I didn’t have to see her to know this. My mother is a writer. She lives in stained sweats behind her computer.  
  
  “Yes,” I replied. Before I could pour myself a glass of orange juice, the sound of her slippers flopping against the hardwood floors surprised me. This was a strange occurrence. Rarely did she break away from her writing when I came home from school. It was usually closer to dinner time before she graced me with her presence.  
  
  “Good, I’m glad you came straight home. I need to talk to you and then I have to get dressed.” She motioned to her baggy sweats and large Atlanta Braves t-shirt. “I’m having dinner with Roger but don’t worry, I’m leaving you money to order a pizza.” She pulled a bar stool out and her friendly face turned serious. It wasn’t a good serious, either. This was the kind of serious I recognized but rarely experienced.  
  
  “What?” I asked as I set my glass down.  
  
  Mom’s back became more rigid as she cleared her throat. The “I am disappointed in you” frown turned the corners of her lips down. I quickly racked my brain, trying to think of something I might have done to upset her, but nothing came to mind.  
  
  “I received a call, right in the middle of chapter fifteen, from Mr. Yorkley.”  
  
  Uh oh, she knew about Leif. “Mr. Yorkley?” I asked, pretending I didn’t know what this was about. Mom nodded and tilted her head to the side as if she were studying me to see if she believed I really had no idea why my teacher might call. The head tilt always made me nervous. I braced myself. She was about to let me have it. I’d been a jerk, but in my defense it wasn’t like I did any damage. I’d made fun of the reigning king, not someone with low self-esteem.  
  
  “Apparently, there is a young man who has a learning disability and was told to seek you out for extra tutoring. You did sign up to tutor this year for extra credit. My question is: why, Pagan, would you not help a student at your school who struggles with something as serious as dyslexia? The boy, I’m told, has the opportunity to be given a scholarship on his athletic abilities, but his handicap requires he get extra help in certain classes. He needs someone to help him put the speeches he must write on paper. That doesn’t seem like too much to ask. You did say you wanted to tutor this year. Explain to me why you chose to tell this boy no, and I’m telling you now it had better be good.” She leaned back and crossed her arms over her chest, in her “I’m waiting” stance.  
  
  Leif suffered from dyslexia? Was this a joke? I’d been going to school with him most of my life. Girls, Miranda included, knew everything about him. Heck, Miranda once told me exactly where his birthmark happened to be located.  
  
  Not that I cared. How could Leif Montgomery have dyslexia and no one know it?  
  
  I thought back to Leif asking me for help in the lunchroom today and the way I’d acted. The revelation that Leif dealt with something like dyslexia and still managed to make such good grades bothered me. I wasn’t sure why, exactly, but it did. I liked thinking of him as a jock. Someone who managed to get heaps of good fortune dumped on his head. Now all I could think about was the way he looked today when he’d come to ask me for help. A sick knot settled in the pit of my stomach.  
  
  I glanced up at my mom and shook my head slowly, “I had no idea he had a learning disability. He’s always so cocky and sure of himself. I was surprised he came to me for help and I immediately questioned why he, of all people, would need help.”  
  
  Mom leaned forward on the bar and her frown eased some. “Well, you can make it right. I’ve raised a more compassionate child than that.”  
  
  I nodded and reached for my book bag, “I know and I’m sorry. I’ll fix it.”  
  
  She seemed appeased. “I don’t like getting calls from school about you. Especially not when I’m writing an intense murder scene.”  
  
  I smiled and put my glass into the dishwasher before turning back to her. “Sorry, I’ll try to remember that. Um, so, second date then with this Roger guy?”  
  
  She blushed. “Yes, he and I seem to be able to talk for hours. I love his mind and he has traveled all over the world. My mind is always turning when he talks of places and things I’ve never seen.”  
  
  She shrugged, “You know me, I’m always thinking of a story behind everything.”  
  
  I raised my eyebrows and leaned close to her. “And he’s a hottie.”  
  
  She giggled, which was not a normal sound for my mom to make. “Oh, now that’s not why I like him. It’s his mind and the conversation.”  
  
  I laughed out loud. “Sure it is, Mom, you just keep telling yourself that lie.”  
  
  “Okay fine, he’s rather attractive.”  
  
  “Mom, he’s a hottie and you know it. Granted, he’s an old hottie, but still.”  
  
  “He’s not old. He’s my age.”  
  
  “Exactly.”  
  
  I watched her attempt to appear hurt before she gave in and laughed. “Fine, I’m old. Your money will be on the counter when you’re ready to order some pizza.”  
  
  Staying home by myself wasn’t something I enjoyed. When I’m alone the souls I see wandering aimlessly bother me. Especially since I’d actually chatted with one today. It was easier to remind myself they were harmless when they were mute. Now, I was a little freaked out. Once I closed my bedroom door, I grabbed the cell out of my pocket and called Miranda.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  “Let me see if I’ve got this straight.” Miranda sat on the couch with a piece of pizza in her hand and a soda between her legs, staring at me. “Leif ‘rocking-hot-make-you-melt’ Montgomery asked you to help him in Speech and you turned him down? Are you as insane as I think you are? I mean really, Pagan, I thought the insaneness you so often flash about was just for show and deep down you did have some common sense.”  
  
  I slapped a piece of pizza down on the plate in front of me in frustration. “I’m going to fix it in the morning. It isn’t like I robbed a bank. Stop making a big deal out of it. I know I screwed up. He really needed help and I did sign up to tutor. If I want the extra credit, I have to help those Mr. Yorkley sends my way.”  
  
  Miranda rolled her eyes, “Oh, and heaven forbid he send the hottest male in the county your way! I mean, for crying out loud, what is wrong with you?”  
  
  It was impossible not to find amusement in her drama. Miranda never failed to make you smile at the little things, by making it all a big dramatic scene.  
  
  “I was wrong for not offering to help. I guess my prejudice toward jocks got in the way. But, I’m not helping him because you think he is hot. I’m only helping because he actually needs help and I signed up to help those who need it.”  
  
  Miranda rolled her eyes and froze, holding her pizza in mid-air between the plate and her mouth. “Wait....is he like going to come to your house and stuff? Because, if he is, I want to be here too. He can notice me and realize he’s hopelessly in love with me and then we can date through high school and then after graduation, we can get married and I can have his babies.”  
  
  Soda spewed from my mouth and coated my plate of pizza. “What?” She smiled and shrugged before taking a bite of her soda-free pizza.  
  
  “For starters, you need to finish college before you can even think of getting married and having kids. And NO he won’t be coming over here. Even if he was, I wouldn’t let you come over after such an insane comment. The last thing I want to do is fix my friend up with a guy she’s fantasizing about marrying and having babies with straight out of high school.”  
  
  Miranda sighed in defeat and gave me the pouty frown she was so good at. “You’re no fun, Pagan, no fun at all.”  
  
  I took another piece of pizza from the cardboard box I’d placed on the coffee table. “Really? So, why do you keep me around?” I asked.  
  
  “Because I love you!”  
  
  “Love you too.”  
  
  Miranda stood up. “I hate to leave all the warm coziness of this conversation but I need to go pee.” She jumped up  
off the couch and headed down the hall toward the bathroom. She always held it to the last minute. I kept thinking she would grow out of it as we got older but she hadn’t. When she decided she needed to go to the restroom it was always a mad rush.  
  
  “Interesting friend you have there. She’s really quite entertaining.” The pizza I’d been lifting toward my mouth fell out of my hands and into my lap. I bit back the scream in my throat. He’d startled me but I recognized the deep drawl.  
  
  The talking soul sat on one of my bar stools. Just great. The really sexy, yet creepy-because–he-can-talk dead guy must have followed me home. “Why’re you here?” I demanded quietly, wanting him to just leave me alone and go wander the Earth somewhere else. The intensity of his steady gaze made my pulse jump from nerves, or maybe a better description would be fear.  
  
  “I can’t tell you that. Now isn’t the time. But, I can tell you I’m not going away anytime soon.”  
  
  After a quick peek to see if Miranda was returning, I glanced back at him. “Why? If I ignore you—you soul things—you always go away.”  
  
  He frowned, leaned forward and studied me closely. “What do you mean by ignore you ‘soul things’?”  
  
  Not feeling very safe on the floor looking up at him, I shoved the pizza out of my lap and stood up so I could be eye level with the soul. “You aren’t special. I’ve been seeing ghosts or souls or spirits or whatever you are, all my life. Souls are everywhere. In my house, on the street, in the stores, at others’ houses, I can see them. I just ignore them and they go away.”  
  
  He slowly stood up and took a step toward me. His height was intimidating but his nearness would have had me backing up even if he’d been short. “You can see souls?”  
  
  “I can see you, can’t I?”  
  
  He nodded slowly. “Yes, but I’m different. You’re supposed to see me. It’s easier that way. But the others....you aren’t supposed to see them.”  
  
  The bathroom door opened with a click. I jerked my head around to see Miranda returning with a smile on her face. “Were you talking to yourself just now?”  
  
  I shrugged and forced a smile. “Um, yes.”  
  
  She laughed and sat back down on the couch. I took a steadying breath and then glanced back at the soul who had returned to the same white wicker kitchen stool, watching me. The only way I could finish this conversation and get him to leave would be to send Miranda home. Talking to a soul she couldn’t see wouldn’t go over very well. My ability to see souls wasn’t something I’d shared with her and I didn’t intend to start.  
  
  The soul seemed to be waiting for me to make a decision. The thought of being alone with him frightened me. He might be sexy, but he was dead and he had followed me home. Creepy didn’t begin to describe it. Letting Miranda leave me here wouldn’t be in the plans tonight. I put some distance between the soul and myself by walking over to the couch to sit next to Miranda. “Want to watch Vampire Diaries? I have the last two episodes recorded,” I asked her, hoping the soul got the hint and vanished.  
  
  “OH! Yes, I missed last week.”  
  
  I grabbed the remote, scanned down the recorded shows on my DVR list and clicked play. I needed to get my mind off the dead guy in the room. After at least ten minutes of listening to Miranda swoon over Damon and fuss at Elena, I held my breath and chanced a peek in his direction. The stool where he’d been sitting now sat empty. I let out a sigh of relief.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  All morning, I’d been replaying exactly what I would to say to Leif. I wasn’t sure if I should let him know that I knew about his dyslexia, or if I should just tell him we could start as soon as he was ready and skip the explanation. I also prepared myself for him to tell me he no longer needed my help. If he’d already managed to find another tutor then this whole mess would be over. I wouldn’t be forced to help someone I didn’t really like, but it would be a negative strike against my extra credit. Either way, I lost in this situation. This also wasn’t something I wanted to do with Miranda beside me, batting her eyelashes at him and giggling when he spoke. Timing would be of utmost importance. After Chemistry, I waited in the hallway for him to come out of the only class we shared this semester. Luckily, he walked out alone.  
  
  “Um, Leif, could I talk to you a minute?” I asked as soon as he stepped out of the door. He glanced over at me and an immediate frown creased his forehead. He appeared to be seriously considering walking away and ignoring me when he turned and made his way over to stand in front of me instead. Leaning against the wall, he crossed his arms in front of his chest and waited. I had a feeling he wasn’t going to make this easy for me.  
  
  “About yesterday, I’m sorry I was so rude about helping you. I did sign up to tutor for extra credit and I shouldn’t have treated you the way I did.” I stopped and hesitated, hoping he would say something. He didn’t move or even act as if he was going to respond. I took a deep breath and reminded myself this was my fault. “If you still want me to tutor you, I’d be happy to,” I finished, not really happy, but it sounded like the polite thing to say and his silent stare happened to be making me nervous. He appeared bored and it took extreme self-control not to get mad at him and walk off. Remembering exactly how rude I’d been yesterday helped keep me waiting patiently for his reply. He straightened and stared down the hall over my shoulder as if he wasn’t really considering what I’d said.  
  
  Right when I felt positive he no longer wanted my help, he focused his bored expression on me and asked, “Are you offering because of Mr. Yorkley? Did he make you do this?”  
  
  I thought of my Mom’s words yesterday and wondered. If she hadn’t insisted I ‘make it right’, would I be offering my help now? This popular, talented, worshipped guy trusted me with his secret. I didn’t like him. Heck, I didn’t know him, but for some reason I wanted to help him.  
  
  “I acted the way I did because I just don’t like you very much. I was wrong and, honestly, I don’t even know you well enough to form an opinion of you. I’m offering to help because you need it. That’s what I signed up for and that’s why I’m here now.”  
  
  He seemed to think about what I said for a moment, and then a small smile appeared on his face. “You don’t like me, huh?”  
  
  I stood a little straighter and pulled my books closer to my chest feeling defensive. Surprisingly, it was rather difficult to be the recipient of one of his charming smiles. Especially after I’d just admitted I didn’t like him. Why did he have to be so frustratingly cute? I gave a small shake of my head and he chuckled. “Well, we might have to work on changing your mind.” He slipped his book bag up higher on his shoulder and flashed me one more grin. “I’ll see you later.”  
  
  He walked away, leaving me slightly flustered. I fought the urge to turn around and watch him saunter off. A slow, clapping noise startled me and I spun around to see the talking soul leaning against the lockers with that blasted, crooked grin.  
  
  “Impressive. A female with enough nerve to admit she can be wrong, apologize, and offer to rectify the situation.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and sighed, knowing the hallway wasn’t completely empty so responding wouldn’t be possible. “Go away,” I hissed anyway, before turning to head for the cafeteria.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  I stood in my living room, frustrated over losing control of the situation in my meeting with Leif. I’d gone to the library prepared to set up our scheduled tutoring and I’d even made notes in the handbook Mr. Yorkley gave to all the tutors. I’d gone to the trouble of creating a schedule for Leif to use, making notes of the days and times of our sessions. I wrote out instructions for him on what to bring and how to take notes in class. Everything seemed so cut and dry. Yet, nothing had gone as planned. I hadn’t taken into consideration that studying with Leif last period would be impossible since all football players must report to the field during last period. I also hadn’t thought about his afternoon practices and his evening job at his uncle’s surf shop. The doorbell rang before I could get any more upset over nothing going the way I’d planned. I couldn’t sha  
ke my irritation as I opened the door.  
  
  Leif smiled apologetically, “I’m really sorry about this. I feel bad you’re having to work around my schedule. I know seven is late and, well, I’m sorry.”  
  
  The steam I’d managed to work up all evening as I’d thought about having to work around Leif evaporated. He seemed sincere and a little nervous. This wasn’t the way I expected him to act. Where was his arrogance? Was he always so nice? Surely not. The guy had dated the wicked witch of the southern coast for two years. I stepped back to let him in.  
  
  “That’s okay. Go ahead and sit at the table and I’ll get us something to drink. Do you like root beer?” I asked, walking toward the fridge so I wouldn’t have to look at him.  
  
  “That’s great, thanks.”  
  
  I took my time, getting the sodas out of the fridge and opening them before walking back to the kitchen table. This would be the first time I’d ever really talked to Leif other than the brief conversations yesterday and today.  
  
  “I brought the schedule for class and what all is expected in this course. I have one week before the first speech is due and it needs to be on something I feel strongly about.”  
  
  Okay. I was a tutor. I could do this. He was just another student who needed my help. “So, we need to decide what you’re passionate about.” He chuckled and I glanced up from his syllabus. “What?” I asked, when I saw his amused expression.  
  
  “What I’m passionate about?”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and held up the syllabus. “You know, something you feel strongly about. Like your purpose or platform.”  
  
  He nodded with his amused grin still in place. “Passionate, I like that. Let’s think of something I’m passionate about.”  
  
  This one shouldn’t take him long to figure out. Some football topic or sports related issue had to be swirling around in his head. I reached over to open the notebook. “Got any ideas?” I asked.  
  
  He appeared deep in thought. It surprised me a little. How deep could one get when it came to football? “The importance of adoption.  
 I started to write down his answer as his words slowly sank in. Adoption? He wanted to write about adoption? “Okay,” I replied wondering if he would elaborate on why he wanted to discuss this. I completely agreed with him, but how could Mr. Popular be passionate about something so important?  
  
  He studied the pencil in his hand and flipped it back and forth between his fingers. I could tell he was deciding on how to explain to me why he wanted to write about adoption. So I managed to keep my mouth shut and wait. Finally he glanced up at me. “I was adopted after living in foster homes for five years. I’d given up hope that I would get a family by the time I turned nine because most people want babies. I was given a chance most nine year old foster kids only dream of.”  
  
  If he’d just spoke to me in fluent Chinese I wouldn’t have been more shocked. Adopted? Leif Montgomery? Really? “Oh, wow, I had no idea. I, uh, can see why this would be an important topic for you.” When I’d said I didn’t know Leif Montgomery, I hadn’t realized how accurate my words were. The little boy in a foster home with no parents and a learning disability didn’t seem to fit the guy who walked the halls of Harbor High as the reigning king. The things about Leif I disliked now seemed like impressive accomplishments. Was it possible I’d labeled him incorrectly? Shallow jocks didn’t overcome adversity and accomplish the things Leif had. I’d labeled him, not even knowing him. Just because girls went gaga over him and every boy wanted to be him didn’t make him a jerk. The only jerk in the room happened to be the judgmental, elitist female. Me.  
  
  “You did hear the part where I got adopted, right?” His voice broke into my thoughts and I glanced up at him confused. A grin tugged at his lips. “You look so distraught. I thought maybe you missed the happy ending.”  
  
  “I’m sorry. It’s just, well, I wasn’t expecting that. You kind of surprised me.”  
  
  He leaned back in his chair. “It sure seems to me that you have a lot of ideas where I’m concerned. You sure have put a lot of thought into someone you don’t like very much.”  
  
  My face grew warm and I knew I was turning a brilliant shade of red. “Who knows Pagan, you may like me before this is over.”  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  It took us three consecutive nights of tutoring to get his speech ready. It also only took three nights for me to realize  
  
  really liked Harbor High’s star quarterback. Leif Montgomery was nothing like I’d always assumed. I still felt guilty over the stereotype I’d placed on him. However, just because we were spending two hours together every evening, nothing changed at school. Though Leif smiled and nodded when we passed in the halls, we didn’t carry the easy friendship we seemed to have during tutoring into our daily life at school.  
  
  “K, sooooo, here’s the thing, Wyatt and I have been talking some and he ask me to the Homecoming Dance. And that means you’re going to have to get a date and come too. I know we planned to go to the movies that night but welllll....” Miranda batted her eyelashes at me from across the table.  
  
  “I’m thrilled you and Wyatt are making up. I hated having the two of you mad at each other.”  
  
  “Me too. It sucked, didn’t it?” Wyatt chimed in, as he took the seat beside Miranda. She beamed over at him and I suddenly felt a little left out.  
  
  “And Pagan needs a date to the dance. We can’t go without her.” Miranda said grinning at Wyatt.  
  
  “I am pretty sure Pagan can get a date if she wants one.” He took a bite of his hamburger. I knew he intended to do his best to rein in Miranda’s match-making ideas. I flashed him a grateful smile.  
  
  “There isn’t anyone I really want to go with.” This was a lie and I knew it. I forced myself not to look at Leif’s table because doing so would give me away. Wyatt, however, glanced over at Leif’s table and back at me with a smirk. Thankfully Miranda missed his subtle hint and Wyatt decided not to verbalize his thoughts. Miranda picking up on my interest in Leif was the last thing I needed.

1lsh3ko,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsh3ko,Infinity at Easter: 3 things that almost ruined our first Celebrity family cruise..,"My young family and I took our second ever cruise over the Easter break. I wanted a small ship, with a kids club and a few things for us parents to do (gym, spa etc). Mostly I’m just happy having the sea air, sunshine and space and time to read whilst the kids are enjoying themselves in the club.

We’d only sailed Royal Caribbean so wanted to try something different, and I’d heard good things about the food quality and calm ambience on Celebrtiy. We chose the Infinity - she’s old but small and with a decent amount of deck space. The 10-day Greek islands itinerary meant we’d have a long break and see many places I’d never been to.

We had a great evening in Piraeus - everyone seemed so friendly and the weather was perfect. When we rocked up to the cruise terminal the following morning, my heart sunk as we were handed *the* letter: there had been norovirus on the previous sailing so extra preventative measures were in place. I’m very conscious of the risk of this on ships anyway - I’m a big hand washer and get very grumpy seeing others waltzing into the buffet or out of the toilet without doing so. On the older ships, there are no handwashing troughs pre-buffet, so a mere squirt of hand sanitizer (which doesn’t kill noro!) is all that’s available. I took a deep breath..

Then, we got to our room. I’m a big researcher for these holidays - it’s half the fun for me - so I was totally shocked at the layout of the inside stateroom. When you book, the image you’re given is of a bed, with a sofa(bed) next to it and the porthole beyond that. So a decent amount of space and privacy. I could never find an image of the room made up for 4 passengers. It just didn’t exist on the website. So my best guess was that a Pullman bed would come down over the sofa bed to make the fourth bed up. How wrong I was. You’ll see from the image that both bunks actually folded down over our double bed.  We had no privacy, my 3y/o was in a bunk with almost no barrier (we made one out of various items in the room!), when the kids were ill we were literally rained on (more on that delight below!).

I felt really deceived. I had actually rejected other cruise options for precisely this room design reason (e.g. Cunard inside). I was ready to throw some serious money at the problem but guest services told me the cruise was full, an upgrade or change of room was not going to be possible. So, in the end we just had to make do; and we did. The mattress was comfortable and the sheets were nice. The room was dated, but clean and we didn’t spend much time in it anyway. Lesson learned!

We headed straight to the kids club on boarding and I was.. again.. disappointed to hear that due to a shortage of staff the youngest two age groups would be merged. My 3 & 5 y/os would now be expected to share a space with 8y/os. I was just waiting for the “we don’t want to go to kids club” after their first session. This truly would have ruined the holiday for us. Again, I held my breath.

Meanwhile, the Noro ‘special measures’ seemed to infuriate some guests. Notably at the buffet where not being able to serve oneself was treated as a human rights violation. A few guests were really impatient with the staff and this was a real mood killer: sometimes I just felt like this was the worst of humanity on display. As you’d expect, most guests were age 65+, I was surprised at how many Americans were on board (to “see Europe” hmm). There were some lovely, interesting people - we got chatting to a number of retirees and some younger couples. A lot of crew and officer families too. 

The entertainment was kitschy and fun. The joy for me is that I can take my 4y/o without any pressure - she loved the dancers and music, but we could quietly walk out if she got bored. I’d say it was a cut above RCI’s similar class ship as here they had acrobatic dancers too. The vocal talents were impressive. I’d never paid much attention to the Cruise Director but ours seemed to be the star of the show, she had lots of positive energy. I wish the karaoke and quizzes (we only did 1-2 of each) had been better curated / run as they felt a bit like an after-thought. The quiz had some bizarre sound bites (could they not find a better option than archive Michael Jackson interviews!?) and the karaoke ended too soon.

The kids club - fortunately my kids were happy there *phew*! Staff were very warm and the team leader was so experienced and professional that we felt in good hands. I will say that my 5y/o seemed very hyper on some nights and later told us he’d been playing “the fruit ninja X-Box” a lot which we were a bit disappointed by - but I imagine the older kids are allowed so when the groups are merged this kind of thing happens.

The gym was great, beautiful views and I’d had no idea there were Peloton bikes on board - bonus! Is this fleet-wide? We missed RCI’s climbing wall and library (honestly, the ship’s library had about 10 English language books in it - what is the point?) but overall felt that, with our busy port itinerary, there was enough to keep us entertained.

The coffee. Oh gosh, I didn’t have one cup of coffee on board (free or paid) that I really loved. Would it be so hard to update the cafes on board to serve more than a frothy, weak cappuccino? The staff were great and I got a (sort of) flat white one day by asking for a double shot espresso with a dash of milk - but the coffee quality was average and it always came served in a huge mug from 1998. Fortunately, Greece has wonderful coffee so it was a nice challenge each day to find a good cafe on land. 

I loved Mykonos, I avoided Santorini (husband said it was nice); Kusadasi was a real gem - we had an amazing hammam and massage whilst the kids stayed on board. Thessaloniki was great: a real Greek port town with lots of local tourists, a nice promenade walk, good food options and it felt a big enough place to safely absorb the cruise crowd. Limassol was fine, a few little playgrounds for the kids, we didn’t stay long. Rhodes was nice but tiny and I can totally understand the anti-cruise ship sentiment from some of these places. We did no excursions whatsoever and in almost all these towns it is super easy to just have a stroll and some lunch on your own steam (profits go to locals that way).

Our third potential holiday-catastrophe came a few days in: on day 4, our kids came back from the club saying a boy had been sick everywhere. Like kids do, they went into detail and named the boy. We were then kind of annoyed to see said boy at the buffet that lunch time. Later that night our kids vomited twice. We felt the right thing to do was to take them to the sick bay. We weren’t met with much sympathy but were asked to quarantine them in the room, which we did. It was pretty miserable. After no improvement, we went back a few hours later and agreed to give them both a shot of anti-sickness drugs and quarantined another 12 hours. Thank goodness me & my partner were never ill. And the kids were only sick from one end(!). Partner and I would take turns to pop out to get some food and.. we saw the same kid at the buffet again, and then saw him vomit outside the buffet. I was really angry but when I reported it to the nurse he shrugged and said that they can’t do anything if the parents deny it. 

Thankfully my kids got well again fairly quickly and it only really affected 1.5 days of the trip. Oh, and cost us $250 in medical fees. Honestly I feel like we did the right thing, but Celebrity gave us very little sympathy and a chunky bill - which is not super incentivising. Even a kind letter or a tiny bit of cruise credit would have gone a long way to making us feel better about it all.

One thing I didn’t like about the ship was the lack of a decent central lobby area like on the older RC ships. On the Serenade OTS there is a huge ‘centrum’ where you have multiple views from every floor of the band playing and people down by the bar. On the Infinity the central lobby area is about 4 decks high and finding any seat to get a clear view of the band is impossible. There was no shuffle board on the decks and the buffet outdoor seating was much smaller. We loved the pool area and hot tubs. The age limits on the indoor pool were not very clear.  I never let my kids in there, but I saw others did and were not stopped. The spa was great - a sauna with a porthole! And it was always quiet in there.

I think we’ll go back to RCI next, I liked Celebrity but the family fun vibes were definitely toned down. I’d expected this of course, and was surprised that I missed it. Despite being full, the ship only felt ‘crowded’ on deck during sea days (and even then, only in the middle of the day). There were always calm spaces to be found. That was a huge positive for me and the reason I won’t touch the bigger ships.

The food in Celebrity was marginally better - the MDR was just a nicer place to be than on RC - the tables had more spacing and the food was a notch above RC. But I’d say you never get better than at an average chain restaurant on land. I didn’t try speciality dining, saving the money for really good local lunches in port. I don’t think the buffet was better though, it has a good Indian selection but the other options were just OK. The desserts, as with RC, were poor.

I’ll always recommend cruise holidays for young families. We all have a great time and at this age, when they’re too tiny to walk far and just want predictable routine, it’s perfect. No tidying and washing-up after meals; childcare on hand every day. We felt well rested and very well taken care of - thank you Celebrity!!

# 🎯 Real Implementation: How I Would Use This AI Operating System

I'm Julian Goldie. I run a 7-figure SEO agency. I know exactly how much time gets wasted on boring, repetitive tasks.

When I saw this AI operating system called Warmwind OS, I immediately started planning how to implement it in real businesses.

Not in theory. In practice.

Here's exactly how I would deploy this AI operating system in different types of businesses.

This AI operating system isn't just a tool. It's a complete system for automating your workflows. And the best part? You don't need to be technical to use it.

The AI operating system runs in your web browser. You show it what to do once. It does it forever.

Let me show you real implementation examples.

# 🏢 AI Operating System Implementation: Service Businesses

Let's say you run a consulting business. Here's how you'd implement this AI operating system:

**Morning Routine Automation:** Set up your AI operating system to start every day at 8 AM. It opens your email. Sorts messages by priority. Flags urgent items. Creates a summary of what needs your attention.

While you're having coffee, your AI operating system has already organized your entire day.

**Client Reporting Automation:**  
Every Friday, you need to send weekly reports to clients. Instead of spending 3 hours on this, you teach your AI operating system to:

* Pull data from your project management tool
* Open your report template
* Fill in the client-specific information
* Generate charts and graphs
* Email the completed report to each client

Your AI operating system does this for all clients simultaneously. What used to take 3 hours now takes 3 minutes.

**Lead Follow-Up Automation:** When someone fills out your contact form, your AI operating system immediately:

* Looks them up on LinkedIn
* Checks their company website
* Adds them to your CRM with all relevant info
* Sends a personalized follow-up email
* Schedules a reminder for you to call them

Your AI operating system turns every lead into a sales opportunity before you even know they exist.

# 🛒 AI Operating System Implementation: E-commerce Businesses

Running an online store? Here's your AI operating system implementation plan:

**Customer Support Automation:** Your AI operating system monitors your support email 24/7. When a message comes in, it:

* Identifies the type of question (refund, shipping, product info)
* Looks up the customer's order history in Shopify
* Crafts a personalized response with relevant information
* Sends the reply immediately

Your customers get instant responses. You handle 10x more support tickets without hiring anyone.

**Inventory Management Automation:** Your AI operating system checks your inventory levels every morning. When a product is running low, it:

* Creates a purchase order with your supplier
* Updates your inventory spreadsheet
* Adjusts your advertising spend for low-stock items
* Sends you a summary of actions taken

Your AI operating system prevents stockouts before they happen.

**Social Media Automation:** Your AI operating system posts to all your social accounts daily. It:

* Finds trending hashtags in your niche
* Creates posts highlighting your best products
* Responds to comments and messages
* Tracks engagement and adjusts posting times

Your social media runs itself while you focus on product development.

# 📊 AI Operating System Implementation: Marketing Agencies

Marketing agencies waste massive amounts of time on reporting and data analysis. Here's how to fix that with an AI operating system:

**Client Reporting Automation:** Your AI operating system generates monthly reports for all clients automatically. It:

* Logs into Google Analytics for each client
* Pulls traffic and conversion data
* Opens Facebook Ads Manager for ad performance
* Checks Google Ads for campaign metrics
* Compiles everything into branded reports
* Emails reports to clients on the same day each month

What used to require an entire team now happens automatically with your AI operating system.

**Competitive Analysis Automation:** Your AI operating system monitors your clients' competitors weekly. It:

* Visits competitor websites to check for changes
* Monitors their social media for new campaigns
* Tracks their Google Ads activity
* Compiles findings into a competitive intelligence report

Your AI operating system gives you insights your competitors don't have.

# 🏠 AI Operating System Implementation: Real Estate

Real estate is perfect for AI operating system automation because so much work is repetitive:

**Lead Management Automation:** When someone inquires about a property, your AI operating system:

* Looks up the property details
* Checks the buyer's financing pre-approval status
* Schedules a showing time that works for everyone
* Sends confirmation emails with driving directions
* Adds the appointment to your calendar

Your AI operating system turns every inquiry into a scheduled showing.

**Market Analysis Automation:** Your AI operating system creates market reports monthly. It:

* Gathers recent sale data from MLS
* Analyzes price trends in different neighborhoods
* Creates charts showing market conditions
* Emails reports to your client database

Your AI operating system keeps you positioned as the local market expert.

# 💼 AI Operating System Quality Control Implementation

Here's something crucial that most people miss when implementing an AI operating system: quality control.

You can't just set up your AI operating system and forget about it. You need systems to make sure it's working correctly.

**Daily Check Implementation:** Set up your AI operating system to send you a daily summary of everything it did. Review this every morning. Look for:

* Tasks that were completed successfully
* Any errors or unexpected results
* Opportunities to improve the automation

**Weekly Review Implementation:** Every week, audit a sample of your AI operating system's work. Check:

* Email responses for tone and accuracy
* Data entry for completeness
* Report generation for correct information

**Monthly Optimization Implementation:** Once a month, review your AI operating system performance and optimize:

* Identify tasks taking longer than expected
* Update templates and responses
* Add new automations for emerging needs

Quality control isn't optional. It's how you ensure your AI operating system actually improves your business instead of creating problems.

# 🔧 Troubleshooting AI Operating System Implementation

Here are common implementation challenges and how to solve them:

**Problem:** AI operating system automations break when websites update **Solution:** Use semantic targeting instead of coordinate-based clicking. Focus on button text and context rather than exact positions.

**Problem:** AI operating system makes mistakes in customer communications  
**Solution:** Implement approval workflows for important communications. Have the AI operating system draft responses that you review before sending.

**Problem:** Team members resist AI operating system automation **Solution:** Position automation as making their jobs easier, not replacing them. Start with tasks everyone hates doing.

**Problem:** AI operating system automations run too slowly **Solution:** Optimize by batching similar tasks and using keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse clicks where possible.

**Problem:** Difficulty measuring AI operating system ROI **Solution:** Track time saved per automation. Calculate hourly wage equivalent. Measure business metrics like response time and customer satisfaction.

# 📈 Scaling Your AI Operating System Implementation

Once you have basic AI operating system automations working, here's how to scale:

**Phase 1:** Automate individual tasks (email responses, data entry) **Phase 2:** Automate entire workflows (lead to customer journey)  
**Phase 3:** Automate cross-department processes (marketing to sales handoff) **Phase 4:** Build AI operating system-powered business processes

The goal isn't just to automate existing tasks. It's to redesign your business around what's possible with an AI operating system.

# ❓ Practical AI Operating System Implementation FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to set up one automation with this AI operating system?** A: Simple automations can be set up in 10-15 minutes using teaching mode. Complex workflows might take a few hours to perfect.

**Q: What if my team doesn't want to use the AI operating system?** A: Start by automating tasks that everyone hates. Show them how the AI operating system makes their jobs easier, not harder.

It’s been less than a day since I found out.

I was the bet.

“Kung mapapainlove mo ‘yan bro, sagot namin inom next week.”
“Pa-fallin mo lang. Mukhang iyakin pa ’yan.”

They knew my name.
They talked about my photos.
They even shared my voice notes for laughs.
Sa TG. Sa fucking Telegram.

And I was there thinking I finally met someone genuine.
Someone who liked me for me not because I was pretty. Not because I was mysterious.

But because I was trying.

Earlier this evening, he messaged.

“Hey, please don’t overthink. It was just guy stuff. It didn’t mean anything.”

Didn’t mean anything?

Then why do I feel like I lost something?
Why do I feel humiliated?
Why am I deleting pictures that you took of me?
Why am I scared that the next guy I meet might just be another dare?

He said it was a joke.
But tell me, how do you laugh at someone who trusted you?

How do you joke about the nights I stayed on the phone while you vented? Or the time I brought coffee to your workplace because “I just wanted to see you smile?”

Was that funny too? 
Was I the punchline in a game I never signed up for?


I haven’t replied.
I don’t know if I will.

Because I don’t want an apology he only said because he got caught. I don’t want to hear “That wasn’t me.”

It was you.
You typed it. You laughed. You sent the screenshots.
You were the bet.

And I was the cost.


Right now I don’t want revenge.
I just want to stop feeling like I was stupid for believing in something real.

But the truth is:

Some guys don’t date for love. They date for proof.
Proof that they could. Proof that they’re still “the man.”
And when they win — you lose.

Well, the advice that I’m seeking is,

How do you move on when you feel humiliated, not heartbroken?

-

I might post a Part 3.
I don’t know what that looks like yet.
But maybe it’s me finally getting even.
Or maybe it’s me finding peace.

And when I say lock in I mean my wondering thoughts always goes to “he misses me so much” “of course he’s thinking about me”, etc. Like every time I think about him it’s always in this way. I also have an AMAZING sense of self concept now, which I know is helping!) So recently I feel like I’ve been seeing movement in the 3D that I want to share.

2. We used to always go to this coffee shop together and he would only go there when we were together. My number is connected to card for points (and he knows this). I have gotten a notification twice from this place saying he went there.

1lsgx0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lsgx0c/does_the_dezin_electric_kettle_deliver_on_fast/,Does the DEZIN Electric Kettle Deliver on Fast Heating and Temperature Control?,"Daily use of the DEZIN 8856 made it easy to appreciate its features, quirks, and capabilities, giving me a clearer picture of its strengths and areas that could improve. As someone who relies on hot beverages to fuel my day, having the right electric kettle makes all the difference. DEZIN's electric kettle, with its sleek black finish and thoughtful features, seemed promising right from the box. With a 1.7L capacity, stainless steel construction, and multiple temperature presets, it certainly aims to appeal to tea and coffee enthusiasts alike. After using it for a few weeks, I jotted down some thoughts on how it fared in my kitchen.

**Impressive Design and Build Quality**  
Its black, painted exterior combined with a double-wall design gives it both style and utility. The kettle stays cool to the touch during operation, which I found reassuring, especially in a house bustling with curious kids. The LED display and buttons are intuitive without being overly complicated, allowing me to access all settings without endlessly pulling out the manual. The stainless steel interior, which is BPA-free, ensures my water remains free from plastic contamination—a detail tea lovers prioritize.

**Versatile Temperature Control Options**  
What sets this kettle apart is its 9 preset adjustable temperature options. I’ve used it to prepare green tea at 175°F, coffee at 195°F, and even warm milk for my niece at lower settings. With the temperature increment flexibility of 10°F, it’s incredibly easy to customize heat levels, and the digital display keeps me informed in real-time. Adjusting the temperature by simply tapping “SET TEMP” became second nature by the end of the week.

**Time-Saving Heating Performance**  
The powerful 1200-watt heating element is no joke. Boiling 1.7 liters within 5 to 7 minutes was consistent and hassle-free. Mornings with limited time now feel less frantic since I no longer have to twiddle my thumbs waiting for water to heat. For a quick boil, hitting the ""BOIL STOP"" feature expedited things even further, which was especially helpful on days I was running late.

**Check DEZIN 8856 price on Amazon.**

**Convenient Keep-Warm Functionality**  
A game-changer for my multitasking mornings, the keep-warm feature ensures the water remains at the desired temperature for up to 12 hours. This came in handy when I forgot I had prepped water for tea but got sidetracked. It’s not just about saving time—it saves energy, too. Plus, I appreciated the memory function; it retained the previous temperature I set, so I didn’t have to constantly recalibrate.

**Winning Points**  
- The BPA-free stainless steel interior enhances safety and adds peace of mind.  
- Dual-wall insulation keeps the exterior cool to prevent accidental burns.  
- Rapid boiling ensures minimal waiting time.  
- Customizable 9 preset temperature settings cater to a variety of beverages.  

**Weaknesses**  
- While the kettle showcases sleek aesthetics, the glossy black surface attracts fingerprints, and constant wiping was necessary.  
- At nearly 3 pounds, it’s a tad heavier than some competitors, which might bother users with limited grip strength.  
- The water level markings are inside, making it less convenient for quick external checks.  

**Alternative Products**  
Stacking it against established competitors like the Cuisinart CPK-17 or the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe, some nuances came to light. The Breville model boasts a more premium finish with a slightly quieter operation, and the Cuisinart kettle’s external water window is a thoughtful addition missing here. However, DEZIN excels with its keep-warm feature lasting up to 12 hours, outshining its peers that typically cap off at two hours.

Where Breville’s added cost comes from is apparent: sophisticated materials and quieter boiling. That said, in terms of bang for the buck, DEZIN captured my attention since it proved functional without such a hefty price tag.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the feature set offered—especially the keep-warm functionality, safety features, and variable temperatures—this kettle competes well within its segment.

I met Chris on Snapchat, July 2024. We had so much in common he loves birds, and we both just kind of hit it off via conversation. There was something about him and I could just remember looking at his photos and going man. There’s something about this one. 

He pushed to meet me right away and the first red flag was. I told him that I was busy. I was actually living in my own apartment at this time and I told him that I would need to schedule him, but I couldn’t see him the night of, and I made him very upset.  Come Thursday the day we were supposed to meet. I got ready. I drove 45 minutes to see him. That was my choice.

As I got closer to him, he told me that he would prefer if we jumped in his car, which has executive tinted window. I was automatically kind of set off. I felt unsafe I wasn’t OK with that. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable that I would rather go to a coffee shop and he said no, and I literally turned around and just left.

Amazingly, we still kept in contact and we still spoke for some reason it just wasn’t as much . After a few days, we started speaking again and we were snapping and talking every day every night. He would get jealous. If I posted pictures of myself he didn’t want me making new friends. He wanted me to follow all of his orders.

We would Butthead often because I’m an independent woman because I needed to be in my life coming from an abusive environment. I needed to seek refuge and get on my own 2 feet so I wasn’t in my family’s house anymore.  For some reason, he saw me as someone who had a nice car and was in the process of buying my own home as someone who is low value as he would call me. By the way, he has six kids and he’s divorced.

We scheduled to meet a second time . I drove out there again because he convinced me that I was the problem the first time. He left me waiting for an hour until he showed up so that he was caught up in something and that he wanted me to sit in his car again.
 
I sat in his vehicle. It was a little bit awkward. At first he was making fun of my parking. He told me I didn’t know how to park and that for such an expensive car I could’ve gotten something nicer like his. He told me he wanted to hook up with me and I said I wasn’t sure and that’s when he pinned me down kissed me very hard to a point where his gums started to bleed because he was biting me and I tasted blood. I got him off of me and we somehow still continue the situation because I was very confused and we left it very open ended. 

No one texted each other when we got home. I was still kind of processing what happened and the next day he sent me a Snapchat around noon I guess I didn’t open it in time. He deleted it and I texted him and we continued speaking.  I blocked him and for three weeks I thought about him all the time I made a fake Snapchat account and saw that he was posting subliminals about losing the love of his life and how it was over and how people think he’s a bad man and that he’s really not and that even if he wants a relationship with somebody, it always doesn’t work out.

I went back to him. He accepted me back at this point. I was in my new home about two or three weeks and still getting everything settled and we were speaking again and it felt really good.  Things are better this time he told me what he needed for me in terms of communication. He told me he was very comfortable with me that I was easy to be vulnerable with me. He said that I had it all as a woman and that I was beautiful and Everything was perfect about me.

And things slowly went downhill again. He would just be mean to me and tell me that I was desperate because I wanted to make new friends after my sobriety journey. He would tell me that the best thing for me to do is stay at home. He would hate when I posted pictures of my body as I’m trying to become more confident in my wanking and told me that I was desperate for attention and that there’s some things that only a man should be seeing your man.

At this point every time we would fight he would then say we’re just friends it doesn’t matter anyway . We spoke about meeting up again and having sex and the day of he sent me a snap which was clearly pointing out the fact that he had cold sore. That made me feel uncomfortable and I just did not want to meet up with him because I did not want any cold sores myself. I just wanna point out that all of our conversations happen on Snapchat. He has over 1 million score. He has his business on his Snapchat as well and I guess his account is a hybrid, personal and business account.. 

On Snapchat, he portrays himself to be a very religious man who has family members who are religious coverings, and he adheres to the obligations as a man in his culture, but it appears on Snapchat. The people who he likes are completely different.  I am not a religious woman I like to post my pictures in my bathing suits. I do not adhere to any cultural obligations because I left my religion about a decade ago. I was raised in an extreme mist environment.

So we stopped talking again another three weeks. I’m here thinking what he’s thinking. I reach out to him again and every time I go back to him, he’s meaner, but he always accepts my hand.  After our three or four weeks of no contact I would text him. He would text me back right away. He would say no problem. Let’s be friends. We would add each other on Snapchat and it’s like things would go back to normal.

At this point, we’ve never had sex. We only met those two times that I mentioned there are many times where I went back to him and this is our fourth time of no contact that I asked him. Why don’t you just block me if you’re going to be mean to me and don’t wanna speak to me in which he replies, you’re never a bother. We’re really good friends he never will remove me. He only removed me from Snapchat once and that’s when I ignored him and he went on a hissy fit.

Our most recent time of me blocking was he just did not want to hear me talk about how I felt that it was kind of ridiculous that him and I just keep on speaking to each other. I told him that we don’t get along. He insists that we do, I told him that he should just block me as well and he said he would not do that and then just started sending emoji reactions to me. I got really upset. I sent him a long message. Just basically saying that I was just fed up and how I’m done with these mind games that this is just immature and childish and that I wanted no parts of him and I actually blocked him everywhere. There’s no way he can contact me at this point.

I do have BPD and I do struggle with attachment a lot. Can someone make a little bit of sense of what’s going on here so I could just peacefully keep this guy blocked as he has been for the past three weeks",2,1751740913.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False
1lsgw2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lsgw2m/11_years_of_isolation_and_shame_i_know_exactly/,"11 years of isolation and shame - I know exactly how to change, and still do nothing","I feel like I willingly threw the past 11 years into the trash. Out of fear - and I don’t even really know what of.

My professional life is great - successful, with an outstanding team (for the most part). But when it comes to self-directed living, I’ve spent the past 11 years gradually isolating myself. Gaming and binge-watching alone at home, junk food to minimize the breaks in between. Dreaming of change, only to then judge myself harshly for what I actually did instead.

Hard stuck in my own head. Big dreams that I immediately tear down the moment I have them. Why? No idea. I live alone, few friends - exact number: 2. And beyond that, my only social contact is the occasional conversation with my family - who are all at least as messed up as I am - maybe even worse. And my coworkers - but only at work. I don’t open up - to anyone. Not even to myself.  

I have no clue what’s going on inside me, what I want, or what I’m supposed to do.  Everything I experience leads to a feeling of inferiority. Everything gets compared to me - and everything wins.  

I haven’t had physical contact with another human being in 11 years. I’ve wanted to quit smoking for 6 years. I’ve thought about trying to go without gaming, binge-watching, and all the other life-consuming virtual distractions. But Every night I masturbate - to porn that doesn’t even excite me anymore. My life runs on habitual autopilot - while I continue thinking:  “Why isn’t this working?” “How can it be better?” “Why don’t I do anything?” And just trying to dig a deeper hole for myself, even though I already reached the bottom in my social life and everything that isn’t work. When I hear others making plans with their friends, I just sit there and think and feel: “Look, that’s what a real life looks like. And what do you have? Nothing, absolutely nothing.” And the worst part? I know all of this. Even that it’s just a highly sophisticated self-defense mechanism trying to protect me from anticipated “bad” emotions based on past experiences like being traumatized by my own mom, her eventually abandoning my siblings and me, leaving us with an alcoholic father who was absent 10 to 12 days out of every 14, being abandoned by all my friends because of the girl I started dating, who also left me, after more than half decade.

I know this isn’t the bottom of human existence. There are people far worse off than me and I know that. And yet, somehow I convince myself they’re not - because at least they manage, even in objectively worse situations. I know this is all happening in my own mind. I know that thoughts don‘t contain truth as well as that thinking about thoughts keeps this hell running. I know how cognitive distortions work. But none of that ever matters when it should. None of that awareness is present in the moments when it could actually break the cycle.  

And holy shit - that is the messed-up part, in all its glory. I know what to do. I know how to do it. I’m more adaptable than most people I know or have known. I learn fast. I’m physically strong, well-coordinated. I see patterns quickly, conceptualize things in seconds, absorb knowledge and skills faster than average. But I don’t feel myself that way. I still feel weaker, dumber, less capable not even compared to people, but to everything.

A sharp mind, adaptable, fast learner, physically capable and I use all of it to build elaborate arguments to justify my own paralysis. God, it’s disgustingly messed up. 

And still, I get up every morning and do the exact same things again and again. Coffee. Cigarette. Ask myself what I could do today and then shoot down every single idea with near-light-speed overthinking: “Go swimming – can’t. Because alone.” “Practice an instrument - can’t. Nice weather outside, better to go out. Can’t go out - because alone.” “Then tidy up your flat or write or draw something - no, can’t. That doesn’t help make new social connections.” “How to make new social connections? Go out, talk to people - can’t!” The only things I do are the ones that my self-built security system allows. Everything else gets shut down or dissected beyond recognition. Constantly trying to control everything - except for the one thing I could control: my own actions. 

And instead of using all the knowledge I have to actually do something different, I just keep going like this. I fear that if this continues, I’ll end up in an early grave without a legacy and without anyone even noticing - without ever having tried to live out even \*one\* of the ideas this quiet voice whispers all the time.",1,1751740911.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

It's a coffee concentrate that promises quick, easy coffee without brewing or pods. Just mix a few teaspoons with water or milk, and you’ve got instant coffee, at least that’s the pitch.

The first thing that stood out was how convenient it really is. No waiting, no coffee grounds, no cleanup. It’s great for mornings when there’s no time to make a full pot or when you just want one cup without waste. I tried it both hot and cold, and it mixes easily either way. The flavor is surprisingly smooth, not bitter, but also not super bold like a fresh espresso. It works well for iced coffee with milk, but if you’re expecting that strong coffee-shop punch, it might feel a bit light unless you use extra concentrate.

One small bottle lasts a while, but the servings can go quickly if you're the type who likes a stronger cup. I noticed I started going through it faster than expected. It’s also on the pricier side when compared to just brewing coffee at home, but for the convenience factor, it kind of balances out. Shelf life is solid too, and it barely takes up space.

What I didn’t love was that it’s hard to tell how much caffeine you’re actually getting unless you measure really carefully. And while it’s marketed as a premium product, the taste won’t blow you away if you’re really picky about coffee flavor. It’s good, but not amazing.

Overall, it’s a solid option for convenience, especially if you’re into iced drinks or want something simple for work or travel. Has anyone else here tried Javy? Did you think it lived up to the hype, or did it fall flat for you?",1,1751740808.0,productreview,0,1.0,False

Posting on throwaway as wife knows my main account.

I think I’m falling into a deep depression and there’s not much I can do about.

Over the past year I’ve tried to obtain my HGV license. Before I started the training, my wife was very supportive. She knew I wanted to go for it so I could support our family. Our son was 1 at the time. 
She helped me do my theory and I passed it first time. She went to my medical with me, all was good. Come to the day of training, it’s a 5 day course. We get into an argument because she ‘didn’t know I would be gone all day’. She was also pregnant with our now daughter. She said it would be hard for her to play with our son and chase after him while pregnant. She didn’t want me to go. I went anyways despite her not talking to me everyday until the day of the test. 

Unfortunately for me, I failed. My mind wasn’t in it. I met her while she was out with our son, she had bought me presents to say well done for passing as she believed in me. She didn’t believe I failed but after I showed her my report she felt bad. £3000 down the drain on finance. 

The government does a funded training course for HGV. I tried to apply, but since I passed other elements, I wasn’t eligible. 

Fast forward to January this year. I went for it again but government funded since I one of my certifications ran out. 
Same thing happened, arguments on the morning I was due to leave. Literally as soon as I got to the training yard she said she can’t do it as both kids are screaming & one needs to nap and she can’t do it blah blah blah.
I did a full day then dropped out. Had an argument with my wife who said fine go back, but she guilt tripped me.

We don’t have family support or friends. We are on our own just to let people know.

Fast forward a few months, my local council asked if I completed the course as they have employers willing to take me on if I passed. I told them I didn’t and would be happy to try again.
My wife again, supported me, she knew I was excited, third times a charm right? 

A couple of days before I was due to start training again, my wife threw me a curveball. Her mum was in ICU due to an apparent drug overdose. She doesn’t speak to her mum nor does she even like her. She doesn’t speak or talk any anything to do with her family back in a different city. 
I obviously believe her as her mum is a known drug addict. 

Come to the morning of training. Her mum died overnight. She looked upset but told me to go even though I said I’ll stay to support her. She refused and said I should go. 

All is well, she’s got money to take the kids out, I got them both ready, cleaned the house the night before, order anything you want for delivery etc. Do  whatever makes things easy for you. 

A few hours in when I was having a break. She’s arguing with me saying I’m selfish for leaving her when she’s grieving. Calling me the bad guy, saying who leaves their wife to grief on their own etc. 

So again, I leave on the first day. 

After that, no mention of her mum despite me asking several times what plans are, what her brother is doing and stuff.
She acts like nothing has happened. 

That night I threw away everything. All my driving stuff, cards, certificates, everything. I said I’m not even going to attempt to do it again. She said I was being dramatic and stuff. 

For the next few days I was looking at her brothers profile, her sisters and her ‘dead’ mums on Facebook. I didn’t see a single thing. I even checked online for local deaths and tributes.  Nothing. 

Yesterday she left her phone in the car whilst she went to the shop, our son was playing with it and managed to get onto Facebook messenger, he clicked on a notification from her brother. 

Her brother was complaining about their supposed dead mother about how she needs money and she drug problem is getting out of hand. 

She’s not dead. She lied, she planned it out a few days before to stop me going. All because she can’t cope with both our kids on her own. 

She’s done this before when I worked, she would call me saying something is wrong with our son and had to leave. I got fired because it happened too much.

It happened during Covid, said she had it but never did, wouldn’t show me tests. 

I know it’s hard with 2 under 2, but I’ve done it several times while I told her to go to a coffee shop for a few hours, get her nails done, relax, do whatever you want! 

I love my wife. I really do. But I can’t order happy pills online, supplements and shit. I can’t go to a doctor or therapy without her knowing or questioning. I can’t even talk to her because she’ll gaslight me, and I sure as hell can’t tell her I know she lied because she’ll go crazy I was on her phone! 

I can’t leave, I love my kids, I don’t want them to be without a dad. I’m trying to hid my depression, I’m trying to be that loving husband, the ones she hugs and seduces me, wants sex all the time. But I don’t feel like loving her even though I do. She’s manipulative, gaslights and lies. But apart from that she’s a loving wife. 

I don’t want to eat but I have to to hide it. I don’t want to do anything. I’ve lost interest in everything. I love to game. I don’t want to. I love to read books. I don’t want to. I was trying to write a book. I’ve scrapped it. 

I can feel my body just shutting down. I can’t even cry, my body doesn’t want it. I feel numb.

I’m not looking to off myself, I’m too scared for that, I’ll never see my kids again, hence why I can’t leave. 

I’m stuck in this black hole for god knows how long. 

I’m hoping she slips up about her mum at some point so I can call her out on it. Until then… ",3,1751740505.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

But now it feels like everything is going at double speed. By the end of our first week texting, he was calling me “babe” and sending good morning/good night messages every day. He introduced me to his friends already, at a house party where he told people we were “kind of official.” I didn’t even know we were there yet. This weekend, he asked if I wanted to go on a short trip together in two weeks. Like an actual weekend away, just the two of us.

It’s not that I don’t like him, I really do. But I feel like I’m barely getting to know him while the relationship is already being built around me. I’m worried if I say something, he’ll feel rejected or pull away completely. At the same time, I don’t want to be pushed into something too fast and wake up one day wondering how I even got into it.

So, you've started your Zepbound journey - that's fantastic! You're likely already seeing some of the benefits, like a reduced appetite or perhaps a bit of weight loss. But here's the thing - while Zepbound is incredibly effective for many, it's not always a completely smooth ride. You might be wondering, ""Is this nausea normal?"" or ""Why am I suddenly so tired?""

Trust me, you're not alone. Experiencing some side effects is actually pretty common, especially when you're just getting started or when your dose increases. The good news? Most of these are manageable, and with a few smart strategies, you can often lessen their impact. This post is all about giving you the practical tips and tricks I've learned (and others have shared) to make your Zepbound experience as comfortable as possible. Let's dive in!

**Understanding What's Normal - And What's Not**

First things first, let's talk about expectations. Zepbound works by slowing down your digestion and affecting your hunger signals. Because of this, some digestive changes are almost par for the course. We're talking things like nausea, constipation, or sometimes diarrhea. Fatigue and headaches can also pop up.

These are often mild to moderate and tend to improve over time as your body adjusts. That said, it's super important to listen to your body. If you're experiencing severe pain, vomiting that won't stop, or any symptoms that worry you, don't hesitate. **Always reach out to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately** if something feels seriously off. They're your best resource for personalized advice.

**Tackling Nausea: Your Stomach's Best Friend**

Nausea is probably one of the most talked-about side effects, and for good reason - it's no fun! It often happens because Zepbound slows down gastric emptying. This means food stays in your stomach longer.

Here's what I've found can really help:

- **Eat smaller, more frequent meals.** Instead of three big meals, try five or six mini-meals throughout the day. This keeps your stomach from getting too full.
- **Stick to bland, easy-to-digest foods.** Think toast, crackers, rice, plain chicken, or broth. These are gentler on your stomach.
- **Avoid greasy, spicy, or overly sugary foods.** These can be much harder to digest and might make nausea worse.
- **Sip on clear liquids.** Water, ginger ale (flat is often better), or peppermint tea can be soothing. Don't gulp them down; small sips work best.
- **Don't lie down right after eating.** Give your body some time - at least 30 minutes to an hour - to start digesting before you recline.
- **Try ginger.** Ginger chews, ginger tea, or even just smelling fresh ginger can sometimes help calm a queasy stomach.

**Beating Digestive Woes: Constipation and Diarrhea**

It's a bit of a paradox, isn't it? Zepbound can cause both constipation *and* diarrhea in different people. The key is knowing which one you're dealing with and how to adjust.

**When Constipation Calls:**

If things are feeling a bit ""backed up,"" you're not alone. This is a very common side effect.

- **Fiber is your friend.** Gradually increase your intake of high-fiber foods. We're talking fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Just don't go overboard too quickly, or you might upset your stomach further.
- **Hydration, hydration, hydration.** I can't stress this enough! Water is crucial for keeping things moving. Aim for plenty of fluids throughout the day.
- **Move your body.** Even gentle exercise, like a daily walk, can stimulate your digestive system.
- **Listen to your body.** Don't ignore the urge to go. If you do, it can make constipation worse.

**When Diarrhea Strikes:**

On the flip side, some people experience loose stools. This can be just as disruptive.

- **Embrace the BRAT diet.** Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast are your go-to's here. They're binding and easy on your gut.
- **Stay super hydrated.** Diarrhea can lead to dehydration quickly. Drink plenty of water, clear broths, and electrolyte solutions.
- **Avoid trigger foods.** High-fat foods, dairy products, overly spicy dishes, and artificial sweeteners can often make diarrhea worse.

**Managing Fatigue and Headaches: Keeping Your Energy Up**

Feeling unusually tired or getting headaches can be really frustrating when you're trying to live your life. These are often linked to changes in your metabolism and hydration.

**For Fatigue:**

- **Prioritize sleep.** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. A consistent sleep schedule can make a huge difference.
- **Gentle movement helps.** While you might feel tired, a short walk or light stretching can sometimes boost your energy levels more than sitting still.
- **Fuel your body wisely.** Make sure you're eating nutrient-dense foods, even if your appetite is smaller. Your body needs good fuel to function.
- **Listen to your body.** If you need a short nap, take one. Don't push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning.

**For Headaches:**

- **Hydration is key.** Dehydration is a common culprit for headaches, so keep that water bottle handy.
- **Rest in a quiet, dark place.** Sometimes, all you need is a little peace and quiet.
- **Over-the-counter pain relievers.** If safe for you, medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with headache pain. Always check with your doctor first.

**Heartburn and Injection Site Reactions: Small Annoyances, Big Solutions**

Sometimes it's the smaller, more localized issues that can be the most annoying. Heartburn and reactions at your injection site definitely fit that bill.

**Dealing with Heartburn (GERD):**

- **Smaller meals, again!** Overfilling your stomach can push acid up.
- **Avoid trigger foods.** For many, this includes coffee, chocolate, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and mint. Pay attention to what seems to make yours worse.
- **Elevate your head while sleeping.** Using a wedge pillow or propping up the head of your bed can help keep acid down.
- **Over-the-counter antacids.** Medications like Tums or Gaviscon can offer quick relief. For more persistent issues, your doctor might suggest something stronger.

**Calming Injection Site Reactions:**

- **Rotate your injection sites.** This is crucial! Don't inject in the same spot repeatedly. Alternate between your abdomen, thigh, and upper arm.
- **Ensure proper technique.** Make sure the area is clean and dry. Follow the instructions for your pen carefully.
- **Cool compress.** If you get redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, a cool compress can help soothe it.
- **Let the alcohol dry.** If you're using an alcohol wipe, let the alcohol completely evaporate before injecting.

**The Golden Rule: Communication with Your Healthcare Team**

Look, while these tips can be incredibly helpful, they're not a substitute for professional medical advice. If your side effects are severe, persistent, or just plain worrying you, **please talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.**

They can:

- Offer specific advice tailored to your health history.
- Adjust your Zepbound dosage if needed.
- Suggest prescription medications to help manage more severe symptoms.
- Rule out any other underlying issues.

They are there to support you on this journey, so don't tough it out alone.

Navigating Zepbound side effects can feel like a challenge, but remember, you've got this. Most people find that with patience, smart strategies, and open communication with their healthcare team, these bumps in the road become much more manageable. Keep focusing on your goals, stay hydrated, and be kind to your body. You're making amazing progress, and a few temporary side effects won't stop you!",1,1751740239.0,ZepboundGuide,0,1.0,False

But our background is long and it's proving difficult for me to not just be blunt about this.

My mom died when my brother, sister and I were kids. My brother was nine, sister was seven and I was four. Two years later our dad brought home his second wife, though she was only a girlfriend at the time. She was super excited to meet us and I remember her being very affectionate to the point it made us uncomfortable. Like hugging and kissing on us and trying to hold our hands. My sister told dad and that stuff stopped but she was still really excited to be coming into our lives. So my dad married her.

After the wedding his wife had a hard time settling into things. None of us called her mom like she wanted, there were photos of our mom around the house and we had mom's last name instead of her and dad's last name because our mom never changed hers when she got married to dad. And we got her name when we were born.

The photos in the main part of the house came down and then she tried to remove them from our bedrooms and the playroom which only had one. She insisted to be respectful of her we needed to not have any up anywhere and to keep them in boxes until we moved out. It turned into a fight where dad told her she needed to stop before she broke the photos and just accept that we could have them in our rooms. My brother and sister shut her out completely after the photos though and she turned most of her focus to me, her ""baby boy"".

She tried so hard to mother me and to win my love. She asked me the weirdest questions like why I loved my mom. Or why I enjoyed spending time with my grandparents. Why did I never ask her to do things with me. And she even asked why I let my siblings decide who my mom was. Those were typically followed up with her saying she was the only mom I'd remember after a while and suggesting I could steal the photos of mom from my siblings room and give them to her to take care of. I didn't entertain this ever but it made me really mad at her. I was just bad at expressing that at the time and I'm the quietest of my siblings so I never made the big fuss they would. So she always had this hope for me to become hers.

She also broke our mom's coffee mug ""accidentally"" but we all had our doubts that it was an accident. Even dad suspected she did it because she was jealous.

My siblings were pretty ruthless in how they treated her and I supported them in doing so and even cheered them on but she was blind to that and my quietness she took as love for her. She had dad ask me if I wanted to be adopted and change my last name a couple of years after they got married. I said no and he accepted that but she brought it up to me a lot.

I was twelve when things boiled over. Our maternal grandparents wanted to take us on vacation and we wanted to go so the five of us talked to dad. His wife took it as I was being pressured into going by my grandparents and my siblings and she had a breakdown where she told them they couldn't take her son and to stop getting in the way of our relationship. She told my grandparents that I hardly remembered their daughter and she was the only mom I would ever really remember and they needed to accept that and back off.

Her and dad ended up in therapy and she went through individual therapy. Dad sat the three of us down after that and told us that she was going through a lot of deep insecurity and it's why she was acting out like she was and clingy like she was. He said she would work on that and could we please try to be understanding and not shut her out or be so awful to her. He asked me to just be polite. But even after therapy and she wasn't as bad, she still had this belief that I was hers and that I loved her and that she was the only mom I ever really knew. I had few memories of my real mom but she was still the only mom in my heart.

My siblings and I all pulled away from dad over it because he stayed with her and we were done dealing with it. It took about 18 months of that before he came to us and asked us to go to therapy with him, which we did. We talked stuff out and he told us he really loved his wife even with all her flaws but he could accept we would never see her as anything more than his wife, not even a stepmom. He told us she was back in therapy too and she was working on backing off.

Things are civil but distant between me and her now. But my relationship with dad is closer than it was for a lot of years.

I got engaged a couple of months ago and about a week after my sister told me that dad's wife was expecting to be mother of the groom and dancing with me when my fiancée dances with her dad. She said since neither her nor my brother really acknowledged her at all and because I was the youngest and she had her hopes on me for so long, it seemed like she still believed she was a mom in some way to me. I thanked my sister for telling me and decided to wait until dad's wife brought it up and if she didn't I wouldn't say anything. I didn't want to create problems. But now she has brought it up indirectly by tagging me in mother/son wedding dances and at a birthday dinner for a family member she talked about looking forward to her ""role"" in the wedding.

So now I don't know how to bring this up with her. I was not planning on doing anything different to my siblings. But I can also see that I'm older that this does hurt her and she does love me, and even if don't like or love her back she is a human and my dad loves her. So I need advice here because I'm at a loss. I can't make a promise to give her something because it will only fuel this hope for more.",23,1751739871.0,relationship_advice,18,0.73,False
1lsggi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lsggi9/what_is_maui_famous_for/,what is maui famous for?,"Spent the last 6 months living in Maui, and I've got to tell you - this island is unlike anything I've experienced before. While most people know Maui for its beaches, there's so much more that makes this place special.

The Road to Hana is probably Maui's most iconic experience. It's this incredible 52-mile journey with 620 curves and 50 bridges that takes you through some of the most breathtaking scenery you'll ever see. I recently took this tour (https://athometouch.com/Maui) and it was honestly the highlight of my stay. The black sand beaches, waterfalls, and bamboo forests along the way are just unreal.

But Maui's fame goes beyond just the Road to Hana. The island is known for Haleakala, a massive dormant volcano where you can watch the most spectacular sunrises above the clouds. The summit sits at 10,023 feet - pretty mind-blowing when you think about it.

The beaches here are world-class. Ka'anapali Beach is consistently ranked among the best in the world, and for good reason. The water is crystal clear, and during winter, you can spot whales breaching right from the shore. Speaking of whales, Maui is one of the best places globally for whale watching from December to May.

Food is another big deal here. Maui's agricultural scene is incredible - we're talking fresh pineapples, sugar cane, and coffee. The farm-to-table restaurants are amazing, and you haven't lived until you've tried fresh poke or a warm malasada (Hawaiian donut).

Snorkeling at Molokini Crater is another must-do. It's this crescent-shaped volcanic crater that's home to over 250 species of fish. The water visibility is usually around 150 feet, which is pretty incredible.

If you're planning to explore the Road to Hana (which you absolutely should), I highly recommend booking a guided tour rather than driving yourself. After trying both, I can say the guided experience is worth every penny. You get to actually enjoy the views instead of stressing about the narrow roads, plus you learn so much about Hawaiian culture and history from the local guides. The tour I mentioned earlier includes all the best stops, lunch, and they handle the park reservations which are now required for some spots.

Maui is also famous for its laid-back lifestyle and ""aloha spirit."" It's not just a marketing phrase - people here genuinely embody this welcoming, peaceful way of life. Whether you're watching surfers at Ho'okipa Beach, hiking through the bamboo forests, or just enjoying a shave ice in Lahaina, you'll feel this unique vibe that makes Maui, well, Maui.

Bottom line - Maui's fame comes from this perfect blend of natural wonders, cultural experiences, and that indefinable magic that keeps drawing people back. If you're planning a trip, definitely consider booking that Road to Hana tour in advance - it tends to fill up quickly, especially during peak season.",1,1751739791.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

A new campaign will try to persuade New Yorkers to trash their trash.

By [James Barron](https://www.nytimes.com/by/james-barron)

*Good morning. It’s Friday. Today we’ll look at a new campaign aimed at one of those seemingly intractable New York problems: littering. We’ll also get details on why more than 100 NASA scientists are moving out of a building that television viewers know from the sitcom “Seinfeld.”*

# Can New York change its habits about littering?

That’s the question behind a new advertising campaign that comes at the end of a week when there has been reason to think that habits in New York can change.

[The new anti-littering campaign](https://www.sanitationfoundation.org/dont-do-nyc-dirty) isn’t charging litterers, The slogan, repeated in commercials that will be broadcast on television and shown in movie theaters and on sanitation truck posters, is: “**Don’t do New York City dirty — trash your trash.**” One of the people who came up with it is [Pam Harris](https://www.sanitationfoundation.org/our-team), the president of the Sanitation Foundation, a nonprofit that works closely with the city’s Department of Sanitation.

# Harris, who helped think up the Knicks’ “Go, New York, Go” motto in the 1990s, talks about “creating a culture of cleanliness.”

**“It’s not going to happen today or this month,” she said. “We have to start sometime.”**

And somewhere, which turned out to be Cooper Square in Manhattan. The foundation, working with Team Epiphany, a marketing agency, set up an installation there called the “Dirty Truth Street Exhibit.” It features larger-than-life sculptures of everyday trash — the shoulder-high core of an apple, an outsize blue-and-white coffee cup and a damaged-looking MetroCard, among other items. The installation, with plaques explaining how real trash is not just an eyesore, will be open on Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Echoing Harris’s idea about changing the culture on littering were Sanitation Department officials who joined her at the exhibit, among them the acting commissioner, Javier Lojan. Two City Council members, Shaun Abreu and Erik Bottcher, were also on hand.

“People think New York just has to be dirty,” Joshua Goodman, a deputy sanitation commissioner, said before the gathering. “If someone comes in from Boston or Amsterdam or Tokyo and says to you, ‘Why do New Yorkers live this way,’ for far too long, our answer as New Yorkers was, ‘How dare you tell me that I should do something differently.’”

# “It’s not piles of black bags on sidewalks, it’s not even the rats,” he said. “It’s the cynicism that we cannot have a better city. It’s not as if dropping litter on the street is some sort of New York City birthright.”

Bottcher said he was on the way home from the gym one night recently **when a driver opened his car door and threw a coffee cup on the pavement.** Bottcher, without identifying himself, said something like, “Come on, man.”

“He proceeded to tell me where to go and how to get there,” Bottcher said. “What is it that makes someone think they can just put trash on the streets?”

Goodman said that the Sanitation Department had accelerated enforcement: Notices of cleanliness violations are up 60 percent from when the Adams administration took office in 2022. The department now uses cameras to issue violation notices to the owners of vehicles that litter is thrown from.

But roadside trash is only a fraction of the litter in New York. A survey for the Sanitation Foundation found that 83 percent of New Yorkers consider littering a problem, but 38 percent of those questioned admitted to littering. The survey also found that 18-to-34-year-olds were the most likely to be chronic litterers.

Harris said that the “Don’t do New York City dirty” campaign was “the start of a generational change.” She said she had studied other antilittering efforts, notably the “Don’t mess with Texas” campaign in the 1980s. “‘Don’t mess with Texas’ got to be such a successful slogan that many Texans forgot it had to do with litter,” she said, “because it tapped so perfectly into Texans’ pride. They thought it was, like, from the Alamo.”

Besides the commercials and videos for the “Don’t do New York dirty” campaign, the city will put images with the slogan on sanitation trucks and on LinkNYC kiosks. The advertising agency Arnold NY put the commercials together with video directed by Nicolas Heller, the film director and social media personality known as New York Nico.",1,1751739644.0,Keralaunfiltered,1,1.0,False

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM!!

Note: I am not good at chatting online and prefer to meet and talk. So if you are looking for online chat buddy, we will waste each other time.",1,1751739516.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

They don’t ask. They order.
They don’t say “let’s go out”. They make plans without me.
They don’t see me.
I’m invisible.

The other day, I asked a guy I considered a friend if he wanted to go for coffee. He said no. Later, someone else asked him and he said yes instantly. That tiny moment shattered something in me.

It wasn’t about the coffee.
It was about the reality that no one actually wants me around.

And this isn’t one isolated moment. It’s a pattern.
Years of it.

People talk down to me.
They exclude me.
I’m the “nice guy” who always gets treated like shit disrespected, walked over, ignored.

Sometimes, I just want to scream.

Other times…
I think about hurting myself.
Not to end it. But just to feel something again.
Because the loneliness? It numbs you.
You stop feeling human. You stop believing you're worth kindness.

There are moments I wonder if I disappeared  would anyone even care?

I’ve tried so hard to be good to others. I speak kindly. I support people even when I’m falling apart. But I’ve never received the same back. Not once.

I’ve lived years without love, without real connection, without respect.
And I don’t know how much more I can take.

But deep inside, there’s a voice  the only one left  whispering:

Don’t give up yet. There’s still more to your story.



So I’m here, writing this.
Not for attention. Not for pity.
Just so someone out there might say the words I’ve been dying to hear:

You’re not invisible. I see you. I care that you exist.

Because right now, I don’t believe anyone does.


(To anyone reading don’t worry):

I’m not in immediate danger. I just needed a place to speak honestly, without being shut down.
I’m holding on barely but I’m here.

Wine is made from fruits, right 😉? Yeah a coffee is a fruit.

So today let's see how to make wine from coffee 🙄

Coffee wine is made from the red coffee cherry husks

That's after pulping the coffee cherry you separate the beans from the husks (waste)

And these are our raw materials for coffee wine 😚

Then we proceed to making coffee wine

1. select ripe coffee pulp  
   Use freshly collected, ripe coffee cherry pulp. Avoid moldy or underripe material.

2. wash and sanitize  
   Rinse the pulp to remove dirt or debris. Sanitize all equipment thoroughly.

3. crush the pulp  
   Lightly mash or crush the pulp to release some juices, but don’t turn it into a paste.

4. add water  
   Mix the pulp with clean boiled and cooled water (roughly 1:2 pulp to water ratio).

5. add sugar  
   Add sugar based on your desired alcohol content. About 1 to 1.5 kg of sugar per 5 liters of liquid works well.

6. add wine yeast  
   Stir in activated wine yeast (like Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Avoid baker's yeast.

7. primary fermentation  
   Let the mixture ferment in a loosely covered bucket or container for 5 to 7 days. Stir daily.

8. strain and transfer  
   Strain out the solids. Pour the liquid into an airtight container with an airlock for secondary fermentation.

9. secondary fermentation  
   Leave it for 3 to 6 weeks until fermentation slows and clears.

10. rack and clarify  
   Siphon off clear wine into another clean container, leaving sediment behind. Repeat if needed.

11. bottle and age  
   Once stable, bottle the wine. Age for at least 2 to 3 months to improve taste.

Coffee wine has a unique flavor — earthy, tart, and slightly fruity depending on the variety.

But remember the older the wine the high the ka price 😉

For non alcoholic like me

To make non-alcoholic wine from coffee pulp, you’ll skip or limit fermentation to avoid alcohol formation. Here's a simple method:

1. select ripe coffee pulp  
   Use fresh, clean, ripe pulp (husks of the coffee cherries).

2. wash and sanitize  
   Rinse thoroughly. Clean all tools and containers to avoid contamination.

3. crush and soak  
   Lightly crush the pulp and soak it in clean water (1 part pulp to 2 parts water) for 24–48 hours at room temperature.

4. add flavor boosters (optional)  
   Add natural ingredients like cinnamon, cloves, or lemon peel for flavor.

5. sweeten  
   Add sugar or natural sweeteners to taste. You can dissolve it in warm water before mixing.

6. gently heat (pasteurize)  
   Heat the mixture to around 70–75°C for 10–15 minutes. This helps preserve it and prevents fermentation. Do not boil.

7. strain and cool  
   Strain the liquid to remove solids. Let it cool completely.

8. bottle and refrigerate  
   Pour into sterilized bottles and refrigerate. Best consumed within 7–10 days.

This gives you a refreshing, fruity, and antioxidant-rich non-alcoholic wine.",1,1751739320.0,UgandanDream,0,1.0,False
