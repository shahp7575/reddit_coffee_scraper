I have read quite a few night shift experiences and tips on the internet and have narrowed down people usually 1. Stay up their first day off 2. Nap until the afternoon & go to bed either early or at their normal day bedtime on their first day off 3. Maintain a late night schedule ie. Bedtime at 2am on off days/wake 10a. I am very torn on which option would be best for me considering my schedule!

I have had 1 night shift; However, I stayed up with my daughter for nearly 2 years having mostly 3-5 hours of broken sleep until this year where I get 6-7. I know that I cannot function on 4 hours of sleep and get depressed, SI etc. I also lost 20 lbs and want to maintain/continue to workout. I'd also like to drop off OR pick up my daughter and have coverage for both.

I cannot self schedule and most of my shifts are 3 days in a row and 2-3 days off. daycare drop off is 7:30a and pick up is 5p. 

My first shift i had a very broken up 3 hour nap (probably anxiety), up at 4:30 naturally. Ate my regular meals but didn't have coffee until dinner at 6. Worked 7-7:30. Had a protein bar for break, small protein pizza thing for lunch break. Lots of water, no caffeine. 2-4 I felt a little sleepy but didn't feel weird until 7 ie. Starving/anxious. Stopped fluids around then and had breakfast at 8a. Tried half dose magnesium glycinate and slept 9:30a-1p naturally. I went about my day and ended with a family walk.

Machine: Breville Bambino Plus  
Grinder: Eureka Mignon Zero 

Puck prep routine: 

* grind beans into 53.3mm dosing cup
* flip into 54mm bottomless portafilter
* use a manual WDT tool with 0.25mm needles (i do this very thoroughly)
* place a 53.3mm gravity distribution tool on top of coffee grounds and wait for it to sink, press it down to flatten it (which is needed for larger doses) and then spin it a few times
* tamp grounds with a 53.3mm calibrated tamper (normcore v4.1 - 30lbs spring)
* add a 53mm paper filter on top of tamped bed
* add a 53.3mm / 1.7mm puck screen on top of paper filter

So what am I likely doing wrong? I feel like my routine is very detailed and precise, with equipment that is supposed to reduce channeling.

Most wallet phone cases will not significantly affect the iPhone 13's signal strength. The phone's antennas are designed to function effectively even with the added layer of a case.

The cleaning and maintenance requirements vary depending on the material of the wallet phone case. Leather cases should be cleaned with a leather cleaner while synthetic materials are best cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap.

I had went to see the Beyonce Cowboy Carter Tour with a prepaid hotel stay at the Mardi Gras hotel and casino just off the strip from that Thursday night to till later that sunday the 27th after seeing the final two shows of the concert. Before my trip I had paid for the round trip flight and the 4 night 3 day stay. I had booked everything earlier in the year before I was sadly laid off from my non profit job in June a week after my birthday on the 16th. If it was not for my unemployment still being pending (to this day) I would have had more than enough to get me by however I was left to my own devices and already  frugal lifestyle being upped an anti as I was entering the city of Las Vegas. Basically this is how it happened

Thursday- 
landed in Vegas at 9 pm walked from the airport to my hotel 1 1/2- 2 hour walk. 
I met up with fellow Beyonce fans and walked from my motel to the cosmopolitan to meet up 
We basically walked around the entire Caesars palace main floor before  going back to our hotels. 
I walked back to my motel then went to sleep.

Harry Reid International Airport → Mardi Gras Hotel
	•	About 3.2 miles walking.

2. Mardi Gras Hotel → Caesars Palace
	•	About 1.5 miles.

3. Caesars Palace → Mardi Gras Hotel
	•	Same as above: 1.5 miles.


Friday-

Woke up at 5 am to walk to the target where I would do my food and hydration shopping and getting whatever I needed for my stay with the $50 gift card and take in the strip properly before sunrise 

Tried to shamelessly sneak in to the holiday inn on tropicana across from MGM for possible free breakfast before target opened but was denied entry went back to target and got the following:
1. A 6 pack of liquid IV 
2. A bag of pita chips
3. Roasted garlic hummus 
4. Oui vanilla and chocolate chips yogurt 
5. A pack of honey wheat sliced bread
6. A travel sandalwood body wash on clearance 
7. 3 bottles of Aquafina waters
8. (This was the only place I could get proper caffeine) stopped at the Starbucks in the target and got a A venti caramel iced coffee it was less than 9 dollars compared to the 15 here in Seattle 
9. 1/2 lb pack of sliced uncured honey ham 
Walked back to the Mardi Gras around 8-9
Took an hour break to hydrate devoured 2 sandwiches.
Shamelessly told a 108 bus driver I only had 50 cents to get to Fremont Street and was granted a ride thankfully.
Took pictures, attempted to get back to my hotel 
The bus driver on my way back did not let me on the bus so I was forced to walk back to my hotel.
Arrived at my hotel around 12 took an hour rest to elevate my feet and hydrate 
Took a shower put my simple merch tee and shorts outfit with my cowboy hat, my remaining 2 bottles of water with extra liquid IV in them made 2 sandwiches and went to find the “free tram” everyone was talking about to get to the allegiant stadium however I didn’t realize I had to walk to Excalibur to catch the tram. Obviously I went in as many hotels and casinos to get Air conditioning as I made my way however I did end up walking from paradise rd down to flamingo rd took a right and walked to the other side of the strip where I then walked through the cosmo/the aria/t mobile arena where I sincerely was met with the most challenging and brutal part of my entire trip that challenged me mentally and physically. That last stretch going from the aria out to t mobile arena and to Excalibur most definitely gave me heat exhaustion and even a slight anxiety attack from the heat at one point before I arrived at the tram I needed to take. 
Regained my strength and got some complimentary lemon water at mandalay before tracking over that god forsaken bridge.
Had the time of my life at the concert in the club 100 level 
Walked back to my motel.
Saturday:
Woke up at 12pm from being out like a buggg I was knocked out HARDER than I ever have in my life it was the best sleep I’ve ever had 😭😂.
Spent the whole afternoon in my motel room eating sandwiches and listening to Beyonce unaware of THE LIFE CHANGING SHOW OF MY LIFE.
Took an uber paid for by a fellow concert attendee I met the night before that was staying at the same hotel as me.
Saw JayZ, Shaboozey, DESTINYS CHILD 😩😱🥹 Perform and most definitely blacked out and having a mild heart palpitation humble me HARD when the girls came out and surprised us.
Walked back to the motel 
Stayed up all night debriefing and sharing my experience with some international fans on a livestream until 6am 
Packed my bags and walked to the airport and got to my flight at 1pm .

If you have made it this far I am sorry for ALL of this 😭 it was A LOT  my life is nothing short of  chaotic but I wouldn’t trade it for anything else than you so much Las Vegas it was a very interesting journey. ❤️",1,1754627463.0,vegas,0,0.57,False

Hi everyone,
I’ve been going through a really difficult medical issues at home, and I also joined  a product-based company, and my team has mostly men. Most of the women here are in managerial or staff engineer roles, with very few in senior/lead positions.

I usually finish my work and leave early because I have  responsibilities, so I don’t get much extra time to hang out. 

In the office, I’ve tried talking to a few people during lunch, but often they just answer my question and then continue talking among themselves. It feels like a “boys’ club.” . They all play foosball or carrom after work, but I’m not good at those games, and they don’t invite me. Even during work hours, I feel isolated.

I have one friend from my previous company who also works here. I talk mostly to her, but my manager once said why you are talking to her ? Why don’t you socialize . I’ve tried, but I don’t feel much interest from the others. 

Once, when I was having coffee, someone even joked that maybe me and my friend gossip together. That hurt, because I’m already trying my best just to get through each day. I don’t want to overshare my personal problems because I get emotional and cry when I talk about them.

Recently, we had a team lunch, and I ended up stuck in a car with senior directors and managers because all others went in other cars . I failed at all the games we played, and at lunch I was seated in the corner, just eating quietly. I feel like I’ve forgotten how to socialize. I wasn’t like this at my previous company ,  but now, between new job , going through so much at home, and joining an already tight-knit team, I just feel out of place.


My manager once asked me about my grandfather health , i just told her the medical issue . I don’t want to elaborate and tell her  how i am feeling because i am very emotional and cry easily . I don’t know how they will think about me . 

Many times i go to office and feels safe to talk to  few people ( my colleague) instead of talking to all .  I do my work well , attend all session , dress up well , maybe people are thinking i am alright , but nobody knows how much time i cried on way to office or in restroom

But more than just a distribution company, the **bigger vision** is to build an **integrated digital platform** (mobile app + web app) where healthcare providers can **order all their medical and surgical supplies in one place** — seamless, transparent, and efficient.

Think of it as the **""Amazon for healthcare procurement""**, tailored for hospitals and clinics.

# Current status:

* Supplier onboarding and early customer discovery underway
* Warehousing Done
* Strong market potential identified in Bangalore and Tier 1/2 cities
* Looking to develop the tech platform MVP alongside the distribution network

# Who I’m looking for:

* **Co-founder**: Ideally someone with experience in healthcare, pharma, supply chain, or B2B tech. Bonus if you’ve worked in startups or operations. You should be Bangalore-based or willing to relocate.
* **Investor**: Angel/seed stage investor interested in healthcare innovation, B2B logistics, or SaaS-backed distribution models.

This space is ripe for disruption, and I’m committed to building something impactful and scalable. If you’re interested, or know someone who might be, let’s connect — happy to chat over a call or coffee.

1mklb80,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingAU/comments/1mklb80/how_do_you_balance_night_shift_while_studying/,How do you balance night shift while studying,"I'm contemplating accepting an offer for a role as AIN in a hospital, I'm super excited as it would be my first nursing related role as a student! But the only thing is they let me know that I won't be rostered on my TAFE days but overnight shifts are non negotiable for other days of the week

I've never worked a night shift job before, the latest I've ever worked is up to 2am as a bartender, but they let me know that night shifts there are 10pm-7am.

I don't know if I should accept it or not as I already struggle to balance personal life, TAFE assignments and work, but I realise it's such a good opportunity and I should probably take it, so can anyone please give me tips on how to manage night shifts?

For example, do you stay up the day after and sleep early the next night, or nap during the morning? And How do you maintain energy throughout nights without completely messing up your sleep schedule, is it okay to eat or have coffee throughout the night?

1mklaw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1mklaw9/a_guide_on_how_to_potentially_survive_your_first/,A guide on how to (potentially) survive your first year at UC Davis (Ver. 2.0 for 2025-2026),"As the title states this will be a more updated version for Freshmen coming to Davis this Fall through Spring quarter with tips and tricks on how to survive both mentally and physically while attending UC Davis. I have updated this from the previous year. I will say now that I am no way of saying you should follow what I have to say to the T and that these are just what I believe what newcomers may expect and how to handle University.

**Money/Expenses**

Ok so a majority of students nowadays are really worried about money so i'll start off by saying that if you don't have that much money to pay for the year then **ITS OK TO TAKE OUT LOANS.** Granted its best to avoid them whenever possible but when push comes to shove and you're struggling to pay tuition, then by all means get loans specifically University and Subsidized loans since those covers loan interest rates up until you graduate or drop out of university and have a 6 month grace period, so you will be able to work it off if you decide to work part time in the University.

I'll first warn Freshmen that a lot of places especially Downtown Davis particularly run on Credit/Debit card payments but a good amount of them do tend to run on physical cash especially at the Market. In order to save money, you guys have to realize that buying (let alone paying for goods and services in Downtown Davis especially) is a luxury. Everything there while not crazy expensive is still pricey (especially that cookie place which I personally think is overrated and overpriced) and will take a toll on your wallet.

I'm not saying to avoid going and paying all together but make a plan and keep track of your expenses in a sheets document. You can also apply for a job working at Davis to cover the cost of tuition and Loans (Job salary ranges from 16 to even 20\~ Dollars an hour varying on job type) However hours are limiting to 19.5 hours a week as a part time student working on campus since any more than 20 then the University will have to add health benefits and a handful of labor laws or overtime pay requirements.

There is also quite a bit homeless in Downtown Davis and also a good amount of people who ask for money (My first experience with this was when I was going to Trader Joe's in the fall and was stopped to donate to a children's sports clothing i think, gave them around 20 dollars and then later a group of men at the silo bus stop who sells CD's but I declined it). If you feel like you can spare them a dollar or two to their cause I won't even be mad at you it's fine, it's your money but remember your in college and money is just as important to you as it is to them. It may be selfish but take it from me, **IT'S OK TO BE SELFISH** once in a while if it means you get to use that money to benefit yourself. Just know that you're also struggling for money so focus on yourself before others if you want to get ahead or stay on track with college. What I'm saying is selfish, but it is what it is.

**Mental Health**

This one's pretty straightforward. Many people deal with the mental strain of handling university while trying to balance it with their personal lives and it's important to talk about. A negative mindset can have a negative effect on a person's lives. If you need to, take time for yourself, hang out with people who actually care about you and get some help. If you think that University is too much for you, have a chat with your councilors and take time off to focus on your wellbeing. University is important, but so is yourself and your sanity. Never ever doubt yourself, you are enough.

**Schedule**

So, I may be a little late for this, but a good schedule is critical when planning for your first quarters in the year. Each individual student is given a pass time 1 and a pass time 2, for pass time 1 the limit is 17 Units with the minimum of 12 to get the full financial aid package with Pass time 2 used to make quick adjustments or add more classes up to 19 units with maximum you can take in open hours afterwards is 28.5 units. I recommend you take a minimum of 12 Units per quarter your first years with classes being no later than 11AM since that will be manageable to get the feel on how your class structure will be later down the quarter. To decide what classes to take go to My Degree on the UC Davis page to see the requirements you need to graduate and or go to reddit and see what classes are recommended. I would like to say that not all classes will be easy, this is a University and Difficulty is a given with any class you choose. This is also a good segway to say that not all classes will be open for registration and will most likely put you on a waiting list. If the list is low and your around the top 5 people then go for it but make sure you have a backup class to fill in the units if no spots are open right when classes start. You have all the 4 years as well as summer sessions to make up for what you may not get to right away.

**Food and Drinks**

OK, I love food as much as the next person I come across, so it's important to understand that this is very much important in Davis. If you already living in the dorms then you most likely have signed up for a meal plan which will save you a lot of headaches. You can use your meal plan as much as you like at any DC over the days its available since its unlimited and a plus is that you can go get a hydro flask and save on beverages by going over to the fountain drinks and filling it up (IDK if that's aloud but hey no one has stopped me or others from doing this so its aloud as far as I'm aware). You can save a drink (or several) in empty bottle for future consumption. They also have a coffee machine, so there should be (practically) no reason you should buy yourself a coffee maker or Starbucks.

If, however, you don't have a meal plan or are tired of the food provided by the Dining Commons, then I have made a small list that can help:

* If you're a student worker, then you will most likely have at maximum 10 employee meal swipes per 2 weeks depending on how many hours you worked. Only one can be used a day which is the equivalent of $15 aggie cash, so you can use that to buy snacks, breakfast food, packaged sushi, and many other items as long as they are at ot below $15.
* There's an AMPM right next to Cuarto DC that offers .99 cent on refills for a XXL cup that you can use as many times as you like as long as you showed it to the cashier beforehand.
* There are Residential Markets that you can spend aggie cash at (only for people who have a meal plan). You receive $200 aggie cash that can be used at any markets (which itself have different variety of foods and beverages)
* There is both a Target and a Trader Joe's, both of which have cheap variety of foods that you can prepare yourselves in the kitchen (Target for Candy, Frozen food, Seasoning, and Beef, Trader Joe's for Meat, Fish and Oil, etc) Fruit, Milk, beverages, and ice cream are already provided at the DC and/or Residential Markets.
* There are also 2 Dollar Tree's in Davis that both sell snacks and other items for around $1.25. It may not be good as the ones in Target or Trader Joe's, but there are ingredients that are cheap to get like Oil, Utensiles, cups and bowls, shampoo, etc.
* A small list of cheap food items around Davis: Little Creasers (pizza), Pink Dozen (Donuts and Croissants), Open Rice Kitchen (Asian foods), Jack in The Box (My personal favorite with Tacos and yes Burgers as an ok alternative), In N Out (Burgers and Fries)
* Bonus: Raising Cane's (Chicken and I consider this a luxury item just for how expensive it is compared to the portion size). 

**Fraternity/Sorority**

This topic I'm not too sure of myself since I'm not one for Greek life but there are a few friends that I know who have been with or are in a Fraternity or Sorority. I don't know much about Sororities but there was a comment that I'm going to copy and paste here about them that someone wrote on the previous years reddit post: ""There are a variety of Greek orgs and it’s not limited to your stereotypical social frat or sorority. Davis has a wide option of cultural and professional Greek orgs! There is a no tolerance hazing policy at Davis and all Panhellenic sororities adhere to a DEI code where we strictly recruit based on values. Some sororities have been put on probation in the past for hazing and bullying incidents, but I promise if you are able to feel it out during recruitment and look for a good group of girls rather than the most popular house, you will find an amazing group of people. As for obligations, these usually just mean you have to show up to a certain number of philanthropy events and other chapter events, like meetings or sisterhoods.""

Surprisingly enough male Fraternities sounded pretty much the same. All I have heard were good things about a majority of frats (Except for like 2 for some reason but I don't know their names) A good place to start is to take part in rush and see for yourself. As far as I'm aware it's just trials to get a feel for the frats like asking out a girl to a frat or getting blind folded in the dark??? (my friend's words not mine and it may vary from frat to frat).

If you want my two cents, then I would check them out yourselves to get the feel for the Fraternity/Sorority. They are a good way to meet new people, and you may benefit from it, but please do be safe and possibly bring a roommate or a close friend you know just to be on the safe side.

**Relationships/Friendships**

Okey for last year's post I left this as ""Good Luck"" but now that I significantly matured (To an extent) and having to live through my own trials and loss of friends over the course of my academic years at Davis, I think I now have to say about this.

For romantic relationships, I'm no expert so honestly, I’d say just go with the flow. I don’t even know how to get into one myself, lol. But if it happens, let it happen naturally. Don’t force it, and don’t feel pressured to have it all figured out.

As for friendships, it really depends on the people and the circumstances. Sometimes you make friends during assigned class discussions or lab work. Other times, it’s as simple as saying “Hi” to someone you see often outside your dorms, when at a DC, or even when cooking at the residential kitchen, and that small moment can spark something meaningful.

But sometimes, you may have to say goodbye to a friend or two. Maybe you just grew apart. Maybe you argued over a misunderstanding that could’ve been resolved if you’d both approached it differently. Maybe they stopped responding to you either to focus on their schoolwork or because you two simply had different ideologies that didn't aligned. I want you to know that these things happen. Like I said before, I’ve been through it myself.

And while it hurts, it also teaches you about communication, about boundaries, about who you are and what kind of people you want around you. Growth like this isn’t always comfortable, but it’s necessary. So, if you’re going through something similar, just know you’re not alone and that you’ll come out stronger on the other side. The most important thing about being at university and making friends, something that most people can often forget about anyways, is that no matter how many friends you do lose along the way, you can always make more, with even stronger bonds.

**Jobs/Work**

As stated previously having a job is a benefit to you when going to university since your making money while studying at the university. Thats being said you don't necessarily need to have a job, It will help you greatly to get one but some people will be overwhelmed balancing work and studying, so do think twice before coming to that decision and getting a job. I recommend people who do decide to get a job to look through Handshake for any on campus jobs due to them being very flexible and genuinely great hours. Other than that, LinkedIn as well as in person drop off resumes with availability hours at any help wanted places in Downtown Davis will help.

You may want to send out your Job application to wherever you choose to work earlier by ill say 1-2 Months before the start of classes since the process is pretty slow and takes months to get a response back. Always choose more than one job you are qualified for to have the best possible chance of getting hired (If you get more than one job application accepted, then choose the one you think will benefit you more, its ok to reject and accepting application so don't worry too much on that) If you do get a job, bring your state issued ID and SSN Card or birth certificate to show proof of individual identity during the hiring process to be hired and be on record.

You can also make money as a Freelancer at Davis! It can be anything you put your mind to really. I used to have a friend who made money by doing clients nails and making around $40-$60 per person depending on what style or accessories they wanted. The key here is doing a task which most people or society thinks are valuable, and while that happens seize that idea and provide a service for it. You also have to work around a schedule and if you can manage that, you can earn money. It may take time to actually get some traction, manage reasonable prices, and pay for supplies, but if you keep it up and with enough luck on your side, you can make it happen!

TLDR: Find something that people want, and you give it to them for a price. That way both of you come out with something valuable.

**Clubs**

Clubs in itself are just a way on meeting new people and having a group of buddies to be with to cool off from the classes at Davis (like Fraternity/Sorority but without the drinking, occasionally). A club that I recommend is DAC (Davis Anime Club) Where people usually go there to socialize about anything anime, have fun at little events, and go to various places to just have fun as a group (and watch anime during club hours of course). In short join a club only if you have time to go to it, there are tons of clubs at Davis that may be of interest for you.

  
**Transportation**

Davis is widely known as the ""Bike School"" and it does live up to it! You're going to need to get from point A to Point B very often, especially when it comes to classes or stores. With that being said, the most obvious transportation needed is a bike, so long as you practice riding it beforehand to prevent any crashing. And while this is quite common, most students tend to use Busses to get to far places as well, so long as you now where the bus will be headed by memorizing its routes. You could also walk like how I was doing it the first 2 years at Davis. It may be the slowest known transportation method there is but man it has done wonders for my legs and cardio.

There is also Amtrak, while not primary used for school transportation, it is good for getting to the Bay and enjoying a break from classes. It can also be used for cheap traveling across California which is preferred if you want to save money and can't afford a plane ticket. Just be sure to purchase a seat in advance.

**Final recommendations**

* Don't bring coffee maker, too many cloths, bed mattress, or too many of one particular item.
* Do bring an extra pair of shoes, rain boots, Umbrella, medical kits, warm blankets, and Pillows
* You can potentially sell some of your personal items on Facebook Marketplace, Offer Up, or in the Buy-Sell-Trade on the UC Davis Housing Discord server but it will take some time to sell.
* Yes, people do wear revealing clothing during parties and holiday events (Including the men).
* No, it is not safe for anyone to walk at Davis at pitch black night, have a buddy system especially for women.
* Yes, all nighters are as harrowing as it is and no it does not get easier and no you don't build a resistance to it by normal means, avoid it whenever possible.
* Make time to exercise, trust me your future self and immune system will thank me later.
* For the LOVE OF ALL OF DAVIS PLEASE SLEEP!!! As stated previously you're going to be busy depending on classes, so its important to get a goods night rest and recharge.
* If you have a lot of stuff to move back into your home somewhere far away, may i suggest outing it in a neatly sealed box or two and shipping them out via UPS or USPS postal service? Trust me saves on gas and luggage
* Don't spend too much money on dates. You don't need to take someone anywhere fancy or expensive, it just needs to be thoughtful where the two of you can have a simple chat and get to know one another. If they ask for money or insist on going to an expensive place they REALLY want to go to, then either find someone else or risk it and cave to their desires. Just be careful with who you go with.
* You'll occasionally see someone who smokes, that's just a fact. You don't NEED to smoke, and most places don't allow you to, but if you're going to, just make sure it's somewhere where you can't harm the wildlife or start a fire.

Some observations:

* it does not work at the same time as the brewer, so either froth before brew or after brew
* I like frothing before brew, and pour a little of the unfoamed milk from the bottom and scoop some of the foam with spoon into the mug before I brew the coffee - doing this also makes the finished product look nice
* I don't always stick with the 2oz espresso size, but thats just my preference and while it may not be a true latte/cappuchino but it still good coffee and bonus is that the coffee is hotter because the milk is warm

Me and my crew are looking to put up flyers and provide small cards with info for a local anime convention taking place in October, and we're trying to figure out the best locations to distribute a lot of our paper adverts we have on hand!

We're not terribly experienced with the best spots unfortunately, and we recognize a lot of advertisement is strongest via ads online or in person events, but the ability to distribute these to variety, coffee shops & general nerd hangouts feel like an earnest way to get our stuff seen nowadays among a small group of individuals.

Plus, it also helps as I wanna be able to help my team reach out to more communities effectively.

Should I just give up on Airbnb while my kid is little?,"This happened a month ago and I'm still so confused. My family (spouse and one toddler age child) stayed in an Airbnb from June 26 - July 4 (we checked out on the 4th). I informed the host prior to booking that we had a kid with us, and asked for the crib and high chair that they provided on request. The place was fine, but my kid kept bumping their head on the coffee table and pulling on the wires on some of the lamps in the living room, so we moved them off to the side of the room to keep them out of reach. The house rules asked us only to put dirty dishes in the dishwasher and towels in the washer, which we did prior to check out. We also put all the lamps and coffee table back to where they were originally placed (or so I thought). We spent the morning before we checked out cleaning up, and thought we did a decent job - took out the trash and recycling, wiped down counters and sinks, and there wasn't any visible mess as far as I could tell. We were also charged a fairly hefty cleaning fee. 

A few days later, I got a pretty nasty review from the host telling me that their cleaner was really upset about how messy the house was, and how they had to move the lamps back and it took really long to clean on July 4. I really don't think the house was that bad, and how is it my problem that they had to clean on the 4th? The host knew our dates before approving our booking. I don't understand how moving a few lamps back into position is a big deal? Also if they want to the house to be spotless then why charge a cleaning fee?

1mkkvru,https://i.redd.it/rmlpjrzovphf1.png,Advice on Old Allergy,"So to explain, when I was a kid, I had a red food dye allergy that resulted in a range from mild to severe hives. At the time, I avoided a lot of foods that had red dye in them, but since it's kind of in everything, I just slowly started eating small bits of it at a time, until at some point I was eating normal amounts of it and not having reactions anymore.

I'm in college now, and in my first year, I would have random reactions here and there with mild itching (very rarely was it true full-blown hives), and it was always when I had eaten something that contained red dye. Now, what I felt like was weird was that I wasn't having a reaction every single time I ate something with red dye in it, just occasionally, so I just kind of brushed it off since it didn't really affect me at all.

As shown in the image, this year (second year), I had a pretty bad allergic reaction with hives everywhere, and I felt a little dizzy, but the symptoms subsided after a little bit. The hives had started around my stomach (like they normally would), but spread to my back, chest, and arms last. To be fair, I had only had two cups of coffee and an entire bag of hot cheetos at the end of the day (it was a long day), so I'm not sure if that contributed to how bad the reaction was, since all I had really eaten was the hot cheetos. After that reaction, I was a little hesitant around foods with red dye in them, but ultimately decided to try it again in a small quantity, and nothing happened. I even had hot cheetoes again recently (a smaller bag this time though, I had eaten earlier in the day, and hadn't consumed any coffee), but no reaction.

Should I be consulting an allergist? I don't really know if hives are really a reason to be concerned, and I'm a little put off by how on and off the allergy is. I don't have an EpiPen, so I wasn't sure if maybe I should be looking into getting one prescribed.",1,1754624626.0,FoodAllergies,2,0.99,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best outdoor tile tables combine aesthetic appeal with robust construction and weather resistance. The tables featured in this review showcase a range of materials and designs, each offering unique advantages.

**Tile Material and Design:** The quality and type of tile used significantly impacts the table's appearance and durability.

Outdoor tile tables often feature ceramic, porcelain, or natural stone tiles. Ceramic tiles are a cost-effective option, offering a variety of colors and patterns. Porcelain tiles are denser and more resistant to moisture and staining, making them ideal for harsher climates. Natural stone tiles, such as slate or travertine, provide a unique and luxurious look, but require more maintenance. The design of the tile, whether a simple geometric pattern or an intricate mosaic, contributes to the table's overall aesthetic. Tables with UV-resistant tile coatings maintain their vibrant colors and prevent fading over time.

**Frame Material and Construction:** The frame provides structural support and affects the table's stability and longevity.

Most outdoor tile tables utilize frames made of powder-coated steel, aluminum, or wrought iron. Powder-coated steel offers excellent strength and durability, while aluminum is lightweight and rust-resistant. Wrought iron provides a classic, elegant look but requires regular maintenance to prevent rust. The frame's construction, including the welding and joinery, is crucial for ensuring stability and preventing wobbling. Tables with adjustable feet allow for leveling on uneven surfaces.

**Table Size and Shape:** The dimensions of the table should suit the intended use and the available space.

Outdoor tile tables come in various sizes and shapes, including round, square, rectangular, and oval. Round tables are ideal for intimate gatherings, while rectangular tables are better suited for larger groups. The size of the table should be proportional to the seating area and allow for comfortable dining or entertaining. Smaller side tables are perfect for placing drinks and snacks, while larger dining tables can accommodate full meals.

**Weather Resistance and Maintenance:** The table should withstand outdoor elements and require minimal upkeep.

The best outdoor tile tables are designed to withstand rain, sun, and temperature fluctuations. Look for tables with weather-resistant grout and sealed tile surfaces to prevent water damage and staining. Powder-coated frames provide protection against rust and corrosion. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is typically sufficient to maintain the table's appearance. Tables with removable tile inserts are easier to clean and repair.

Key features of the best outdoor tile tables include:
* Durable tile surfaces
* Sturdy frame construction
* Weather-resistant materials
* Variety of sizes and shapes

## Core Benefits

Outdoor tile tables offer several practical benefits that make them a valuable addition to any outdoor space. These benefits include durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of maintenance.

**Enhanced Durability:** Tile surfaces are highly resistant to scratches, stains, and fading, ensuring long-lasting beauty.

Outdoor tile tables are designed to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. The tile surface is resistant to scratches from everyday objects, such as plates and utensils. Stains from spills, such as wine or juice, can be easily wiped away without leaving permanent marks. The UV-resistant tile coatings prevent fading from prolonged sun exposure, maintaining the table's vibrant colors for years to come. This durability ensures that the table remains in excellent condition, even with frequent use.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** The intricate tile designs add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any outdoor setting.

The unique tile patterns and colors can transform a simple patio into a stylish outdoor living space. The variety of tile designs, from classic geometric patterns to intricate mosaics, allows you to choose a table that complements your personal style and existing decor. The tile surface provides a smooth and elegant look that enhances the overall aesthetic of your outdoor area. This aesthetic appeal makes outdoor tile tables a focal point of any outdoor setting.

**Ease of Maintenance:** The smooth tile surface is easy to clean and requires minimal upkeep.

The tile surface is non-porous and resistant to staining, making it easy to clean with mild soap and water. Spills and messes can be quickly wiped away without leaving permanent marks. The weather-resistant materials require minimal upkeep, preventing rust and corrosion. Regular cleaning is typically sufficient to maintain the table's appearance, saving you time and effort.

## FAQs Section

Answering common questions about outdoor tile tables can help potential buyers make informed decisions. This section addresses some of the most frequently asked questions.

**Are outdoor tile tables suitable for all climates?**

Yes, outdoor tile tables are generally suitable for all climates, but the specific materials used should be considered. Tables with porcelain tiles are more resistant to moisture and freezing temperatures, making them ideal for colder climates. Tables with powder-coated frames offer protection against rust and corrosion in humid or coastal environments. Proper maintenance, such as covering the table during extreme weather conditions, can extend its lifespan.

**How do I clean and maintain an outdoor tile table?**

Cleaning an outdoor tile table is simple and straightforward. Use a mild soap and water solution to wipe down the tile surface regularly. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the tile or grout. For stubborn stains, use a specialized tile cleaner. To prevent rust on metal frames, apply a rust inhibitor periodically. Covering the table during the off-season can help protect it from the elements.

**Can I repair a cracked or damaged tile on my outdoor table?**

Yes, cracked or damaged tiles can be repaired or replaced. Small cracks can be filled with epoxy or tile sealant. For more significant damage, the entire tile may need to be replaced. You can purchase replacement tiles from a tile supplier or hardware store. Ensure that the replacement tile matches the original in terms of size, color, and pattern. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for tile replacement, or consult with a professional tile installer.

1mkktj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mkktj0/quitting_caffeine_are_these_symptoms_or_something/,Quitting caffeine: are these symptoms or something else?,"So almost a year ago I had a really bad panic attack for the first time in my life. It was delta 8 induced, from a gummy. Took too much and had a panic attack one night by myself and it was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. Post panic attack, and even up until now, I’ve felt my anxiety has skyrocketed on a daily basis. I’ve also had random feelings of derealization, etc. 


I’ve tried on and off to quit caffeine altogether, it made my skyrocketed anxiety even worse but I was addicted to the initial feeling of coffee like most people are. 

Currently I’ve been off coffee a little over a month now, and it’s been absolute hell. My anxiety is insane, I get home from work and can’t relax at all or do anything productive. But at the same time I’m not sure if it’s caffeine withdrawal. I was always sensitive to caffeine, one cup and I’d be lit like a Christmas tree. So not really understanding how withdrawal from one cup a day is making me like this. I have a lot of depressing thoughts, not suicidal, just a lot of scary thoughts like something bad is gonna happen, which feels like it’s from the anxiety. 

Tbh I’m just a mess and I’m not sure what the source of this is? Is it just general anxiety that has lingered a while from the panic attack I had or is the caffeine withdrawal that bad for me? I think quitting caffeine right now is basically a catch 22 situation with the anxiety, anxiety with it & anxiety trying to quit it 

Just asking in this sub if they’ve ever experienced withdrawal symptoms this bad from quitting caffeine ? ",1,1754624433.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

The problem was that earlier this afternoon, I had asked her if she wanted to go to a coffee shop with me, which she responded with sorry I'm with so and so, which was the friend she was hanging out with the day before. I thought that was weird because she had just seen her yesterday, wasn't feeling good, and then was seeing her again on the day we had plans. But she did tell me she'd see me tonight. Around 5:30 I was getting ready to go to her house at 6, when I was about to leave I got a text from her mom saying, oh her and so and so are leaving at 6:30 to go somewhere. So I spent 30 minutes getting ready, just to be canceled on for the same friend again. Her mom said I was still welcome to go over until they left. Obviously I was pissed, because we had plans that she kept canceling for the same friend. So after I got that text from her mom, I sent her that text.

The way you and your crew always stop at that weird roadside diner with the neon sign—even if it’s 30 minutes out of the way—because their pie is “life-changing”? Or how you’ve got a strict rule: whoever’s in the passenger seat has to take a photo of every kitschy billboard (“World’s Largest Ball of Twine—10 Miles Ahead!”) for the trip scrapbook? Welcome to r/RoadTripRitualsA, where the *how* of the journey matters just as much as the *where*.This isn’t a group for perfectly planned itineraries (though if you’ve got a hack to keep your road trip snacks from turning into a squished mess, spill it). It’s for the family that says a silly rhyme before hitting the highway (“Wheels on the bus go zoom, zoom, zoom—let’s not get lost, okay, Mom?”). The friends who pass around a “road trip totem”—a beat-up stuffed penguin that’s been to 47 states and smells like french fries. The solo traveler who writes a postcard to themselves at every rest stop, just to read later and remember how free the open road felt.Share your “weird but wonderful” traditions: “Every trip, we buy a magnet from the first gas station. Our fridge looks like a map now—sticky, chaotic, and full of stories.” Laugh about the rituals that went off the rails: “Planned to stargaze at that overlook? Turns out, it’s right next to a neon-lit truck stop. Oops. Still ate the s’mores, though.” Ask the big questions: “Is it a road trip rule that someone *has* to forget their toothbrush? Or is that just my family?”We get it. Road trips aren’t just about reaching the destination—they’re about the rituals that turn a drive into an adventure. Maybe your ritual is terrible (like forcing everyone to listen to your 2000s pop playlist on repeat). Maybe it’s tiny (saving the last chip in the bag for the person who drove the longest). But those little habits? They’re what make your trip *yours*.Grab your travel mug (stained with coffee, we won’t judge) and let’s swap stories. Did you 坚持 a “no screens after sunset” rule and end up playing 17 rounds of I Spy? Did you stop at every “Scenic View” sign, even the ones that just looked like a field?

So, after said coffee I hung out with a friend, and around 3 hours later my head began to hurt. I thought of the usual suspects first – being a little hungry, not drinking enough water, just plain talking too much – and didn't worry too much about it. 

I also take medication before every meal due to IBS, and I got distracted when I was about to take it and totally blanked on whether I had taken the pill or not, but took one anyway. 

Then I ate, which made my headache better for a few minutes before it got worse, and then I felt a stomachache followed by nausea and some light chills. I kneeled in front of the toilet in case I may puke and sat there for a bit until I felt a bit better. Then eventually I felt well, headache gone and everything. 

I'm not sure what happened – if it was the caffeine, if it accidentally took 2 pills, if the food didn't sit well with me – but the whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes, from feeling sick to getting much better. 

Besides being a hypochondriac, I'm also tokophobic, so random nausea is particularly scary to me. I take the combination pill and I just had my withdrawal bleed this weekend which had put me at ease. And now, I don't even want to say I'm concerned about anything because I honestly don't even want to think about it as a possibility (which would just be very very low regardless, – almost impossible – thankfully.)

Chapter 1 



“Breaking news out of Chicago, Illinois, where a high-tension playoffs basketball game between the Bulls and the Boston Celtics erupted into chaos and violence. Masked goons stormed the arena, turning the playoff game into a bloodbath. The assailants specifically targeted law enforcement and—get this—the VIP section. Targeting anyone spotted in the VIP areas of the arena. Among the confirmed fatalities: Chris Kelly of Kris Kross fame, and Senator Daniel Ken, Hawaii’s beloved legislator. Police remain baffled, offering zero leads beyond a vague plea for public cooperation. While authorities are tight-lipped, whispers are already swirling about a shadowy, possibly international, criminal enterprise…”

The grim news video played on her phone as Armoni navigated the bustling college campus. Towering buildings, draped in red banners loomed over her as students swarmed the sidewalks, buzzing with pre-game hype. Her fiery red hair, tamed (barely) beneath her headphones, zipped through the crowd, her eyes glued to the unfolding horror on her screen.Just as the reporter started rambling about ""speculation,"" a blue bubble popped up, cutting off the tragedy. It was from ""Bestest Roommate ever.""

""Turn around.""

Armoni spun on her heel, phone still clutched in one hand, sweeping her vibrant red hair out of her eyes with the other. She scanned the sea of students, past the clusters of gossiping friends and the frantic dashers hustling to class. Then, a grin spread across her face as she spotted a familiar figure. She threw a hand up, waving at her approaching friend, Kiara.

“Armoni, girl! Why are you walking so fast?”  Kiara puffed, finally catching up. “I thought we had plans to smoke before you go to your work-study, remember?”

“Girl, I’m so sorry,” Armoni said, a touch of guilt in her voice. “I totally forgot. Reggie hit me up and asked me to get to the greenhouse early today so we can study for midterms.”

A quirky knowing smile made its way onto Kiara’s face, she rolled her eyes. “Swole Reggie with the beard? Girl, look at you, turning it around like that! I never thought you would leave that hood rat ass dude you were messing with alone. Now you’re getting with a handsome, educated brother that actually wants to see you win. I’m so proud of you!”

Now it was Armoni’s turn to roll her eyes at her friend’s teasing. “Girl, it is not like that. And last I checked, you’re still dating one of those ‘hood rat’ guys I run with.”

“Yes,” Kiara said, swaying her hips in a suggestive manner. “And that's how I know y'all ain't studying for no midterms in there.”

“Emm, girl bye!” Armoni laughed.

The girls giggled at their little joke for a moment.

“Okay, I guess I’ll call up Marcus and see what he’s up to,” Kiara said, her face falling, a dramatic sigh escaping her lips.

“Why are you saying it like that? What’s the tea with you and your boo? Do you need me to check his ass real quick?” Armoni asked, already reaching for her phone.

“No, it’s not that. It’s just… Rodd has been around non-stop since his parents died. And you know how he is now. When he isn’t around you or Mark, he starts getting depressing to be around. And it’s only getting worse because Mark doesn’t want to leave his side, and they are roommates, so they hang out all the time anyway. It's just... not the vibe I want to be around. Plus, since you and Desrick started hanging out again, I can feel myself kinda drifting away from everyone myself. It's not like freshman year when we were just having fun. I have feelings for this boy now, and he wants to be there for his friend in his time of need. But is it bad that I just... don't want to be there for him too?” As Kiara spilled, she had an uncomfortable look on her face, no doubt replaying Rodd’s most recent episode. Armoni wasn't gonna push for details; the look on Kiara’s face was enough. Rodd was getting a stern talking-to later. Or maybe just a swift kick.

“I get it. Here.” Armoni reached into her bag and pulled out a small Ziploc bag with something stamped on it. It was Armoni’s personal brand of artisanal, home-grown weed.

“This shit right  here, my friend, is what I’ve been cultivating back at Mom’s. I call it ‘Space Dick,’” Armoni told her.

Kiara took the bag quickly, giving it a big sniff before shooting her an incredulous look. “You and these names girl! Goddamn, but seriously, is it as good as that ‘Purple Organism’ you had me on last month?”

Armoni smirked. “Yup, maybe even better.”

“Girl, I love you. Promise you’re going to take me with you when you run away!” Kiara insisted, clutching the bag like a winning lottery ticket.

“I swear, I wouldn't go without you.”

“I’m holding you to it! Don't let me find out, girl, haha, Muha.” Kiara laughed as she went in for a long hug and kiss. Armoni hugged her back before they went their separate ways. As she walked to the green house she couldn’t help but feel bad for her friends. Kiara, Mark and Rod were her favorite group of people. To think that her closest friend group could fall apart so soon after they had formed was a devastating worry for her. 

Up ahead, the greenhouse came into view. It was a massive glass box gleaming in the sun.  Inside, a hushed calm replaced the roar of the campus. The familiar scents of damp earth, fresh water, and a dozen different plants filled her nose, a comforting hug. But as she headed into the back area, something was off. She  pushed open the door with the ‘staff only’ sign and despite seeing an empty breakroom, a wave of irritation washed over her. A low, insistent thrumming, distinct from the greenhouse’s usual hum, vibrated through the floor. And then, the smell: a sweet, pungent cloud, far more potent than anything currently in bloom, hung thick and undeniable in the air. Reggie, you idiot. Her eyes immediately dropped to the floorboards. She nudged one with her foot, and a thin stream of artificial purple light trickled through the cracks, revealing a trapdoor.

She yanked the trapdoor open, and a wave of familiar, burning weed smell punched her in the face. She dropped down, pulling the door shut with a soft click that sealed them in. She shimmied down a short ladder into a cramped, humid space – their miniature, clandestine grow lab. Grow lights pulsed like some alien sun, bathing rows of vibrant green plants in that sickly purple glow. The air was thick, heavy with the intoxicating, very illegal aroma.

A young, bearded man with glasses and braids, shirtless, danced as he sang tunelessly to himself, meticulously trimming a budding plant with a pair of shears. A half-smoked blunt sat precariously on a pot's rim. He hadn't noticed her yet, too absorbed, too high.

""Reggie!"" Armoni hissed, the single syllable a razor blade cutting through the hum of the fans and the general buzzing in the air.

He jumped, nearly impaling a plant with his shears. His bloodshot eyes, wide as saucers, blinked slowly. ""Mon-Moni? What's up? Damn, you scared me, girl. Thought you were someone else.""

Armoni scoffed, stomping deeper into the cramped space. ""Why does our covert cultivation lab smell like a damn Wiz Khalifa concert, and why are the vents on so high?!"" Her gaze swept over the pristine setup, her fury bubbling. ""Did you forget to seal the vents? Or did you just leave the damn door ajar, you high-ass fool?""

Reggie swayed slightly, a sheepish grin plastered on his face. ""Nah, Moni, I'm just dialing in the airflow. Gettin' 'em maximum potency. And I just needed a quick hit to focus, you know? Got a little too deep in the zone."" He gestured vaguely at the plants. ""They're gonna be fire, though. Best batch yet.""

Armoni clenched her fists, fighting the urge to shake him until his braids rattled. ""Fire for the feds, maybe! You know what we've invested in here! You know the risks! This isn't your personal hotbox, Reggie! This is our entire future, our post graduation plan!"" She ran a hand over a particularly lush plant, her anger laced with a deep, protective instinct for her botanical babies.

A deliberate, insistent rapping echoed from the trapdoor above them. Then, a voice, calm and unyielding, that made Armoni's blood run cold.

""Hey, who's down there? Armoni? Reggie? Is this where you've been hiding?"" Mr. Jay's voice drifted down, annoyingly precise. ""You left the exhaust on too high, and light is bleeding through the floor.""

Reggie's jaw dropped, the last wisps of his high evaporating faster than a puff of smoke. Armoni's eyes frantically darted around the cramped space, searching for an escape that wasn't there. The potent scent of their high-grade product, moments ago their pride and joy, now felt like a suffocating blanket.

Armoni stumbled back to her dorm room a few hours later, her day and mood having taken a nosedive since morning. She slumped onto the coffee table in her common room, staring blankly out the window. Two familiar faces were sprawled on her couch: Mark, the campus football hero and low-key trap star, and Rodd, a grad student and certified pothead. These two were basically family, and they were the first ones she'd called with the tragic news.

“You're getting kicked out of school!?” both men called out in shock.

Armoni's face was a sour mess as she glared at her phone. ""I'm so fucking pissed! My last year, and then this shit happens! Fucking Reggie!""

Mr. Jay, that rule-obsessed narc, had indeed called campus security, and the whole mess had rocketed straight out of hand. Armoni wasn't surprised by Mr. Jay's snitching—the dude always had a nose for trouble and probably got off on finally catching her after being suspicious of her for years now. He probably hoped she would be thrown into jail, but Armoni had made a call of her own. She made a call to the Dean's office. The Dean surprised everyone there, waving away the police who had just arrived moments after him, along with Mr. Jay himself. What had surprised her was the sheer, icy rage in the Dean’s eyes.He wasn't mad she was slinging drugs; he was furious she'd been dumb enough to get caught.

“Armoni,” Dean Harrison had purred, his voice a low, dangerous rumble that barely masked the panic behind it. He hadn't used her full name, which somehow made it worse. “After all we've... cultivated together... this recklessness is simply unacceptable. Do you have any idea what a federal drug charge involving one of our star botany students would do to this institution? To our funding? To my career?""

He paced his office, a man used to maintaining perfect order was now in total disarray. Armoni, still reeling from the shock of Mr. Jay’s bust, had met his gaze evenly. She knew he wasn’t just the Dean of the school; he'd been an enthusiastic customer of her finest, most exclusive strains for years. Their relationship was a carefully balanced, unspoken agreement.  And now Reggie's idiocy had blown it all to hell.

""You had three bags on you, Armoni. That's a felony. Combine that with what Mr. Jay found... you're looking at serious time,"" he'd stated, his eyes narrowing like a snake's. ""But... I'm willing to smooth things over. For the university's reputation, of course.""

The deal was laid out cold: immediate expulsion, two years academic probation (meaning no going back to this or any other decent university until then), twenty grand in cash he knew she had or could get to make any ""official inquiries"" disappear, and, the kicker, the patents to her senior project. 

“And,” he’d added, his gaze lingering, ""a regular supply of… your premium product from your off-campus operations, for a period we can discuss. Consider it a repayment for my personal inconvenience, and for keeping this quiet.” He hadn't even pretended it was for the university—her magnum opus..

Armoni had known instantly there was no other choice. Her life, as she knew it, was on the line. The Dean wasn't just disciplining her; he was straight-up taking her assets and securing his silence.

""Freedom cost,"" Armoni muttered to Mark and Rodd, the Dean's cold, calculated gaze still burned in her mind. She didn't want to give it up, but her whole life was on the line. Mark and Rodd both looked pissed.

“You always said Mr. Jay was the one to watch out for,” Mark added.

“And isn’t it crazy that the week after we finish setting up all that crap at the house I finally get caught?” Armoni asked. “How stupid can you be?”

Mark and Rodd exchanged strained looks; neither could argue with that.

“Damn, that's rough. So what are you going to do now?” Mark pressed.

“I don't know. I was thinking about maybe moving to Dalton for a while. Temporarily…” Armoni mused.

“At my parents' house?” Rodd’s voice rose an octave,  his eyebrows shooting up.

“It's just, we're the only ones that really know how to work the equipment and stuff out there anyway. Pulse, my dogs are already over there.”

""Yeah, but I thought we agreed it'd just be me up there for a while,"" Rodd countered. ""Less traffic,  less attention, more plausible deniability, right?” Rodd countered, looking increasingly uncomfortable.

“I totally understand, but guys… I really, really don’t want to go through the whole ‘telling my mom I got expelled for dealing weed’ thing for as long as humanly possible. You know how she gets.”

Rodd was visibly annoyed at the idea of her crashing at his childhood home. ""Who's gonna pay the bills for you being in there? You just gave away all our money. With you living there, it'll be more expensive to keep the lights on.""

""I wouldn't make it go up that much more,"" Armoni argued. ""And I won't have to trap myself, I can get Kiara to work off my phone. I just need some time to get myself together and be back under the influence of some positive energy, a temporary ‘spiritual retreat’.""

Despite her solid argument, neither Mark nor Rodd looked entirely convinced. Still, But after a few more moments of uncomfortable silence, without much fuss, they agreed.

""I guess if Desrick's cool with it, it's cool with me..."" Rodd conceded, sounding less than thrilled.

“Yes! Rodd, you’re a lifesaver! Think I can borrow one of your cars for the drive? I need to blow off some serious steam!” Armoni practically bounced with renewed energy.

“What? Hell no… Damn it, ok, but you're not getting the Benz. You can ride in the Jag.""

""Okay,"" she nodded, accepting. Beggars couldn't be choosers, after all. Armoni snatched the keys and was off. No time to lose; she was basically public enemy #1 with her college, and the last thing she needed was Mr. Jay trying another stunt. She floored it, leaving Athens in a blur.

She was already on I-85, the highway a blur around her as she sped through traffic, the Jag eating up the miles. Her phone buzzed, and she snatched it up immediately after seeing who it was.

“Really nigga? You're going to call me back three hours later? I already left the campus, Desrick, where the fuck have you been? I needed your punk ass!” Armoni snapped.

“I been busy, girl, shit. What the hell got into you?” Desrick asked coolly.

Armoni’s voice rose with frustration. “Did you read my text messages? They’re kicking me out of school! I have to get all my shit and be gone by the end of the day!”

“Stop playing…”

“Yes! And I wanted you to be there for me! I didn't have anywhere to go!”

“Oh shit, my bad! Aye though, I told you, you gotta use the metro number for shit like that.”

“I tried to call it, it's off again!”

“My phone’s been on, girl, quit trippin’. Anyway, what’s up with this? How’d you get kicked out? I thought that you were paying the campus security off.”

“I was, but that damn caretaker caught your partner Reggy smoking in the cubby.”

“... The same one that’s been on ya’ll ass??”

“He's the only one, and his ass called the real police on me.”

“Fuck getting kicked out of school! How did ya’ll not go to jail?”

“I had got the Dean involved before the cops could show up. So, yeah, pretty much academic probation. I had to give all the weed up and some of our savings too.”

“Damn, on God, girl, you're so lucky that man fucks with you. So, what now? Are you planning on moving back in with your mom, or are you going to stay in Athens?”

“Well, that is why I was calling you. I wanted to move in with you for a while.”

“I don't know about that, Moni. I move different with you around me. I have to stay locked in on this bag.”

“I thought your thot ass would say some shit like that. That's why I went ahead and talked to the fellas about moving me into the spot for a minute, while I get myself together.”

“I thought we all agreed that it was best we all stayed away from over there as much as possible. TThat’s why I invested all that money into making it fully automated.” 

“Well, Rodd, Mark, and I all agreed it’d be cool if it was just me. And since you wouldn’t pick up, you lost the vote. Besides, I figured you wouldn’t mind swinging by to ‘check up on me’ every now and then.

“…Okay, that’s cool, I guess. It’s Rodd’s crib anyway. Fine, I’ll come up there and ‘keep you company.’”

“Yeah, your thot ass can spend the night too. How soon can you get here? I grabbed most of my stuff from the dorm, but I'd like it if you could come back with me later and get the rest.”

There was a beep on the other line. It was her father. ""Hold on, that's my dad, I'll call you back."" There was a click as she switched over.

There was a click as she switched over to the other line.

“Well, hello, stranger. How are things in Baltimore?” Armoni greeted, forcing a smile into her voice.

“Everything's good out here. How is my baby girl? How’s school?” her father replied.

Naturally, he had no clue about her side hustle or the mess she was in. And she sure as hell wasn't about to come clean about either.

“It's going really well,” Armoni explained, keeping her voice light. “Just starting to get tired of it all, Dad. Things are getting really stressful at the [greenhouse.My](http://greenhouse.My) work-study guy, Mr. Jay, is a total nightmare. And the papers just get longer and harder, like some kind of cruel, intellectual torture. It’s all so stressful. When can I come to see you? I need a break, Dad. Just a couple of months. A sabbatical for my sanity.”

Her father chuckled. “A couple of months? I was under the impression that you wouldn't want to take a break until your graduation. You’ve been so focused on the books.”

“Yeah, well, I've just been feeling like I need a break. Maybe a semester off would be good for my mental health. And you know things aren’t exactly sunshine and rainbows between me and Mom. If I went home for a semester, she would start saying I dropped out.”

“Yeah, I think I said exactly the same words to her before, and look how that turned out,” her father chuckled. “I wish you could come stay with me, Armoni, but it's not that simple, sweetheart.”

The line went dead, leaving a hollow silence in the Jag.

A low, building rumble vibrated through the chassis of the Jag, growing quickly into a deafening, apocalyptic roar. In the distance, over the cityscape, a monstrous, angry mushroom cloud blossomed into the sky with terrifying, impossible speed. Armoni’s face flashed against the windshield in pure, unadulterated horror as she narrowly swerved to avoid a flying sedan, instinctively wrestling the Jag to the side of the road.  A moment later, a fierce, concussive sonic boom slammed into the car that rattled her teeth and sent shockwaves rippling through the very air. Cars around her erupted into mangled metal, flipping onto their sides, or careening into each other in a cacophony of screeching tires, shattering glass, and what sounded suspiciously like a thousand simultaneous car alarms. She glimpsed the chaos—flipped cars, snapped trees, a bewildered squirrel—and then, with a final, violent lurch, the shockwave caught her car, sending the luxurious Jag tumbling through the air like a discarded toy. The air turned instantly hot and thick with dust and debris, the setting sun’s light now an eerie, unnatural, blood-orange red. And then, everything went white.

1mkkjq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mkkjq2/running_out_of_alternatives/,Running out of alternatives,"I've come to the conclusion that I'm autistic and nobody ever bothered to tell me. I've spent my whole adult life seeing therapists who told me I was fine, meanwhile everything in my environment informed that I was not fine. I was told that it's all in my head, when it's now obvious to me all the signs I saw were there. People treat me differently, they talk to me like I'm stupid, they keep secrets from me, they talk about me behind my back and when I call them on the carpet they make me into the bad guy. My job is to suffer at the expense of others, to be their joke, their clown, their perfect idiot. And if I don't like that? Too fucking bad, I guess. I don't get to have opinions, I don't get to have feelings, those aren't for me. But there's nothing wrong with me, nooooo, not a thing. That's what they say. They say that over and over and over again and that's all they've ever said to me since I was a child, meanwhile they treat me me like a disease. So I just told myself: let it go, let it go, don't let it get to you. And that worked for awhile. But the problem is other people. They want me to feel the shame. They want me to feel the pain of their judgement. This is my punishment for being different. But I'm not different. There's nothing wrong with me. They tell me there's nothing wrong with me. But they treat me like there's something wrong with me. What the fuck is this? This is torture. Slow, excruciating torture. And I'm just supposed to be okay with it.

I'm starting a new job next week that I know I'm going to be bad at. I can't find any work in my field after losing the job I had for almost three years and then quitting the job I went to after that because I could tell all my coworkers were shitting on me behind my back and spreading rumors about me. People are going to tell me that I'm crazy, that I'm being paranoid, but I fucking SEE THIS SHIT IN LIVING FUCKING COLOR EVERY GODDAMN DAY AND I KNOW WHAT I AM SEEING AND I KNOW THAT ITS FUCKING REAL. I would love to be proven wrong, I have held out hope to be proven wrong. But nobody is proving me wrong. 

  
I am falling apart. I am dying. I am going to kill myself. I just need to work up the nerve. I'm scared of a world where I fall asleep and never wake up. I cling to these small things like having a cup of coffee or watching the sunset, but my enjoyment of these things is stolen from me when I realize I've been a fool my entire life. All the years I wasted believing the lie that I'm normal, that other people's avoidance of me was just a coincidence or in my head. Then suddenly these things I enjoy don't seem so enjoyable anymore. They're the simple pleasures of a simpleton, the village idiot.

I'm completely leaving out all the stuff about drugs and alcohol because that would just make this even longer. But I'll say this much -- all I want, all I have ever wanted to do is get fucked up as much as possible. My liver aches on most days and I know that's not in my head either. So I'm an addict on top of all that. I can't even be a boy scout right. I can't do anything right.

I've fucked my life up. Me piloting my body has been like a toddler trying to drive a bus. I have crashed it at every turn and probably hurt a few people along the way but I'm such a moron with zero awareness that I didn't even register it.

They want me dead. I want me dead, too. I'm not gonna say how old I am, but I'm old enough. Old enough to know better. Old enough to figure out when something isn't working. None of this is working. Nothing I do works. I get these hollow words of affirmation that feel like should help but they don't. I'm running out of places to turn. I'm running out of money. Everyone is laughing at me. They're all in on this. It's a secret. Don't tell him. He's an idiot, he wouldn't get it anyway. Just smile and nod. He'll tire himself out eventually. 

I hate you all so fucking much. All of you. I don't want to do this anymore. I wish you'd just take care of it yourselves, but I gotta be the one that does it. Laugh it up. Screenshot this and post it in a 4chan cringe thread. Hopefully someone will get some entertainment out of the absolute joke that has been my life. Allow me to reiterate: I hate you all. I wish you the best. Thanks. ",2,1754623595.0,SuicideWatch,2,1.0,False

My partner has one too: after dinner, he wipes down the kitchen counter \*exactly\* three times (don’t ask why) and then lights a candle. Even if we’re exhausted, even if the dishes are piling up, he does it. It’s like his way of saying, ""The day’s work is done—let’s relax.""    
  
These aren’t big, fancy things. They’re just little habits, but they turn routine into something intentional. A friend once told me she arranges her cereal bowl \*just so\* every morning—spoon on the left, milk poured first—and it makes her feel in control, even on chaotic days.    
  
What’s your small, silly, sacred ritual? Maybe folding the towel a certain way, playing the same song while you cook, or leaving a glass of water by the bed every night? I think these little things are what make a house feel like a home.  ",1,1754623099.0,KitchenCanvas,0,1.0,False

Has anyone specifically opened a coffee shop that is comfier, bigger, and still stays afloat? If so, why didn’t you open a smaller, minimalist, instagrammable ‘grab and go’ type place?

Scientists are amongst the first to examine the amulet itself. It was covered in ancient text and writing. scientists had nothing to compare it to. The amulet appeared to be light as a feather but seems to have weighed more than 8 pounds. Every time the amulet is disturbed it seemingly changes the cabin's appearance. It was only after five minutes of examining the amulet that 2 of the scientists became ill and had to promptly exited the premises.

Outside the cabin a young explorer is interviewed by reporters about their discovery while more come to examine the amulet. The young explorer became lost within the dense fog, forcing him to take a trail path that led to the cabin. Once inside the young explorer discovered the amulet on a coffee table covered in dust.

After extensive tests the amulet is now examined for radiation. The scientists use a special brush to carefully dust the amulet. Once dusted the amulet began to glow in a ferocious manner and a blast of energy came from the amulet. The cabin, the reporters, the scientists, the townsfolk's; they had all disappeared.

Many searches took place over the years to find any clue as to where everything disappeared to but no discoveries were made.

Not to forget the smell of fried chicken lingering.

2. How about pests ? this definitely ""house warming"" for pests

3. With many recent cases of fire burndown houses, this is definitely higher risk activities done by the neighbor. In fact, HDB Fire insurance premiums should be rocketed if you have higher risk neighbor

4. Rider/Customer picking up food footfalls are kinda disturbing. Now my friend have to close their door , no choice.

1mkk61u,https://www.reddit.com/r/femaletravels/comments/1mkk61u/3_days_in_santa_barbara_that_felt_like_a_reset/,3 Days in Santa Barbara That Felt Like a Reset Button,"I just got back from a solo trip to Santa Barbara and wanted to share what I did in case anyone else is planning a little beach escape. I’ve been trying to do more short getaways that feel chill and recharging without being boring and Santa Barbara was perfect for that. It’s walkable, cute, not overwhelming, and has that kind of slow-luxury vibe without needing to do much planning.

Here’s a quick idea of how I structured my 3 days (I also made a mapped version with all the pins if you want to use it, linked below).

**Day 1:** I stayed at the Hotel Californian which was a little splurge but totally worth it. Right between the Funk Zone and the beach so I could just walk everywhere. I did a little sunset walk to Stearns Wharf, grabbed wine and fish tacos, and just kind of eased into the trip.

**Day 2:** Wine tour day Santa Ynez Valley. Honestly one of the prettiest drives I’ve ever done. It felt safe and relaxed doing it solo since it was a group tour. I came back super zen, grabbed a late lunch at Brophy Bros. by the harbor, and later treated myself to a massage at FLOAT Spa. 10/10 recommend.

**Day 3:** Woke up early and walked Butterfly Beach with coffee in hand, then had brunch at Boathouse (the views!!). Walked around downtown a bit more, stopped at La Arcada Plaza to poke around shops and galleries. I had a few hours to kill before heading out so I just chilled in the Mission Rose Garden with a book. It was the perfect slow sendoff.

A few random tips if you’re going solo:

* You honestly don’t need a car if you stay near downtown or the Funk Zone.
* The pace is slow  in a good way. No pressure to over-schedule.
* It felt safe the whole time, even walking alone during sunset.
* Lots of chill moments built in  spa time, beach, cafes with outdoor seating, wine tasting with new people if you want social energy without committing.

Anyway, I’ve been sharing a few of my solo getaways lately, past and future and I put them into little 3-day mapped guides. They’re kind of like a shortcut if you want to skip the planning part but still have a stylish, easy trip.

Here’s the one I made for Santa Barbara if anyone wants it:

Just something I put together for my travel newsletter. I send out a new one each week with different destinations, mostly weekend-type trips that are perfect for solo resets or girls’ weekends. If you like this vibe, feel free to follow along. I just like sharing what works for me in case it helps someone else. 💛

1mkk4hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mkk4hd/conversation_with_a_therapist/,Conversation With A Therapist,"Delilah sat on the dark blue couch, nervously playing with her blonde hair. Her tired blue eyes stared at the woman in front of her. Doctor Blackwell smiled warmly at her, trying her best to make her feel more at ease. A brown coffee table sat between them with a small flowerpot being home to a little pink orchid, a small photo of the Doctor and what looked like her husband resting next to it. He seemed familiar somehow, but she wasn’t sure where she had seen him before. Degrees and certificates hung in their golden frames on the wall next to a small clock. Delilah tried her best to feel comfortable in the bland room. A lover of all things colorful (although not lately) she silently cringed at the plain cream wallpaper and lack of decoration. Her eyes landed on a small circular camera almost hidden in the corner of the room.  

 “It's so nice to finally meet you, Delilah. My name is Doctor Blackwell but you’re more than welcome to address me as Dr. B” she said, her smile never fading the whole time. Delilah sat up a little and cleared her throat.  

“Hi” she simply said.  

 Doctor Blackwell was accustomed to this. All of her patients were timid at first and she couldn’t really blame them. After all, she did specialize with those who experienced severe trauma. Disassociation and unwillingness to communicate, especially with a therapist, was a common response. For now, she would mostly be trying to gain Delilah’s trust. Although it was, in Doctor Blackwell’s opinion, a very important field, there were less and less people in need of her expert services. But this was her true passion and the only career suitable for her. Doctor Blackwell shifted in her seat, getting comfortable. She reached down into her brown purse that was sitting by her feet and pulled out a notebook and pen, clicking it twice.  

 “I just wanted to say that for today, we can talk about whatever you want. We don’t have to discuss anything that you don’t want to. We can talk about what movies or music you like, or if you like you can ask me as many questions as you want” Doctor Blackwell rambled, setting aside the notebook momentarily. Delilah perked up a little, a small smile reluctantly crept its way onto her face. “Okay. Can I think about what to ask first?” she asked politely. Doctor Blackwell nodded and smiled back at her.  

 Delilah leaned back on the couch, her observant eyes scanning the doctor in front of her. Doctor Blackwell sat back, letting her take her time but was slightly caught off guard by how piercing Delilah’s gaze was.  

 Delilah had always been observant and curious by nature. She knew that Dr. B was only trying to gain her trust, but she decided that maybe trusting someone wouldn’t be so bad, especially after what she had gone through.  

 “What’s your favorite color?” she finally asked. “I like pink. I know it doesn’t seem like it with how my office is, but every office was designed to look the same. I got away with the pink orchid though” Dr. B replied, nodding at the flower. Delilah smiled a little. “Me too,” the girl said.  

 “What’s your favorite movie?” Delilah questioned again. Dr. B quickly answered, “Definitely the Babadook”. Delilah let out a small laugh and added “The Babadook is such a standard therapist answer. There are so many other movies that have shit about grief and mental illness in them that are better”.  

 Doctor Blackwell chuckled, glad that Delilah was relaxing. “Okay, okay, fine you got me. I see that you are also a horror movie fan. I love classic horror movies like The Shining. Truthfully, my husband is the real horror connoisseur. He has a small platform where he posts everything horror. Is that answer more acceptable to you?” she inquired playfully. Delilah sat back and laughed again. “Yes, much better. I love horror movies too. I think I may have seen a few of your husbands' posts. I appreciate you being honest with me, Dr B. If you answer things honestly then so will I.”  

 Slightly taken aback by her candor, Doctor Blackwell picked up her notebook again and nodded. “Deal” she said. “Do you have anything else you want to ask me?”.  

 Delilah nodded back at her. “What made you decide to become a therapist?” she asked with an innocent bat of her long lashes. Dr. B smiled, seemingly used to getting asked this question. “Well, I always knew that I wanted to be in a career that allowed me to help people.” She replied. “My mother had her own struggles with mental illness which definitely emphasized the importance of this field to me” Dr. B added after hesitating slightly. Delilah frowned a little. “I’m sorry to hear that”. Her gaze sharpened a little, resting on Dr. B as if trying to guess her answer to the next question. “Have you had many patients like me before?”.  

 “Yes, I have actually if what you mean is if I’ve treated young women before”. Doctor Blackwell stated, quickly trying to determine if Delilah was ready to open up about herself now. “I’ve found that having a fellow female to talk to is much easier,” Doctor Blackwell added.  

 Delilah tilted her head up slightly. “How so?” she wondered out loud. “Well, women can often empathize with each other's situations in deeper ways as well as creating a more… safe atmosphere which is important to those who have experienced trauma” Doctor Blackwell explained patiently. “I think your situation also calls for a female therapist since I believe you might have some trauma with men” she continued.  

 Delilah paused and looked at Dr. B, her eyes staring at her in confusion. “Why would you think that?” Delilah asked aggressively, as if she was uncomfortable with how Dr. B was talking about the incident so blatantly. As if she didn’t want anyone to know the details of what happened.  

 Doctor Blackwell shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “Well Delilah, you witnessed a man doing something horrible to your classmates. I can’t even imagine what that must have been like. The powerlessness you must have felt in that moment is something you never should have experienced.”  

 “Watching someone fucking murder my friends is something I never should have experienced” Delilah interrupted. “Of course I was powerless. What was I supposed to do? I couldn’t have done anything”. Delilah folded her arms across her chest and glared at Dr. B. “The police keep asking me question after question as if I could have done something. As if I stood a chance against a psycho with an axe. I don’t know how I was the only one to survive that day in the library, but the point is I did, and I think this whole thing is just useless”. Delilah angrily rolled her eyes and looked away.  

 Doctor Blackwell took a deep breath, thinking about what to say next. She wrote down “seemingly powerless” in her notebook, although her little outburst suggested otherwise. “I’m sorry if I upset you, Delilah. Do you ever feel guilty… about surviving?"" Doctor Blackwell asked hesitantly.  

 Delilah looked away from Dr. B, choosing to settle on the pink orchid instead. She sat there for a moment, unmoving and silent; refusing to meet the doctors' suspicious eyes. After a few minutes, she finally spoke. “No” she said in a voice that was barely even a whisper. “I don’t. I hid and didn’t get caught. They did. I’m living with the trauma and they’re all comfortable in little cushioned coffins. Their families and friends come by every day to see them. You know who visits me? Police detectives who think a high school senior is gonna be the key to solving which pathetic little low life has been chopping up kids.” Delilah spat out, her blue eyes starting to tear up.  

 Doctor Blackwell looked at her, her expression unreadable, unfazed by Delilah’s harsh words. But not surprised. She stared down at her notebook, trying to recall anything from her experience that she could use to help the girl in front of her. Whether it was helping her with the grieving process or helping her confess to something, she wasn’t sure.  

 Doctor Blackwell looked up at her cautiously, pondering the next question she had in the back of her mind since the teenager first sat down in front of her. “Do you think... the police are suspicious of you?” The words had barely left her lips before Delilah’s head snapped up at Doctor Blackwell. The doctor momentarily sank back into her chair, cringing when she let a gasp escape. Delilah didn’t know what to do except glare menacingly at Dr. B. Did she know what was going on? Was she onto her?  

 Delilah remained silent for longer this time, calculating eyes never leaving the woman in front of her. Dr. B, clearly feeling her piercing gaze sat up straight and silent, her eyes showing evident distress as every possible response ran through her head. The two women sat silently, allowing the ticking sound of the clock to be the only noise in the room. Delilah sank further into the soft couch as if she was daring Dr. B to break the silence. Delilah hated to admit it even to herself, but Dr. B was a smart woman. Surely, she would know what was going on by now.  

 Doctor Blackwell took in a long, deep breath before letting the shaky sound of her exhale out. “Delilah” Doctor Blackwell said, trying to sound comforting. “I’m sorry for asking you these questions. As I said earlier, I can’t imagine what it must have been like for you. Hiding in that cabinet... you must have been so terrified, and you might be feeling even more stress what with all the officers asking you hard questions”. Doctor Blackwell tried her best to remain calm, but her facade was quickly slipping away. She couldn’t shake away the feeling that Delilah knew.  

 Delilah cocked her head to the side. Her confidence dropped for just a moment, letting her brows furrow in confusion. “I never said I was hiding in a cabinet. I never even told the police that...” Delilah uttered breathlessly, the pieces finally connecting. Dr. B’s husband wasn’t familiar to her from social media. He was the man she saw that day in the library. He was the man she saw gruesomely murder her friends. He was the man who stared directly at her hiding spot and flashed her a smile that had been haunting her every night. A smile that made her sick just from thinking about it.  

 Doctor Blackwell’s eyes darted from the photo on the table to Delilah’s nauseous face. She had a feeling Delilah would have recognized him. Doctor Blackwell sighed and shook her head. “It's just so hard to find new patients these days” Doctor Blackwell muttered and stood up, reaching down into her purse. Delilah stood up in a panic, desperately eyeing the security camera on the wall.  

 Noticing this, Dr. B chuckled a little. “It doesn’t work, dear. It’s just there for show” the doctor said as she pulled out a small bottle from her purse. Delilah gasped and tried to run but Dr. B kicked the coffee table which smashed into her knees, hard. Delilah fell to the ground but tried to crawl away from the woman advancing on her.  

 “I’m sorry dear, but this would be easier if you just didn’t struggle” Dr. B said with a menacing smile. Before Delilah could react, Dr. B pounced on her and pulled her shirt up to cover her face. Delilah tried to scream but then felt the doctor pouring the liquid from the bottle over her shirt. Delilah struggled feebly for what felt like hours, but her limbs soon became limp; her hand covered in the dirt from the overturned flowerpot.  

 Doctor Blackwell sighed. Transporting them was the hard part.  

 After a few hours, Delilah woke up to find herself tied to a beam in what looked like a basement. She tried to take in her surroundings but her throbbing head made that difficult. All she could make out was the dirt floor and a heavy looking door that stood at the end of a wooden staircase. She closed her eyes and tilted her head back, silent tears slipping down her face. What was she going to do now? Suddenly she could hear two voices beyond the door. She tried to inch forward but her chest was tied tightly to the beam. Opting to stay as quiet as possible, she finally heard Dr. B arguing with someone. “You just had to look right at her didn’t you” the doctor’s muffled voice said. A much deeper voice that sounded just as annoyed replied with “Well maybe you shouldn’t have had my fucking photo out in the first place”.  

 Delilah tried to listen in more, but her heart felt like it had stopped beating when she heard Dr. B say, “It doesn’t matter now, we have to get rid of her too”. Delilah desperately tugged and squirmed against the harsh ropes, praying for them to go loose. But they remained tight as ever, digging into her skin and drawing blood. Delilah let out a sharp cry at the sudden pain and instantly regretted it. Her eyes quickly found the door again and she hoped with every fiber of her being that they didn’t hear her. Luck was not on her side as heavy footsteps quickly found their way to the door that was now being swung open.  

 A man stood in the doorway, large axe in hand. His shaggy black hair barely covering his menacing dark eyes. He just stared at her for a moment, a twisted smile creeping onto his face. He tightened the axe in his grip and walked towards her. Bending down to look at Delilah’s tear-soaked face, he took her chin in between his fingers. “Couldn’t have just looked the other way huh” he spat out. He stood up and took a step back, raising the axe above his head.  

 “Stop!! Wait no please!!” Delilah desperately cried out, heels digging fervently into the dirt as she tried to scramble away in vain. The last thing she saw was the axe coming down directly aimed at her skull. Her limbs went limp once again, permanently this time. Red blood streamed down her face, coating her once blonde hair.  

 A shallow grave had already been prepared for her in the corner of the basement. Delilah, or any of the other girls buried there would unfortunately not be getting their own cushioned coffins. Her body fell into the hole with a loud thump. Doctor Blackwell and her husband took their time covering her with dirt until it looked like nobody was buried there at all. Like it was really just a normal basement with no skeletons rotting beneath them.  

 “We’ll be more careful next time” Doctor Blackwell told her husband softly.

# Naked Filter Review 2025: Find Your Best Option Now!

A Naked filter, also known as a bottomless portafilter, is a specialized coffee brewing tool that exposes the bottom of the coffee puck during the extraction process. This allows for a clear view of the espresso shot as its being pulled, providing valuable feedback on the grind, tamping, and overall extraction quality. For baristas and coffee enthusiasts alike, it's an indispensable tool for perfecting their espresso skills and troubleshooting potential issues.

The use of naked filters is not merely aesthetic; it's deeply rooted in the pursuit of coffee perfection. By visually analyzing the extraction, users can identify channeling, squirting, and other inconsistencies that can negatively impact the taste and quality of the espresso. This direct feedback loop enables baristas to make real-time adjustments and refine their technique for optimal results. Choosing the right naked filter is a crucial step in achieving consistently excellent espresso shots.

## Key Features Analysis

The world of naked filters boasts a range of features tailored to diverse needs and preferences. This section delves into the critical aspects, from build materials to compatibility and portafilter size, to help you navigate the available options.

**Material Construction**

Naked filters are typically made from stainless steel, offering durability and resistance to corrosion. The specific grade of stainless steel can vary, with higher grades such as 304 stainless steel being more resistant to rust and pitting. Some filters may also feature wooden or plastic handles, with ergonomic designs for agreeable handling. For professional use, the stainless steel needs to be of sufficient thickness to withstand daily use.

**Portafilter Basket Compatibility**

Most naked filters are designed to accept standard 58mm portafilter baskets, allowing users to swap out baskets to experiment with different coffee volumes and extraction profiles. Though, it's essential to verify compatibility with your existing baskets before purchasing a naked filter. Some models may also come with a specialized basket designed to optimize extraction when used with the naked filter.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics**

The handle of a naked filter plays a crucial role in comfort and ease of use. Ergonomic designs with contoured shapes and comfortable grips can reduce strain and fatigue during repeated use. The material of the handle, such as wood or plastic, also contributes to the overall feel and durability of the portafilter. A well-designed handle should provide a secure and comfortable grip, even with wet hands.

**Spoutless Design and Visual Feedback**

The key feature of a naked filter is its spoutless design, wich allows for a direct view of the espresso extraction. This provides crucial visual feedback on the grind, tamping, and overall extraction quality. By observing the color, flow, and consistency of the espresso as it's being pulled, users can identify channeling, squirting, and other inconsistencies that can negatively impact the taste and quality of the espresso.Key features of high-quality naked filters include:

* Durable stainless steel construction
* Compatibility with standard 58mm portafilter baskets
* Ergonomic handle design
* Direct visual feedback of the espresso extraction

## core Benefits

The use of a naked filter extends beyond mere aesthetics, providing concrete benefits that impact both the quality of espresso and the barista's workflow.

**Improved Extraction Analysis**

A Naked filter provides invaluable visual feedback, allowing baristas to diagnose and correct extraction issues in real time. By observing the espresso flow, you can easily identify channeling, squirting, or uneven extraction, indicating grind size or tamping inconsistent issues. Addressing these issues leads to more consistent and flavorful espresso shots.

**Enhanced crema Production**

The open design of a naked filter promotes greater crema production compared to spouted portafilters. By allowing the espresso to flow directly into the cup, the naked filter reduces the disruption of the crema layer, resulting in a richer and more voluminous crema. This is visually appealing and contributes to the overall mouthfeel and flavor of the espresso.

**Refined Brewing Technique**

Using a naked filter encourages better brewing technique. The visual feedback promptly penalizes poor tamping and uneven distribution through visible spurting, making the barista more aware of any inconsistencies. Over time, this promotes a consistent and repeatable workflow, improving consistency and reducing wasted coffee.**Diagnostic Tool for Grinder Performance**

Variations in the stream appearance from shot to shot can identify issues with the grinder itself. Erratic extractions, even with consistent tamping, can suggest burrs or other components needing attention. This transforms the naked filter into a diagnostic tool, not just a brewing tool.

**Efficiency and Cleanliness**

Some users report that using a naked filter can lead to a slightly cleaner workflow, as there are no spouts for coffee to linger in. This can marginally make cleaning easier, and potentially reduce any stale coffee affecting flavor over time.

## FAQs section

Users often have questions about the practicalities of using naked filters, ranging from espresso machine compatibility to cleaning and maintenance. Here are some common questions addressing common concerns.**Will This Naked Filter Fit My Espresso Machine?**

Compatibility is the most common concern.Most naked filters are designed to fit standard 58mm espresso machines, but you should always check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific machine model.Pay particular attention to the ear placement and the overall portafilter dimensions. Some machines utilize a proprietary attachment mechanism, requiring a specific proprietary naked filter.

**How Do I Clean A Naked Filter?**

Cleaning involves removing the basket and thoroughly rinsing all parts with hot water. Periodic backflushing of the espresso machine is recommended to maintain cleanliness. you can also use a mild detergent to remove coffee oils and residue. Be sure to dry it immediately before reassembling. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as these may scratch the stainless steel.

**What Are The Signs Of A Bad Extraction When Using A Naked Filter?**

Visible channeling, squirting, or an uneven espresso stream indicates issues with the grind, tamping, or coffee distribution. If the espresso gushes out to quickly, it's likely a sign of a coarser grind. If it drips slowly or not at all, it could indicate a finer grind or over-tamping. An uneven stream often points to inconsistent tamping or coffee distribution.

**Are Naked Filters More Difficult To Use Than Standard Portafilters?**

Yes, generally they need a little more care because naked filters are unforgiving. They often amplify errors in preparation. But, in turn, it's frequently enough a better learning tool to improve coffee pulling skills. Expect to modify grind settings and tamping pressures until you find the right combination.

Proper staking is essential to support the heavy blooms, and tuber storage over winter is necessary in colder climates.

## FAQs Section

**how do I properly store Peaches and Cream Dahlia tubers over the winter?**
After the first frost, carefully dig up the tubers, gently remove excess soil, and allow them to dry for a few days in a well-ventilated area. Then, store them in a cool (40-50°F), dry place in a container filled with peat moss, vermiculite, or sawdust.

**What are the best growing conditions for this dahlia variety?**
Peaches and Cream dahlias thrive in well-drained soil and full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day). They require regular watering and fertilization, especially during the blooming season.Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter to improve drainage and fertility.

**Is staking necessary for Peaches and Cream Dahlias?**
Yes, staking is highly recommended, especially for plants with large blooms. The heavy flower heads can cause the stems to bend or break, especially in windy conditions. use sturdy stakes and tie the stems loosely to the stakes to provide support without restricting growth.

**How often should I fertilize my Peaches and Cream Dahlias?**
Fertilize your dahlias every 2-3 weeks during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer.Avoid using fertilizers that are high in nitrogen, as this can promote excessive foliage growth at the expense of blooms. A fertilizer with a higher phosphorus and potassium content is ideal for encouraging flower production.

1mkjxqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNourish/comments/1mkjxqo/how_our_home_space_affects_our_mental_health_and/,How Our Home Space Affects Our Mental Health (And Easy Fixes),"Last month, I rearranged our living room, and something unexpected happened: everyone in the house started spending more time there, and arguments over “who gets the TV remote” dropped way down. It made me realize how much our physical environment shapes our mood and interactions.    
  
Our old setup had the TV as the main focus, with chairs facing it like a theater. Now, we’ve turned the couch to face the windows (hello, natural light!), added a low coffee table where the kids can do puzzles, and moved the TV to a corner. Suddenly, we talk more. The kids draw on the floor while my partner and I read, and sometimes we even forget to turn the TV on.    
  
Another small change: I cleared off the kitchen counter. For years, it was cluttered with mail, keys, and half-opened packages. Now, there’s just a bowl of fruit and a small plant. I didn’t realize how much that clutter stressed me until it was gone—now I actually enjoy standing at the sink to wash dishes.

About the roomie(s) 
I've lived in the city for almost 10 yrs now. In my free time I enjoy being outside, exploring the city, hitting the gym, grabbing coffee, hanging out with friends, discovering a new food spot. When I’m home I usually am relaxing in my room and binge watching tiktok (I know, I know!). I like having a friendly relationship with my roomies. I'm quiet and laid back, and value assertive yet respectful communication style.

M is from Cali, she enjoys hanging out with her friends, traveling, playing with her cat, and doing voice lessons in her off time. Bubbly, social, and easy to connect with.

For example, my partner and I started a 5-minute “morning check-in” over coffee before the kids wake up. We don’t talk about to-do lists; we just ask, “How are you \*really\* feeling?” It’s惊人 how much calmer the day feels when we start with that connection.    
  
Then there’s our evening routine: after dinner, instead of everyone scattering to screens, we take 10 minutes to tidy the kitchen together. The kids race to put away their plates, my partner wipes the counters, and I load the dishwasher. It’s not glamorous, but that small act of teamwork makes the space feel lighter, and no one wakes up to a messy kitchen.    
  
I also started keeping a jar by the front door where we jot down one good thing that happened each day—a kid’s funny comment, a sunny walk, a quiet cup of tea. On tough days, we pull out a note and laugh or sigh together.

Before this diet I struggled losing weight and was diagnosed with insulin resistance, PCOS, and prescribed metformin. This after years of ruining my gut with pain medication and birth control in an attempt to “feel better” and balance hormones . I’ve tried it all, and for the past three years I was eating Whole Foods , dairy free, sugar free diet and found myself slowing gaining so carnivore seemed like the one last thing to try . 

90 days in, this are my results so far :

- down 25lbs 
- down 8”in my stomach 
- down 5” in my waist 

Things that happened along the way :

- started 30 days of strict carnivore (beef, butter , salt)  
- took 30 days to enjoy the taste of butter and beef with little to no salt 
- after thirty days I introduced cream for my coffee and that gave me a terrible skin flare (because of my dairy allergy , idk what I was thinking) and had to cut all dairy, including butter , completely . It took 3 weeks for my skin to heal . 
- 60 days in a developed a histamine intolerance .i was eating a lot of bacon and pork rinds , plus I don’t think the dairy flare helped my system response . I cut back on the pork , have switched to only cooking fresh and never eating leftovers . My histamine response has chilled out .  
- no longer bloated 
- my energy levels are all over the place 
- still havnt developed a big appetite. I eat small Meals three times a day (2 chicken thighs or half a pound beef  or 1 steak)


Overall I am happy with how I am feeling . I am getting really tired of cooking and having the same things. But the goal for me is to heal my stomach and transition to an animal based diet . So however long that takes , I’m on this ride .

My goal with this was to experimentally verify some solutions I found to unsteady Beltrami flow under certain Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Initiated by a coffee frother, the azimuthal circulation induces secondary circulation in the meridional r-z plane by virtue of the frictional boundary layer interaction with the floor (z=0). The ""updraft"" laminarizes in the presence of torsional stress transferring from the frother to the floor, stabilizing the azimuthal velocity, which in turn, stabilizes meridional velocities. This recursion between the two planar flows generates a fast-rotating, localized swirl column with a singularity at the vortex base.

I’m not a perfect faster either. I do a little “dirty fasting” in the mornings…coffee with chobani creamer, then water until I break my fast at noon. Diet Coke here and there at night. For me, when I stop eating is way more important than a perfectly clean fast.

The biggest win is the consistency. Like today I’m on my period and definitely ate more than usual, but instead of it turning into a full-on “screw it, I’ll start over tomorrow” binge at night, I just stopped at my normal time.

While ramping up for my ER, I really appreciated reading about how others prepared, along with their background and results. I hope this is helpful or interesting or instills some hope! 💖 also SIA if formatting is weird.. I’m on my phone.

I’m 33f with hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, and fibroids. My AMH was .89 in May 2025. AFC last checked was 13. Also I’m 5’5 and 143 lbs, so within “healthy” range BMI (I don’t take much stock in BMI but am sharing for those who may want to know).

My lifestyle & diet:
I eat almost 100% whole foods and as much organic as I can afford (especially the dirty dozen). I’ve swapped to loose leaf green tea (though I love and miss coffee), drink at least 2 litres of water a day, and try to get 8h sleep every night. I’m not the most active and could be better in this regard. 

I eat a primarily Mediterranean diet with seafood, beans, and chicken as my proteins, and I try to get minimum 75g of protein a day. I eat lots of fresh and baked veggies. I’ve been seed cycling for over a year, and I eat nuts and seeds everyday with breakfast. I don’t have much sugar, but I love dessert so I have dark chocolate or frozen fruit every night. I try to have a low glycemic index diet. I also eat some type of fermented food every day with lunch (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, etc). I’m a proponent of the 80/20 rule so I indulge every once in a while outside the above!

I stopped all alcohol and recreational drugs for about 6 months prior to my ER (I previously was into edibles so this was a sacrifice for me lol).

I really try to reduce how much plastic exposure I have. No tinned foods, only glass Tupperware, no plastic wrap or ziplocs on food, etc.

I also have swapped all beauty, skincare, dental, and hair care products to well rated products on EWG or the Yuka app.

I did acupuncture once a week for three weeks leading up to ER. Also while on stims I increased my intake to 3-4 litres and drank strictly electrolytes and not just water. 

My meds & supplements:
- 300mg Seroquel (including this for any gals out there also on meds for diagnosed mental illness ♥️)
- 100mcg levothyroxine 
- Nature made prenatals with folic acid
- 200 iu vitamin e 
- 4x100mg ubiquinol coq10 active 
- 2x Wild omega 3 with EPA 660mg and DHA 330mg 
- 2x1200mg omega 3-6-9 
- 2x2000mg myo- and D-chiro inositol
- 2000 iu vitamin D3 & 240mcg vitamin k
- 500mg vitamin c
- 4x500mg L-carnitine*
- 4x500mg açai powder *
- 1000mcg B12*
- 3mg melatonin 
- 1/2 tsp Turmeric powder *
- 1/2 tsp brewers yeast
- 1/2 tbsp Wheat grass powder
- 1/2 tbsp Psyllium husk powder 
- Probiotics
*asterisks are those I added in about 4 weeks before transfer as per a naturopath’s advice. Everything else I took for several months or longer. 


My protocol:
- primed with lupin-estradiol 2mg (CD6-25) & prometrium 2x200mg (CD18-25) 
- Took 6 days off, cycle restarted
- Stims started with dexamethasone .5mg, clomiphene 100mg, and pergoveris (350iu)
- Orgalutran (250mcg) (day 7-12)
- Ovidrel (2x250ug) and Decapeptyl (2x.1mg) (trigger day 12)
- retrieval day 14
- Prometrium 10mg x5days starting day 14

Results:
9 retrieved > 6 mature > 6 fertilized (5 normal, 1 abnormal one pronuclei) > 5 blastocysts which were 5AA, 5AA, 4AA, 3BB, 3BB (one 3BB was the one pronuclei) > 4 euploids (the one pronuclei was haploid/aneuploid)

If anyone’s in the GTA, I highly recommend Hannam Fertility in Toronto. They were amazing, thorough and kind, and have an excellent lab. Best of luck to everyone out there!✨",5,1754621201.0,IVF,2,1.0,False
1mkjqlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1mkjqlo/advice_on_an_old_allergy/,Advice on An Old Allergy,"So to explain, when I was a kid, I had a red food dye allergy that resulted in a range from mild to severe hives. At the time, I avoided a lot of foods that had red dye in them, but since it's kind of in everything, I just slowly started eating small bits of it at a time, until at some point I was eating normal amounts of it and not having reactions anymore.

I'm in college now, and in my first year, I would have random reactions here and there with mild itching (very rarely was it true full-blown hives), and it was always when I had eaten something that contained red dye. Now, what I felt like was weird was that I wasn't having a reaction every single time I ate something with red dye in it, just occasionally, so I just kind of brushed it off since it didn't really affect me at all.

This year, (second year), I had a pretty bad allergic reaction with hives everywhere, and I felt a little dizzy, but the symptoms subsided after a little bit. The hives had started around my stomach (like they normally would), but spread to my back, chest, and arms last. To be fair, I had only had two cups of coffee and an entire bag of hot cheetos at the end of the day (it was a long day), so I'm not sure if that contributed to how bad the reaction was, since all I had really eaten was the hot cheetos. After that reaction, I was a little hesitant around foods with red dye in them, but ultimately decided to try it again in a small quantity, and nothing happened. I even had hot cheetoes again recently (a smaller bag this time though, I had eaten earlier in the day, and hadn't consumed any coffee), but no reaction.

Should I be consulting an allergist? I don't really know if hives are really a reason to be concerned, and I'm a little put off by how on and off the allergy is.

I said I would leave you be and I never thought in a million years you would allow that. I saw your flaws and picked you up when you were alone. I never meant to fall for you but I did. That scared you. You are an avoidant that shuts down when you have to explain your feelings, you cut and run. You told me that. I never thought you would do that to me. We shared, I was helping you build your life back after bad men tried to destroy you. I was there. I listened and I learned you. I fucked up and told you I wanted you to myself and didn’t want to be an option. That clearly was too much. I never asked you to change or be someone else. I just wanted to be your only guy. You don’t want that. You would rather close the door on me, kill me and us with silence. This is better??? I don’t understand. You have kids. You’re still buying coffee and lunch with my credit card, but can’t even say hi. Wow. I never took you for this person. I was wrong. I have had time to see, to feel and to understand what I am/was to you. The pain out weighs the pleasure. No more cards, no more trips, no more Louis’s, no more Chanel.

I was wondering if there’s any good third spaces for me to socialize and meet new people? I am 19, so any bars that are 21+ aren’t an option. I love arcades, live music, thrift stores, shooting pool, grabbing a coffee, physical activities… I am very interested if there are any decent local bands that play plenty of shows around here. Or any good clubs to join for young adults!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Katie Volynets vs. Varvara Gracheva – A Cincinnati Open First-Round Rumble**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn, because we’re diving into a first-round clash at the 2025 Cincinnati Open that’s as tightly priced as a can of tennis balls in a vacuum-sealed bag. Katie Volynets, the British upstart with a serve that could start a jet engine, faces off against Varvara Gracheva, the Russian grinder who plays like she’s auditioning for a role in *The Matrix* (but with more volleying). Let’s parse the odds, digest the “news,” and serve up a prediction with a side of humor.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are in near-unanimous agreement: **Varvara Gracheva is the favorite**. Her decimal odds hover around **1.81–1.83**, translating to an implied probability of **\~55%** to win. Katie Volynets, meanwhile, sits at **\~50%**, with odds between 1.91 and 2.0. The spread markets back this up, giving Gracheva a **-1.0 to -1.5 game** edge, while the total games line is locked at **21.5**, with even money on Over/Under.

What does this mean? Simply: Gracheva is expected to win comfortably, but not so comfortably that bookmakers expect Volynets to pack her bags and go home. The spread suggests a **2–1 victory for Gracheva**, while the total hints at a match that’s long enough to make even the most dedicated fan reach for their second cup of coffee.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Your Aunt Can’t Help

Unfortunately, there’s no juicy scandal or injury report to spice this one up. Gracheva’s camp hasn’t announced that she’s recovering from a “mysterious pizza-related incident,” and Volynets hasn’t tripped over her own shoelaces in a press conference. But here’s what we *do* know:

* **Gracheva’s form** is as steady as a metronome set to “tennis victory.” She’s coming off a clay-court run where she looked like a woman possessed by the spirit of Billie Jean King (but with better hair).
* **Volynets**, on the other hand, is the definition of a “dark horse” — or, as

Anyways, I moved to a new town age 25, male, and honestly life has been pretty good. I socialize at work and that’s pretty much all I need. I come home and drink coffee, study, watch TV… I keep myself busy.

But my Dad emailed me today and said I need to “get out more.” He then compared me to my extroverted sister and how she socializes more than I do.

I felt very hurt. Lots of shame. I just complied and agreed with my dad, and started signing up for things. I felt like I didn’t have a choice and it was the only way to make these awful feelings go away. My dad is super extroverted and loved high school and college. That just wasn’t me and those were some of the hardest most shameful years of my life. I am his only son. 

I called my Mom later and cried a bit, and she basically told me to “do what’s best for me.” She is a very wonderful person. It was like a weight was lifted. I immediately felt better and continued on with my evening.

Any ideas on how to counter this? It just feels so overwhelming sometimes. Thanks.
