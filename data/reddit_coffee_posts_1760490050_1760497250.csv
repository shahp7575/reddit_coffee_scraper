1o6zsr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1o6zsr6/i_picked_up_a_stranger/,I picked up a stranger,"Fifteen years. That’s how long I’ve been driving a rig.

You learn which truck stops have the cleanest showers (not many). You learn how to back a 53-footer into a dock. And you learn, above all else, when not to stop.

Especially out in the empty places, in the dead hours between midnight and dawn.

Last night, I broke that rule. 

I was east, on the Nevada side. My eyes stung from the drive, my back ached from sitting too long, and the coffee in my thermos had gone cold. The next city was still three hours away.

He stood under one of those sickly yellow rest-area signs with his thumb out. His jeans were dusty, his flannel shirt looked worn thin, and his cap was pulled low over his face. I let out a sigh, called myself an idiot for slowing down, and pressed the brakes.

He climbed into the cab. “Thanks for stopping,” he said. Once he settled in, he pulled his cap lower and added, “My name’s Eli. Are you heading west?” 

“Yup.”

For the next hour, he stayed quiet and hardly moved, while he stared straight ahead. I tried making small talk, but all I got were short replies. He said, “Yep,” then, “Nope,” and finally, “S’pose,” before falling silent again.

After forty minutes, he finally spoke. “I need to piss.”

“Yeah, sure. Bushes’ll do?”

“Bushes’ll do.”

I eased onto a pull-off, gravel crunching beneath the tires. He opened the door.

“Back in a sec,” he said, and stepped into the dark.

The door shut. I glanced around. His cap was still on the seat, and next to it sat his phone. I frowned, muttering under my breath, “That’s weird,”. Every bit of common sense told me to leave it alone. After a heartbeat, I reached over and picked it up.

The screen lit up in my hand. It wasn’t locked, already sitting open on a photo. At first, I thought it was a picture of the truck stop, until I saw myself in the frame. 

I was leaning against the grille of my rig two days ago. Then another photo came up, one of me asleep in the cab, shot from above. The angle didn’t make sense, someone had taken it from the roof… or they’d been inside.

I swiped again. There I was, then more, dozens of them. Every stop, every damn mile I’d driven for weeks.

My hands started shaking so bad the phone nearly slipped.

Without thinking, I threw the shifter forward and slammed my foot on the gas. My eyes flicked to the mirror. 

He was running toward me, his limbs bending the wrong way, his arms reaching farther with every stride. That was five hours ago, and I haven’t stopped since. The highway’s empty, the fuel gauge’s dropping, and I can still feel him out there, closing the distance. I don’t look back. I just drive. He’s still running, and I know he’s going to catch me.",2,1760497101.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I told him it makes me uncomfortable that he notices every move, and he said, You’re acting like I’m a stalker. You’d do the same if you cared.

1o6zqmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1o6zqmf/my_encounter_with_astral_projection_happened_twice/,My Encounter with Astral Projection (Happened twice),"Hey everyone! I’m back with another storytime. 

This time…with astral projection. 

In a sense, to contribute this into an explanation on the experience I had astral projection usually involves an intentional effort to send your consciousness from your body. In a sense traveling out of your body, toward a spiritual plane or different dimension. 

This happened about three or four years ago. At the time I was living with my boyfriend (now ex) we’ll call him Shaun. 
To be frank, Shaun and I were living together at the time. We were always drinking and having a great time together. 
I never had an astral projection experience before so I never really thought of anything that could trigger it. 

Well it happens so, one night, we were both laying in bed together fallen asleep. It was around 11:30 pm that evening. As I remember. 

Everything was normal, normal day, normal night. 
Two hours later, this is where it started happening, because exactly when I woke up from this terrifying event, the clock was at 3:30 am. Let me explain. 

I fell asleep around 11:30 that night. Knocked out of my body type of experience where I was exhausted and extremely tired. I was sleeping pretty well. Until I realized that when I woke up, it was already sunrise. Everything in this dream felt real. I could feel the bed beneath me. How the touch of the cold floor made my feet feel. 
Keep in mind that at this point I’m still in my bed sleeping. 

Well I “potentially” walked out of the room in this dream, to use the bathroom. Start my day to day life. Everything I experienced in this dream was normal, except it wasn’t. 

I remember walking out of the bathroom to the smell of pancakes Shaun was making. Normally he would walk around with boxers on, which I saw. I told him good morning and he said good morning back. Nothing unusual. From then on, it was like I was reliving the same night we had just 30 minutes ago. Right before bed. 

I was a bit confused trying to make sense of it. But eventually we get to bed, sleep and lay it off as nothing. 

But that’s where it kept happening. I was asleep physically, but my consciousness was somewhere else I couldn’t explain. This time, I woke up. But with cold sweat dripping down my face. My eyes were in between sleep and awake, they were burning. I was cold. 
From this point I looked at my phone it read; “12:30am” I was asleep for an hour. Not even close to an hour. 

I could feel my heart beating, Shaun was knocked out as a light. I laid back as I pulled up my covers. Quickly falling back asleep. 
Not so long after I woke up. 

Same bed. Same place. This time it was dark out. I quickly pounced out of bed, looking for Shaun. No where to be found. I was fearful. But there he was as I walked out of the bathroom. A light grew in darkness. It was the kitchen. I walked slowly to the kitchen once again. Cooking pancakes and made me coffee. I told him good morning, but then I asked him what we were going to do for the day. 

He looked at me, this time I looked and stared back at him as he handed me my coffee cup. Sternly he told me “you need to wake up.” My smile faded, into a confused expression. “What do you mean?” I asked. “Wake up. This isn’t me who you’re talking to.” He said coldly. 

My hair grew big at the back of my neck and down my shoulders. I quickly left the coffee cup sitting on the table where he was at. I looked back at him once again. But this time. In the same boxers, he was talking to a woman. A woman I have never seen or talked to before. 

I remember clearly she looked back at me and smiled. Then looked back at Shaun. Shaun told her “she doesn’t know.” Slowly whispering into the woman’s ear. 
My body froze. I quickly ran towards the bedroom where I saw my body sleeping. Yes my literal physical body. 

I got into bed, right after locking the door. Pulled up my covers and tried falling back asleep where my body laid. It was impossible. This happened two or three times. 
No success. Maybe I got stuck. From what I remember I kept looking for a light or a way back into the physical world. 
This woman was following me everywhere. 

The one part I left out though, right when I went back to the bedroom, where I tried pulling myself back into the real world, it felt like a clock. Everything restarted again. Shaun was next to me. I nudged him to wake up but it he was in a deep sleep. It was helpless. I felt helpless. 

Back to where I was, I tried finding a way out. The bathroom was my only choice due from me going to it in the first place. The woman was not there. Not until I went to the kitchen again. 
There she was standing. Her white hair flowed to her shoulders. She looked around 50, wrinkly. Out of shape. I gathered my courage to ask her what she wanted. Her frail body and her expression were far too scary to look at. I felt her take my arm clutching it tightly around her hand. “You are mine.” 

I looked at her, that’s where I grabbed her and told her that I wasn’t I was going back to where I was. Pushing her away with all my strength, I managed to run out of the house. And ran towards the other house which was the neighbors. But it brought me back to the same house and same spot. I desperately walked back inside and went towards the bedroom. 
Locked the door jumped in bed. Closed my eyes. 
But the lady was on top of me, trying to grab me violently. 
Knocking me out cold. I woke up again hesitant. Looked to my right, I saw Shaun. Out like a light. At this rate I felt like I was having a heart attack. 

Whatever this entity was she didn’t want me to leave. I nudged at Shaun. Shaun instantly woke up. I told him why didn’t you wake up earlier when I nudged you. 
He just smiled. “You’re still dreaming.” 

My heart dropped. 
My last attempt was to get out of the bed and find my physical body. 
I walked all around the house, walked back inside the same place. Locked the door. I looked at the bed closing my eyes. Desperately trying to figure out a way to find my real me. I yelled out “I want to go home.” 

Opening up my eyes I saw the room change. Shaun and I were laying in the bed. There was me. I made and effort to make it to the bed, pushing myself inside my body. 

I woke up. I felt the warmth underneath my skin. Shaun’s annoying snoring. I was back. My heart was pounding, cold sweat was dripping down my face and my shoulders. My legs were sweaty. 
I was heavy breathing. I took a second to relax before I looked at the time. I was too scared to wake Shaun up at this point, due to the several times I tried waking him up. 

I slowly grabbed my phone. It read 3:30 am. I was gone partially for 3 hours that night. From then on, I decided to move out of my exes house. One from how much it was affecting me. From the little hellos in plain daylight without anyone else being there. From a little girl saying “hi!” 
I don’t know what I encountered but I’m glad it was over. For now. 

The second and last astral projection I had was with something totally different. 
It happened weeks ago. 

I was sleeping, like usual, it was as if I was in a different house. This house had an upstairs and there was a bedroom. 
I was hanging out with a group of people. One where I remember being a lady. She was fun, casual. 
But there was a man upstairs, I’m guessing who she lived with. To be fair, I have never met these people before. But they seemed familiar to me. I’m not sure if I need to put it in terms of “spirit guides” but the guy took me upstairs to look out the window and see the world from their point of view. 
From what I researched when I did wake up, was that it was some sort of observation. 
We were potentially observing people. 

Whatever this astral projection was, in terms this man said “we are not human or entity. We are observers.” 
I think where I understand it we are a light of being, with gifts. Trying to understand the world around us. But this is where I get freaked out. 

From what we were observing, I was hearing a whistle in the background coming up the stairs where we were. I asked him what it was. He simply stated “you need to go.” 

I felt anxious. He led me back into my sleep, that’s where I woke up. Drenching in cold sweat. Heart racing. At the same time the whistle I heard in my dream I heard it again as I woke up. Hearing a loud knock on my wall. 

It was weird considering I thought I was the only one awake. The time read 3:30am. Next thing I know everyone else wakes up. It wasn’t just me. It was me, my mom, my brother and my aunt. 

From then on I haven’t had any experiences with this astral projection.

my friend (f22) took me to her gym months ago. she pointed out her ""gym crush"" (m24) and i tried encouraging her to talk to him. she insisted that she couldn't do that because she saw him almost every day and it would be too awkward. well, i don't go to this gym, so i went up to him. i thought that if she saw me go up to him she would be encouraged to make a move, but she didn't follow me up to him, so i just asked for his number and ran away. i didn't throw her under the bus or anything and say ""my friend likes you"" i just said something like ""hey you're cute can i get your number?""

he IS very attractive, but i wasn't going to make a move on him after this so i didn't ever text him. i tried giving my friend his number but she insisted that was weird.

well, recently (months later) i went to the gym with my friend again and i asked about her gym crush. she said she hadn't seen him in a while and she thought he switched gyms. she said she regretted not talking to him after all, so i decided to text him.

i texted him from a fake number and i told him a fake name (we didn't exchange names before), however i did tell him that I was the same girl that went up to him several months ago. i just wanted to know if he still went to the same gym (he does). i was going to stop talking to him after that, but he was super nice and continued the conversation with me. i actually started to enjoy texting him just because he was so nice, but i literally lied to him about my entire identity and it's not like i would date the guy that my friend was into. and also my friend doesn't know that i texted him in the first place and i STILL don't want to throw her under the bus and tell him that i'm only texting him because of her.

he asked me to work out with him. i lied my way out of it, but he keeps asking. he invited me over to watch a movie and he asked me out to coffee and every time i have to just lie and say that i can't. i WANT to, but i won't.

he asked me out again today and i just felt so bad i didn't respond. he's really so so nice and i really like talking to him, but i was trying to do a favor for my friend. i feel so guilty. i feel bad for my friend and i feel bad for this guy. they're both such good people and i wronged both of them by doing this.

i'm thinking of just texting this guy and telling him the truth about everything, that i only texted him for my friend and she has no idea that i'm doing any of this. i thought i may as well also set them up, and send him her instagram or something, so at least that way it's not so bad that i've been stringing him along... i just don't know what to do. should i set them up? or should i just ghost the guy?

1o6zmj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xennials/comments/1o6zmj1/dealing_with_parents_passing/,Dealing with parents passing???,"This is a rough one.  Obviously not everyone has a great relationship with their parents, I do and I count myself extremely fortunate in that.

The man I call ""Dad"" is actually my stepfather.  He married my mom when I was 9 and my kid brother was 4.  He formally adopted us a year later.  He is, and always will be, my dad.

Since August he hasn't been feeling like himself.  Slowing down, losing weight, in pain lot, but just associated it with getting older (he's 73) and went about his days.  Just after Labor Day, he asked mom to take him to the ER, he hasn't been to the hospital, doctor's office, what have you, since 1988.  I won't go into serious detail, but after that visit, tons of visits to specialists, and a biopsy and rounds of testing yesterday that only confirmed what we already knew, he's at an advanced stage of prostate cancer that's spread aggressively in the general area down there.

During the scans, they also found spots on his liver and lungs which probably aren't related to the prostate cancer, but are definitely issues in their own right that would also need treatment.

The point is, he's going to die.  The chances of successfully treating his prostate cancer alone are very low, the oncologist told him so.  Because it's spread everywhere, removal would be extremely difficult, and radiation wouldn't be effective enough to shrink it down before it's too late.  It's already too late.  They're proposing hospice care and he's already accepted what's going to happen.

I haven't.

I can't wrap my head around the fact that he's going to be gone.  I know it's part of life, I've always known I'd have to deal with my parents passing at some point, we all do sooner or later, but I just can't see him not being here by Christmas.  I can't make myself see that it's happening.  Every time I try to talk about it I break down into a sobbing mess.  I'm a big strong man, a Navy man, a career railroader, I'm tough as nails, I'm not supposed to cry.  Crying is for wussies who can't handle the real world.  

My dad's dying, he's in pain, he can't go out to do chores, he can't drive up town for coffee.  He can't check fences, or check his cows, he can't climb up into the combine for harvest.  We (his 4 sons) have done all the harvest, and between us and the neighbors we got everything done as of yesterday.  He's happy that we've got the season finished out and mom won't have to worry about bills.  2025 is his last harvest and he didn't get to do anything.  Yeah, I cried like a baby when I hauled in the last load last night.  I couldn't even walk into the elevator office and get the scale ticket, the scale operator brought it out to the truck.

I don't know how to cope.  My dad will be gone.  Is it knowing ahead of time that's making it worse?  Death on a schedule?  Is it knowing what he's going to go through and dreading that for him, but also dreading watching it?  I don't know.

I've lost loved ones before, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, but this is different and I don't know why.

Alright, so I’d like some advice if anyone’s willing to offer it. I spent some time managing at a quick-service food place. My responsibilities were mainly shift operations and keeping the restaurant running smoothly when I was there. I had two people above me who handled ordering, payroll, staffing, and other administrative tasks. I left in January for a better-paying office job.

I’ve now been offered a position as a general manager opening a drive-through coffee place. The plan is to start around Q2 next year. It’s a new build, and the franchisee knows my experience level but wants to hire me so I can grow with the company. I’d be the one opening the location, staffing it, and running day-to-day operations.

I believe in the person hiring me. I’ve known about him for some time, and everyone who knows him vouches that he’s a great person and solid in business. I’m confident in my ability to learn and do the job well.

I’m not even sure what I’m here to ask — I guess I just want to know what I should look out for. I’ve conducted interviews before, but I’ve never been the final decision-maker. I’ve scheduled shifts, but again, someone else made the final calls. I’ve done inventory, but never had to order.

TLDR: Going to open a drive-through coffee shop and I’m nervous. Any advice?",1,1760496341.0,managers,0,1.0,False
1o6zisc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritCrab/comments/1o6zisc/how_can_i_encourage_my_dd_party_to_roleplay_more/,How can I encourage my D&D party to roleplay more seriously without taking all the spotlight?,"**How can I encourage my D&D party to roleplay more seriously without taking all the spotlight?**

I’ve been playing D&D for quite a while now. Originally, I started with a group of six people, including myself:

* **Player 1:** A.F.
* **Player 2:** M.P.
* **Player 3:** S.G.
* **Player 4:** C.V. (the most experienced among us)
* **DM:** J.P.
* **Player 5 (me):** D.R.

This was our main party. All of us had played D&D before, but never anything truly serious. Back in 2018, none of us had ever completed a full campaign. Our DM, J.P., decided we’d play *Curse of Strahd*—something that, in hindsight, was incredibly ambitious, but we had no idea of its scale back then.

We ended up playing for over two years, including through the pandemic. That campaign became deeply important to us; during lockdown, we agreed to only see each other (outside our immediate families) to keep everyone safe.

It was during that campaign that I discovered my favorite class: **paladin**. I love digging into the rules and understanding every mechanic. I wouldn’t call myself a min-maxer, but I definitely like to optimize. Whether it’s D&D, board games, or video games, I’ve always been the kind of player who studies systems to make smart choices.

That table was wonderful. A.F. and I constantly competed for the “leader” role—**in character**—which created a fun rivalry and great friendship. S.G. was more of a background player, but always brought comic relief with his chaotic antics. C.V., the most experienced, missed some sessions but often came back teaching us how to make our characters feel alive through roleplay. And M.P., J.P.’s older sister, was amazing—she studied Literature at UNAM (a major university in Mexico), so she brought fresh creative ideas and a love for storytelling.

As for J.P., the DM—he became my best friend because of that campaign. We both got completely obsessed with D&D, and that shared passion built a lasting friendship.

**Where things stand now**

Of course, time did what time does—life happened, and we drifted apart.  
A.F., my best friend, moved to another city. I still see her about once a month, but now it’s just to catch up.  
C.V. moved on to other RPGs and now DMs *Warhammer Fantasy*, where I play as a character in his game.  
S.G. and I had personal issues and decided to stop playing together. Even when we met again at a Warhammer table, it was clear our chemistry was gone—we greeted each other politely, but that was it.  
M.P. moved away for research, but I still see her occasionally since I’m a lawyer specialized in legal philosophy, and we share professional interests.

But J.P. and I? We’ve kept playing together. We’ve introduced a lot of new players to D&D—sometimes he’s the DM, sometimes I am. Our DMing styles are completely different, but we know each other well enough to make it work.

**The current campaign**

That was all background—now to the situation I actually want advice about.

Right now, I’m DMing a campaign where J.P. is a player, and I’m also a player in his *Wildemount* campaign (from *Critical Role*). That’s the one I’m struggling with.

The *Wildemount* table looks like this:

* **DM:** J.P.
* **Player 1:** F.F. – Rogue
* **Player 2:** G.I. – Artificer
* **Player 3:** A.F. – Monk
* **Player 4:** D.G. – Warlock
* **Player 5:** L.L. – Fighter
* **Player 6:** D.R. (me) – Wizard
* **Player 7:** L.I. – Sorcerer (new player, joined recently; not central to the story yet)

We started around mid-2023. A.F., despite living in another city, made the effort to visit every two weeks, which was exhausting and expensive for her, so she eventually had to stop. G.I. and F.F. (who are married) invited L.L., a mutual friend, but after a falling-out between them, L.L. left the group.

That left us with D.G., F.F., G.I., J.P., me, and later L.I. (G.I.’s sister).

D.G. is a relatively new player—this is his second campaign. I actually DMed his first one, where he played a paladin. This time, he chose what I consider *the laziest character concept ever*:

“My character lost his memory.”

Now, that alone isn’t a bad idea. It can be compelling with the right approach. But in his case:

1. He has absolutely no backstory.
2. He doesn’t seem to remember or care about the world itself—not even his birthplace.
3. He’s a chaotic evil warlock who makes the most irrational, random decisions possible.

To make matters worse, once he even showed up drunk and spent half the session throwing up in the bathroom, making everyone uncomfortable.

After that incident, and with A.F. and L.L. leaving, the campaign went on hiatus for over a year.  
We just resumed this July (2025). During that time, J.P., G.I., F.F., and I still met regularly to play board games.

When we came back to *Wildemount*, I was genuinely excited. My wizard is one of the characters I’ve developed the most—he has a home, family, friends, and a deep connection to his city and the world. He’s a true scholar who actually cares about what’s happening around him.

**The problem**

Since resuming, though, the tone at the table has changed.  
F.F. and G.I. seem disconnected from their characters. (For context, F.F. has *always* played rogues, for years, yet still asks every session how Sneak Attack or Cunning Action work.)  
We hesitated to invite D.G. back, but since he’s been sober and genuinely trying, we decided to give him another chance. And to his credit, he’s been early, reliable, and even makes coffee for everyone.

But here’s the issue:  
J.P. and I love lore-heavy storytelling. We enjoy talking to NPCs, asking questions, exploring the world, and feeling it breathe. J.P. often sets up those kinds of scenes—moments meant for curiosity and immersion—but the others don’t seem to care.

G.I. recently admitted he feels detached from his character and wants to work on that, which I respect.  
F.F. mainly looks forward to combat.  
And D.G.? The entire current story arc revolves around his warlock patron—and he still shows almost no interest in it.

I love roleplaying. I love speaking in character, reacting naturally, and getting lost in the story. But every time I do, I feel like I’m taking too much of the spotlight. I genuinely want everyone to enjoy the world J.P. is building, not just me.

I even tried staying quiet for an entire session to give them space. The result? They spent the whole session asking *in character* why my wizard wasn’t helping or advancing the plot—so the story stalled completely.

Later, D.G. texted me privately and said he felt like I was “taking too much spotlight.”  
And that’s the last thing I want. I don’t want to be *that* player. But at the same time, I feel like if I don’t take initiative, nobody else does—and the story just doesn’t move forward.

**So here’s my question**

How can I, **as a player**, encourage the rest of my party to take their characters and the story more seriously, **without dominating the table or stealing the spotlight**?

As many have said, these ice creams are creamy and dense vs light and airy. The flavors are well balanced and delicate. The mix-ins are decent and none of them taste overly sweet. 

The Meyer Lemon Cookie is my favorite but the Strawberry Crumble is a close second. The lemon swirls pack the right amount of tartness. It’s not overpowering. It balances out perfectly with the creamy lemon flavor.  You can eat through this one quite easily. 10/10

The Strawberry Crumble is so yummy. Doesn’t taste artificial like some and the crumble… idk what it is but it’s so good. Tastes similar to a ginger oatmeal cookie almost and has the consistency of a Bundt cake. 9/10

The Groundwork Coffee & Toffee is lovely. I like coffee flavors and this one does it for me. Similar to Häagen Dazs but not as sweet which I like. The people were right when they said it’s like cold brew but not as bitter. I appreciated the chunks of toffee though I was expecting the flavor to be more prominent like in a Heath bar.

It's how she's able to be so bubbly and into her nails, skincare, coffee shops, and silly dancing so soon after Trigg died. I don't care that it's supposedly 1% of her day, that stuff just isn't appropriate or a good look at all right now.

There was another influencer who lost their child or newborn (someone let me know if you can remember their name - they've been mentioned here before). They were gone from social media for about six months, and then came back saying that the loss of their child fundamentally shifted everything and changed their entire perspective into things like social media - none of that mattered anymore. Her ""new"" content was about how much more she now treasured her remaining family and all the small, important things in life. Not gym outfits, makeup, decor, etc.  
  
Honestly, I really do feel for Emilie. I'm just so disappointed in how shallow she has turned out to be. I know it's her ""job,"" but she's really selling out, and it's hurting poor Trigg's memory.

By 11 a.m. it felt like I had a fat lip on the right side of the mouth like I had had a shot a novacaine there, BUT, it was the left side of my mouth that water dribbled out which is really weird as if I did go to the dentist and got novacaine the fat lip and dribble is normally on the same side. 

I was wondering if I had a stroke or TIA. Did the stroke tests: Passed the outstretched arms, my vision fine in both eyes, hearing test done with my Apple iPodsPro checked fine. Failed: Slight droop on left side during smile test, problems winking left eye, can hardly flare left nostril, I also felt tightness and a neck ache on my right neck which may have been compensating for defective left. No problems typing, speech a bit slurred.

Thought I could sleep it off and thought maybe it was a dental thing on my right side as it still felt like a fat lip on the right. 

Early morning next day, still dribbling water out of left, decided to Uber to ER. Described symptoms to reception screening nurse and said I might be having a TIA, did some simple strength/dexterity tests with my hands and arms and right away he said BP.

ER Dr exam, diagnosed BP, given Valacylovir, eye drops for dryness (along with paper tape in case I can’t keep my left eye closed) & Prednisone like the rest of you. Leaving ER the reception nurse asked me, ‘BP?’ I said ‘yes,’ and he said that’s better than a stoke and I agreed. 

I figured out one thing on my own. To prevent dribbling drinks out of your mouth, use a straw, but USE IT ON THE AFFECTED SIDE. When you’re done sucking on the straw liquid will fall back down the straw, your strong non-straw side will prevent dribbling. Do it the other way and you will need a bib.",1,1760495704.0,BellsPalsy,1,1.0,False

I woke up to the sound of people screaming their hearts on a very very cold morning. I wanted to go to sleep.again but the situation had escalated further and now I was thinking if I ever was going to go down. I think they had it coming.

My neighbors the floor below me are a family of four. The house has four stories. I lived on the top floor. I don't have any problem with my apartment except for not having any toilets on the floor where I live. They used to do that sometimes but it hadn't been this loud. I'm sure half the neighborhood heard it and now gossips are gonna spread like wildfire. But that wasn't any of my concern. I had to go take a shit and it wasn't having it.

They stopped arguing. The old grandmother was mumbling something while the daughter in law kept quiet. Even if I didn't want to, I heard everything. I woke somewhere between "" you're never satisfied by my work"" and ""why don't you just throw me off a cliff"". The old grandfather kept quiet. He always did. But it must've been hard for him to be in such situations. To choose one side when you can't afford to choose. I had respected him more for that. From what I know, their grandchildren were abroad and only three of them lived there. 

I was at the end of my wits. As much as I hate being woken up early on a holiday, I had to do my business urgent. It's been twenty minutes since the argument stopped. Surely they've gone somewhere. I went down tiptoeing my way through. When I reached for the toilet door, I saw the grandfather looking up in the sky. The toilet was just opposite of the room at the balcony and if the door was open, the whole balcony was visible . I could see the old man standing in the sun looking at the sky. I couldn't phantom what his thoughts were and I left it at that.

After finishing my business I went back to my room. He was still standing at the balcony. I went to my room to make coffee hoping it would make my day better. Then my dad messaged me "" What happened between mom and grandmother?"".

I’ve spent a good amount of time exploring both the famous spots and the lesser-known corners of Music City, and I’ve found that the best experiences often happen once you step a few blocks away from the noise.

Here’s a mix of [classic highlights and under-the-radar gems that give you the full Nashville experience](https://jotzle.com/things-to-do-in-nashville-tennessee/):

  


**1. Explore Music Beyond Broadway**

* **Bluebird Café**: This small venue in Green Hills is where many songwriters got their start. It’s intimate, quiet, and completely centered on the music.
* **Station Inn**: If you’re into bluegrass or roots music, this place is legendary. Shows here feel authentic and down-to-earth.
* **Third Man Records**: Jack White’s record label has a shop, live stage, and a quirky vibe that blends art and music culture.

  


**2. Eat Like a Local**

* **Hattie B’s or Prince’s Hot Chicken**: Yes, the line is long, but it’s part of the Nashville experience. Go for medium heat if you want flavor without tears.
* **The Pharmacy**: Great burgers and a nostalgic soda shop atmosphere.
* **Mas Tacos Por Favor**: A neighborhood favorite that serves some of the best tacos in the city.

  


**3. Take a Walk Through History**

* **The Johnny Cash Museum**: Small but full of fascinating memorabilia.
* **RCA Studio B Tour**: Learn about where Elvis and Dolly Parton recorded some of their biggest hits.
* **Belle Meade Historic Site & Winery**: A beautiful estate that combines history and wine tasting.

  


**4. Enjoy Nashville’s Outdoor Side**

* **Centennial Park**: Don’t miss the full-scale replica of the Parthenon. It’s quirky but worth seeing.
* **Radnor Lake State Park**: Peaceful trails just 20 minutes from downtown. Great for spotting wildlife.
* **Shelby Bottoms Greenway**: Ideal for biking or running with scenic river views.

  


**5. Experience the Neighborhoods**

* **12 South**: Boutiques, murals, and excellent coffee spots.
* **East Nashville**: Artsy, laid-back, and packed with independent restaurants and record stores.
* **The Gulch**: Trendy and polished, great for rooftop views and modern dining.

  


**Takeaway**

Nashville is far more than just country music and neon lights. It’s a city where creative energy seeps into every part of life, from its food to its community spaces. Whether you’re coming for a weekend or a week, mix in a few of these local spots with the must-sees and you’ll leave with a much richer experience.

I go into more detail (with photos and personal recommendations) on my blog here:

1o6z9m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonPlatonicR4R/comments/1o6z9m0/47_f4m_river_oaks_theater_movie_buddy_and_true/,47 [F4M] River Oaks Theater movie buddy (and true cinephile),"I’m a River Oaks Theater Cinema Savant subscriber, but I usually end up going alone. I’m looking to meet a fellow cinephile to catch films with and have long, thoughtful conversations afterward (in person or in chat). Someone who lives for film: classics, foreign, indie, prestige cinema, and even some silly stuff. I love dissecting themes, cinematography, and performances over coffee or drinks. 

About me: I have a literature degree (which explains my love of film analysis) and am a liberal feminist and atheist. I strive to always be kind, love to laugh, and have a snarky streak. I’m open minded and not easily offended (with the exception of bigotry). I click best with intelligent, introverted people who enjoy real conversation. 

I tend to get along better with men, so that’s why I’m posting F4M, but I’m not looking to date. I just want to meet someone who’s genuinely passionate about film. Men and nonbinary people of all orientations welcome, 30+ please. 

I’ve got a kid, so my schedule varies, but I’m usually free a few nights a week and on weekends. And I’m always up for chatting about film in the meantime.

If this sounds like your kind of friendship, let’s trade favorite movies, directors, hot takes, and compare Letterboxd stats to see who’s got bigger film cred. 😂

Originally we were going to go with light countertops but it didn’t feel right - it almost felt too stark. We were on a weekend getaway last weekend and decided to walk around the local slab yard and I fell in love with this specific slab, a Jatoba brown quartzite. It’s hard to picture this on the island and counter tops, and google and chat GPT hasn’t been helpful. I showed this to our interior designer today and she wasn’t enthusiastic about it and called it “dated.” But I still really like it I think! We are now exploring soapstone-like slabs, eg honed granite, but I guess I’m here to ask:  what do YOU think of this slab?!

1o6z4d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuckyBarnes/comments/1o6z4d4/my_bucky_in_a_relationship_headcanons/,My Bucky in a Relationship Headcanons,"I made another post titled give me your most niche bucky head canons and so many people had so many amazing ones that I figured that I would do a similar post but for relationships. Note that most of these head canons are based on the relationship he is in in one of my fanfics

Bucky's love language is Acts of Service and Quality time. In his relationship he shows his love by doing small things, making coffee before she gets up, fixing broken cabinets, restocking the fridge with food he knows she likes. Spending time is also another one of his favorites. It doesn't have to be anything grand or even exciting sometimes just sitting on the couch shoulders against the other while reading is enough. 

How Bucky shows love is through his actions. Yes he says ""I love you,"" but he always put something behind the words. He never wants I love you just to become a phrase. 

At first when Bucky wakes up from nightmares he goes distant even if all he wants is to be held and consoled. He struggles with the guilt believing he is not worthy of it and also the fear that he might lash out. However she knows to ask, ""Do you need a moment?"" always before reaching out. It gives him that second to breath. His response would depend on the nightmare, if it was one about losing her he would shake his head and allow her to move closer to him resting his head on her shoulder while she strokes his hair. If it was one of him being the Winter Soldier he would hesitate some times even getting up and leaving the room to create space since he thought that meant safety. Now as the relationship has progressed when Bucky wakes up from nightmares the first thing he does is A. make sure that he is fully himself, B. Do a scan of the room with his eyes and the almost instantly he then wraps his arms around her pulling her closer to him and burying his face in the nap of her neck. He now finds comfort in her being so close. Her presence reminds him where he is and that he is safe and no longer the Winter Soldier. 

Physical intimacy does not come till much later in the relationship. Even then Bucky never wants that to be the only way he shows her love. Love is always much more. 

Bucky is a gentlemen without having to think. Always holding open doors, always walking on the outside of the side walk and always offering his jacket.

He can be clingy in the mornings often roping his arms around her and mumbling for five more minutes. 

After coming back from a mission she is the first person he goes to sometimes claiming that he is going to stay a day back at the mission location only to fly back the same day as the rest of the team seperately so he can have a whole day with her. He feels bad for it up until she opens the door. Instantly he embraces her holding her close and falling into her arms. That night he always holds her even closer. 

When she cooks Bucky always helps. Always. He had three sisters and knows how to be helpful in the kitchen. He even is quiet the cook himself. Nothing flashy but homey. He used to help his mother to. He's always assisting and if he isn't doing that or if there is nothing for him to do he is wrapping his arms around her from behind perching his chin on her shoulder and watching her work even if it is something as dull as stirring soup. 

Always does the dishes especially if she did all the cooking. Sometimes they do it together but on the nights when she seems tired of stressed he refuses to let her touch a single dish. He actually enjoys it. It give him a sense of normal and can also be de stressing the simple movements of cleaning. 

Bucky was so against physical touch for so long because it only brought him pain that he is now touch starved. Its not flashy or dramatic. A simple holding of her hand or his hand resting over hers is enough. But he is a sucker when she combs and plays with his hair. 

Thats all I have for now I'd love to hear urs and ur thoughts (plz keep it appropriate) lol this is long sorry. ",1,1760495121.0,BuckyBarnes,0,0.67,False

Im struggling with the energy dip, but the biggest hurdle is the mental game the constant feeling that my so called ""better high-energy self"" is floating around, still drinking coffeeLast night, I had this weird compulsion to try and find old photos of myself from when I was heavily caffeinated, just to compare the vibe😌. I used faceseek and uploaded a current, tired decaf face pic.The results were strangee☠️. The tool pulled up dozens of photos of me from high-stress work periods when I was drinking four cups a day. My eyes looked totally...let's say it was WEIRD. It was like seeing a different person who looked exactly like me but was running on pure adrenaline ANDDDD i freaked out 🫩
It feltt like the tool was showing me the ""ghost"" of my old, l self-the one im desperate to let go. This unexpected visual comparison was a huge reminder of why I quit, but it also made the low-energy slump feel so much heavier.

1o6yyzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1o6yyzc/how_do_i_stop_making_my_life_a_confirmation_of_my/,How do I stop making my life a confirmation of my worst abuser's predictions?,"From the time I was very young, my mother told me I was meant to be alone, that I didn't seem to like other people, that I would never marry, never have kids. This all flew in the face of what I desired most: a family, lots of children, a large circle of friends, a happy life. As such, I've spent the majority of the last 43 years trying to forge connections with others, attain an education, build a career... and now I'm 43, unemployed even with a doctorate, single for the last almost 5 years (and before that, for 8), childless, friendless, broke and in tremendous debt, and living in a house I own, but that is literally falling apart. I managed to excel in academics, doing better than even the majority of my non-traumatized peers, but everything else is a total loss. Because of my nearly constant, abject loneliness, as well as other recent circumstances beyond my control, I've felt I had no choice but to remain in contact with my mother... despite the fact that she is still very, actively abusive. 

I feel like I've tried everything I could to meet potential friends and partners, but nothing works. Social groups? I've participated in all available, same with support groups. Church? I'm an omnist, so I don't really fit anywhere, but I've still attended several different religious institutions, and while people have been friendly, I've never even found so much as a coffee buddy. I've used dating apps galore and found a host of ghosters, posted personal ads in classifieds and found fwb situations but no relationships. I've made friends, at least in name, but people tend to either ghost or give excuses within a few months, and are gone. Currently, the only ""friend"" I have-- the only one who will converse with me on a regular basis-- is a long-term ex from years ago; she was horribly abusive during our relationship, so the only way our now text-based friendship works is that 11 years have passed since we were together, and she lives too far away for us to hang out in person. 

I'm just completely at my wits' end with all of this. The one positive is I have a therapist of 4 1/2 years with whom I have a very solid and trusting relationship; she, however, is at as much of a loss as I am, as to how I've ended up in this conundrum. I feel like, at 43, I'm nearly to the end of the time I could feasibly raise kids-- I'm a guy, but my body isn't in great shape and I fear I won't have the energy to chase around little kids for much longer-- and when I go on dating sites or check personal ads, none of the women in my age range have any interest in having kids, anyway. I guess posting here is my last-ditch attempt to get some suggestions as to how to counter the seeming inevitability that my life will always be exactly what my mother said it would be: the polar opposite of anything I ever wanted or that would make me remotely happy.

I am trying to improve my chances by being more clear in the questionaire and expressing my interests in certain feilds and projects. 

Heres what I know: 

The Google team matching process is where you fill out a form, and during November teams will start sifting through questionaires and looking for which intern matches with their project. You'll have calls where you'll get questioned/interviewed to see if your good fit for the team. 

My questions/concerns: 

I am very curious how much your resume impacts your team matching. I would say I have a decent resume compared to other CS juniors considering I've had an swe internship at a F30 my sophomore year, many projects and a full portfolio. I believe that I lack hard though compared to other people in the intern pool, primarily because it's Google and I am expecting other interns to have had FAANG+ internships freshman and sophomore year hell, maybe even high school . I am also curious what aspects in the questionaire can be improved to increase chances. So far I've written the detailed additional skills portion, selected languages ik like python and cpp, I've also selected what I know and said that I prefer a lot of different projects. Finally can I get away with coldemailing/ setting up coffee chats with google engineers to try and find a project match through them? I asked my rec about this and they said I can only match through the recruiter, but I've seen other people say you can get away with this. 

  
So if your someone who works/worked at google and could help maybe ease my concerns or give more information about the process I would appreciate it alot!

The process that shops have quoted me seems absolutely insane. Paint the base 'milk' color - droplets of 1 color, cook, clear coat, cook, etc, etc, etc. Each round or color of droplets costs about $500. I can't imagine you're going through more than a cup for each color. Felt+Fat makes a coffee mug with larger droplets through flicking droplets over the mugs like powdered sugar over a cake. This Marin frame likely wasn't smooth - which is fine. I know I'd want the base coat to be professionally done, but I'm wondering if I can do the spackles myself. Would love to know what folks think.

1o6yv2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o6yv2o/th_mr_brookhaven/,[TH] Mr Brookhaven,"MONDAY



“I love you too, I’ll see you tonight.”



I stepped out the door at 6:34 this morning, waving to my wife from the sidewalk as she headed back inside, presumably to grab another cup of tea and get our daughter, Olivia, fed and ready for daycare before she left for the train.  



We moved to Brookhaven, Illinois, 20 miles outside of Chicago, from Southern California five years ago.  We were ready to start a family and we just couldn’t get on firm ground in SoCal, so when my wife got a job offer in the Chicago, we jumped at the chance.  My in-laws have settled into their golden years here in Brookhaven, so we bought a place five minutes from em, popped out a kid, and haven’t looked back. 



I’m luckier than most.  While I can’t work from home, I can walk to work, door to door, in twenty minutes flat.  I struggled my first two winters here, but walking year round has thickened up my California blood, those dorks are right, there isn’t bad weather, just bad clothing! I start the day with some fresh air and exercise, and the quiet calm gives me time to decompress after a long day at the station.  I’ve made it a point to leave my phone alone in my bag, and my headphones out of my ears.  For forty minutes a day, I’m afforded the opportunity to disconnect, to feel the air and sun on my face, to hear the birds chirp and squirrels fight, to simply exist where I am. 



I began walking south, it was a brisk September day, one that requires a jacket for the morning walk, and room in my bag for said jacket on the walk home.  My neighbor Scott, from two houses down, was loading up his work van as I walked by.  4 inch PVC pipe, bonding, fittings, and a shovel.  I’m guessing drainage project. 



“Morning Scott, what’s todays gig?”



“Sump pump discharge.” He replied.  Nailed it!



“There are worse days for it, have a good one!”



“You too.”



I continued walking, passing the dozen or so houses on my street before rounding the corner and heading east, on Jefferson Avenue.  The north side of Jefferson continued the sprawl of single family homes, but the south side’s residences were cut short by a small, naturalized prairie.  Indiangrass and big bluestem dominated the landscape.  Drifts of purple gentians, yellow goldenrod and orange prairie dock gave color to the otherwise muted hues of the prairie grass.  Ahead, Jefferson Ave continued east over the river.  Just before the bridge, a pedestrian crossing split the road.  I crossed the road and followed the limestone path, heading south.  To my left, the river meandered lazily, it’s shoreline crowded with tall grass and sedges, lobelia and swamp milkweed.  Occasional clearings reached the river for benches and water access.  River birches and black walnut trees hung over the water, the rockbed occasionally breaking the surface, creating turbulence in the current.  



As I continued down the path, the prairie on my right gave way to mature, dominating oaks, maples and sycamores, separated by manicured lawn; a beautiful, curated savannah.  The river bended further east before passing under another bridge, Fern Street, marking the end of the park. A playground and gazebo sat in the triangle created by the river, bike path and street, and the savannah on my right thinned into a large clearing, useful for whatever large clearings are needed for. 



A single car was parked along Fern St, an old, red Honda hatchback.  In the clearing, a stout, short woman moseyed in the well maintained field, some hybrid of shepard and retriever bounded toward her, frisbee in mouth.  The woman bent over the dog, wrestling the disc from it’s grasp.  The moment the dog lost tug-of-war it took off, into the clearing, ready for the next toss.   The woman flung the disc.  The dog tracked the frisbee, sprinting at top speed before leaping and snatching it out of the air.  What a catch!



The woman clapped her hands, smiling.  She turned and noticed me, I was still over 100 feet away but smiled at her, and shot a thumbs up.  She stopped, glanced at her watch and whistled for her dog.  “Cmon Reggie, time to go!” she called.



Reggie trotted up to her.  She quickly attached his leash and shuffled to the lone car.  She popped open the rear and Reggie hopped in, the hatch closing quickly behind him.  The engine started, and before I knew it they were on their way.  I guess she was running late, good on her for finding some time for her dog.



I crossed Fern Street.  East, across the river, began downtown.  On this side of the river, a small plaza, composed of a corner restaurant, a boutique and my favorite cafe, The Coffee House, flanked the south side of the road.  Outside The Coffee House, half a dozen tables spread out, all empty at this early hour save for a lone employee, Steve, a college age barista, wiping the morning dew off the tables.  A small table outside the entrance had half a dozen cups on it, holding online orders for commuters before they caught their train into the city.  I gave Steve a nod, and headed west.  I crossed the street and waved my badge at the entrance to the police headquarters, heading into work.



TUESDAY



Last night was fun.  I met some buddies at The Lamplighter, a small bar downtown.  We watched the Bears blow another strong lead.  God I am so glad I’m not a Bears fan, but they sure are fun to watch with genuine Bears fans.  I swear my friend’s blood pressure spiked 80 points in that last quarter. I got home around 10, and only had three beers, but between being a dad and being in my late 30s, I’m paying for it today.  It took 3 hits of the snooze alarm before I mustered the strength to pull myself out of bed.



I got out the door at 6:55.  My truck was sitting in my driveway, I could probably make it if I drove, but I’d rather bribe my coworker Mark to cover for me.  A coffee is a fair price to pay to get my morning stroll in.  I shot him a text and ordered two Americanos from The Coffee House.  



Across the street, The Garons had their American flag waving proud and high.  Last year, under that same flag, flew Trump 2024.  I have to remind myself the Garons are good folks, despite their political ideals.  Leslie brought us a beautiful bouquet and delicious homemade lasagna when we had to put our dog down earlier this spring, and she knows we’re a house of bleeding heart liberals.  They’re a part of our community, and I’m glad they’re here, even if they are a bunch of God damn republicans.



Kids gathered at the corner, waiting for their bus.  I saw Bennett, my neighbor’s 8 year old son, staring into space.  I gave him a little bump, “Our deal still stands Benny Boy, you beat me in one Mario Kart race, you, me, your dad and Olivia get ice cream.  My treat.”



“I’ve been practicing!  You’re going down!”  He shouted as he punched me in the arm.



“I’ll believe it when I see it!”  I yelled back as I made my way around the corner.  That kid’s never gonna beat me.



As I headed down the park path, I watched a great blue heron in the shallow, flowing river.  It stood virtually motionless, it’s focus on the water.  Suddenly it lunged it’s head toward the water.  It raised it’s head, a fish impaled on it’s bill, blood dripping down it’s long neck.  The fish flailed briefly before going limp, succumbing to the deathblow.  Brutal.  I continued along the path.  Ahead, I could see the old red Honda from yesterday, parked along the curb ahead.  I looked to my right, and saw the owner treading along the perimeter of the prairie, Reggie on lead, sniffing asters and goldenrod.  A bumblebee flew near Reggies head, Reggie pulled back and nipped at it.  The owner turned and noticed me, bracing her hands on Reggies leash.  I waved and called to her, “Beautiful dog.”



Reggie looked up and barked in return, jumping, constrained against the leash, begging to be petted, to play, but she said nothing.  She turned quickly, pretending not to see me.  She shuffled away from the path, dragging the dog into the savannah.  That was weird, I guess she’s just really shy.  I continued south, to the end of the park, glancing at her car as I walked across the road. An old Bernie 2016 sticker adorned her bumper, a “coexist” just to the right of it, and on the opposite end a sticker that said “Please be patient, I’m just a girl”.  I chuckled.  At least we think the same!  



I passed The Coffee House, snatching mine and Mark’s coffees off the to-go table, and headed into work.



WEDNESDAY



I stood at the base of the playground.  Above me, Olivia stood at the top of the ‘big kids slide’, as she calls it.  I tried to reassure her, “You can do it, love.  I’m right here, daddy’s got you.” She grabbed the sides of the slide and squatted, but I could see fear bubbling up in her.  She stood back up and backed away from the slide.  “It’s okay to be afraid Liv, just try it again in a minute.”  



Two boys, a bit older than Liv, were running around the elevated play paths, playing tag.  They were rough, and had no regard for my two year old trying to conquer her fears.  I glanced at their mother, she was in her late twenties and had her nose in her phone, completely oblivious to the chaos her boys were creating.  Classic Gen Z mom behavior.  I guess I’m gonna have to parent these kids too.  “Hey!”  I barked at the boys, “Careful around the little kids!”  They froze, eyes wide, stunned by a stranger telling them what to do.  



Their mom perked up, “Don’t speak to them like that!”  She yelled from her bench.



“Get off your phone and pay attention.” I responded, dismissively.



She scoffed and called the boys over, they headed for the SUV parked nearby.  “Some people are so rude!” She exclaimed, opening the car door for her little hellions.  Don’t let the door hit ya on the way out, lady!  



I focused my attention back on Olivia.   “Let’s try it one more time.”  She approached the slide cautiously.  I positioned myself at the base of the slide and reached out to her.  “You’ve got it baby girl.  I’m here to catch you.”  She was clearly nervous, but sat down, her feet dangling down the angle of the slide.  “Give yourself a little push, it’ll be just like when we go down together!”  She took a breath and inched forward, little by little, until gravity grabbed hold and began to drag her down the slide.  Her body was thrown back by the momentum, and she grimaced the entire ride down, bracing her body with her elbows.  I caught her at the bottom and picked her up, her grimace turned to elation.  “Again!” she cried.



After another 20 rides down the big kid’s slide we loaded into the stroller and headed for The Coffee House.  We’ve earned some java and a pastry.



Inside, a room-spanning industrial pipe chandelier, light bars integrated into the pipes at irregular intervals, cast a warm glow onto a large, beerhall-style walnut table.  The table was split by a succulent planter that ran the length of the table, and customers chatted with one another or typed away on their laptops.  Artwork from the Brookhaven High School Art Department (Go Cats!) decorated the walls.  The Shins played at low volume, drowned out by quiet chatter of customers and the pulverizing of beans in coffee grinders.  Steve waited behind the counter, his expression vacant.  I walked up to the register, “Hey Steve!  I’ll have my usual, and she’ll have a croissant.”  I said, pointing to Olivia in the stroller.  



“Hey man….  You’re gonna have to remind me what your usual is…”  Steve said, glancing at his coworker leaning on the counter.



“Sorry, thought you might’ve remembered me, I’m in here most days.”  Come on dude, remember your regulars.  “An Americano, splash of oat milk please.”



“Sure thing man.”



I meandered to the order pickup counter, looking around the cafe.  Ian McFadden, a city council member, sat chatting with a middle-aged woman.  “How are we doing councilman?”  I said, walking to their table.



“Tyler, hello.  Good, just having a meeting.  This is Sara, she works with city legal.”



I extended my hand, “Nice to meet you!  I knocked on doors for Councilman McFadden two years ago.  So now he owes us at the police station a big raise on our next contract!” I said, laughing.



She shot Ian a quick look.



“I kid, I kid” I said.  “I’m just happy to help people who wanna do good for our city.”



She shook my hand and smiled “Well, nice to meet you”.



“Good seeing ya Tyler, have a good one.”  Ian said.



“You too!”



I walked back to the stroller as Steve motioned to me.  “Here’s your drink, man” he said with a smirk, handing me my cup and a baggie with Olivia’s croissant.  I headed for the exit and took a swig, “Mr Brookhaven” was written on the side of my cup.  I glanced back to the counter to see Steve and his coworker look away and laugh.  Fucking kids, I thought to myself.  



It was about 11, still an hour or so before lunch and naptime.  Once Olivia was down for her nap I had a hole in the drywall to patch, wasn’t looking forward to that.  I opted to take the scenic route back to our house, to stretch the morning a bit further.  We walked up Benton Avenue, a residential street connecting vehicle traffic from downtown to my neighborhood.  Lost Prophets blared from my headphones.  Benton Ave is flanked with houses on the east side, and apartments on the west.  The guys at work say the apartments, Armpit Acres, they call em, is the hood of Brookhaven, but they really aren’t a big deal.  Sure there’s the occasional odor of cannabis, and last winter a maintenance worker was stabbed in the neck, but the guy lived, we got a guy in custody, and the domestic calls we run there are no different than the ones we have in the mansions south of downtown, just colored with Spanish or ebonics.  Most of those folks in Armpit Acres moved to our town for the same reason we moved here, to raise their kids in a stable, safe town with good schools.



I passed the garden style apartments, their balconies overlaid with planters, folding chairs, kids bikes and “Class of 2026” signs.  The parking lot was only half full, only the beater cars remained, with their beater owners presumably contributing to the smell of marijuana.  Among them was the red Honda that I’d seen at the park the last few days.  So here’s where miss antisocial lives…



THURSDAY



It was just shy of 6:40 when I left this morning, not ideal but I’d still make it in time.  Olivia woke up early this morning, 5:30, and would not stop whining.  She asked for cereal for breakfast, but when it was in front of her she changed her mind.  Same with apple slices and yogurt.  I guess she’s proof that one can live off God damn pop tarts.



I hurried down the street and onto the path through the park.  I could feel the tension in my shoulders, I needed to calm down.  What kind of man lets a two year old get under his skin.  I slowed my pace and looked at the trees of the distant savannah.  I noticed the gentle upward arches of the maples branches, the leaves at the top just starting to tint orange with the impending fall.  I followed the sharp angles of an oak’s massive limbs, showcasing the strength of the wood.  The rough morning began to fade into distant memory.  Two cyclists pedaled opposite of me.  “Morning!” I called, the cyclists answering with a short wave as they passed.  I passed the prairie and the open field revealed itself.  



My vision traced the current of the river when my periphery caught a dark object on the other side of the path.  I flinched and looked to my right, realizing it was just our antisocial friend with Reggie on leash.  She was standing next to an old oak, Reggie braced himself towards me, against his collar.  He growled, propped up onto his hind legs by the tension of his leash.  “Sorry!”  I said with a chuckle, “You scared me!”



She didn’t respond.  Instead, she tried to break eye contact, but kept glancing at me, she stepped behind the oak, a shitty attempt to hide herself.  I stared for a moment, before scoffing, “Okay then!”, and continuing my trek to work.  What a fucking weirdo, what is she afraid of me for?!  She must lead a sad life if she can’t even a handle a friendly run-in, she needs to get her shit together.



I glanced at her car as I crossed the road, rust spotted the bumper.  A crack split the rear window.  What a beater.



FRIDAY



I was out of the door at 6:30, plenty of time.  It was chillier this morning, I shoved my hands in my pockets and kept my head down on my walk.  



A low fog covered the prairie.  Moisture hung in the air and I could feel the cold humidity in my lungs. The sun was just beginning to peak through the clouds as I crossed the street and walked down the path.  The prairie ended and ahead, through the orange, sunlit haze, I could see the woman and her dog well ahead of me.  This bitch, I thought to myself.  She walked along the rivers edge with Reggie on a tether, his nose stuck in the shoreline sedges.  She’s gonna take one look at me and high tail it to her car, I just know it. 



She glanced up at me, and flinched when she saw me, fucking flinched!  She turned and marched towards her shit box, dragging Reggie along with her.  I fucking knew it, this fucking bitch.  What in the fuck is her problem, what does she have to be afraid of?!  Doesn’t she understand that it’s friction that makes the world a good place to live?!  Talking to cashiers, waving to neighbors, interacting with strangers is what makes life vibrant, what makes life worth living!  This fat cunt, this waste of life, she’s not fulfilling her social contract!  Doesn’t she understand that she’s a member of this fucking community?!  Be a fucking part of it!



She got into her car, the chassis shifting as she sat down.  The engine fired up and she was off.   Enjoy your whole half mile drive, lazy piece of shit.  I bet she’s gonna spend the whole day in her shitty apartment ordering Grubhub and watching TV.  She won’t retrieve her food until she’s sure the hallways clear, so she doesn’t have to speak to anybody.  What a life to lead.  I could feel vitriol in my heart.  I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my breath.  The leaves of river birches flittered in the wind, and spackled sunlight warmed the left side of my face.  The right side of my face remained in the cool, crisp autumnal shadow.  I focused on the contrast, on the warmth and cold.  I felt my pulse slow, my body calm itself.  Am I really gonna let this bitch ruin my day?



Crossing the intersection before the police station, a volunteer for the Knights of Columbus held a tootsie roll toward me, “Donations for the needy?”



I glared at him, “Fuck off” I muttered.  I guess she was gonna ruin my day. 



…



I took another rip from my weed pen and glanced at my watch, 10:45.  The night was calm, still.  Our friend’s rusty shitbox sat in front of me.  I pulled my phone out.  



“KFB…” I said aloud to myself, typing her license plate information into my notes app.



“R3” I took another pull from the vape.



“92”



Saved.



I spit at her bumper, and headed home.



SATURDAY



I held my badge to the electronic reader, and, with a beep, the mechanical lock clicked open.  I stepped into the police station and headed up to the darkened second floor, just the skeleton crew of the weekend inside.  I walked past the large glass wall, unlocking the attached glass door with my badge.  Inside, the dispatch center sat in darkness, a warm, low glow from dimmed overhead lights.  The only other light came from multiple monitors decorating the three dispatch stations, and a TV quietly playing college football on the opposite wall.  Mark sat watching the tv at the left-most station.  “Mark!  What’s up man?”



“Hey Tyler, what are you doing here?”  He asked, turning away from the television.



“Nothing, kiddo is taking a nap, and forgot something yesterday, figured I’d swing by…” I said, rocking back and forth on my feet.  “Hey, I’ve got a favor to ask of you.”



Mark raised an eyebrow, “What do ya need?”



“I need you to run a plate for me.”



Mark leaned forward in his chair.  “I dunno man, that’s really not for public use.”  He said.



“Cmon Mark.” I insisted, “My sister-in-law says she’s seen the same car parked outside of her place quite a bit the last few weeks.  She lives in a nice place, she’s afraid it’s getting cased.  You know she had that incident a few years ago.”  



“You mean when those teenagers raided her beer fridge?”  Mark chuckled, glaring at me, “in her open garage?”



“It still freaked her out man!”  I retorted.  Mark stared at me, arms crossed.  “Mark, please.”  I begged, “we’re the police, I’m not gonna use this for something dumb, just looking for some peace of mi-”



He cut me off, “Tyler, I’m not trying to be a dick, but you’re an office administrator.  We appreciate what you do here, but…” I could feel heat building inside me.  “You’re not supposed to have access to this stuff.”  He paused, “Look, there’s a reason you’re not an officer, if you can’t pass the psych then you shouldn’t be-“



“I told you that because we’re friends,” I growled back, “not so you could hold it against me.  I’m looking out for my family, that’s it.”  



He looked away from me, shrunk in his chair.  I could feel my jaw clenching, my anger building.  I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to calm myself.  I unclenched my fists,  but could still feel the raw tension in my hands.  I tried to speak softly, “can you just tell me if this person has any history?”



Mark took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.  “I don’t need any details, just wanna keep my family safe” I pleaded.



He sighed, “Give me the info.”



“Thank you” I replied.  I gave him the plate number as he typed it into his keyboard.



He scanned the screen.  “She’s clean, no warrants, no arrests.  Happy?”



I walked to his side, leaning over his monitor and bumping his mouse.  “Can you give me an address?  See if she lives in the area?”



“You’re not supposed to see this shit!” He exclaimed, grabbing at his mouse and closing the query.  But not before I saw her name, Taylor White.



I could still feel the frustration in my gut, but I had gotten what I’d come for, well, half of what I’d come for.  I continued through the darkened halls and stopped at the logistics officer’s door.  I pressed my badge against the electronic lock, and the latch clicked open.  I may not be police according to Mark, but the city deemed it appropriate that I have access to virtually the whole department.  Behind the officers vacant desk, a key cabinet was mounted on the wall, it’s own key inserted in it’s lock, our excellent security on full display.  I turned the key and opened the cabinet, scanning the keys inside.  I found what I was looking for, a spare Knox key.  I grabbed the key and returned the cabinet to the state I’d found it.



I headed outside and into The Coffee House.  The afternoon crowd was thin, Steve saw me walking in, “Hey, it’s Mr Brookhaven!  You want your usual?”  He laughed, bumping his coworker with his elbow.



I felt my freshly cooled rage bubble inside me once more, as I walked up to the counter.  Steve walked up to the register.  “I’m just joking man, you want your Americ-“



“You think you’re funny?”  I said quietly, cutting him off.  “You think it’s funny?  Think it’s fucking funny to mock good people?”  I felt my fists clenching.  “You think you’re cool?  Shitting on me for trying to make the world a bit brighter?”



“Woah man” he stammered, taken aback, “I didn’t think-“



“No shit you didn’t think” I interrupted.  “You don’t think, life is just a fucking joke and you’re just here to laugh and make fun, aren’t you?” Steve reeled back as my voice raised, “don’t contribute, don’t help, don’t seek conversation or betterment, don’t give a shit.  Just shit on everything.”  I jabbed my finger at him, “You’re what’s wrong with this world!” 



The cafe was quiet.  I could feel the eyes of the few patrons bounce from me to Steve.  Steve stayed back from the counter, staring, his mouth agape.  I stepped back, remembering where I was, “I’ll just go to fucking Starbucks” I muttered to myself.  I snatched a cup off the online order tray as I walked out the door.



I crossed the street, heading back home.  I needed to ground myself.  I took in my surroundings.  The field of the park was abuzz with pee-wee soccer.  The limestone crunched beneath my feet.  The din of kids learning team sports filled my ears, of parents cheering and whistles blowing.  The trees of the savannah, bright with the afternoon sun, heaved with the wind.  The same breeze blew dry autumn heat into my face.  I raised the warm cup to my lips and took a sip.  



I reeled back and tossed the cup to the ground.  Fucking pumpkin spice.



SUNDAY



After yet another rousing reading of ‘Llama llama Misses Mama’, I got Olivia tucked in and down for the night.  “I’m stepping outside for a few, I’ll be back in 20.” I called to my wife.



I grabbed my jacket, threw in my headphones and stepped outside.  The sky to the west was the deep red of a bygone sunset, rapidly transitioning to purple and black.  The night was chilly, and I zipped up my jacket and braced myself against the cold.  I walked south to Jefferson and turned west.  A few folks have begun putting out their halloween decorations, inflatable pumpkins and plastic skeletons.  Orange and purple porchlights cast a queer glow on the quiet houses.  A bluster of wind carried dry, fallen leaves across the road, clicking and ticking as they bounced on the cold cement.  I really let this Taylor girl get under my skin the other day, but I cannot fathom why someone would be afraid of me!  If I could just talk to her she’d see that I’m a good guy, just another guy that makes our community special.  She could be so much happier if she’d just participate in society!  She just needs to see it from my perspective!



I headed south on Benton, arriving at Armpit Acres.  The red Honda sat in the parking lot, a beacon to what had to be her apartment building.  I approached the front door and gave the door a tug, locked.  I scanned the exterior wall.  Behind a large bush, about six feet off the ground was the Knox box.  I inserted the Knox key into the lock, twisted and pulled the box open.  Inside were two keys, one, small and labeled FACP, the other, large, with DO NOT DUPLICATE stamped on it’s body, the master.  I inserted the master key into the door lock and she turned.  Inside, fluorescent bulbs bathed the hallway in sallow light. I looked over the mailboxes, scanning the names written on each receptacle.  White, 204, got ya.



I headed up the stained carpet stairs.  I’m just gonna talk to her, let her know I’m a good guy.  Who knows, maybe we’ll be friends!  A Wipe your Paws doormat lay cockeyed in front of 204.  I knocked on the door, Reggie barked inside.  A few moments later the door cracked open.  Taylor’s face appeared in the crack, “Can I help you?” She moused, barely audible over Reggie barking.



“Yes hi, I live in the area.  I’ve seen you at the park…”



She stared back at me, “Okay…. What…. What do you want?” She stammered.  Reggie’s nose peaked through the cracked door below her.



“I live in the neighborhood, I’ve tried to say hi, but you don’t seem to want to be a part of our community.”  



She stared at me, “What?  I don’t know you…”



“We can get to know each other, when I wave it’s just out of friendliness.  We can be friends ya know.”  I said, earnestly.



She continued to stare, wide eyed, “I…. I have anxiety.  People give me anxiety.”  She spoke quickly, her cadence unnatural, stilted.  “What are you doing here?”



“Hi Reggie!”  I reached down to pet the dog.  “I’m not a threat, I’m not gonna kidnap you or hurt you or anything crazy.  I’m not a murderer.”  Reggie snarled and bit at my hand as it got close to his face.  I pulled my hand back.  “Easy buddy, you remember me!”



“What the fuck!  Why are you here?!”  Her breathing was fast.  “How do you know where I live?!  I don’t even know you!”  She was raising her voice.



“Taylor please, If I could just come inside,”  I reasoned with her.  “I bet we could figure this out.”  



“What the fuck!  How do you know my name?”  She was clearly alarmed, on the verge of panicking.  This wasn’t going well, “How do you know my dog’s name?  Are you stalking me?!  I’m calling the police.”  She tried to slam the door, but I caught it with my foot.



“Taylor come on!”  I exclaimed, forcing the door open as I stepped inside.  The door thrust open, hitting Taylor on the head and knocking her backwards, onto the ground.  This really wasn’t going well.  I took another step inside, reached down to help her up, “I’m so sorry, I-“.  A snarl cut me off as Reggie lunged at me, teeth bared, hitting me on my right side.  His weight knocked me to the left, my body slammed into the kitchenette.  Fortunately, Reggie’s teeth couldn’t find hold and he was picking himself off the ground.  He lunged again.  I braced myself, covering my head.  He aimed for my neck, but his body crashed into my forearms.  He gnashed at me, but his mouth only found air.  Using my whole body, I threw him across the room.  He landed on an end table, his yelp accompanied by a choir of clatter as the corner of the apartment went dark, a lamp shattering as it fell.  I tried to regain my composure, and looked to Taylor, who had picked herself off the ground.  A fresh laceration on her forehead.  Underneath, an expression of fear and retribution. She held something towards me.  “Wait, this wasn’t-”



“GET THE FUCK OUT!”



Wetness hit my face.  I was blinded, my eyes burned, my throat was on fire.  I’d been maced once before, when I was going through the college police academy.  The cadre coached me through the process, to control my breathing, to fight my panic, to remain in control.  I did not have that luxury today.  I howled.  I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t see, I stumbled backwards into the hallway, Taylor continued to shout at me, but I couldn’t make it out, it was just noise.  “What the fuck!”  I coughed, I tried to catch my breath, each inhale increased the intensity of the napalm in my throat.  Through my blindness I could only see one thing, red.  I clamored up and took a step towards the threshold of the apartment.  



I was met with 80 pounds of fur, and I stumbled back into the shared hallway.  Reggie found his purchase on my right forearm. Reggie’s head wrenched back and forth, his teeth shredding my forearm and sleeve while his hind legs dug at my stomach. I could feel warm blood beginning to pool in the elbow of my jacket.  I punched at Reggie with my free arm, but his grip only tightened.  I was fully panicked now, I howled and shook my arm, a primordial plea for relief.  Half blind, I watched Taylor grab Reggie by the collar and try to pull him off me.  Thank God, I thought.  Reggie finally relented, releasing his grasp.  As Taylor pulled him backwards she began kicking me, in the legs, the crotch, wherever she could find impact.  



I scrambled to my feet.  “You fucking psycho” I gasped, but I was defeated.  I retreated down the hallway, past Taylor’s neighbors, drawn to the hallway from the commotion.  I staggered out the front door, my left arm cradling my mangled right.  



I limped back up Benton.  My face burned, my eyes were on fire, my nose a dripping faucet of mucus.  The turbulent wind like daggers twisting into my cuts and scrapes.  Blood dripped from the elbow of my jacket and onto the sidewalk.  The night was dark, and I felt the darkness in my bones.  I recounted the events of the evening in my head, of my good intentions, so willfully rejected.  All I wanted to do was find a common ground, to help her become a part of this town, and this is the thanks I get.  I focused once more on my breathing, to calm my racing heart, but I just couldn’t let go.

My Fellow Prismo valve started leaking and I thought, no problem, I'll just buy a replacement. Turns out Fellow does indeed sell cheap valve replacements - but it seems like you have to be in the USA (maybe some other countries?) to buy them. And where I am, it's impossible to buy replacement valves.

In the end I found a clone on AliExpress: the YRP Prismo for about US$11 including shipping (vs US$2 for the replacement valves plus shipping - around US$7 in the USA - from Fellow). This is about a third or a quarter of the price of an original where I am. (So I bought two - might have been to save on shipping - can't recall.)

It's not an exact clone - the valve doesn't have the same plastic frame - it's just silicon and might be susceptible to slipping out, but so far no problem. The replacement valves are roughly like a tiny pacifier (baby's dummy) - a bit sticks out where the coffee goes through and there's a larger circular part that stops the valve falling through.

The YRP Prismo fits my Aeropress perfectly, and comes with a metal filter and THREE replacement valves. I use it with both a paper filter (they fit fine) and the metal filter. It hasn't been completely drip-proof but literally just a few drops get through, which I'm happy to put up with (especially considering my rusty and risky inverted method skills). Works just fine for me.

For those wondering, the replacement valves do fit in the original but without any frame they sit loosely and I couldn't squeeze them in with the frame. Since the YRP one works well, I haven't so far experimented further.",1,1760494296.0,AeroPress,0,0.67,False

I’m feeling ok mentally and mostly physically after 50 hours, but dealing with some diarrhea that I’m not sure is normal or not. 

On both day 1 and 2 I’ve had approximately 12 oz of black coffee, 72oz of plain water, and 72oz of electrolyte drink. I’ll post the total electrolytes below. I’m wondering if I’m overdoing on the sodium? I haven’t experienced any headaches or lightheadedness. 
- Calcium 300mg
- Magnesium 400mg
- Sodium 1000mg
- Chloride 1600mg
- Potassium 2400mg
- Stevia leaf (unknown amount)

This is 4x scoops of powder in 72oz of water. In addition to that I’ve added 1/2 tsp of salt so there would be an additional 1000mg of sodium. 

Is the diarrhea from overdoing the sodium? I noticed it came on quickly when I drank about 20oz of the electrolytes in 10 minutes. I guess looking at the ingredients I don’t know what the difference is between the Sodium and the Chloride.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Dallas Stars vs. Minnesota Wild: A Same-Game Parlay Masterclass**  
*Where Hockey Meets Hilarious*

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Dallas Stars are the NHL’s version of a mathlete—relentless, precise, and utterly terrifying to their opponents. Against the Minnesota Wild, the Stars are favored at **-190 on the moneyline** (implied probability: \~66%), with a puck line of **-1.5 goals at +125**. The Wild, meanwhile, are +155 underdogs, which mathematically suggests a 39% chance to win—about the same odds as me correctly spelling “Oettinger” without looking it up.

The total goals line sits at **6.5**, with even money on over/under. But here’s the kicker: Dallas’s defense, led by Thomas Harley’s *“I’ll-score-while-you’re-not-looking”* heroics, has allowed just 2.21 goals per game. Minnesota’s goaltender, Filip Gustavsson, though, has a save percentage of .806 in his last start—worse than my ability to parallel park.

**Digesting the News: Wild Times, Wild Problems**  
The Wild are coming off a back-to-back series, which is hockey’s version of a student pulling an all-nighter before a pop quiz. Their fatigue is compounded by Gustavsson’s recent struggles, which have been so dire they’ve inspired whispers that the team’s mascot, a certain fuzzy rodent, might be better suited for netminding duties.

Meanwhile, Dallas’s Jake Oettinger is a fortress with a side of flair. His .922 save percentage against Minnesota is like a vault for a bank that also serves free coffee. And let’s not forget Thomas Harley, who’s been so productive lately, he’s essentially a one-man Swiss Army knife of defensemen—versatile, sharp, and occasionally used to open stubborn jars of pickles.

**The Humor: Because Hockey Needs Laughs**  
The Wild’s schedule is a tragicomedy. They’re playing the Stars, then immediately facing the Kings the next day—

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

I’m in the process of finding out what’s wrong with me, and why I’m going blind at 28. The doctors are settling into “A series of cryptogenic strokes, alongside a previously-undiagnosed genetic disorder.” Basically, I’m gonna get worse, and since there aren’t any risk factors I can work on to prevent another stroke (I have none), they are going to do nothing for me. I just get to be sick, with no treatment. The best the doctor could do was give me aspirin, but since we don’t know if my strokes are hemorrhagic or ischemic, I don’t feel safe taking that.

Needless to say, I’m very overwhelmed, and fragile. Even my therapist, who specializes in chronically ill people, doesn’t have answers to help me.

Today, I got myself a coffee. It’s my favorite treat, and I don’t always get to have it, since I’m very low-income, and my nespresso machine broke. I was happy! They even wrote my name on it in cute, bubbly letters, that I could read!

I’m not even as upset about my laptop, as I am about a stupid $6 coffee. :’) Now, I feel like I’m being a huge freaking baby. It’s just the straw that broke the camel’s back. It’s probably not REALLY about the stupid coffee, but I’m really sad about my stupid coffee.

First off, Thanks for being such a welcoming group! 

I’m new to this group, and looking for inspiration for a project I’m making for my mom. 


I am making my mom a mother/daughter scrapbook! 
I want to create handwritten letters and scrapbook pages that show how much I love spending time her, and how much fun we had/have. This  is going to be mostly based around our upcoming future memories/experiences that are shared/made together, as well as including our more RECENT activities/memories shared together  that just happened… i.e. we went on a hobby lobby  adventure together yesterday, and i want to show/write about our experience, (AKA no scrapbook pages of baby photos/photos of us together from decades ago.) 

I’m having trouble finding inspiration on how to make scrapbook pages about “simple” / “basic” activities done together, that are exciting story telling pages about what we did/how we felt/how spending time with her made me feel. 

we don’t travel or do extravagant things that often that would usually be seen as more “scrapbook worthy” than going to the grocery store together… but, when we do get to see each other, we always have a good time whether it’s just going to Starbucks together to get coffees, doing a craft, or any other low-key activity that’s less spendy. 

I’ve been writing letters to her about our recent experiences together, sharing my favorite things about each one, but I don’t know what to do with the letters/how to make a cute eye catching scrapbook page out of it. 

Any insight would be HIGHLY appreciated, I’m really stuck here, i just want it to be special for her, so she knows how loved she truly is! 

Thanks so much! 

Feel free to comment any questions you have that would help you better understand/clarify anything up, that will help you, help me! 

I’ll add a picture of the scrapbook (12 x 12) that I bought for her yesterday!",1,1760493591.0,scrapbooking,1,1.0,False

I have severe health and medical anxiety, and the idea of the LP scared me half to death. I barely slept last night and couldn’t eat this morning but managed to drink some water since I heard it helps. Just to say, if you have anxiety about the LP, you are certainly not alone!

I got to the outpatient clinic bright and early and they checked my blood pressure and oxygen, then I was sent to a private room. Contrary to all advice I’ve seen on here, the LP was done without guidance… and by a resident, with the doctor verbally guiding her the entire time. This did not make me feel confident, and I was shaking the whole time. 

I barely felt the lidocaine needle (my pain tolerance is pretty high). The LP needle felt gross and wrong and made my nerves zing a bit, but I wouldn’t describe it as painful. My friend had a very painful LP because the doc was in the wrong place, so I think I was just lucky the person who did mine went in carefully. They didn’t take much fluid—just enough for some tests that already came back clear. She showed me the vials and I was kind of in a daze from my adrenaline dropping, so I blurted that it looked like water 😂

The doc said my pressure wasn’t too bad, about 23. I’ve lost around 12 lbs since my ENT first said I might have IIH, so not sure if that brought my pressure down or if this means I’m destined for even more testing. Everything else has pointed to IIH, and I’m honestly dreading the prospect of my neuro deciding a pressure of 23 means I need even more invasive tests. I can’t imagine my boss will like me missing more work either, but I’m trying not to be pessimistic.

They didn’t make me lay down for long after the LP, just enough to recheck blood pressure and make sure I felt steady. That was probably the most surprising part of the ordeal. My back is super sore, but no headache as of yet. I drank a ton of coffee and water and have been mostly laying down.

Back in 2020, i remember reading posts about cheating on Reddit and learning why it happens and how to avoid it.

Fast forward a year i met this girl. We both liked each other, shared exact same values, were sexually compatible, mutually respected each other and even fulfilled each others’ desires.

We used to have long discussions about our values of loyalty, fidelity, integrity etc. She used to tell people who cheat lack morals or values and if it ever comes to cheating, much rather break up, than breaking your SO’s heart. 

We also were sexually compatible, always the initiation was mutual and we communicated thoroughly on each others’ needs. 

We both have never been in a relationship before. Neither hooked up. 

I’ve been hitting the gym for last 8 years so i trained her myself in the gym. I used to craft strategies for her so that she aces her uni exams and accordingly made sure i communicated well and left no reason to feel her not loved.

Yet it happened. A guy who she apparently ‘brozoned’ years back came back for a college reunion. 4-5 of them went for a coffee, he dropped her and all that dogshit eventually led these 2 to sleeping together. Like wtf man. All this nonsense about not cheating and that’s all it took?

Some of her friends were telling me back in past saying those guys are already in the brozone or friendzone so it’s the official end for them. And here we are.

Confronted her and she said it was a mistake and she doesn’t know how it happened. She said she never liked that guy before & rejected his proposal long back & saw him as a brother. But it all just happened in a moment, so fast she couldn’t process the consequences. She said there was no reason to cheat even, claiming that guy was less attractive than me, the sex wasn’t good and he overall was a desperate person which put her off. 

What can someone even do man. I literally made sure i leave no reason a person could ever cheat their SO for. 

I’ve talked to my friends & colleagues before. People with a past have cheated, people who’ve cheated before have cheated again, people with orthodox backgrounds have cheated & now this. I’ve seen the full circle. 

I’m just tired & broken. I literally can’t do anything more & don’t think i can enter a relationship again. There’s no way to stop someone from cheating no matter who they are and what their past is. I’d appreciate any advise on how to avoid this in future or if this is inevitable. And how to cope?",5,1760493227.0,survivinginfidelity,3,1.0,False

Initially, I was a little crabby (in the mildest sense) about having to be in this old, cold building, that was clearly once something, but is now all but forgotten and neglected. Ugly drop ceilings line the corridors. Generations of electrical conduit are stuck to walls here and there. Even for me, it was cold, and was told that the building's heat hasn't yet been turned on. I was there for a training that I had been to similar iterations of multiple times before over the last 25 years, and only had so much coffee to sustain me.

Then, I started looking around. First, the terrazzo floors caught my eyes. Then, it was the stained glass in all of the windows. Then I looked at the woodwork, and banisters in the stairwells. There was a lot of intention built into this building.

When I had some extra time in the middle of the day, I started snooping around. Clearly, most of the building is simply being used for storage for old office furniture, as you can see in a couple of the pictures. I was happy to see that many of the doors were unlocked. What I took to be hospital rooms initially, I believe were actually dorm rooms. They were small, but enough for a single student. Charming built in shelves and drawers were in the wall by the door. Each window was stained glass like all the others. Then I found what was either a corner office or lounge area overlooking the river. If not for the old office furniture, it would be a really charming space. 

Lastly, I cam across the auditorium on the top floor. It was gorgeous with grey and blue accents. There were decorative crests that had S, T, and M. St. Mary's? Was this not St. Kate's like I was told? Were the initials something else? I don't know. There was a beat up old piano up front, a large stage, pretty hanging light fixtures that all added up to a lovely space. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of fancy to-dos had been held there in the past.

I've thought many times in the past about what I would do with a time machine. I'd likely pass on some of the monumental moments in history. Instead, I'd love to see the denizens and the goings on in this building a hundred years ago, or the state fair from the turn of the 20th century, or the voyageurs and the Dakota and Anishinaabe. Like those examples, this place has more of a human and day to day history that I am curious about.

I occasionally get tonsil stones so I have really worked on my oral hygiene to get these to go away! But I’ve noticed now deep on the back of my tongue, I get this like clusters of white dots. It looks just like tonsil stones. My breath and mouth feels the same as tonsil stones that it’s just dirty back there. I floss, water floss (and try to angle to the back of my tongue but doesn’t work well), brush with oral b electric tooth brush, tongue scrape then finish with therabreath mouthwash . I do this atleast 2x per day. 
My tongue scraper cannot reach this part of my tongue because it’s so far back/my tongue has a small u shape curve in the back that even angled, my spoon shaped scraper can’t reach. The only way I get them off is my holding my tooth brush over the spot. I noticed it pop up mostly after having something like hot tea with honey or after my coffee with creamer. I don’t think it’s the yeast stuff because it goes away and doesn’t come back until after eating! 
Has anyone had this or know what it might be? What can I do to get rid of it? 
I think maybe it has to do with post nasal drip. I sometimes feel like I have mucus in my throat after eating and feel the need to clear my throat. 
Oh I also drink about 80-120 oz of water per day. 
And for reference, I have to stick the tooth brush so far back I’m gagging whilst doing it. I just feel like there has to be something else I could do.

My wife and I like to do 1 large trip a year. We have gone to many countries and countless states at this point. After years of hearing many people rave about the Alaskan cruise both in person and on here, we decided this was going to be the year we did it.

After some research we decided we wanted to do the inside passage including Glacier Bay on Hollands Koninigsdam. The Ship and cruise line were great; this isn’t a review on them in any way shape or form.

Due to time constraints, we took the last cruise out for the season with the expectation of gloomy and rainy weather, we fortunately received quite the opposite, clear and sunny skies! So, clear we got to see the northern lights on back-to-back nights.

 Our first 2 days on board were just like any other cruise, open waters and nothing to do but eat, sleep, and attend some shows! Great so far! On day 3 we arrived at our first stop, Juneau. Here we had an excursion planned to Mendenhall Glacier, that included a narrated tour of the town. We made sure we were on the first excursion out, so we had plenty of time to explore after. The Glacier was cool, especially being so close to a waterfall but somewhat underwhelming, we decided since we had a decent amount of time, we would do the 2-mile roundtrip hike to nuggets fall. If you’ve ever seen a waterfall before, save yourself some time and don’t do it. After this we headed back to town, where there is really nothing to do, its just all jewelry shops, so we grabbed a cup of coffee and back to the ship we went. We figured we still had the whole trip ahead of us and it will surely get a lot better.

Day 4 – Skagway – We woke up to some beautiful views right outside on our balcony, very reminiscent to the Swiss Alps. We disembarked and got out to catch our next excursion, the White Pass Railway ride. We again got some decent views but nothing jaw dropping. We got back to town and walked around and as everyone suggested we went to the Klondike doughboy which was in fact great. The town was like Juneau, nothing but jewelry but with some more scenic views. We again went back to the ship underwhelmed but very excited for the next day as it was Glacier Bay! As we were departing Skagway the captain came on the intercom and informed everyone to step outside as the northern lights were visible!

Day 5 – Glacier Bay – The day we were finally waiting for! We set our alarms very early and got up to the crows nest (for those who haven’t been on holland before it’s the front most enclosed café right above the bow with panoramic windows so you get a full view of everything in front) We wanted to get there early to get decent seats and be near the park rangers as they chatted about the park, we learned shortly after that they wouldn’t be joining due to the government shutdown. The Ships wildlife “expert “joined us and said he’d be taking over the tour instead. We took in some views before returning to our room. From there we sat in our balcony and for the first 20-30 minutes it was mesmerizing but then it became repetitive. We got to the first glacier; the captain turned the ship 360 degrees so we everyone got a nice view. The scenery was great, however, if you’ve seen one glacier, you’ve seen them all. This day ended with some more northern lights!

Day – 6 – Ketchikan – By far the worst stop, not much to do there, we got down walked up and down the street and found a local excursion company that drove us around the town and up into the wildlife spotting areas. We came back and did the lumberjack show which was a fun time and went back to the ship early.

Overall, if you’ve seen mountains or glaciers, I don’t think this trip is amazing as people make it out to be. Honestly, if it weren’t for the northern lights this trip would’ve been a bust considering how much we spent. This trip cost us around $5,700 for the 2 of us, this is to include airfare, hotel the night before in Vancouver, a larger room with a balcony, excursions, and a few meals plus transportation in Vancouver. We did not get the internet or drinks package to save a little. So, it is not very cheap considering some of the other trips we have taken.

 If someone were to ask if they should go on an Alaskan Cruise, I would honestly tell them to spend your money elsewhere. A trip to the Andes which would cost less or even a trip to the Swiss alps where you could see many beautiful little towns and cities and would cost you about the same or maybe just a little more with adequate planning.

Is it just us? Did we do the wrong excursions? Genuinely asking here.

TLDR; I didn’t think the Alaskan cruise was worth it and there are other trips one could take.",0,1760493025.0,Cruise,22,0.45,False

If I’m at a friends house and having a couple drinks and know I have to drive I’ll be antsy to get home so I can either continue to drink or smoke and go to bed. Like even when drinking I can’t just “chill”. It seems as if everyday peaceful things aren’t stimulating enough for me and I have a theory that its due to the amount I drink. Was wondering if anyone else experienced this or had any insights or advice? I want to redefine my relationship with alcohol as to be able to enjoy everyday things like listening to an album or having coffee on the porch but still be able to drink a couple nights a week. Found this sub and thought it was a happy medium as I want to at least try and cut down first before ruling out drinking for good. 

TLDR: I think that drinking has affected my attention span to the point where normal activities aren’t as fun or stimulating and I’d like to change that",3,1760492580.0,cutdowndrinking,1,1.0,False

The premise is Harrow becomes a vampire very young, is lonely, and turns Gideon into a vampire even though they hated each other.  The tone is pretty dark off bat in terms of the premise, the power dynamics, and violence and it kind of remains dark throughout the fic both in the aesthetic of having to hunt for humans in the night but also the the plot points.  The power dynamics make it darker than I typically read, but even just vampire fics alone are more dark than the typical college or coffee shop modern au that seem to be popular.  I'm craving some more griddlehark fics that are more gloomy and kind of supernatural like the books!

That cup became my daily dose of dopamine. Before I knew it, I was back in my toxic relationship; wired, anxious, and rocking dark circles so deep my cat looked at me like I was a stranger.

Now here I am again, staring at my reflection with the kind of fury only a tired addict can feel. My eyes are puffy. My soul is dramatic. But deep down, I know this is it.

""This time,"" I tell myself, gripping the mug like it’s a grenade, ""I am done. For real.""

Here are the brands I tried:
-The Healthy Basket, Ceremonial and Culinary. I actually prefer the Culinary. The ceremonial taste soapy for me, I had to add a tiny bit of honey to change the taste profile. 
-Adoleaf matcha, 4A ceremonial matcha. I use 5g it taste like diluted matcha.

Please share your recommendations for matcha that goes well with milk and where to buy said recommendations.

and kisses me on my forehead.

In the way that he holds my hand

and rests his head on my shoulder.

I like receiving gifts-

but in the way that he remembers to buy the gold necklace because I’m a gold girly

and lets me borrow his hoodie.

In the way that he brings me my favorite flower

and handwritten letters for me to know he’s thinking of me.

I like acts of service-

but in the way that he remembers the small things,

like not forgetting what time I have swimming every day

and wishing me good luck before my concerts.

In the way that he holds the door open for me

and brings me my morning coffee exactly how I want it.

It’s very hard for me to do blood work bc they can never find a vein even the best ! I usually get poked several times. On top of that waiting for the results hard for me. I panicked over the slightest abnormality.
With that said I had normal blood work in April aside from a hemoglobin being slightly high. Dr told me it was nothing of concern.

Last week I had a CBC and Dr said it was normal. I then pointed out to him the two things out of range and he said “oh you’re dehydrated” and gave it a funny name I can’t recall. He didn’t think twice about it, so I let it go….. at the moment. 
Then I put those two things into ChatGPT and Polycythemia Vera came up! 

Of course I freaked out. 

All I had to drink that day was coffee - no water. So dehydration is very likely. I don’t smoke or have sleep apnea. 

Can I trust the Dr that my results are of no concern? I want to let it go but don’t want to do something dangerous. 

I have to get routine bloods again in January. Is that okay to test again?

Peninsula:  
\-  Take down the partial wall between the kitchen and the area with the table so we can have an open peninsula that replaces an island we have now as the main prep area (and seems to get in the way).   
\- There's a radiator that's blocking from opening the 21"" to the right of the opening.   
\- 32"" opening matches current door width

Pantry Room:  
\- There's a pantry room behind the cooktop area where I could fit 2x24"" lower cabinets and open shelving above.   
\- Have coffee maker and grinder on the counter here?   
\- (Not shown) There's also a separate step up pantry above the basement stairs to the right of the kitchen table room. Used for cans and dried goods.  
  
Dead corner ideas:  
\- Maybe have a kitchen table-facing cabinet in the peninsula to use the blind corner.  
\- A bit crazy but use the corner near the cooktop for a fridge that can hold corny kegs for chilled and [sparkling water](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/at-home/diy-seltzerator.html). Access would be pantry-facing and limited due to a milk door (because apparently that's how they used to do it?!), but it wouldn't normally open by using a c[ontinuous soda carbonator](https://cornykeg.com/products/continuous-soda-carbonator-keg-lid).

Upper Cabinets:  
\- 9' ceilings, unsure whether to have molding, free space, or possibly 12"" cabinets to bridge tops of cabinets to ceilings.   
\- Is it fine to pick widest cabinets to fit within window molding or does this look crowded?  
\- Store dishware and cups here and maybe spices in 12"" one adjacent to the vent hood.

Lower Cabinets:  
\- 36"" induction + 36"" vent hood  
\- Pull out trash to left of sink  
\- Silverware, towels to right of dishwasher. Vertical cutting boards after that, followed by appliance storage.

High Cabinets:  
\- 24"" for Miele Steam oven + Microwave combo, pull out for baking pan storage  
\- 24"" countertop for oven/fridge landing zone   
\- 36"" fridge

1o6xtaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o6xtaa/kalita_wave_vs_hario_v60/,Kalita wave vs hario V60,"Hi everyone 👋. I was wondering if I can have your expert aficionado opinion on whether or not I should use a kalita wave or hario v60 for lighter roast beans. 

I recently purchased a pour over from my local coffee shop (Georgios coffee in NY), it was an Ethiopian sumatra that had notes of blueberry and strawberry. I was very shocked when I tasted it that it tasted JUST LIKE BLUEBERRIES.  I say that because I've never tasted those fruit notes, ever. So I was shocked when I did. 

Naturally I purchased a bag, brewed it with my kalita wave but then, guess what, never tasted those notes again. I tried higher temperature, stirring right after bloom, agitating using pulse pours and obviously adjusting grind sizes. I just can't seem to catch that blueberry taste I got when I purchased that pour over. 

They brewed that pour over using a hario v60. I honestly thought it wouldn't make much of a difference using the kalita but I have to ask, does the brewing equipment really make that much of a difference to miss such an enjoyable element of the coffee? I've ended to ordering a hario v60 now just so I can hopefully catch that taste again. If it gives me that taste again, I've honestly lost hope it in kalita.

Currently, I'm struggling to quit smoking (heavy metals actually age you at the speed of light) and I'm aware of this, which is exactly why I would like to be able to quit. Unfortunately, I have dry skin which, as you know, is prone to premature aging,  so I use everyday coconut oil, coenzyme q10, retinol. I'm almost obsessed, I love having a slightly oily skin. I usually use SPF a lot in the summer and spring, I try sometimes to massage my face and also to drink more water…. The sugar from coffee is another problem that I have to resolve —-> to try to cut the sugar (I feel is really hard, same as trying to quit smoking 🥲)
 Im curious about something… I recently found out that another trick to stop premature aging would be to use ice for face. I've also seen some girls on tiktok who keep their face in cold water for 15-20 seconds. Has anyone tried this? does it work?",0,1760491430.0,scacjdiscussion,1,0.33,False

As a survivalist, I once had a PowerStation die on me right in the middle of an emergency, and from my experience, most energy devices, even those sold as “rugged” or “outdoor”, are not truly *emergency-ready* and able to withstand actual damage.

For this reason, our company PhotonSolarSystems is working with leading international partners in the USA to develop a dedicated version of our portable solar generator designed specifically for survivalists.

Here’s what sets us apart from the competition: our system is fully waterproof, built with a military-grade shell for maximum durability, and designed to be compact enough for one person to carry with a single hand, backpack or trolley.

Our device can power an entire household or base camp completely off-grid, and be recharged from ANY power source.

I’d love to hear your stories too, if you are willing to have a quick coffee chat, hit me up!

I'm Jamie, a tech enthusiast who stumbled into the world of content creation a few years back. Coming from a background in computer science, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of creativity and technology, which led me to start building HypeCaster.

In the beginning, I dabbled with various content creation tools, curious about how automation and AI could enhance the media landscape. My first projects involved clumsy, manual workflows—little experiments that never seemed to scale. I was obsessed with finding ways to streamline processes, but many of those early hacks just broke constantly, haha. 

It wasn't until I saw how much time creators were wasting on editing and posting that the idea for HypeCaster really clicked. I realized there had to be a way to use AI and automation to solve this problem. So, I started validating the idea by building scenarios on Make.com, connecting diferent APIs and gathering feedback from early testers.

Our first big wins were small but monumental—watching our first prototype work, generating our first automated video, and receiving some positive feedback from fellow creators. those moments made me feel like maybe, just maybe, we were onto something.

Late nights were filled with tinkering and lots of coffee, but nothing beat the excitement of seeing our first automated video roll out—only for the flow to break after three tries lol. Today, HypeCaster is a platform dedicated to helping creators generate and distribute content effortlessly using AI and automation.

Thanks for reading my journey! I'm excited to share more about what we're building soon.",1,1760491281.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

1o6xpp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/recurrentmiscarriage/comments/1o6xpp9/my_miscarriage_story/,My Miscarriage Story,"As a part of my healing, I’m telling my miscarriage story. Hopefully it will reach someone who is going through something similar and needs to relate. But really, it’s for me.

I’m 36 years old and we found out we were pregnant at 3 weeks, 4 days (TTC and testing early). The first symptoms were breast soreness, constipation, and fatigue. We were elated as we want so bad to build our family and give our daughter a younger sibling.

The first week was typical and the excitement builds daily with every pregnancy test line becoming stronger. Once I got to 5 weeks, the excitement builds again as I officially was past the length when my chemical pregnancy happened earlier this year (4 weeks, 5 days). 

In the middle of the next week, I had this random bout of diarrhea that was extreme but not associated with any other symptom or illness. It lasted one evening and I didn’t give it another thought. I did start to notice that my symptoms were different than my first pregnancy and I didn’t have any nausea at all, where my first I was extremely nauseous and vomiting daily starting at 5 weeks. But I knew every pregnancy was different so I tried to not think negatively.

The day I hit 6 weeks (Wednesday) I noticed brown, coffee grounds-like discharge when I went to the bathroom. My heart sank. I checked my breasts, they were maybe a little less sore than the previous day, but I wasn’t sure. I told my husband and we tried to not make a big deal about it. I called my doctor the next morning after I noticed more pinkish discharge when I woke up. They decided to bring me in the next day.

Through the rest of the day, the discharge picked up. Still brownish-pink, not red, but there was an uptick in volume. My breasts were definitely less tender. I was so tired, more than before. I wasn’t in pain, maybe a 1-2 in my lower abs but it didn’t hurt like I had read about other miscarriages so I was holding onto hope that it was something else. It could have been nerves or stress, but I was an emotional wreck.

The next morning I went to the doctor who did an exam and she was kind of on the fence. It could be a SCH, or a miscarriage, or something else. None of my symptoms were absolute one way or the other. We would take betas today and then again on Monday, which would tell us what to do next.

I already knew SCH was a possibility from the incessant googling I had been doing. I was desperate to find a story online that was similar to mine, with the same symptom progression, that had a happier ending. At that point, it seemed it could go either way but in the back of my mind, the loss of breast soreness was eating at me.

Over the weekend, the bleeding picked up majorly. It went from dark brown/red ish to bright red with small clots. I was filling pads every 2-3 hours. Then on Sunday, I passed a massive clot and it caught me so off guard. It was the size of half my palm. I was bleeding so heavy and passing huge clots for the rest of the day every few hours. My pain never got above a 1-2, but I noticed it would come in waves every 10 minutes or so. My betas came back at 3600 at 6.5 weeks. Normal range but on the low end.

The bleeding peaked Sunday night into Monday morning. I worked all day Monday, trying not to think about the bleeding and clots I was passing. It was horrible and surreal.

The bleeding started to ease up Monday night. I never saw anything but blood clots through the process, never tissue, maybe something on Sunday that looked like a whiteish lining over a clot, but still looked like the previous clots. By the time I got my second beta results Tuesday morning, the bleeding had eased and I had come to terms with what I was hoping wasn’t happening. The betas came back at 2400, confirming the MC.

The nurse and doctor team were really kind and are setting me up to get betas every week until I’m back down to 0. My 8 week ultrasound was cancelled.

I’m coming out of the experience with a renewed sense of how hard it is to get and stay pregnant. Women are amazing, working every day as they go through such a scary time, not being able to speak up about their experiences but to only a select few. I wanted to scream out loud what was happening, but instead I just painted on a smile and churned through. My husband is incredibly supportive, taking the lion share of childcare through the week and letting me rest/sleep as much as possible, buying me flowers and letting me vent. I know it’s hard on him too.

It hasn’t led me to think I can’t have a successful pregnancy in the future and I’m trying to not let those negative thoughts through. We’ll try again and trust that my body will know when it’s right, and be blessed with a strong, sticky baby the next time around. One of the most helpful thoughts to have is that my body is doing the right thing, by stopping a pregnancy that wasn’t going to be a viable one, all through the natural process, which is sad, messy, but all in all impressive. Women are amazing.",1,1760491165.0,recurrentmiscarriage,0,1.0,False

I am in university studying a double degree and work a part-time job and go to the gym and am really fit and have a lot of hobbies, I am okay looking6-7/10 not Meghan Fox but not old sally from down the road yk …. I asked a stranger at my uni for an unbiased opinion lol 

I have been in a relationship with my partner for 2 years nearly and we are planning on settling down, getting engaged, buying a house in the next 5 months . 

He is amazing, I am not the easiest at times as I’ve had a hard life and carry a fair amount of baggage… he has been nothing but kind an caring, supportive and loving - he has helped pay for my uni even in small amounts each week. He is an apprentice and a few years older than me and nearly qualified - genuinely a top guy, truly. 

We match up on almost everything, apart from things like fitness goals and standards, standards as in social like what is acceptable and what is not, I am from a upper middle class and he grew up on next to nothing, not being mean but it is factual -  and he’s got me to turn into a financially savvy gal whereas before I was not - I want a traditional type of marriage and all of that but I am unsure of whether it will be possible, he is trying so hard and I am so proud of him and I believe he can for the most part…. - he also has some health issues I am worried about being passed down genetically like asthma, hay fever, eczema etc 

However I’ve had a guy I talked to maybe a few years ago who I ran into and he asked me to coffee, I thought it was platonically as I thought I had told him I was in a relationship but on reflection have realised it is not. 

I told the guy I am in a relationship and could not would ever compromise my morality but something inside me likes to future plan and what the other guy has and his current as is life prospective seems almost higher and more aligned.

I don’t know him very well and I am not willing to put my partner in any situation as I do genuinely care about his wellbeing - I feel like such a bad person, truly - I don’t want to hurt anyone, I don’t want to hurt him, part of me wants a life with him and the other knows I’ll probably want more and yet I am willing to stay and give him the chance - the other part is his family - very different from mine and I don’t know if I want my partners family (some of them) influencing my hypothetical future children you know violence, drugs etc - he is the total opposite of that though so I am not trying to place his family lore onto him.

I feel so lost, so confused and feel like I cannot be honest when I am wired to be honest as I don’t want to hurt anyone you know ….

My partner and I will be going to Kona to celebrate our anniversary. I am very much a traveler, whereas he is HEAVILY a vacationer. The main issue I have (besides not knowing the island) is that my partner insists on being the main driver, but hates driving. He wants to go on vacation to relax and gets very bummed out about having to drive to many places or long distances bc then he doesn’t get to enjoy the trip. He’s not comfortable with me being the main driver bc I’m not very experienced (I got my DL two years ago). I would appreciate any input/guidance y’all have for relaxing things to do around Kona. I’m also open to suggestions for driving outside of Kona to see something nice like waterfalls or state parks (as long as they’re about an hour’s drive away - that way we don’t get stuck in traffic and my partner won’t stress out). 

- Friday 
* Arrival at Kona airport: 10:30am
* Car rental: 11a (suggestions for what company to use? Neither one of us knows how to drive 4WD, and we don’t plan on going to Mauna Kea fyi) 

* Brunch in Kona area (suggestions?) 

* OPTION 1: rent snorkeling gear from Kona boys surf shop, and go snorkeling on our own (maybe at two step?). 
* OPTION 2: rent beach towels/chairs from Kona boys, and just have a beach date at two step (other nearby beach suggestions?). I’m interested in sunbathing, my partner is interested in swimming/being in the water. 
* Option 3: coffee farm tour. (Could we just show up unannounced and buy a ticket? Or are reservations the only way to go?). 

* SUPPLY STOP (we usually stop at the first ABC store we see to pick up snacks or essentials we may have forgotten) 

* Drive to Hawaii volcano natl park 
* (Any suggested stops to make between Kona and the NP?)

Hey y’all! I’m 25, female, and really hoping to develop some genuine friendships with other women! I’m super quiet like… 90% of the time, but once I warm up, I love talking shit and laughing about the most random things.

I’m currently in school for my RN, so I get busy and disappear sometimes, but I promise I come back. I love horror, dark humor, and I’ve got 10 tattoos of completely random stuff (none of them make sense, and that’s kind of the point).

I’m southern, into sarcasm, iced coffee, late night venting, and people who can hold real conversations without being weird. I’m not looking for anything romantic — just chill, funny, supportive friends who get the chaos of adulting, school, and trying to keep your sanity intact.

It started a few months ago, the day my Grandpa died.

I’d been to enough funerals to know the rhythm—black clothes, hollow condolences, that heavy air of finality. 

It was all too familiar.

That day, I learned Grandpa left me his house, but he left me something else, too.

A plain white envelope with just two words scribbled on the front: Read Carefully.

Inside was a note that would change my life.

It read:

To My Grandson, Nathan —

If you're reading this, it means I’ve failed and that I’m no longer here to see you become the man I always hoped you would be.

There’s something that you need to know about our family. Something that I’ve kept from you your whole life to protect you. 

You’ve inherited more than just a house; you’ve inherited a family secret.

There’s a door upstairs in the attic that sits in the middle of the room. You haven’t seen it yet, but you will.  It’s a door that chooses to show itself to you and once it does — your life will never be the same.

It only appears to the men in our bloodline. I couldn’t explain it to your grandmother or your mother. They thought I was crazy because they could never see it like I could.

I’ve managed to keep the door locked away for over sixty years so that your father could raise you and give you the childhood I never could for him.

Every night of my life was spent standing in front of that door and making sure it stayed closed because if no one is watching, it opens.

It can’t ever open. 

That’s why this next part is important. You need to heed these rules, no matter what.

1. Do not open the door no matter what you hear.

2. You must be standing or sitting in front of it. You cannot be more than 10 feet away.

3. When the voice behind the door speaks, do not respond.

4. Do not close your eyes unless you want to open them again.

5. Always remain at your post. You can sleep when the sun rises.

There will be more and when they appear, you need to be ready. 

The door is always watching and learning you. Your resolve will be tested.

I won’t sugarcoat things, if you fail, you will die. 

That can’t happen, for if the door is left unguarded, the world will be in grave danger.

I hope you’re stronger than I ever was, Nathan.

I believe in you, good luck.

Love,
Grandpa Bill

The note shook me to my core.

I’d always looked up to Grandpa Bill. 

He was my last real connection to my parents—both of whom died in a house fire when I was seventeen. 

I never got to say goodbye, and I never had closure.

My grandmother passed a year later, and after that, I was left with a few distant relatives who barely remembered I existed.

But Grandpa? He made me feel like I still belonged somewhere, like I hadn’t been completely forgotten.

Losing him felt like losing the last piece of myself that still remembered what “home” meant.

For a while, I didn’t even want to be in the house — the memories, the silence, all of it felt wrong.

But I had to be strong—just like he would’ve wanted.

I couldn’t let the door win.

I moved into the house immediately and that night is when my duty began.

As soon as the sun went down, I took my Grandpa’s note with me and went upstairs to the attic.

When I reached the top of the stairs, I laid eyes upon the door for the first time.

It stood in the middle of the room, and its crimson red wood was warped and shone faintly in the moonlight from a small window nearby. 

Scratches ran across the surface—deep gouges like something had tried to claw its way out… or in.

I sat a few feet away, not daring to get closer.

It just stood there—silent and still for now.

But I couldn’t shake the question that lingered in the back of my mind:

Why was my family given such a peculiar task?

The longer I stared at the door, the more it felt like staring into an answer I didn’t want. 

The silence pressed against me, thick and waiting.

Nothing happened for the first few hours, but a little after midnight, I heard a knock.

At first, I thought it might have been my imagination, but I heard it again.

This time, it was louder, heavier, and unmistakably coming from the door in front of me.

I fell backwards and watched the door shake from how hard the knocking had become.

Eventually, the knocking stopped, but the air was… moving.

It wasn’t wind, it was slow, warm, and rhythmic.

The door was breathing. 

Each damp, sour exhale brushed my face — the smell of decay curling like smoke.

I backed up but remembered not to go too far away from the door.

I didn’t say a word or move again until the sun came up.

When the light finally touched the door, it stopped breathing.

That’s how it was for the first week.

Life outside the attic felt paper-thin — the price of a routine I was still learning to survive.

My coworkers started noticing—the dark circles, the zoning out during meetings, the way I’d flinch whenever someone tapped me on the shoulder.

One of them joked that I looked like I was living in a haunted house.

I laughed, but I didn’t correct them.

I burned dinner twice, forgot my neighbor’s name when we crossed paths, and nearly drifted off behind the wheel at a red light.

Then the sounds started following me.

The fridge humming downstairs began to sound like chattering teeth.

My reflection lingered a little longer than it should have.

Sometimes I’d catch myself whispering the rules—not to remember them, but to convince the door I still believed in them.

It felt like a pact, like a ritual I couldn’t escape.

With every repetition the rules grew heavier. 

They stopped feeling like protection and started feeling like chains.

Everything real was starting to feel fake, and the only things that felt real were the voices and the door.

Day after day, night after night, my life split in two.

One under the sun, the other in the dark.

By day, I’m just another exhausted office drone.

By night, I’m the gatekeeper.

Work eight to five, eat, sleep if I can, climb the stairs, watch the door until sunrise, and repeat.

Every night blurred into the next until time itself felt like another rule I had to obey.

I almost started to believe the door would never change.

On the eighth night, I heard the voice behind the door speak for the first time.

“Do not be afraid.”

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark. 

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week. 

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop. 

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did. 

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before. 

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future. 

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.” 

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.
 
“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision. 

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it. 

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate. 

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence. 

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me. 

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole. 

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning. 

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light. 

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice. 

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say. 

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post. 

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards. 

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air. 

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find. 

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open. 

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that. 

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night. 

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep. 

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek. 

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me. 

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern. 

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards. 

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered. 

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. 

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross. 

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved. 

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it. 

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer. 

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me. 

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face. 

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight. 

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn. 

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling. 

I haven’t slept in days. 

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations. 

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all. 

My parents, Grandpa, myself. 

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

I burned dinner twice, forgot my neighbor’s name when we crossed paths, and nearly drifted off behind the wheel at a red light.

Then the sounds started following me.

The fridge humming downstairs began to sound like chattering teeth.

My reflection lingered a little longer than it should have.

Sometimes I’d catch myself whispering the rules—not to remember them, but to convince the door I still believed in them.

It felt like a pact, like a ritual I couldn’t escape.

With every repetition the rules grew heavier. 

They stopped feeling like protection and started feeling like chains.

Everything real was starting to feel fake, and the only things that felt real were the voices and the door.

Day after day, night after night, my life split in two.

One under the sun, the other in the dark.

By day, I’m just another exhausted office drone.

By night, I’m the gatekeeper.

Work eight to five, eat, sleep if I can, climb the stairs, watch the door until sunrise, and repeat.

Every night blurred into the next until time itself felt like another rule I had to obey.

I almost started to believe the door would never change.

On the eighth night, I heard the voice behind the door speak for the first time.

“Do not be afraid.”

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark. 

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week. 

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop. 

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did. 

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before. 

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future. 

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.” 

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.
 
“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision. 

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it. 

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate. 

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence. 

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me. 

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole. 

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning. 

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light. 

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice. 

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say. 

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post. 

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards. 

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air. 

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find. 

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open. 

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that. 

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night. 

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep. 

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek. 

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me. 

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern. 

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards. 

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered. 

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. 

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross. 

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved. 

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it. 

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer. 

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me. 

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face. 

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight. 

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn. 

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling. 

I haven’t slept in days. 

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations. 

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all. 

My parents, Grandpa, myself. 

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

So 2 days ago I drank coffee after quiting for 5 days because of the meds and I wanted to see how it would affect me and it’s was big jittery and big energy and wasn’t pleasant and affected my sleep that night it was too much and it was a small. I didn’t like it. 

So the problem is now I wake up like 3-4am and now I have a problem going back to sleep. I wake up and go back to sleep and wake up and go back to sleep and wake up a bunch of times these past couple of days. Since I drank coffee 2 days ago but I quit. I’m still getting like 7-7.5 hours of sleep but it’s really annoying. 

Is this normal? Since I never tried adhd medication before? I don’t have any other side effects just dry mouth but not that bad I drink water and it goes away. 

I also tried magnesium glycinate before bed seems to help me fall asleep at 9pm any tips?

Above is an update from like 2 months ago to get on the same page. 

I am now down to 214-21bs and can see a slight difference in progress visually and have became less “round”. Also definitely [feel] a big difference in overall mobility in squatting, climbing, bending work is much more easier idk why I didnt decide to get into shape years ago

Anywho it all started week before last when I started my new job. New job is a bit more labor demanding I’m up and down man lifts/ladders all day, walking around all day looking for dam tools and much more involvement of the body being wiggled in tight cramped spaces lots of overhead welding etc. 

Since then getting off work I’m more tired than usual and I’ve picked back up on coffee quite a bit to get through just the work day. I do still lift weights and run afterwards but the next day and the day on so forth by day 3 I’m getting much more tired/burnt out in the evenings and more hungry at night Sleep disruption is there unless i get up and eat something. Catching myself buying a bag of chips here and there, grabbing a free cookie at work because my stomach is always on E most of the day and whatever I eat it only lasts on my stomach maybe for about an hr and a half. I’ve cut down intense running from 30 mins to 20 mins instead.

I’ve been engaging in between 2200 - 2500 calories a day @ 5ft 11” 215 lbs. goal is to get down to 205.
