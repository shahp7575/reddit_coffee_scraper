1jdzr4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jdzr4k/i_cant_stand_it_when_people_talk_about_coffee_and/,"I can’t stand it when people talk about coffee and tea, it’s my biggest and weirdest pet peeve","You know how in middle school one immature boy would go around screaming the word ‘moist’ and some girls would just visibly cringe, shrivel up, become dust, and want to die inside? Idk why but that’s how I feel when people talk about caffeine. It just gets me. There’s no good reason for it. I have tried to be less judgy and disgusted by it. I really have. The fact that I secretly am temporarily (and sometimes permanently) disgusted with everyone in my life that talks about their caffeine is my biggest dirty secret. 

I hate the momentary greedy golem like look people often get on their faces when they talk about it. Thoroughly unsettled is  how I feel when people talk about or describe how much they love their coffee and other caffeinated drinks. It disgusts me to my core. Like nails on a freaking chalkboard. Nothing annoys me more than someone fantasizing about a ‘fresh cup’. I wish I could just ignore it, or turn my thinking around, but I just can’t. I don’t get it. 

Nothing about that coffee is fresh. The beans were probably imported and took weeks to get here sitting on a pallet, then they were probably roasted, then likely sat in a bag for at least a week or more if it’s from home. Then it was ground and boiling water was run through it. That shit is not fresh. Smells like freaking poison to me. Holy cow it just irks me so much listening to people almost fetishize caffeine. 

Saw a post in one of my distant friends accounts. It was nearly two whole ass paragraphs of her describing how she liked her coffee and how she chose to sip happily at her fresh cup. Eugh. Gross. I know I’m going to get flamed for being overly judge but I wanted to get this off my chest, since I have to hide my disgust. I never want to actually hurt someone’s feelings so I always outwardly swallow it and act normal. Like a penguin from Madagascar, just smiling and waving. lol 

I also can’t stand coffee snobs. When I walk into coffee shops to pick things up for my coworkers I hear the rudest people whining and moaning at these poor employees about a million silly drink modifications. I get replacing whole milk for something like two percent or switching to oatmilk if you’re vegan… busy some of the demands are just asinine. The long list people never seem to be very nice either. 

Watched a fully grown woman scream at another human being over her godd**** frappe a month ago and it only made me hate it more. I really think pretentious coffee people are vile. Scum of the earth humans. More than I hate other kinds of pretentious people.  For some odd reason I have a higher tolerance for pretentious asshats when it comes to almost anything else, but when it comes to coffee and caffeinated drinks, I’m reviled. 
I know I’ll be downvoted and shamed for saying this stuff. I’m sorry but I had to get it out. 
Go ahead 
I probably deserve it

I (20F at the time) had just ended a two-year relationship and was in a rebound FWB situation with a friend—let’s call him Dave. One day, he introduced me to his close friend, Amy, who somehow became a small post of our group over discord calls and group chats. A couple of months later Amy was visiting from the UK. She was dating a guy we’ll call Steve (19M)

Now, when I first met Steve, I wasn’t exactly swooning. But the more we talked, the more we realized we were basically cut from the same cloth—same college, same field, same vibe. After Amy flew back, Steve naturally became part of our group. Coincidentally, my new job was just a minute from his house, so we started hanging out more—lunches, coffee breaks, and maybe a little too much “accidental” quality time.

Here’s where it gets messy: Amy wasn’t exactly girlfriend of the year —in fact I’d say she was a nightmare. She had cheated on Steve multiple times, yet somehow refused to let him go. It wasn’t that he was still in love with her; he was stuck. Every time he tried to leave, she’d manipulate, guilt-trip, and trap him into staying. He was exhausted, done, and desperate to break free.

Then came a stormy December night—literally. Floods left me stranded at work, and Steve, came to the rescue, taking me to his place until I could get home. That car ride? Electric. We talked about everything—his toxic relationship, our lives, our dreams. At one point, he looked at me, I looked at him, and for a split second, the world stopped. But we turned away. He was still technically taken.

Fast forward a month—drinks were had, inhibitions were lowered, and I sent Steve that text. The one where I told him he deserved better, that he should finally break up with Amy. His response? Are you asking me out? My answer? Yes.

A week later, Amy was out of the picture, and Steve was mine. Three years later, we’re still together, and I have zero regrets.

Did I “steal” him? Maybe. But let’s be real—he was a prisoner in that relationship. I just handed him the keys.",2,1742283205.0,AmItheAsshole,2,0.63,False

**Platform(s):** PC - Windows XP

**Genre:** Time Management

**Estimated year of release:** early 2000s, possibly late 1990s, but I've played it somewhere between 2000-2010

**Graphics/art style:** The general theme was dark. Lot's of dark blue, green, purple, black. There was a map with marked levels. In each level you stand behind a stall. At least 2/3 of the screen are the working area/bar where you prepare drinks. The top is a ""window"" where customers come in and order.

(In this it was very similar to Baking Success but the graphics were a bit cruder and the customers smaller, like chibi, but not the same style.)

**Notable characters:** Customers included vampires, dark fairies, yetties, probably witches as well.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** General gameplay was easy - customer comes with a specific sound to the top with an order written on a sheet of parchment. You need to identify the drink they want and make it. It starts with Hot Chocolate that is ordered as Hot Choc. You brew the base into a shot, pick up a glass, pour it in and serve to the customer. Customer leaves coins on the counter you have to collect.

As the game progresses you get more drinks to juggle. There are different glasses and mugs to use, various flavors (marsh, wart, pumpkin), inserts (ice, marshmallows), toppings (whipped cream, wart cream) and decors (warts, cinnamon, cherries, marshamllows.

You have to remember the recipes since the customers order by name like Marsh Coffee. At several points in the game you have to make your own recipe and name it, then you serve it as any other.

Not sure about this, but there was a tip jar on the counter. The coins customers leave on the counter go to the jar and then you buy upgrades for the stall. There was a character that would steal the tips if you didn't collect it from the counter in time.

There are several different areas you go through. I remember a marsh and mountains. Each area changes the amount of different customers and their preferences.

**Story:** Take this with a grain of salt, since I might be mistaking with another game, but the MC is not serving in the stall willingly. I think the game starts with a scene where a woman walks into a café in the middle of a forest, acts rude to the owner who turns out to be a witch and curses the MC into the magical land to serve until they learn hopitality. The opening scene had a different art style than the rest of the game which is why I think it might be from a different game.

**Other details:** The game had to be installed on the PC, not a browser thing. I must have found it on one of those sites with tons of games like BigFish, PlayFirst, Oberon etc. since I was playing a ton of those back in the day. It wasn't free - I donwloaded a lot (I had no budget as a teen). I am buying a lot of them now if they're still available to make up for that.

I might add this if I remember something else. Any clues will be appreaciated. :)",1,1742282418.0,tipofmyjoystick,6,1.0,False

1jdzc9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1jdzc9o/we_accidentally_invited_a_drug_dealer_to_our/,We accidentally invited a drug dealer to our wedding,"This happened a few years ago but we are still flabbergasted about it.


We planned to do a tiny wedding, less that 100 people. Two weeks before the wedding, a friend we knew from highschool asked us if she could bring her boyfriend. We thought we forgot to add a +1 and we were very apologetic. We asked the restaurant to add one more seat at her table and confirmed with her that he could attend. Only after the wedding did we realize that she had been hooking with him for a month and their relationship was not even official.


We had so much fun at the wedding that we barely noticed anything. The only weird moment came when he approached my husband started making lots of gross and sexual comments about me, the rest of the guests and the wedding night. My husband was astonished that a person who has never spoken to him would start a conversation like that! 


Several months after the wedding I was chatting at work with my colleagues and one of them confided in me that somebody was dealing cocaine in the bathrooms of my venue. I was mortified. Apparently he was doing lines in the bathroom and tried to sell cocaine and MDMA to some guests. I asked some of my guest and thankfully, he only spoke to 2-3 people, but there was a bit of drama because he did sell cocaine to the husband of a colleague and he relapsed. She did not blame us, thankfully.


People, my husband and I barely drink, and we have never even smoked. I don’t even drink coffee! People always tease us a bit for it. It is such an embarrasment for us that happened. We cannot blame our friend even. She is a sweet girl, but she is not exactly smart. She did not know he was a dealer and soon after our wedding he got her pregnant and disappeared from the face of Earth when she asked for child support. Apparently he insisted on coming to our wedding, probably because he thought it was a good “business” opportunity.


So the moral of the story is beware of last minute guests.


TL;DR: A friend asked us if she could bring a +1 2 weeks before the wedding. She brought a hook-up who turned out to be a drug dealer.",8,1742282154.0,weddingdrama,4,1.0,False
1jdzb6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jdzb6i/aita_for_asking_my_exboyfriend_of_2_weeks_payment/,AITA for asking my ex-boyfriend of 2 weeks payment to dogsit our dogs?,"I (23F) and my ex-boyfriend (24M) recently broke up due to a lot of issues present in our relationship. We've known each other for 6 years and we've broken up twice within those 6 years, this being the third one. (I decided to break up because everything got very toxic, and i completely lost my sense of self and self respect in the relationship). 

Today, my ex called me during the day (we've been broken up for 2 weeks, but we finalized the break up for good 2 days ago since he wrote me a letter where he told me he doesn't want to let me go, but I decided this was the best option for the both of us), and he asked me about my plans for the day.  I was going to go to the gym with my brother, but I didn't have much to do. He then asked me if I could babysit our dogs at his apartment since he had to go out of town (3 hours away) to buy some sneakers with his business partner (he's a sneaker reseller). I told him I'll give him an answer later as I was at a coffee shop with my friend. I texted him when I got home and asked him if he would pay me to stay overnight at his apartment (since he would be paying a dogsitter regardless). Initially he asked me how much I would want. However, he found it weird. I told him that I think it's weird to ask your ex to stay at your place and take care of dogs that I never 1) asked for, 2) never claimed responsibility for as I had so much on my plate. 

Backstory: In September, my ex hyper fixated on adopting a dog because he was feeling very lonely as it was his first time moving out and living alone (I couldn't always go over as I had school, work, and a difficult family life at home). I advised him that he was being irresponsible and was obsessing over something that I thought would be a quick fix to his problems but it would not be permanent as that loneliness was being caused by him constantly working, neglecting his health (mental and physical), not leaving his house (works from home) and isolating himself socially. I told him we'll work on him getting better and he agreed. An hour later, he adopted the dog and laughed at me when I got super angry and told me I'm going to love the dog. He then decided to get another dog 4-5 months later as he felt like the first dog was lonely (since he had to work a lot during the day). For the second dog, he consulted me before making an actual decision because I got so angry the last time as he went behind my back and didn't respect anything I had to say. I told him that I don't think it's a good idea, but if he thinks he can handle it to go for it. I made it clear that I will NOT be taking any responsibility for the dog as I have too much going on in my life. That being said, yes, I accepted the dogs and got so attached to them, but I would go over all the time to help, despite not actually having the time to do it. I had to sacrifice a lot of my time to look after our first dog. Also, our relationship was barely a relationship anymore, we were so tired, would argue all the time, and it felt like we were a married couple of 40 years at that point. 

That being said, I asked for payment because I feel as though he has really abused and taken my kindness for granted throughout the relationship. I put my whole life on pause to tend to him, especially when he got the dogs. I'm in a lot of debt and he knows that, so I also wanted to do something in my self-interest for once. He told me that he would just find a dog sitter and that me asking for money was a tough pill to swallow. I asked him why, and he said that after everything he's done for me, wether it's dinners, a 5k bag he bought me, or any other thing he's done for me, he feels like I'm taking advantage of him. Keep in mind, he is an entrepreneur and works for himself. I still live at home and go to school and do not have the means to have his same lifestyle. 

To me, this ignited so much anger in me because it feels as though I owe him something for all those gifts he's gotten me or dinners he's paid for. EVEN THOUGH I've been giving him my time and have been helping him constantly for the past year with anything you can imagine. I'm sorry, but I'm in debt and I got him a $700 watch and $800 Dior wallet (and more) in the span of 3 months for his birthday/Christmas despite my debt but I'll NEVER hold that against him or use it against him if I needed something from him. 

We then argued about our relationship again and I told him that me staying over is my time and that he thinks that I'll just do anything for free and out of the kindness of my heart because I've been doing so for so long (which I was okay with because we were dating). His argument was that ""They're OUR babies and it's disappointing that you would want to get paid to look after them."" I told him that he doesn't respect my time, and frankly, I don't think he respects my boundaries either (we JUST broke up and I'm so heartbroken, I need to go to his apartment where we've made so many memories in and sleep in the bed we used to cuddle in, and I'm just supposed to be okay with that? On top of that, I'm going to spend a whole night with dogs I absolutely adore and I won't see them ever again??? It's like torture to me). 

We argued pretty badly and I told him to get a second opinion about the way he speaks to me and he told me that I should post about this on Reddit and that he would love to read the comments (I would actually never do this but he provoked me and I want to know if it's really bad that I asked for a bit of money).

1jdzb0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lvad/comments/1jdzb0m/everything_i_had_is_ruined/,Everything I Had is ruined...,"In 2024 I had a heart issues going on.  At the time, I was a manager and ran my department well.  Everything in my life was going great.  I even saved up enough cash to move onto another industry and in August of 2024, 19th day my whole life changed forever.  Started with fluid in my lungs and asking the head manager to go to the hospital, I wasn't breathing right.

After that day they put me on high blood pressure meds and lasix, but I refused to take it.  I was a naturalist and didn't take the condition serious so I went a month with fluid in my lungs.  I took ADHD medication as well at a low dose.  Never had conditions with my heart at all, but it was a stressful job.  Suddenly I got h.pylori, a stomach bacteria that kept my stomach from digesting food.  I notice undigested food in my stool, but never thought of it.  The cardiologist said it's a weak pump on the heart, but come to find out it was both.

They gave me medicine to clear that up, antibiotics, but still had issues with until Feb when I could eat again.  Anyways, while in the hospital they said I'm at a 7 percent EF and needed an LVAD.  It was a long road and journey from there to now.  However, my primary doctor is refusing to put me back on my ADHD meds.  I'm not doing so well without them and it's ruining the life I built starting April of 2022 when I got diagnosed with ADHD.  I feel like my life is ruined.  Being such a motivational kind of guy and helping others, this has broke my spirit.

She kept saying my EF is 10 percent, but this information was in December of 2024, the time where I was still sick with the bacteria.  This was the time I couldn't even cook my own food, go the bathroom or get up vs what I'm doing now.   My goal was with the LVAD I have now and my meds to ATLEAST go back to school & relieve this depression/hyperactivity I'm feeling along with going back & working on my full time job. I felt great going to the doctor to look for great news and now like a brick being thrown to my head It's destroyed me mentally.  The analogy of seeing your friends running around, having fun, playing in the nice weather while you're sitting back watching from your parent's window, crying with tears and two broken legs.  Yes, It's this real....

I literally sat in bed and thought about bad thoughts again.  People just don't know how destructive untreated ADHD can be.  BTW: when I took my high blood pressure meds along with my ADD meds, I was doing well, however I made a stupid decision to stop them because I wanted to be,"" natural,"" and not take the HBP meds at all.  Now I take them ( Entresto, Spiro, Bumex, and Jardiance )

Is there any solution around this?  2025 was my year to break goals and records, now it's filled with depression, loneliness, doubt and shame.  I need support.  I hit the breaking point of my life.  I've been low, but this is the biggest low of my life.  Just so much failure right now is all I can take and handle....😥.  Like all my fears that I thought came upon me all of sudden came to life!

I've a Gaggia Classic E24 coming my way in a couple of days and I've been debating with myself (and my gf, who's the espresso one, in the couple) about which water to use. 

I'm a pourover guy and I'm used to make my own with the Barista Hustle recipes but, from what I can understand, those are not suitable for espresso machines since they lack Calcium. 

I'm in the Netherlands so I cannot access Volvic (my go-to bottled when available), TWW packets are crazy expensive and the other packets I could access are Pure Coffee Water but can't really find any information about it and what's in it. 

Water out of the tap, in every house I've lived in, so far since here, had tds no lower than 350 and up 400+. Every cafe I ask to say they make their own. 

I use a Brita filter, for drinking and cooking, but I don't like the massive difference in tds between the first week and the fourth week of use of each filter, making the brewed coffee taste different across the moth of use whereas I'd like something as consistent as possible (especially with such amazing beans I can access here).

I went on Amazon and started looking them up and the one I really wanted was around £300 (I've forgotten the exact price now, it's been over a year but it was there or there abouts). I thought yikes that's expensive and I can't afford that right now but I told myself, no worries, that's the one I want and that's the one I'll have but I'm gonna get it free or at least at a huge discount. 

I texted my mum and said I was gonna get a masticating juicer. Almost instsntly, she called or text me (again it was over a year ago I've forgotten if it was a text or call) and said don't buy one. She said she was just in a charity shop and there was a brand new one on the shelf for £15 and she sent me a picture. It was the EXACT one I wanted, same brand and same model number. So I got what I wanted within 10 minutes of deciding.

2. A few weeks ago, I was in the car with my mum, she was driving me home from a hospital appointment and we were just chatting as you do. I told her I'd been online looking at those machines that you fill and it boils the water and keeps it boiling so you have hot water on hand for tea and coffee, we joked a little about how we could just use the kettle, first world problems and all that lol, then we both said it would be nice to have one anyway. 

We then changed the subject and I started talking about wanting to make black garlic. We talked about how we wondered if there was a machine specifically for making black garlic or maybe I could just use my instant pot. Then she dropped me home and I never thought of it again. 

Next day, she came round and said her and my aunty had randomly decided to go to the new recycling centre shop, where they sell things considered too good to scrap and there she found a hot water machine, brand new (ok not the exact one I looked at this time but does the same job) and I think for £10 (if memory serves me right, I'm not always great at remembering specific details as you'll have guessed by now lol). Not only that, she also found a black garlic machine, again brand new and even still had the receipt in the box, for £7. Weeeiirrrdd lol.

3. Now, just yesterday, I had my little dog in the garden and he chased after a cat which ran round the side of my polytunnel and jumped through the neighbours fence and ran away. My dog was about to try get through the fence but I shouted him back and then my phone rang so I just took him in to answer my call.

After the phone call I thought, I better let him back out coz he never got to pee, and once we got down the path to the garden I was just winding him up a little and said where's the cat, go and get the cat and I pointed to where the cat had jumped through the fence. At that exact moment I ponted, a cat, a different one entirely, came through the fence into my garden at the exact spot the other one went the opposite way. Had to shout my dog back again 🤣 I thought ok, that was so bloomin weird, I felt like a witch that waved my wand and magiced a cat into existence 🤣

I do have another one that was HUGE, I'm talking £25k huge but I don't want to write that one because I don't want that to be the focus, I have posted it twice on a different account though. 

I'm curious what people think about this? Some will say coincidence, maybe it is. But this is a manifesting group so figured I'd post it anyway and see what people's thoughts on it are, if anyone reads my little novel lol. 

I've had so many other instances like this, it all started around a year ago with that juicer. Maybe it was before that and I just never noticed or shrugged it off but anyway it's just a little freaky to me lol.  ",3,1742281657.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I warn you ,this will likely be quite long.

I was born to a Roman Catholic family, I received my baptism but never first Communion nor confirmation. Live in a very rural island area and my parents and siblings were already aged by the time I was born (youngest sibling is 22 years older). I have a few memories of church on childhood all very pleasant. Unfortunately that's the extent of my remembering,most of my childhood was wrought with turmoil due to my parents substance abuse and eventual divorce.

Fast forward a few years and I am back and forth between couches in my parents ,my mother vindictive and blaming toward my father,my father sorrowful and wishing things hadn't gone as they had. Both to blame but for very different reasons, both still abusing substances and seldom harming by way of physical and emotional.

I leave home at 16 around the time my grandfather passed ,he was the last bastion I had in my family at that time as I knew very little of my aunts,uncles or cousins so as any 16 year old now with the system in my own apartment I turn to alcohol myself. That would consume the next several years until I turned 21.

Now ,I have drank myself to oblivion more oft than not and have hit the point where even my landlord had mentioned I'd been ""looking yellow"" I knew in my heart of hearts it was now or never to quit but I didn't,kept drinking instead. 

This is now where I turned 21 ,met a girl I fell for fairly quickly not head over heels but something told me ""This is different, she's different."" Called it happenstance. But she made a request of me before we'd really ever known eachother, within a week of talking, that she wants me to stop drinking. I laughed it off at first but it stuck with me in the back of my mind each time we'd speak ,each time I'd have a sip ,in those quiet moments I'd hear her asking me to stop. So I began the struggle of quitting before I'd even realized I had  and then when I had realized I was I tried to go back to booze,that's when I had my first ...I guess you'd say intercession? I remember it plain as day I'd drank myself till passing out on my couch which was facing from the living room down the hallway directly to my bathroom and I had what I assumed was a dream it was something beastial and grotesque a painting but it seemed so much more and made me feel total helplessness and fear it felt as though I was being pulled closer to it and then it slid to the left leaving me in profound darkness and silence, then much the same as it had moved to the left Jesus and his sacred heart slid out from the darkness going right a whit robe with blue and red scarfs I remember feeling overwhelmed and nervous then comforted and safe. I then woke up and began the path of sobriety.  Though I didn't fully accept that as a sign. Too skeptical of course.

So I was arrogant and decided I'd ask for three ,either show me these three things in an undeniable fashion or I will chalk that dream up to coincidence and alcoholic delirium.

1.) Two deer

2.) A sign in the sky

3.) A white dog

The sign in the sky came first ,this is where I'll add not only am I a child born in an attempt to save a failing marriage and someone who strayed from the church ,I turned in my infinite drunken wisdom to Norse Paganism, yes I did things within that religion I am ashamed of ,things that haunt my mind,things I now ask for forgiveness from our lord and Savior and yes i realize that this makes me an Apostate.   But this is important as I'd asked for a sign from those false idols as well,it never came. But after asking from this dream ,during a walk home arguing in my head with my beliefs I seen it ,a miraculous white streak that had several pieces stunningly bright that appeared from nowhere and vanished with no trace. Without hesitation I was filled with certain understanding of whom that came from.

Next came the deer, I was out for a walk with my dogs as I often do ,this being several months after the first sign. And I find myself again pondering the who,where and why ,the chances of coincidence or something greater and almost as if to erase the doubt there they were ,two deer a buck and doe grazing the clovers ,the doe took no notice of us but the buck did. And again I knew.


Lastly was the dog,now this one was interesting, I'd seen a few ,none stood out or felt in anyway different than just a dog. So of course, despite the other two signs I took this as proof that it's all coincidence and nothing mattered I laughed and jeered at Jesus in my head. Three months later the woman from earlier on a cool fall morning said ""I love you"" for the first time and my heart fluttered and I felt like a kid in a candy shop again unable to respond I just kissed her,some time passes and I take my coffee out onto the step to watch as the sun burns off the mildew and there it was, at the edge of the yard ,a white dog sat looking directly at the door ,long fur and all...


Even a recovered drunk ,last attempt and apostate couldn't deny the timing nor significance, coincidence cannot shake the truth and to have all three appear far from eachother but In ways that even when far from mind they appear and you know what it means...

So here I am today, years after that,married to the love of my life ,with a white dog of my own that found it's way to me and having lost my soul companion dog very recently I have decided that it's time ,it's time to come home and begin my new journey with God.

I've contacted my local parish of St.Joseph and will be attending with my wife who wants to join me in refinding God and his mercy.

St. Francis of Assisi, St. Augustine of Loyola and St. Ignatius are the saints whomst I've read and whomst have helped me understand that even after dabbling in heresy you can comeback to God .. but I Intend to confirm with St.Roch,Patron of Dogs. It seems fitting given my request and my dear pets recent passing having been what's brought me home.

If you've read this ,thank you ,and if anything please take heart and know that your signs will come if you worry and that God loves each of us regardless. If I'm worthy of signs  you're worthy of far,far greater. You're here for a reason,you're filled with purpose and you are needed.

Hey everyone!

I'm a 23-year-old gay guy from Northamptonshire looking to expand my social circle and make some new friends. I’m into quite a mix of hobbies, so hopefully we’ll have something in common!

I absolutely love cheerleading — it's a big passion of mine and keeps me active. I'm also really into working out, so if you're a gym buddy or just someone who enjoys staying active, I'd love to connect.

When I'm not moving around, I enjoy reading, especially anything thought-provoking or with a great storyline. I’m also a big fan of cooking — trying out new recipes and experimenting in the kitchen is always fun.

I’m a huge lover of music (my playlists are all over the place) and I can never say no to a trip to the theatre — musicals, plays, you name it!

If any of this sounds like your vibe, or if you just fancy a chat, feel free to drop me a message. I'd love to connect with some like-minded people, whether that’s for grabbing coffee, hitting the gym, or just talking about books, food, and life.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Like a lot of posts are people supporting each other through caffeine withdrawal symptoms and posting their progress through withdrawal. Literally when you google caffeine withdrawal, it says ""it is a temporary and typically mild condition"". But the people on the sub act like they are going through hell. They also use a lot of terminology like ""being in recovery"" and ""relapsing"" and being ""sober"" that I've never heard being associated with coffee drinking.

But the biggest thing that gets me are posts like this [https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/mkgtqp/in\_case\_you\_want\_to\_relapse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/mkgtqp/in_case_you_want_to_relapse/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/vbr9xd/stay\_strong\_you\_got\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/vbr9xd/stay_strong_you_got_this/) Honestly, no disrespect meant if I am wrong about this, but I have just never heard of caffeine destroying people's lives in the same way that hard drugs do. And it seems like the people on that sub act like coffee has taken their families, their jobs, their livelihoods and now that they are ""sober"", they are rebuilding their lives in the same way that other former addicts would.

So, is it just a community of especially dramatic people? Or does coffee actually have these effects on people's live and is withdrawal really that difficult?

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

One such staple is the crossbody bag — a perfect blend of style, functionality, and effortless elegance. Whether you’re running errands, heading to brunch, or dressing up for a night out, a crossbody bag is that one accessory that never fails to elevate your look.

But what makes this trend so irresistible? And why should every woman have at least one in her collection? Let’s break it down.

# 1. The Perfect Balance of Style and Convenience

There’s a reason why the [**crossbody bag trend** ](https://lafiza.in/)refuses to fade. It’s not just about aesthetics — it’s about practicality meets fashion.

* **Hands-Free Comfort:** Unlike tote bags or handbags that require constant adjusting, a crossbody bag sits perfectly across your body, keeping your hands free for coffee runs, shopping sprees, or simply scrolling through your phone.
* **Even Weight Distribution:** Carrying a traditional handbag on one side can lead to discomfort over time. A crossbody bag evenly distributes the weight, making it the ideal everyday companion.
* **Effortlessly Chic:** Whether it’s a structured leather piece for work or a beaded crossbody for a festive evening, this bag instantly pulls your look together.

When an accessory checks all the boxes — fashionable, functional, and versatile — it’s a no-brainer why every wardrobe needs one.

# 2. A Must-Have for Every Occasion

One of the best things about crossbody bags is their ability to adapt to different occasions. No matter where you’re headed, there’s a style that fits.

* **For Everyday Errands:** A **compact leather crossbody** or a trendy canvas sling is perfect for those who love to keep things minimal yet stylish. It fits essentials like your phone, wallet, and keys without feeling bulky.
* **For Work & Office Chic:** A structured crossbody bag with sleek detailing adds an instant upgrade to office wear. Neutral shades like black, tan, or muted pastels complement most outfits effortlessly.
* **For Travel:** A crossbody bag is the ultimate travel essential. Look for anti-theft designs with secure zippers and RFID protection to keep your belongings safe while exploring new places.
* **For Evening Glam:** Swap the oversized totes for a mini crossbody with embellishments or metallic accents to complete your dinner date or party look. It’s compact, stylish, and hassle-free.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, but the beauty of this bag is that it can be styled to suit just about any occasion.

# 3. Versatility That Complements Every Outfit

A good accessory has the power to transform an entire outfit, and a crossbody bag does just that. Whether your style is edgy, classic, or boho-chic, there’s a design to match.

* **For a Casual Look:** A simple canvas or vegan leather crossbody pairs beautifully with denim and a basic tee, giving off an effortlessly cool vibe.
* **For an Elegant Touch:**Opt for a structured crossbody with gold chain detailing to pair with a tailored blazer or a sleek dress.
* **For a Bohemian Aesthetic:** A handcrafted, embroidered, or beaded crossbody bag works like magic with flowy dresses and earthy tones.
* **For a Sporty Edge:** A nylon or belt-style crossbody is great for athleisure outfits and adds a trendy streetwear feel.

Choosing the right crossbody bag isn’t just about the color or material — it’s about finding a style that speaks to your personality and elevates your wardrobe.

# 4. Functionality That Goes Beyond Fashion

Let’s be honest — style is important, but functionality is what makes an accessory worth investing in. The crossbody bag shines in this department as well.

* **Multiple Compartments:** Unlike regular handbags, many crossbody bags come with separate compartments for easy organization. No more fishing for your keys or tangled earphones.
* **Adjustable Straps:** Whether you prefer a high-slung bag close to your chest or a relaxed long-hanging style, adjustable straps make it easy to customize your look.
* **Compact Yet Spacious:** It may look small, but a well-designed crossbody can hold more than you think — wallet, phone, lip balm, sunglasses, and even a mini perfume bottle.

A great bag is one that not only looks good but works for you. And that’s exactly what makes the **crossbody bag trend** so enduring.

# 5. The Investment Piece That Never Goes Out of Style

If you’re building a capsule wardrobe, a timeless crossbody bag is a must. Unlike fast-fashion accessories that lose their charm after a season, this bag has proven to be a long-term investment.

* **Classic Designs Stay Relevant:** Minimalist designs in leather, suede, or high-quality faux materials never go out of style.
* **Transitional Fashion:** A crossbody bag can be styled across different seasons, from summer sundresses to winter coats, making it a year-round favorite.
* **Durability Matters:** Investing in a high-quality crossbody means you won’t have to replace it every few months. A well-crafted one can last for years while maintaining its elegance.

When choosing a crossbody bag, consider it an investment rather than just a purchase. The right one will not only enhance your outfits but also stand the test of time.

# Final Thoughts: A Wardrobe Essential You Can’t Ignore

Trends come and go, but certain pieces prove their worth over and over again. The crossbody bag is one such staple — effortlessly stylish, incredibly functional, and endlessly versatile. Whether you’re a minimalist who loves sleek designs or someone who enjoys statement accessories, there’s a crossbody bag that fits your aesthetic.

So if you haven’t already added one to your collection, now is the perfect time. The only question is — which style will you go for first?",1,1742280770.0,u_Loose_Ebb4405,0,1.0,False

Now, 90% of staff were already going in a day or two a week.  But some of us who are considered hard to hire and hard to retain and do 100% of our work via computer were allowed to continue to remote.

I wasn't that butthurt about RTO.  I like who I work with.  My dog did rip up a cushion and shit on the floor but I guess things like that will smooth out over time.  I'm an old so I don't have small kids to worry about.

However, a colleague of mine and I decided to walk out and get coffee nearby.  We get all the way to the lobby and colleague forgot their badge.  So, I stayed down while they went and got it.  We got coffee.  I was going to go stop by my car to grab a USB cord.  Only, I left my car fob in my cube.

Later, I went to the lobby to talk to some support staff and then went back to the elevator to go to my floor.  I got in the elevator.  I stood there.    A lady got in.  She did a visual assessment and said, ""Well, you have to select at least ONE button.""

Ever felt like your bladder is running its own **nightly fire drill**? Waking up multiple times a night, never quite feeling relieved, and dragging yourself through the day exhausted?

**Prostate issues** can hit hard, and it's not just about the inconvenience—it's about sleep, energy, and frankly, keeping your dignity intact.

Many **prostate health dietary supplements** promise a fix, but most seem to **rely on one or two ingredients** with *questionable* results.

One of the **top 5 prostate supplements**, [ProtoFlow](https://theworldhealth.org/protoflow-official), is a **herbal supplement for prostate health** that boasts a **multi-ingredient formula** designed to do more than just **reduce frequent urination**.

But is it any good? That's what we wanted to know.

Let’s **cut through the marketing fluff** and see if this supplement is worth your time.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **ProtoFlow**
* **Category:** **Health & Wellness ➜ Prostate Health Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.7/5**

# ProtoFlow Ingredients & How It Works

Instead of **relying on a single ingredient**, **ProtoFlow** combines **multiple herbal extracts**, aiming to **support bladder health, prostate function, and testosterone balance**.

# Breaking Down the Formula

🔹 **Saw Palmetto** – A staple in **prostate support supplements**, the benefits of this extract are well-researched for its **potential to reduce inflammation and support urinary function**. It's a key player.

🔹 **Chinese Ginseng and Muira Puama for prostate support** – These ingredients may **help improve circulation**, which **some research suggests** could be beneficial for **hormonal balance** and **urinary function**.

🔹 **Cayenne Pepper** – An unexpected but **welcome addition**, known for supporting **blood flow** and aiding in **nutrient delivery throughout the body**.

🔹 **Damiana & Epimedium Sagittatum** – **Common in over-the-counter prostate supplements**, these herbs are believed to **help regulate testosterone levels and energy production**.

🔹 **Catuaba & Hawthorn Berries** – Powerful **antioxidants that support heart health**, which is crucial for **long-term wellness and circulation**.

Is this the **best natural prostate supplement with multiple herbs?** It claims to offer [broader benefits](https://theworldhealth.org/protoflow-official) than those that **rely solely on Saw Palmetto**. But how does it perform in real life? Let’s check out what **users are saying**.

# User Reviews & Customer Feedback

The internet is **flooded with opinions**, so we scoured through **ProtoFlow customer testimonials** to see **what’s working and what’s not**.

# What Users Like:

✅ **Fewer nighttime bathroom trips** – Many report **sleeping through the night**, a **huge win for energy levels**.

✅ **Stronger urinary flow** – Several men say they no longer feel like they’re **stuck in a traffic jam at the urinal**.

✅ **Better overall comfort** – A number of **ProtoFlow user feedback** reports **less urgency** and **more confidence**.

✅ **No major side effects** – Unlike some **effective prostate supplements**, **ProtoFlow** doesn’t seem to cause **stomach issues**.

# What Users Don’t Like:

⚠️ **Takes time to work** – **ProtoFlow supplement effectiveness** isn’t **instant**. Some saw results in **two weeks**, others needed **four to six**.

⚠️ **Capsules are big** – If you **hate swallowing pills**, this could be **a mild annoyance**.

⚠️ **Not cheap** – While **cheaper than some top-rated prostate supplements**, the **cost adds up over time**.

# My Uncle Ray’s Experience with ProtoFlow

My **Uncle Ray**, a **62-year-old retired firefighter**, has always been an active guy.

Even after leaving the force, he never really slowed down—between helping out at the local community center and keeping up with his grandkids, he’s always on the move.

But over the past year, he started struggling with something he didn’t expect: **frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom**.

At first, he brushed it off as just part of getting older.

But when it started **interrupting his sleep and leaving him drained during the day**, it became more than an inconvenience—it started **affecting his energy, mood, and overall quality of life**.

After a little convincing (and some good old-fashioned stubbornness on his part), he decided to [give ProtoFlow a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/protoflow-official).

After **a couple of weeks**, he started noticing **small but meaningful improvements**. The biggest change? **He wasn’t waking up as often at night**, which meant **better sleep and more energy in the morning**.

His usual morning coffee routine no longer required **an extra half-hour of grogginess** just to feel awake.

One thing he wasn’t a huge fan of? **The size of the capsules.** He joked that they looked like they were made for a horse, but after a few days, he got used to taking them with a big gulp of water.

Did ProtoFlow solve everything overnight? No. But after **a month of consistent use**, he felt **noticeably better**, more in control, and less frustrated by those endless bathroom runs.

For him, that was **more than enough reason to keep it in his daily routine**.

# ProtoFlow vs. Other Prostate Supplements

With **so many prostate supplement comparisons**, does **ProtoFlow** make the cut for one of the **best prostate health supplements**?

🔹 **Saw Palmetto alone vs. herbal prostate blends** – Unlike **basic Saw Palmetto pills**, **ProtoFlow** includes **several additional herbal extracts** for **bladder and hormone support**.

🔹 **Do prostate supplements with multiple ingredients work better?** – The idea behind **multi-ingredient formulas** is that they tackle **multiple symptoms**, rather than **just reducing prostate size**.

🔹 **Best supplements for enlarged prostate?** – While **not a prescription treatment**, **ProtoFlow** may offer **some relief** for those with **mild to moderate issues**.

# Pricing Options

* **1 Bottle (30-day supply):** $79
* **3 Bottles (90-day supply):** $159 ($53 per bottle)
* **6 Bottles (180-day supply):** $294 ($49 per bottle)

Each order includes **free digital bonuses** and a **60-day money-back guarantee**.

# Where to Buy ProtoFlow

To **avoid fake versions**, [buy directly from the official site](https://theworldhealth.org/protoflow-official). **Third-party listings** (Amazon, eBay) may **lack quality control**, and **any guarantees** apply only to **official purchases**.

1jdyw4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1jdyw4h/my_friend_undermines_and_criticized_my_parenting/,My friend undermines and criticized my parenting...,"My friend (childless) keeps over stepping boundaries and recently criticized my parenting in front of other guests. 
My friend and I have been friends for a long time and we have never been at odds with each other until recently. She is also dating our roomate (my husbands ver close friend) so I see her often. She was my maid of honor at my wedding and was at the hospital for the birth of my children. She really is my best friend. 
 
Backstory: 
During the day, I am mostly cleaning and caring for my children, as I am a stay at home mom living with 7 people and 2 dogs. In the house is my husband and I, our 3 children (ages 1, 2, and 8), my 14 year old sister, and our roomate.

 My kids daily routine is pretty consitant. We wake up at 6am eat breakfast get ready for school and the day. Then by 10am my littles are ready for a nap. They wake up around noon, we eat lunch and hang out then I have to get my other kids from school around 3 and we eat dinner at 5-6 then all the kids go to bed at 8pm. 

My  2 year ols son is very smart and ambitious, and If he wants something he absolutely will find a way to get it. He has mastered baby gates. All of them, every kind that I have tried.. The latches for kitchen cabinets he will use tools to get them open. He pulls out dining chairs and pushes them up to the counter to then use the coffee pot to climb on the fridge to get hidden snacks. he has figured out how to use barettes, coins, or any small tool to unlock doors. So of course, I went got some of those door handle covers and this has been a life saver.

Previously my 2 year old son was not interested in potty training and would throw a fit about sitting on the toilet. So I didn't press it. I would still offer but he always said no. one day I decided to take a nap while my babies were napping and my son woke up before me (also before he usually wakes up)  and pulled off his diaper and started smearing his poop all over his room. So I started trying to get him on the potty more. He still refused. He did this a couple more times during nap time but then started asking to go potty on the toilet. So now even if he doesn't actually go potty, when he asks I immediately put him on the toilet. 

The incident 
So the other night my husband and i had some friends over for dinner. Of them being my bestie. She  knew that my sons door stays locked with the door knob covers so he can't escape his room. She came up to me and said hey I saw this idea that you can put a babygate in front of his door and leave the door open. I explained to her that my son can unlock baby gates and will just climb over them. She then proceeded to to tell me that I keep him locked in his room too long. I explained that I don't and she said "" well, he is locked in his room right now."" (I had sent him to his room for not eating dinner and told him he can come out when he's ready to eat and did not close the door.) I told her the door is open so I was unsure what she's talking about. Then she said well that's why he plays with his poop because you leave him in there too long and he's bored. Then she went on this long rant about how to properly potty train him, and then ends with ""what you are doing is borderline child abuse"". 

This conversation was happening in front of everyone and  there have been other incidents of her undermining my parenting and overstepping but usually I just let it go. But this time she went too far and I  was so angry I had to walk out of my house get away.  

My friend does not have children of her own but continues to share her parenting advice. Ive never had this feeling of irritation from her before because we have never been at odds... I found out from my roomate, (her boyfriend) that she often makes comments about my parenting and how she would do it differently. 

I'm unsure if I should just smile say thank you and disregard her unqualified advice and keep on parenting my way for the sake of my relationship with her and the dynamic of our roomate situation. 

Has anyone else ever dealt with this from a friend?
What would you do? 
Should I confront her and ask what her problem is and that what she said really hurt my feelings?",1,1742280046.0,Mommit,9,0.6,False

Earthquakes the only time the Earth decides to do the cha-cha without asking us first. These unpredictable dance moves are measured using the Richter scale, which compares seismic waves to a standard reference. The magnitude function is given by:

M(x) = log10 {x / 0.001}
where x represents the seismograph reading in millimeters recorded 100 kilometers from the epicenter. Let’s crunch some numbers.

(a) Calculation of Seismograph Readings for Given Magnitudes
1. For M(x) = 7.7:
7.7 = log10 {x / 0.001}

Solving for x:
x = 0.001 x 107.7 = 50.1 meters

That’s roughly the height of a 16-story building wobbling like a Jenga tower.

2. For M(x) = 5.7:
5.7 = log10 {x / 0.001}
x = 0.001 x 105.7 = 0.501 meters

Just half a meter—barely enough to make your coffee spill.

Comparison and Conclusion:
A 7.7 magnitude earthquake produces waves 100 times larger than a 5.7 magnitude one. Translation? One is a bad day; the other is a REALLY bad day.

(b) Why Logarithms? Because Math Said So
Why do scientists use logarithms? Because earthquakes don’t mess around with simple math.
- Huge Number Compression: If we didn’t use logs, earthquake magnitudes would have so many zeros, they’d look like someone fell asleep on the keyboard.
- Better Comparison: A one-unit increase means 10 times the wave amplitude and 32 times more energy released like upgrading from a mild argument to a full-blown shouting match.
- It Just Works: Logarithmic scales fit exponential growth perfectly. If we used polynomials or exponential functions, earthquake scales would be so out of whack, even scientists would get dizzy.
(c) Recent Earthquake Event: The Earth’s Latest Mood Swing

A recent earthquake occurred in Haiti on August 14, 2021, registering a magnitude of 7.2 (United States Geological Survey [USGS], 2021). Let’s apply our math magic:

M(x) = 7.2
x = 0.001 x 107.2 = 15.8 meters
That’s nearly the height of a five-story building rocking back and forth talk about a rough morning.

Added 1.5oz of one of my favorite Irish whiskies: Redbreast PX (Pedro Ximenez sherry cask finish). Tbh i was a little hesitant using it, feeling a little guilty that i might diminish one of my favorite drams.

Nope. Holy shit. This was great — no, it was perfect. The slightly thin brew was spot-fucking-on and opened up the whiskey more than I expected (heat probably helped too) and bringing out more notes than I usually pick up. The washed coffee complemented with the apple remaining intact and the brown sugar jumping out in the final drink and leaving a beautiful finish of both the coffee and whiskey notes intertwined. I offered my wife a sip and she kept the glass. Final whiskey/coffee ratio was something around 1:2.5 or 1:2.75.

After that I never paid them much mind until one day i was exhausted and falling asleep in class, after class i went straight to the train and got on a random seat and was staring out the window. when i looked out another train was passing and they were right next to me on the train riding next to mine - they avoided my eyes but its common courtesy not to stare at someone on the train so i looked away after a while and they’re train passed mine. 

after a while i decided it was a very film esque moment but i just decided to drop it. i start changing where i take the train for ease of transportation and safety. i realize that they take the train there too. i speak to them once there and compliment their outfit, they’re receptive and nice but the convi doesn’t go far. after a while i start to take notice of them and i think they take notice of me. we were in a large class and i wanted to make a new friend (esp one that i see so often) but im a shy nervous person so it takes a while for me to talk to people especially first. after a while i realize they didn’t pay me much mind so i try not to bother them either but they’re my type, dress nice and seem kind so ofc i develop a bit of a crush (also just needed some eye candy for class). 

after a while i notice that they’re very anal retentive. they do the same thing the same time at the same pace all of the time. get up slowly, pack their bag slowly and leave out the same door. i noticed though that when we started kind of circling around each other sometimes they would change their routine a bit to match mine- leaving out the door i did, matching my pace or a pace behind me, just putting themselves in my space in a way. but at this point i had talked to them first twice and they hadn’t so much as waved hello — im extremely shy as well but at that point it was a pride thing. once they entered the station with another person (one of the times they broke routine) and instead of standing where they usually stand on the train they stood right behind me which admittedly freaked me out and they stayed there until they’re friend called them away by asking what they were doing. 

after a semester of this back and forth. staring at one another when the others not looking, taking the train together, just being in each others space constantly - i didn’t know their name, their age, or anything about them. 
so the next semester i leave for study abroad and decide to put them in the back of my mind, though they did pop up once or twice. when i came back i was enjoying my summer but two weeks before school i could not get them out of my head. it was driving me to the point of distraction and at that point i decided - i needed to know their name.

now… HERES WHERE IT GETS WEIRD:
i thought that the knowing was better than not knowing so i just decided to go through the class roaster and do a linkedin/ ig search. i go through 3-5 times and can’t decide a name i feel matches them and can’t find a trace of them on the internet. i decided i can’t do it anymore and pick a random name from the list. the name didn’t match them but i just needed something - i didn’t expect to see this person again. school starts and i decide for a shortcut instead of using one train to get to school id transfer trains and i, as a coffee addict, leave home a little early so i can get coffee and a nice seat in my lecture hall. so i was in a place i didn’t need to be, at a time i didn’t need to be there and one day as im waiting for the train.
the train arrives and i get on and who do i see other than this person a bit across from me on the train? i freak out and my stomach starts hurting hurting so i text my friend - she tells me to talk to them talk to them and acknowledge how crazy it is that they’re there because for a solid 2-3 weeks before they were all i could think about( & im not the obsessive type, study abroad and all i had going on when i came back i had more than enough on my mind without this kid being on it too!) 

my stomach was killing so i didn’t have the guts to go to them and said if i see them again i will speak to them. i freak out about it and continue with my week. next  week on the train again - the train arrives and my stomach starts hurting, i brush it off and get on. when i get off who do i see on the platform? them. then i decide now or never and i talk to them. we walk and talk so i ask their name and guess what their name is? the random name i picked out of a list of 100-150 kids in the class. as we talk i don’t feel nervous we vibe and split ways. 

we don’t see each other for around 2 weeks from this but i know when they pass me because every time they do my stomach starts hurting - a symptom that i’ve only gotten with them - if im a station away i can tell when they’re near and when they leave because id get a random stomach pain. so imagine my surprise that the next time i see them, they glance at me and walk right past. i don’t mess with any of that so the next time i see THEM i glance and walk past (even though i think they tried talking to me). since then i haven’t seen them but they’re on my mind. i’m a firm believer in if you’re thinking of someone they’re thinking of you too so they must be thinking of me. 

its so insane because it’s been half a semester and i have yet to see them but they’re always on my mind. i even wrote a letter to try to say goodbye to them and remove their energy but when i wrote about letting go so i can find another (im ready for a relationship) i felt this very odd wave of something in my body akin to jealousy or discomfort.

What are everyone’s thoughts? 

if you got this far thanks for reading!

i will add that even though i do think about them from time to time i no longer have any romantic or lingering feelings for this person and have not seeked them out apart from the few times i tried talking to them. i have also had romantic connections since meeting them and have already experienced deep and not so deep limerence in the past (which was terrible to say the least) so i do not think it applies to this. i’m someone who believes everything happens for a reason so im mostly coming at this from a curious pov and open mind :)",1,1742279809.0,spirituality,2,1.0,False

1jdytfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabeticfirstcure/comments/1jdytfn/lowering_insulin_levels_10_simple_strategies_for/,Lowering Insulin Levels: 10 Simple Strategies for a Healthier You,"

Living with elevated insulin levels, or hyperinsulinemia, can pose serious health risks, including excessive weight gain, heart disease, and even cancer. Thankfully, you don't have to accept this fate. By making a few mindful lifestyle changes, you can significantly lower your insulin levels and reduce your risk of developing chronic health conditions. Here are ten actionable strategies that can help normalize your insulin levels in just two weeks, offering a more sustainable path to better health.

# 1. Lower Your Carb Intake

One of the most effective ways to start managing your insulin levels is by reducing your carbohydrate consumption. It doesn’t mean you need to eliminate carbs completely, but simply be mindful of the types and amounts of carbs you consume. Focus on healthier, low-carb alternatives like vegetables, whole grains, and legumes while avoiding sugary snacks, processed foods, and white bread. Low-carb diets can help decrease insulin resistance, stabilize blood sugar levels, and ultimately reduce the burden on your pancreas.

**Tip**: Incorporating a low-carb meal plan into your routine can be easy and enjoyable. There are numerous delicious recipes available that allow you to still savor hearty meals without spiking your insulin.

# 2. Apple Cider Vinegar: A Simple Solution

Apple cider vinegar is a natural remedy that has been shown to lower insulin levels. Just a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in your morning routine—whether added to a glass of water or mixed into a protein shake—can significantly reduce insulin resistance. The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar may improve the body’s ability to clear excess sugar from the bloodstream, making it a great addition to your daily regimen.

**Tip**: If you find the taste of apple cider vinegar too harsh, consider trying apple cider vinegar gummies, which are a more palatable alternative.

# 3. Mind Your Portion Sizes

Portion control is crucial in managing insulin levels. By reducing portion sizes, you can minimize blood sugar spikes after meals. The key here is not just reducing calories but avoiding overloading your digestive system, which can overwhelm the pancreas and cause insulin levels to spike. It takes about 20-30 minutes for your brain to recognize that you're full, so eating slowly and stopping before you feel stuffed can help prevent overeating.

**Tip**: If you love large meals, consider preparing smaller plates beforehand. And if you still feel hungry, wait an hour before going for seconds—often, the urge will pass.

# 4. Reduce Sugar Intake

Consuming too much sugar is a primary contributor to high insulin levels. When you consume sugary foods and drinks, your blood sugar rises quickly, prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. By cutting back on sugar, you will not only reduce insulin production but also lower your risk of fat accumulation, cardiovascular issues, and other chronic diseases.

**Tip**: Replace sugary snacks and sodas with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, or nuts. Gradually reducing sugar intake will help stabilize your blood sugar levels, leaving you with more consistent energy throughout the day.

# 5. Exercise Regularly

Physical activity is crucial for managing insulin levels. Exercise helps increase insulin sensitivity, meaning your body becomes more efficient at using insulin to process glucose. Whether it’s walking, cycling, or strength training, regular physical activity improves blood circulation, promotes weight loss, and supports overall well-being.

**Tip**: If you’re not a fan of the gym, try finding activities you enjoy, such as dancing, hiking, or even playing sports with friends or family. You don’t need an expensive gym membership to stay active—just move your body regularly to see benefits.

# 6. Try Ceylon Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a powerful spice known for its ability to lower blood sugar and insulin levels. Specifically, Ceylon cinnamon (also known as true cinnamon) is especially beneficial in this regard. Studies have shown that adding cinnamon to your diet can help improve insulin sensitivity, making it easier for your body to manage blood sugar.

**Tip**: Sprinkle Ceylon cinnamon onto oatmeal, smoothies, or coffee to enjoy its blood sugar-lowering effects.

# 7. Choose Complex Carbs Over Simple Carbs

Not all carbohydrates are created equal. Simple carbs, like those found in processed foods and sugary snacks, can lead to rapid blood sugar spikes. On the other hand, complex carbs (such as those found in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables) are digested more slowly, leading to more stable blood sugar levels. Opting for complex carbs over simple ones can help keep your insulin levels in check.

**Tip**: Whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and oats are great sources of complex carbs. Incorporate these into your meals for long-lasting energy without insulin spikes.

# 8. Consider Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting (IF) involves alternating between periods of eating and fasting, typically in cycles of 12-24 hours. This eating pattern has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss. It allows your body to rest from digesting food and can help regulate blood sugar levels more effectively.

**Tip**: If you’re new to intermittent fasting, start with shorter fasting periods (e.g., 12 hours) and gradually work your way up. Consult with a healthcare provider before starting, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

# 9. Increase Soluble Fiber Intake

Soluble fiber slows down digestion, helping you feel fuller for longer and preventing sudden blood sugar spikes. Foods high in soluble fiber, such as oats, beans, lentils, and certain fruits (like apples and citrus), can help stabilize your blood sugar levels and lower your insulin levels over time.

**Tip**: Add fiber-rich foods to every meal. Try starting your day with a bowl of oatmeal, or snack on raw vegetables with hummus to boost fiber intake.

# 10. Incorporate Green Tea and White Mulberry

Research has shown that green tea and white mulberry extract can help reduce insulin concentrations in the body. Green tea is rich in antioxidants, which support overall health, while white mulberry can improve glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. By adding these to your diet, you can promote better blood sugar control and enhance insulin sensitivity.

**Tip**: Enjoy a cup of green tea or add white mulberry extract to smoothies or capsules to support your insulin-lowering efforts.

# 11. Eat Fatty Fish for Omega-3s

Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower insulin levels. Omega-3s are known to reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and support heart health. Adding more fatty fish to your diet is a simple yet effective way to lower your insulin levels and improve your overall health.

**Tip**: Aim to eat fatty fish at least two times a week. If you're not a fan of fish, omega-3 supplements are available as a convenient alternative.

# Conclusion

If you’ve been struggling with high insulin levels, don’t despair. With simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, you can take control of your health and significantly reduce your risk of chronic diseases like obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. By lowering your carb intake, reducing sugar, exercising regularly, incorporating beneficial spices and natural remedies like apple cider vinegar and green tea, and making smarter food choices, you can normalize your insulin levels and lead a healthier, more vibrant life.

**Remember**, consistency is key, and small changes over time can have a profound impact on your health. Start today, and in just a few weeks, you’ll notice the difference!

1jdyru4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1jdyru4/first_virgin_voyages_cruise_a_review_of_resilient/,First Virgin Voyages cruise - A review of Resilient Lady,"My wife (28) and I (27) had our honey moon on Resilient Lady last week (3-8/3-15) and we had such a good time! This was my wife's 4th cruise, and my 2nd cruise, but our first with Virgin. I'll do my best to review everything during our week!

1. Check-in/boarding: Painless! 

Our check in time wasn't until 5:30 PM, but we got in line around 9 AM to drop our bags off so we could explore San Juan. Very easy process. We explored San Juan for 4 hours, but my wife felt like she was going to get a migraine from walking around in the heat, so we decided to see if they would let us on the boat early. We get back to the port at 1:30, showed our boarding pass...and we got on 4 hours early. They didn't even check the time on our passes.  Very glad we could get on a little earlier so my wife could rerst before it got worse. 


Staff at the port explained our wristbands functions and gave us some recommendations on what food places to check out right away on the boat :) arrived at our room and all our luggage was there waiting for us.

2. Service: Wonderful! From restaurant staff, the hosts for the many different games at the Social Club, or just other crew members passing by, they all made it a point to say hello and ask if we had a question about anything. 

3. The ship overall and it's many spaces: Great as well. We overheard security mention that our sailing was almost full. The only times we ever felt like it was crowded was a few hours before Scarlet Night as everyone was trying to get dinner before the party, along with trying to get in to The Red Room and The Manor. Felt like there was not enough seating for the 2 shows we went to. Every showing for Peresphone had a line from the doors at The Red Room to all the way from the other side of the casino. 

Plenty of places both inside and outside to sit and relax. Highly recommend The Dock House on deck 7 if you want a quieter and more comfortable place to chill outside, along with some delicious food. 

The pools were fine. We had to get there early if we wanted to actually have room to get in. They seemed clean. The app says they are open 24 hours, but 2 nights my wife and I tried to use the pool at 11PM and they already had the nets over both of them. The whirlpools/hot tubs were available at least.

The Social Club was easily where we spent a lot of time next to The Dock House. So many puzzles, board games, and classic arcade games, along with the many fun activities there such as trivia night or karaoke. Best part, the arcade is free. Snacks they have there are good as well.

Food: With a good selection of different kinds of food, it's hard to stay hungry on here. Many days, we just stuck with The Galley for lunch and dinner, so reviews for places we tried there will be first.

Burger Bar: We were pretty impressed. Quality was good. I stuck with the classic, while my wife tried their different specials throughout the week. She really raved about the veggie patty burger they had.

Noodle Around: Was disappointed with this one. Tried both the miso and tonkatsu and the noodles were overcooked in both. Tonkatsu broth tasted ""flat"", not really sure how to describe it well, but it just wasn't good. 

Let's Taco Bout It: It was okay. I wish the tacos were a little bigger, they were all served on the very small shells. Good for a snack, but these didn't fill me up at all when I ordered them.

Bento Box: We found ourselves getting lunch here the most. Everything is made fresh throughout the day and packaged for you to grab yourself. Perfect for if you wanna just get a quick bite to take back to your room or somewhere outside. The cucumber roll and salmon roll was delicious. 

Non Galley:

The Grounds Club: The first full day, not good. We ordered a latte and in both drinks, our espresso shots tasted burnt. Rest of the cruise it was good. Coffee from The Grounds Club is not free, but the pastries are no cost. Lattes are $5, but free pour coffee is available at The Galley. We both enjoyed the Walnut Banana Chocolate Bread they had, we couldn't find that in the bakery at The Galley. 

The Dock House: What an awesome place! The 2 bartenders there were wonderful and down to chat while we enjoyed our drinks and food. Highly recommend the steak tacos and the shrimp. 

Pizza Place: We went here almost every night lol. Great tasting personal pan pizzas. Only complaint I have is they only had water or alcohol there, no soda. Highly recommend the chicken pesto and the white pizza.

Reservation restaurants: 

Razzle Dazzle: we went here for brunch and it was so good! It was pretty busy, but we got our food quickly. We both got the waffles with candied bacon. 

Extra Virgin: It was...fine. Our food was good, but we both felt it didn't live up to the hype or the difficulty in trying to RSVP. Would try again still.

Gunbae: ...interesting. If you have a party less than 6, you are seated with strangers. Thankfully, the 2 couples we sat with were lovely to chat with. It is a very loud restaurant. In between ordering and waiting for your food, we all did a drinking game. Food portions were huge. We got full pretty quick, but the other couples we sat with were more than happy to have some of the pork belly that we didn't finish. Food was good, but I don't see us coming back here on our next cruise.

Entertainment: We only got a chance to catch Lola's Library and The Miss Behave show, both were wonderful! Crowd interaction at both was so good.

Our room: We had 14290A, it was in the perfect location just right outside the fore elevators. 

Balcony was a good size for just 2 people, and the hammock was so nice. 

The tech was very cool. Having a smart home myself, using the tablet to control the lights, TV, curtain, etc. felt familiar. Only minor issue we had was it would be nice if we could cast to the TV. Their on demand section had a lot, but there are only 6 live TV channels to pick from, the only 2 based out of the US were news stations. It would have been nice to be able to watch our Hulu shows on the TV as opposed to our phones. 

Other info to share:

Unless you are streaming video (Netflix, Hulu, Wyze Cameras) or video calling, don't buy the premium wifi. It is not any faster than their free wifi. I made a post during our cruise fhat shows a speedtest with the premium. The free wifi under my wifes login was the same. Wifi calling and texting works no issues. Made 1 quick phone call and the latency wasn't bad.

The app worked most of the time. Sometimes it lost connection to the boat wifi if we were walking around while using the app, but I'm blaming that more on our phones. We both agree it was much better than Carnivals app. 

On your first day, check to see if better reservation times for restaurants opened up! I was able to move our brunch for Razzle Dazzle from 9:30 to 7:30. 

Overall, we had a really great time on our honeymoon here and we can't wait to plan our next vacation with VV! ",5,1742279494.0,VirginVoyages,2,1.0,False
1jdyrtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlTalk/comments/1jdyrtg/advice_needed/,Advice Needed,"I wish I could say that this has happened once, but this is now the sixth time. I think….

So, my boyfriend of 7 years broke up with me in September last year. It wasn’t great and I still don’t really understand why, but that’s a story for another time. I moved back in with my parents and found a temp job. Since then I’ve been trying to make friends because the only friends I had were also my ex’s work friends. 

I started this temp job and as always made friends at work. Now I have never seen a work friend outside of that setting so yeah. There weren’t a ton of people my age there. Everyone was either a teen or significantly older than I am, but I got along with most of them anyway. 

There was 2 guys that worked in a different department, but in the same general area as I did. I got to know each of them while I was there. However I did become better friends with one over the other. And this is where my problem began…

My contract with the company ended and I went on my way. I totally forgot that everyone I worked with had my number from the group chat. So this guy started to text me and check in. Last week he asked if I wanted to meet up for coffee. I didn’t think anything of it. I wanted a friend that lived closer to where I did and he was there.

So, I go for coffee with him. I wish this was my first mistake here, but it’s not. We spent 4 hours talking and getting to know each other, but things started to feel weird as the night went on. It was little things that made me realize something was happening. Things like the way he phrased his sentences. Or that he kept pointing out how pretty I was with or without makeup. 

When he dropped me off I made some comment about how my parents have never liked my friends.  I mentioned that I didn’t think my parents would have a problem with him so long as he shows them respect if he ever met them. Then I said that if this was a date, my dad might feel differently. However, I also said that this was by no means a date. 

Since then, he texts and Snapchats me pretty much everyday. The other night he said that a ton of things happened and that he was kind of having a bad night over it. I stupidly asked if he was willing to tell me what was wrong and I probably shouldn’t have… He said that stuff went down at work and that he had “went on a date with a girl [he] was into, but it didn’t go as planned.” 

I kind of sat there for a minute and had to ask myself was he talking about me? Because at that point I knew everything he’d done since I saw him last. I started to panic. I glazed over the date and just agreed that a lot had happened to him that day. 

I just wanted a friend. I’m nowhere near ready to think about dating and yet here I am panicked because I felt someone was talking about me. This happens to me way too often. Guys take me being friendly or nice to them as me flirting. And granted sometimes that’s what’s happening, but most the time no. I just want someone to be there because making friends is hard as an adult. And finding girl friends? Scares the hell out of me. I never have much luck. 

What should I do? I feel awkward and I don’t want to lead him on. Especially if he is thinking that he likes me…",1,1742279492.0,GirlTalk,0,1.0,False

**Introduction:** Hey puzzle lovers! Ever find yourself lost in a maze of letters, grinning ear to ear when you crack a clever riddle? Welcome 😊! In this kickoff post, we’re diving into **word puzzles** – those addictive little brain teasers that have entertained us for ages across different cultures. Word puzzles span everything from the classic crosswords you tackle with your morning coffee to ancient Chinese character riddles passed down through generations. They’re not just games; they’re a global pastime that tickles our brains and brings us together.

**A Brief History & Fun Facts:** Word puzzles have been around *forever*. The first modern **crossword** emerged in 1913 when Arthur Wynne published a “Word-Cross Puzzle” in the New York World newspaper. But that’s just one chapter – ancient Chinese riddles date back to **circa 2nd century CE**, thriving by the Warring States period. How cool is it that thousands of years and miles apart, humans were inventing games to play with language? Each culture developed its own twist. Western puzzles often grew from alphabet and word play, while Chinese puzzles leveraged the visual and tonal tricks of characters. Yet both traditions share something special: they’re **just plain fun!**

**How to Play (In Simple Terms):** Word puzzles come in many flavors, but they all boil down to one thing – figuring out a hidden word or phrase using clues. For instance:

• **Crosswords:** Fill in lettered grids using clues for each row/column. You solve each clue, letter by letter, until the grid is complete.

• **Riddles:** Read a tricky description or question, and find the answer (often a pun or double meaning).

• **Word Searches:** Hunt for listed words hidden in a jumble of letters.

Each puzzle has rules, but the goal is similar – use your wit to uncover the secret word(s)! And don’t worry, we’ll break down specific examples in upcoming posts.

*Fun fact: Word puzzles like crosswords became so popular that by WWII, newspapers feared they were a “mental distraction” – clearly, nothing stops a puzzle fan*

**Interactive Challenge – Let’s Play!:** Ready to flex those brain muscles? Try this **mini riddle**: *“I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind.”* 🤔 Drop your answers in the comments! (Hint: think natural phenomena). Feel free to share your favorite puzzle or a clever riddle to stump the community. Let’s get a playful thread going – who can solve whose puzzle first?

**Tie-In to Our Puzzle Journey:** Consider this series your puzzle travel guide. Today’s intro sets the stage. In the next posts, we’ll hopscotch between Western and Eastern classics – from crosswords to Chinese **字谜** (character riddles) – and even mash them up in a cool east-meets-west challenge. By the finale, you’ll not only have flexed your puzzle-solving muscles but also gotten a sneak peek into a **new word puzzle game** I’m cooking up. 😉 Stay tuned, and happy puzzling!",1,1742279479.0,WordPuzzle_Game,0,1.0,False

thanks in advance for the help. my wife received a handwritten letter from someone who claimed to have grown up or watched her grow up, and then implied that my wife had asked him to go and get coffee.



he signed the note with his full name but provided no contact information. he used a postcard letter from her old town.



the post office says this kind of thing happens periodically but i've never heard of it.



has anyone heard of this style of stalking before?",2,1742278604.0,Stalking,0,1.0,False
