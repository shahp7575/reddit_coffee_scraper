I have noticed that drinking chamomille tea (2 sachets for 1 cup) as well as chrysantheum tea (i had buds, and i just used a handful) has been extremely helpful in managing this. Instead of water normally, I drink these teas. I ice them too but they work better hot. I hope this works for you too guys. If your IC is mainly an inflammation type thing- try drinking these and let me know. I drank around 6 cups or 5 cups a day when ik I'm going to have a really bad flare, or when I eat anything acidic or tomato-y or drink coffee, I drink the tea as well. Little to no flares now.

It goes horribly. What did I do wrong/how do I move on? Can’t live with myself rn. ,"I met her online. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as we began to talk more, we picked up the pace and our interactions got more engaging. Over the past month, we’ve been Facetiming every day for 5, 6, 7 hours at a time. We get along very well. We’re both Indian American and we speak the same mother tongue. I’d never met someone in this context that matched my immersion in the culture I grew up with. We bonded over that and over many other things like love of family, connections with friends, and a common curiosity for learning about each other. So, after investing a significant amount time to get to know one another, we decided a visit might be a good idea. 
I offered to visit her city as I had a few friends there I could crash with during my stay. and we established beforehand that we would go into it without putting any pressure on the outcome. Neither of us were particularly keen on long-distance, but we enjoyed each other’s company over FaceTime so much so, we thought it would be worthwhile. Our conversations were smooth and could last forever because we never ran out of topics to talk about. Both of us loved listening to the other person talk and we hated having to hang up even if we were eating into our schedules for the day. She would call me before a night out, during a night out, after a night out and whenever else. What particularly made me feel confident about our strong connection from her side was that during our calls she would give me her undivided attention for hours, staring wide-eyed at me through the screen with a cute smile, taking in my words, expressions, and company. Those conversations continued up until I flew over to visit her. 
I arrived Thursday evening and crashed with a friend near the airport and then planned to meet her Friday as I had taken the day off. The weather was disgusting. It was hot, wet, and humid thanks to the hurricane that was steamrolling the east coast last week. I met her at her apartment, and we walked to an art gallery, then a coffee shop, and then lunch. Seeing her for the first time was actually really cool. She was really attractive. Roughly at my height, her skin was a rich shade of dark bourbon that glowed despite the overcast grey light seeping from the cloud cover. I could only imagine what she looked like in the sunlight. The first couple hours felt natural, and our conversations were as easy as they were over the phone despite both of us trying to take in the other’s physical presence. She seemed to be exactly who she was through the screen. Well-spoken, put together, with a bubbly personality underneath. I didn’t think at all about how I was coming off. I usually don’t have to as I’m pretty comfortable letting the conversation flow in any direction and redirecting it when necessary. 
During lunch though, the energy plunged. She definitely looked a bit uneasy, and I remember noticing, but it didn’t register. I like to think that I am emotionally aware, so I don’t have to try too hard to have a good conversation. I naturally pick up on cues and adapt, but on this day, I was either tired from traveling, sleep deprived from an uncomfortable air mattress the night before, off from the weather, in an unfamiliar situation, had the wrong idea of what her expectations were, or all of the above. Whatever it was, I was unable to steer the conversation in a better direction and I didn’t think too much of it. A key moment during lunch though was when she mentioned the word ‘courting’ which implied that she expected me to take the role of a man that takes the lead on a date. I misread and didn’t pick up on that unfortunately. Instead, I thought this meant I was pursuing her and not that we were both mutually interested in each other. 
We went back to her place after to watch a movie and even there I was unable to gain any traction with her. Meeting her housemates didn’t really help either as I felt more and more like an outsider who didn’t belong. At that time, I wasn’t able to tap into the connection we had developed over the last month. I failed to engage with anything I had already learned about her in a meaningful way. I was a little uneasy too, but I didn’t see what else I could do at that point besides spending more time to get more comfortable for a moment to hopefully reconnect. 
That evening, she made me dinner. She went to the store before my visit and found fat-free ingredients which she then used to make us Banh Mi which I can’t usually eat because it contains a lot of fat (I can’t digest fat). But this fat-free version tasted so good, and it meant a lot to me that she had done that for me. 
After dinner, we were supposed to go to a club, so her and roommates began pregaming. I don’t usually prefer to go out to drink or party, but I was happy to join her. The friend I was crashing with that night goes to bed early and so I went to go put my backpack down at his place and grab his keys so I can come back however late we were out without disturbing him. On the way there, I got a text from her expressing it might be better if we just met up the next morning for breakfast. That was a nail in the coffin, and I felt it profusely for the first time that things weren’t going well. 
The next morning, we met for breakfast at a bagel place, and the conversation was pretty tame, no real energy. Afterwards she told me something wasn’t feeling right for her about us and that maybe we’re not compatible. I swear, the moment she said this, the sky began to clear. The sun shone brightly through the clouds splashing the slightly yellow autumn leaves lining the boulevards with a vibrant hue. The light dappled her in an angelic coat that had me kind of reeling. As cringey as this sounds, you had to be there to understand. It really sucked that things weren’t going well. 
When we sat down to discuss it, she told me that in my company, she wasn’t able to take it as easy as she would like to. I apparently wasn’t assertive enough. We had the rest of the day planned together, but suddenly that became uncertain. That’s all I was able to think about as she told me this. Each thing she pointed out felt like a punch to my gut as I completely had my guard down. I apparently wasn’t pulling out my phone decisively enough to navigate when she struggled or opening doors decisively enough. I apparently wasn’t selecting what to order and reaching for my card fast enough to pay. I apparently wasn’t decisive enough in selecting what movie to watch on her TV. I apparently didn’t connect with her roommates who I had just met, well enough. I apparently did not have enough agency, confidence, or poise as I interacted with her and the world. Given the short time we had together, these things really are all she has to go off of, but it felt really unfair to me in the moment. It felt like she completely disregarded the person I showed her for the past month and just went with exactly what she saw. Which is fair, I guess. 
I assumed going in that no matter what the outcome, we would have a good time because we get along so well. During this conversation, I began to reflect upon the previous day’s interactions much more thoroughly. I panicked when I realized that she had already processed so much about me, and I assumed that she had made her decision that we are not compatible. I felt like it was on me because she showed up as who she was over the phone whereas I was clearly not coming off with the same authenticity and confidence that I had through the screen. Moreover, the power dynamic had shifted, she no longer seemed as interested whereas I had nothing but a good impression of her. I was taken aback because I thought that I would be given a bit more grace from her given the circumstances of me visiting her and being in an unfamiliar environment. 
To hammer in the final nail in, instead of asking her if we could maybe give it more time or that expressing that I haven’t really had the chance to be comfortable yet, I tunnel-visioned on the critique she presented and assumed it was over. I admired how clearly, she knew how she felt and how gently she was able to articulate it. The permanence with which she pointed out problems with our interactions however did not help on the receiving end. I tried to explain that she hadn’t seen the real me yet, but I choked on it trying to rationalize her verdict with my own while my confidence just crumbled into dust. 
I walked away from her feeling like a loser. I didn’t know what I was doing there anymore. Stuck in the city for the rest of the day that I no longer wanted to be anywhere near. I love the District too so that made it suck even more. Paid a premium just to be abandoned and unwanted. I just walked around the National Mall the rest of the day thinking about what had happened in cruelly gorgeous sunny weather that so starkly contrasted the previous day and the way I was feeling inside. The sunset was so beautiful. It would’ve been even more beautiful in the company of the girl I couldn’t distract myself from. 
She really was just so good, and she was real. Her ‘realness’ knocked me off my feet and by the time I realized the expectations, it was too late. 
My lingering pain comes not from her critiquing my behavior, or not even necessarily that it didn’t work out, but rather that I went over there and was unable to show her who I was. I failed to show up and it’s crucifying for me because that’s the only impression she has of me, and it’s wasted potential for what seemed to be a wonderful connection. It’s like getting a test question wrong even though you have all the information to get it right. When it came to it though, you misread the question or maybe you didn’t connect the dots. But you totally could’ve got it right if you were locked in. I didn’t go into it looking at it like a date where I need to demonstrate how I take initiative and stuff. I just went in hoping to have a good time. So, it caught me of guard so much when she implicitly expected me to do all this stuff. But the context around the visit definitely did point towards such expectations, so call me oblivious, I guess. 
Since this weekend, my brain’s been running on overdrive, picking apart every single moment I spent with her. What I could’ve done better, how I could’ve worn different color and type of clothes, made different jokes, asked different questions, ordered different food, or whatever else I could nit-pick at. The pang of regret and deep sadness has been crippling. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. Maybe it’s the withdrawal from the long and intense doses of interaction I had before this. From such a high peak, I fell right into a ravine. 
I’m relatively assertive and decisive day-to-day, but this weekend I really was not. Watching someone lose interest in you while you progressively get more interested is really hard to come to terms with. As I scrolled through our chat history, I realized how excited she was to see me, how interested she was in me until she met me. Why didn’t I realize how excited she was before? I was excited to see her too, but she was ecstatic. Maybe if I had internalized that earlier, I would’ve been more receptive to her expectations. I know it sounds like I’m trying to be someone else, but I'm not. I believe that it is my authentic self she was interested in, but she tragically did not give me enough grace. Maybe I’m delusional, I don’t know. It torches me to think about it, but I also can’t help but think about it. 

Whenever something like this doesn’t work out, I consider the common reassurance that there are a bajillion other women out there and that this girl is not particularly special. But I can’t help but embrace the fact that we only meet so many people in our lifetimes, and only a fraction of them are of the preferred gender. It’s an even smaller fraction that we find attractive, and even tinier portion of which we connect well with and are compatible with, and even an even fewer number of people who show up at the right time. So, when they show up, we can’t afford to slack off. Call me crazy for flying out and talking and meeting people far away in different worlds and lives, but I am just really determined to find my person. 
I’m still hurting a little and I still don’t agree that we’re incompatible no matter how many well-meaning wise people in my life tell me so. Maybe I’m in denial. With every passing day, it gets a little better because I forget a little more. But I’m still unable to just sit still and live with myself. Every memory of her and our conversations is a crucifixion against me in my consciousness. It doesn’t help that we literally talked about and related on every topic you can think of. I really put myself out there and felt I had good reason to do so. The burns hurt, but whatever. I’ll come to terms with it eventually.

TLDR: This weekend I flew across the country to meet someone I had been getting to know for about a month. Apologies if this is a bit long-winded, I’m still reeling from it, and I like to think writing this piece is part of me making peace with what happened.

It’s cold outside. I put my hand into the blaze seeking and expecting warmth, but instead I got scorched to hell.

For a few months i’ve been online dating on/off. I’m F38. I’ve been on two dates, both didn’t result in additional dates. No bother. My last relationship was over 10 years ago. During this entire time, i didn’t go on dates or speak to anyone romantically, just worked on myself and have enjoyed being independent. At this point i feel done and feel i should hibernate from the dating scene for another 10+ years. 

I recently started speaking to M35. He seems cool and we have plenty in common. He wanted to meet up and i suggested meeting during the day sometime for a coffee or a walk, but he keeps insisting that i come to his house in the early morning hours. I told him i’m not interested in a fling, he said he isn’t either. So his excuses to convince me to come to his range from wanting to cuddle, watch movies & order food in. But i know if a guy is inviting me to his in these circumstances, it’s surely for one thing. He’s even already told me his size and spoke to me about explicit things he wants to engage in with me, hence why i feel stupid for writing this as it seems like a no-brainer. I have been transparent in my communication, that i’m not into one night stands, am not in this to have someone use my body to get-off and even stated that i don’t know him well enough to just turn up at his house after midnight, i mean i’ve never even met him and my life-goal isn’t to be on a future netflix serial killer documentary. He has a witty (and charming) comeback for everything.

Last night he wanted me to come to his at 3am just to “cuddle” but i didn’t go (obvious reasons). Whilst msg’ing him, i fell asleep. Through the course of 30 minutes, he msg’d me a bunch of times, then called my phone twice, waking me up. I msg’d him to tell him that i’m not going to his, i’m tired and want to go back to sleep, so he wanted me to grab a taxi and sleep at his (remember i’ve never met this individual before). When i refused, he was pretty cold with me. He then msg’d and told me he’s disappointed in me. I didn’t respond. He then msg’d minutes later and said that he’s feeling confused and salty but will be fine in the morning and hopes i sleep well. I haven’t responded back because this guy doesn’t seem to understand that no means no, it doesn’t mean convince me. And if i put myself in a position where i do leave my house at 3am to meet him, who knows what i’m walking into and what else he’s going to “convince” me to do? It’s been about 12 hours since we communicated, and just a while ago he messaged to ask if i were awake and that he looks forward to having me stay over and then waking up next to me. I haven’t responded. 

What are your opinions/advice on this? Could someone tell me what is going on here from a mans perspective? And if anyone has had similar experiences, what happened / how would you suggest i safely manage the situation without provoking him? Is it worth giving up on online dating because all i’ve understood is that it’s a culture of people who want one thing and treat others as though they’re disposable, and it’s just not me.

Ever found yourself sitting in a coffee shop, soaking up the vibes, and thinking, *Man, I wish my place felt this chill*? Well, good news—you can totally recreate that cozy, Instagram-worthy coffee shop aesthetic right at home, minus the $7 flat white. With more of us swapping office cubicles for home setups (aka the dining room table), it's no surprise that people are craving that warm, inviting cafe vibe at home.

Whether you’re trying to impress your Insta followers with that perfect cozy corner or just wanna trick yourself into feeling productive, I've got the steps for transforming any room into your own personal coffee shop wonderland.

# 1. First Things First: Pick Your Vibe

Before you even think about decor, you’ve gotta nail down the aesthetic you're going for. Every cool coffee shop has its own vibe, and your home should, too. Let’s break it down:

* **Industrial:** Exposed brick, metal accents, and just a touch of ""I live in a repurposed warehouse"" energy. Perfect if you’re into sleek, modern designs but still want things to feel a little gritty. Think dark leather, minimalistic furniture, and maybe a piece of abstract art you *totally* understand (even if you don’t).
* **Boho:** This is for my earthy folks. Rattan furniture, macrame wall hangings, and enough plants to rival the Amazon rainforest. The boho aesthetic is all about chill, laid-back vibes. It’s cozy, it’s inviting, and there’s always a strong possibility of finding a crystal or two on the windowsill.
* **Minimalist:** Clean lines, neutral tones, and a “less is more” attitude. White walls, simple decor, and the kind of space where clutter doesn’t stand a chance. Perfect for those who want their home to scream, “I’m effortlessly cool, and I have my life together.” Even if you don’t.
* **Vintage:** You know that feeling when you walk into a coffee shop, and it’s got mismatched furniture, quirky art, and maybe a typewriter in the corner for “aesthetic purposes”? That’s vintage. It’s all about charm, character, and finding unique pieces that make your space feel one-of-a-kind. Flea market finds, retro posters, and a jukebox playlist set to ‘60s rock? You’re golden.

Feel free to mix and match these vibes. It’s your space, after all. If you want to blend boho with a hint of industrial, do it. The world is your (coffee-flavored) oyster.

# 2. Set Up Your Space

Alright, now that you’ve picked your style, it’s time to scope out where this coffee shop magic is gonna happen. Good news: you don’t need a whole room for this. A cozy corner in your kitchen, living room, or even a sun-soaked spot on the balcony will do the trick. As long as it’s a space where you can chill, sip your coffee, and pretend like you’re somewhere trendier than your own home, you’re golden.

# Location, Location, Location

Here’s the thing—you don’t need to blow down a wall to create your dream cafe corner. Look for little nooks or crannies that might go underused. That weird corner in your living room? Boom. Cafe zone. The sunny spot near the window in your bedroom? Coffee shop vibes activated. It’s all about creating a little pocket of peace, somewhere you can sit with your coffee and pretend you’re not just 10 feet away from your laundry pile.

# Lighting is Everything

Listen, lighting is what separates the *meh* from the magic. You can’t just slap any ol’ lamp down and call it a day. Coffee shop lighting is warm, inviting, and makes you look like you’re perpetually in soft focus—perfect for Insta, right?

Think Edison bulbs for that vintage-industrial feel, string lights for some soft, twinkling vibes, or a cute little table lamp that casts a warm glow. The key? No harsh overhead lights that make you feel like you’re about to be interrogated.

# Furniture and Decor Essentials

Once you’ve staked your claim on a corner and got the lighting just right, it’s time to fill it with stuff that makes you wanna stay there all day (preferably with multiple cups of coffee).

* **Cozy Seating:** Whether it's a comfy armchair, a little loveseat, or a few chic stools, the point is comfort *with style*. Pro tip? Throw some quirky cushions on there, too. Nothing says “cozy” like a mountain of throw pillows.
* **Wall Art and Signage:** Those empty walls? Boring. Add some personality with coffee-themed prints, a cool vintage clock, or even a chalkboard where you can write today’s “special” (even if it’s just leftover pizza). Want to go full cafe? Neon signs are a fun, bold statement. ""Good Vibes Only"" or “But First, Coffee”? You get the idea.
* **Shelving:** Coffee shops love shelves, and so should you. Floating shelves or rustic wooden ones, they’re perfect for displaying mugs, coffee beans, plants (so many plants), and little knick-knacks. It makes your space feel lived-in, and more importantly, loved.

# 3. The Coffee Bar Setup

Ah, the pièce de résistance: the coffee bar. You can’t call your space a coffee shop without the *coffee* part, right? It’s time to get serious about your caffeine game.

Designate a space—whether it’s a little cart, a shelf, or a section of your kitchen counter—for all your coffee essentials. This is your brewing station, and it deserves some respect.

* **The Gear:** Whether you’re rocking a drip coffee maker, a fancy espresso machine, or just a classic French press, make sure it’s front and center. If you’ve got a grinder for your beans, even better.
* **The Mugs:** Display your favorite mugs—bonus points if they match your aesthetic. (Or if they’re quirky thrift store finds that scream *character*.)
* **Extras:** Organize your beans, syrups, and sugar in cute jars or containers. No one wants to look at ugly packaging. Keep a plant or two nearby, because, at this point, I think we’ve established that plants = cafe vibes.

# Organizing Tips

The key here is to keep it looking tidy but still accessible. Use trays or cute little baskets to corral your coffee-making tools. The goal is to make it feel like you’re stepping up to the counter at your favorite cafe, ready to place an order. (Even if you’re just ordering from yourself.)

# 4. Adding the Final Touches

Alright, so you’ve got your aesthetic, your furniture, and your coffee bar. Now, let’s elevate it with some finishing touches that take your space from “cute” to “OMG, can I move in here?”

* **Incorporate Plants:** I don’t know who decided that plants were the unofficial mascot of coffee shops, but they were right. Whether it’s a big ol’ monstera in the corner or a couple of succulents on your coffee bar, greenery brings life to your space—literally.
* **Textiles:** Throw blankets, pillows, and rugs are a must. Layering soft textures makes your space feel cozy and inviting, like it’s giving you a big ol’ hug.
* **Scent:** Candles or diffusers are the final touch. Opt for coffee-scented candles if you’re extra, but even just a nice subtle scent can complete the sensory experience. Pro tip: Avoid anything too overpowering—this isn’t Bath & Body Works.

# 5. Practical Tips for Maintaining the Look

So, you’ve got your dreamy coffee shop space set up. Now the challenge is keeping it looking that way. I mean, no one wants to sip coffee in a cluttered, chaotic corner.

* **Decluttering Tips:** Stay on top of stray cups, papers, and any random stuff that might start creeping in. Remember, the goal here is chill cafe, not “hot mess express.”
* **Seasonal Updates:** Don’t be afraid to switch things up with the seasons. Swap out your mugs, add a cozy blanket in winter, or pop a vase of fresh flowers on the table in spring. It keeps things feeling fresh without overhauling the entire space.

**Final Thoughts**

So there you have it—a step-by-step guide to creating your own coffee shop aesthetic at home. Whether you're going for a full industrial-vintage-boho mashup or keeping it minimalist chic, the key is making your space feel warm, cozy, and uniquely yours. And hey, the coffee’s always brewed *exactly* how you like it.

Right now, the large hopper that comes with it has been replaced by a 3d printed one for single dosing. 

Dialing in the coffee is particularly annoying as it has steps and they are not easily changed because they get stuck. Also I would like a more silent grinder, if possible, as to not wake up the household with my coffee shenanigans in the morning 🙈. 

I have been looking at the niche zero (because that’s one of the grinders I hear people a lot about) but I actually would prefer one with a portafilter holder, although this is way less important than the grind quality. I prefer a grinder with a more clean look. Also, I do occasionally make a filter coffee but I mostly focus on espresso, so definitely focused on the latter.

- Silent, single dose espresso grinder.
- Stepless or easy to switch
- Portafilter holder
- Clean look preferably
- Budget is preferably around 800 but I do have more if it helps the cause ;)
Cheaper is also fine ofc lol

Thought that was definitely strange, so I called my bank to verify that my card was working. As it turned out, I had 34 charges pending for $17.48 from Doordash (the amount of my coffee and breakfast pastry + tip) — totaling to $594.32 in pending charges. My bank put a hold on my card and asked if I’d attempted to make any purchases on Doordash this morning, to which I said yes — just the one, and they informed me the charge was pending for 34 different transactions.

Nearly $600 in pending transactions, for a coffee and a pastry. I put a hold on my card and ordered a new one, so thankfully the charges weren’t cleared — but WTF??

This was a dream within a dream. 

So before I fell asleep, I was reading for a class in the morning and I didn’t want to truly fall asleep, so I just rested my eyes for a bit, and so it happened.

The first thing I can recall, was that I was talking with my sister, but I was unconscious. Like my eyes were shut, and I was kind of mumbling to her. She was telling me that she had to interview someone with a disorder, but I just explained that I was really tired. She asked if I could sit up straight and open my eyes, but I just couldn’t. 

The next thing I know, I’m drinking a twisted tea and I deadass thought I was drinking this in real life. I swear I could feel it trickle down my face, and I could feel the cold splash in my stomach. All of a sudden however, I felt drunk and there was a sharp pain in my stomach. 

This is where time skips a little because this makes no sense. Because now I’m driving. Drunk. With a girl who I don’t know, but I’m lowkey attracted to. She’s Mexican. Anyways, we had just done something, I’m not sure what. It was daytime, and we were driving in what appeared to be a metropolitan area, possibly St. Louis, but I’m not sure. She had asked me what I wanted to do, and I just said we should get a coffee, because I have class in a few hours and I’m running on not that much sleep (in real life).

She hesitates as I start swerving on and off the road, and in the middle of a highway, there’s a stoplight. And it’s red. I slam on my brakes, and we don’t even stop. Thankfully, it turns yellow right as we go under it and into a tunnel.  We were driving behind a white utility truck and occasionally underneath a massive logging truck but that’s besides the point. Anyways, this was a red tunnel, and it teleported us to this girls place. It was kind of a mess. It had food on all the counters, dirty dishes, etc. Her apartment was like all white with elements of pink furniture, and consisted of a few rooms.

I then met her roommates, as one of them volunteered to make dinner. Mac and Cheese and teriyaki chicken. Shit looked gas. However, I didn’t want to eat it there, so I tried to find a Tupperware container I spotted earlier to put it in, but it had old food in it and it was gross. So I took the food out of it onto a plate. (It was like rice and black beans made out of plastic). I then continued to wash the dish, but I was so disgusted by the mold on the lid, I just told her and her roommates I would do all the dishes. 

Then, as I walk into the kitchen, I see Evan and Thomas (my roommates) there as well cleaning up the mess. I gain consciousness and try to explain to them that this isn’t real, I’m dreaming right now. But all of a sudden, Thomas takes one of those huge kitchen knives, like the ones you use to cut watermelon and swings it straight at my crotch. Like full on uppercut. 

I immediately lift in the air into darkness, and feel this sensation of my body run through me. I start gargling like something’s coming out of me, and then I drop and hear this voice.

The voice says in the most robotic way possible:

“Welcome back to reality”

I am supposed to be 8w 3 days according to the LMP. My periods been irregular for most of the part. When i went to an ultrasound 2 weeks ago, my OB told me that it looked like i was 5w5d. There was gestational sac and yolk sac and what looked like a baby but super tiny and no activity. My HCG  was 8283. Antibody screen Negative , Progesterone was 25.7.    CRL was measuring    2.1 mm

Two weeks later i went for another ultrasound and we saw the baby who was a little tiny. And i guess they measure using their own calculations and it showed 6w5d. And we saw the heartbeat measuring 138.

My new hcg was 84852
Progesterone went down to 22.6
CRL was 7.8 cm

Prior to the 2nd ultrasound i was scared that we wouldn't see the heartbeat. My husband was not there for the first Ultrasound. I was scared that he would be heartbroken if we didnt see the heartbeat. Thank god we did she the heartbeat.

Is 138 bpm okay for 6w5d. Also i am scared that baby is behind by a week and few days. My OB told me that as long as the growth was consistent, she wasn't concerned about the baby being small or measuring behind. We told my in-laws about the baby and they are excited since the baby will be the first grandchild. I'm scared and not as attached to the baby incase anything goes wrong. I think my husband would be heartbroken and I'm scared about it.

Also I am not consuming as much protein because eggs make me nauseous. My breasts are sore and i have cramping all the time and nauseous when i drink coffee or brush my teeth.

I was terrified it would come back after the myo. It took 3 doctors for me to finally get the surgical procedure. The doctors insisted I start birth control, but to me taking synthetic hormones forever did not sound like a good solution especially since they did not even know what caused the fibroid.

So like most women, I took to the internet for research and found out about estrogen dominance. And I had every symptom with breast soreness being the worst one.

I was moody, breast felt painful for most of my cycle, acne, painful ovulation and period, randomly being bloated, and so much fatigue that I thought I had a sleep disorder and had to get a sleep study done.

Anyway, I found out about DIM. I take it SEAONALLY. Whenever the weather changes from warm to cold, my body starts giving up. I am an African woman living in the US so winter is stressful af for me. I take it everyday for a month, then take it ONLY during ovulation week for the rest of the season. A phone reminder helps. 

Its Oct now so I started my DIM bottle for the 3rd year. I figured it is time to trust  DIM enough to tell others.

the positive effects are:

Bloating - my stomach is flat and remains so throughout the day.

I sleep better which then uplifts my mood

my skin starts glowing.

my energy is up

Breast are not sore till 4-5days before period

cramps are so better much manageable. Quitting coffee has also helped this one.

I just feel like a normal human being if there's such a thing. I do not feel like I am constantly struggling to feel ok.

Massive headache by day 4-5, but it ceases after 2days. I fight this one because the benefits are worth it.

1fv83iw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fv83iw,Escaper spotted at 4am!,"Hi reddit. 

Let me start by telling you a little tale of “how I met my cat” I rescued her exactly a year ago a half during storms. She was a stray cat back then with a ton of wounds. My boy cat was absolutely in loved with her through windows. He would wait for her, stare at her, and tried to touch her through the glass. I kept feeding her and I eventually earned her trust. When the storm stopped for a brief moment, she came out completely drenched. I said, “where have you been girl? I was worried!” And she ran straight into my arms. I named her Lylla and the rest is history.

As I’m writing this I am almost in tears. I am in Georgia and we were recently hit my tropical storm. We lost power for 3 days and during those times, our skittish girl escaped somehow. No idea when, how, from where… she just vanished. My husband and I have been trying everything. We have put her litter box and our dirty clothes out. We’ve been putting fresh water and food out for her twice a day. We’ve also been patrolling the neighborhood and nearby park every night softly calling her name. 
I woke up this morning and I checked my security camera. Well, she was in our yard at 4am this morning!!!! I’m outside in shed with my phone, book, coffee trying to not make any noise so she doesn’t get spooked. I also put her favorite blankies and bed by the entrance of the shed with her food covered in churu as she LOVES churu (even though she is not food motivated, at all). 

TD;DR: My cat escaped 4 nights ago. We’ve tried all the tricks on the book! She was finally spotted in our backyard at 4am last night!

My question is, am I on the right track?! We have a pretty good fenced in yard with very little room to escape. Are my chances pretty high? Please help me and my heart broken young man (my boy cat) calm their nerves and any tips would be so greatly appreciated! Thank you all 🥺💖",8,1727963064.0,cats,1,1.0,False

Instead of fighting to convince him I wanted to stay like usual, I just conceded. 

“You’re right, maybe we can preserve the friendship if we end things now while we can still stand each other.” Is essentially what I said. “I think maybe we’d make better friends and coparents.” 

He said he didn’t expect me to say that. I don’t know what he expected me to say. I bet he was genuinely feeling the thoughts when he said them but I don’t think he was prepared to follow through on them. It’s so much easier to flirt with the idea of losing it all than it is to actually do it. 

He says I’m a bad communicator, he doesn’t understand what I want and that I’m unwilling to work with him toward what I want. I’m tired of having my needs/desires being repurposed into something they’re not. I asked him to ask me more questions about myself; I want to feel heard and cared for and special and thought of. He asked if we could both research a topic and have discussions about that topic instead, you know, as a compromise. I don’t know what changing the topic of the discussion does to make that task easier but he says it’s because of his autism that he needs that accommodation. “You know the question game makes me nervous.” I think you just don’t like me, dude. What do you mean you can’t ask me questions about myself? My inner thoughts? Does Autism make you selfish, or is it that autism makes you not interested in me? 

He left for the night, went to see his parents. I have felt my insides rotting away ever since. I can’t eat anything. I had coffee to keep me awake during my 6 am shift, but I’m struggling to not throw it all up while my body breaks down and my brain begins liquifying out of my ears. He did come home, although I wonder if it’s out of obligation to the 2 kids we have since the older one has preschool today.

I accidentally left someone on hold at my job for like 6 minutes because I dissociated mid-call. This job is what enables me to leave so I can’t lose it. But I’m clearly not well. I don’t want to go home but I think that’s the only place I want to be somehow.

I don’t want to break up, I just want him to love me. But I don’t think he can love me the way I appreciate love best. ",3,1727963034.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False

What you read is a review from an Amazon reader about RINYV. 

Arrival of The Moon Hare (Rinyv 1)

On a Grim Adventure (Rinyv 2)

Remote Island Prison (Rinyv 3) is currently in the works.

Synopsis Book 1: Fear hinders one's potential.

A sinister presence delights in Rinyv's torment, relentlessly pursuing and killing her after she turns fifteen. Now, having encountered death four times already, the girl is living her fifth life hoping to alter her fate and stop the endless cycle of suffering.

As the terrifying age of fifteen approaches and chaotic events lead people down the path of despair, Rinyv can't help but do everything in her power to overcome her trauma and grow stronger.

The looming strides of death draw near, and Rinyv appears to hold the key to saving not only herself but all of mankind. Fortunately, armed with the knowledge of her past lives, continuous training, and a giant pair of scissors found on holy ground, she is no longer a powerless, naive young girl.L!nk in the comments section.

I will probably never be able to smoke or drink hard liquor again. I can’t even drink coffee. I had to delete my Twitter that I’ve had since 2017 because I was schizoposting nonstop for days and ruined my entire feed. 

And since I lost my phone prior to my breakdown, I don’t even have any old pictures to look back on. Needless to say I’m a shell of the person I used to be. 

It feels like I’m being forced to change for the better. I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoon that’s on its way to become a butterfly. I know that time heals all wounds, but the present still sucks.

I have issues with anxiety/social anxiety and for the most part I handle it quite well but I have a hard time saying no to people because I am a ‘people pleaser’. There is an older gentleman (late 70’s to early 80’s) who comes in a few times a week and I am always very friendly with him as I am with all my customers. A couple of weeks ago I served him and we were making small talk and I had mentioned that I was taking a course to get a profession involving animals. This lead to him asking me if I’d like to come meet his dog at his house sometime which I just agreed to because I was trying to be polite and didn’t know how to say no. He asked me when I had a day off and he said he would pick me up from my workplace and take me to his house which is about a 10 minute drive out of town.(As I don’t have a license it wasn’t an option for me to drive myself there)

Come the day for him to pick me up I was extremely anxious at the situation I had put myself in but I still showed up. When he arrived I told him I wasn’t comfortable going to his house but I would be okay going out to get a coffee or something to eat and I offered to pay. He said that was fine although he seemed a little upset that I wouldn’t be going to meet his dog. The lunch went okay besides a few comments he made that made me uncomfortable such as “this is kind of our first date” and “you will come down to the house eventually” and he would not allow me to pay for anything and told me I could pay for myself “next time”. Needless to say it was very awkward and I was very nervous through the whole encounter. He mostly talked about himself and how he survived cancer. He has a ex wife which whom he speaks to often and a daughter who he hasn’t seen or spoken to since she was very young, I didn’t ask why. I questioned him as to why he asked to see me outside of work and he basically said “you seemed nice, I had no malicious intent and I thought you might like to meet my dog since you like animals”.

Since this happened I have been very nervous while at work and keep watching the door to see if he’s come into the store. Twice now I have hid out the back and my coworker has served him so I wouldn’t have to. I feel like I’m being ridiculous but I also don’t know what to say to him as I feel he will ask me to go to his house again or to go out for lunch another time and I won’t know how to say no. He could just be a lonely old man who wants company but I’m just not comfortable with it and I don’t know how to tell him without upsetting him. I know I should have just said no to begin with and I have dug myself into this hole. I have informed my boss of the situation and he was very understanding and even switched some of my shifts so I wouldn’t be working alone. My boss told me I just need to say “No sorry I can’t” if he asks me again and that I don’t need to give an explanation, which may be true but I feel he may just keep asking me if I give no explanation or think I’m just saying no to that specific time. My coworker has suggested that I could just blame my partner and say that he’s not comfortable with me seeing another man outside of my workplace. 

I work this coming Saturday by myself in the morning and I am almost certain the older man will be coming in as he usually comes in on Saturdays and I am trying to plan what to say to him. I hope this isn’t a stupid question but do I just be honest and tell him I’m not comfortable seeing him outside of work or do I blame my partner and say he doesn’t want me to continue seeing him? I just don’t want to start a confrontation and I also don’t want to upset this old man but I know that may be unavoidable at this point. Sorry for the long post, thank you if you’ve read this whole thing.

Edit: Prior to our lunch he did not know I had a partner because the subject was never brought up but he does know now because while we were out he asked me why I moved to Australia (I’m from Canada) and I said to live with my fiancé. I found his response a little odd, he asked “Where is he?”. I just told him my fiancé was at home and I didn’t know if he was welcomed to come along to which he responded that he wouldn’t have minded.",2,1727962565.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

Is it worth having hope? ,"I met her online. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as we began to talk more, we picked up the pace and our interactions got more engaging. Over the past month, we’ve been Facetiming every day for 5, 6, 7 hours at a time. We get along very well. We’re both Indian American and we speak the same mother tongue. I’d never met someone in this context that matched my immersion in the culture I grew up with. We bonded over that and over many other things like love of family, connections with friends, and a common curiosity for learning about each other. So, after investing a significant amount time to get to know one another, we decided a visit might be a good idea. 

I offered to visit her city as I had a few friends there I could crash with during my stay. and we established beforehand that we would go into it without putting any pressure on the outcome. Neither of us were particularly keen on long-distance, but we enjoyed each other’s company over FaceTime so much so, we thought it would be worthwhile. Our conversations were smooth and could last forever because we never ran out of topics to talk about. Both of us loved listening to the other person talk and we hated having to hang up even if we were eating into our schedules for the day. She would call me before a night out, during a night out, after a night out and whenever else. What particularly made me feel confident about our strong connection from her side was that during our calls she would give me her undivided attention for hours, staring wide-eyed at me through the screen with a cute smile, taking in my words, expressions, and company. Those conversations continued up until I flew over to visit her. 

I arrived Thursday evening and crashed with a friend near the airport and then planned to meet her Friday as I had taken the day off. The weather was disgusting. It was hot, wet, and humid thanks to the hurricane that was steamrolling the east coast last week. I met her at her apartment, and we walked to an art gallery, then a coffee shop, and then lunch. Seeing her for the first time was actually really cool. She was really attractive. Roughly at my height, her skin was a rich shade of dark bourbon that glowed despite the overcast grey light seeping from the cloud cover. I could only imagine what she looked like in the sunlight. The first couple hours felt natural, and our conversations were as easy as they were over the phone despite both of us trying to take in the other’s physical presence. She seemed to be exactly who she was through the screen. Well-spoken, put together, with a bubbly personality underneath. I didn’t think at all about how I was coming off. I usually don’t have to as I’m pretty comfortable letting the conversation flow in any direction and redirecting it when necessary. 
During lunch though, the energy plunged. She definitely looked a bit uneasy, and I remember noticing, but it didn’t register. I like to think that I am emotionally aware, so I don’t have to try too hard to have a good conversation. I naturally pick up on cues and adapt, but on this day, I was either tired from traveling, sleep deprived from an uncomfortable air mattress the night before, off from the weather, in an unfamiliar situation, had the wrong idea of what her expectations were, or all of the above. Whatever it was, I was unable to steer the conversation in a better direction and I didn’t think too much of it. A key moment during lunch though was when she mentioned the word ‘courting’ which implied that she expected me to take the role of a man that takes the lead on a date. I misread and didn’t pick up on that unfortunately. Instead, I thought this meant I was pursuing her and not that we were both mutually interested in each other. 

We went back to her place after to watch a movie and even there I was unable to gain any traction with her. Meeting her housemates didn’t really help either as I felt more and more like an outsider who didn’t belong. At that time, I wasn’t able to tap into the connection we had developed over the last month. I failed to engage with anything I had already learned about her in a meaningful way. I was a little uneasy too, but I didn’t see what else I could do at that point besides spending more time to get more comfortable for a moment to hopefully reconnect. 

That evening, she made me dinner. She went to the store before my visit and found fat-free ingredients which she then used to make us Banh Mi which I can’t usually eat because it contains fatty ingredients (I can’t digest fat). But this fat-free version tasted so good, and it meant a lot to me that she had done that for me. 

After dinner, we were supposed to go to a club, so her and roommates began pregaming. I don’t usually prefer to go out to drink or party, but I was happy to join her. The friend I was crashing with that night goes to bed early and so I went to go put my backpack down at his place and grab his keys so I can come back however late we were out without disturbing him. On the way there, I got a text from her expressing it might be better if we just met up the next morning for breakfast. That was a nail in the coffin, and I felt it profusely for the first time that things weren’t going well. 

The next morning, we met for breakfast at a bagel place, and the conversation was pretty tame, no real energy. Afterwards she told me something wasn’t feeling right for her about us and that maybe we’re not compatible. I swear, the moment she said this, the sky began to clear. The sun shone brightly through the clouds splashing the slightly yellow autumn leaves lining the boulevards with a vibrant hue. The light dappled her in an angelic coat that had me kind of reeling. As cringey as this sounds, you had to be there to understand. It really sucked that things weren’t going well. 
When we sat down to discuss it, she told me that in my company, she wasn’t able to take it as easy as she would like to. I apparently wasn’t assertive enough. We had the rest of the day planned together, but suddenly that became uncertain. That’s all I was able to think about as she told me this. Each thing she pointed out felt like a punch to my gut as I completely had my guard down. I apparently wasn’t pulling out my phone decisively enough to navigate when she struggled or opening doors decisively enough. I apparently wasn’t selecting what to order and reaching for my card fast enough to pay. I apparently wasn’t decisive enough in selecting what movie to watch on her TV. I apparently didn’t connect with her roommates who I had just met, well enough. I apparently did not have enough agency, confidence, or poise as I interacted with her and the world. Given the short time we had together, these things really are all she has to go off of, but it felt really unfair to me in the moment. It felt like she completely disregarded the person I showed her for the past month and just went with exactly what she saw. Which is fair, I guess. 

I assumed going in that no matter what the outcome, we would have a good time because we get along so well. During this conversation, I began to reflect upon the previous day’s interactions much more thoroughly. I panicked when I realized that she had already processed so much about me, and I assumed that she had made her decision that we are not compatible. I felt like it was on me because she showed up as who she was over the phone whereas I was clearly not coming off with the same authenticity and confidence that I had through the screen. Moreover, the power dynamic had shifted, she no longer seemed as interested whereas I had nothing but a good impression of her. I was taken aback because I thought that I would be given a bit more grace from her given the circumstances of me visiting her and being in an unfamiliar environment. 

To hammer in the final nail in, instead of asking her if we could maybe give it more time or that expressing that I haven’t really had the chance to be comfortable yet, I tunnel-visioned on the critique she presented and assumed it was over. I admired how clearly, she knew how she felt and how gently she was able to articulate it. The permanence with which she pointed out problems with our interactions however did not help on the receiving end. I tried to explain that she hadn’t seen the real me yet, but I choked on it trying to rationalize her verdict with my own while my confidence just crumbled into dust. 

I walked away from her feeling like a loser. I didn’t know what I was doing there anymore. Stuck in the city for the rest of the day that I no longer wanted to be anywhere near. I love the District too so that made it suck even more. Paid a premium just to be abandoned and unwanted. I just walked around the National Mall the rest of the day thinking about what had happened in cruelly gorgeous sunny weather that so starkly contrasted the previous day and the way I was feeling inside. The sunset was so beautiful. It would’ve been even more beautiful in the company of the girl I couldn’t distract myself from. 

She really was just so good, and she was real. Her ‘realness’ knocked me off my feet and by the time I realized the expectations, it was too late. 
My lingering pain comes not from her critiquing my behavior, or not even necessarily that it didn’t work out, but rather that I went over there and was unable to show her who I was. I failed to show up and it’s crucifying for me because that’s the only impression she has of me, and it’s wasted potential for what seemed to be a wonderful connection. It’s like getting a test question wrong even though you have all the information to get it right. When it came to it though, you misread the question or maybe you didn’t connect the dots. But you totally could’ve got it right if you were locked in. I didn’t go into it looking at it like a date where I need to demonstrate how I take initiative and stuff. I just went in hoping to have a good time. So, it caught me of guard so much when she implicitly expected me to do all this stuff. But the context around the visit definitely did point towards such expectations, so call me oblivious, I guess. 

Since this weekend, my brain’s been running on overdrive, picking apart every single moment I spent with her. What I could’ve done better, how I could’ve worn different color and type of clothes, made different jokes, asked different questions, ordered different food, or whatever else I could nit-pick at. The pang of regret and deep sadness has been crippling. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. Maybe it’s the withdrawal from the long and intense doses of interaction I had before this. From such a high peak, I fell right into a ravine. 

I’m relatively assertive and decisive day-to-day, but this weekend I really was not. Watching someone lose interest in you while you progressively get more interested is really hard to come to terms with. As I scrolled through our chat history, I realized how excited she was to see me, how interested she was in me until she met me. Why didn’t I realize how excited she was before? I was excited to see her too, but she was ecstatic. Maybe if I had internalized that earlier, I would’ve been more receptive to her expectations. I know it sounds like I’m trying to be someone else, but I'm not. I believe that it is my authentic self she was interested in, but she tragically did not give me enough grace. Maybe I’m delusional, I don’t know. It torches me to think about it, but I also can’t help but think about it. 

Whenever something like this doesn’t work out, I consider the common reassurance that there are a bajillion other women out there and that this girl is not particularly special. But I can’t help but embrace the fact that we only meet so many people in our lifetimes, and only a fraction of them are of the preferred gender. It’s an even smaller fraction that we find attractive, and even tinier portion of which we connect well with and are compatible with, and even an even fewer number of people who show up at the right time. So, when they show up, we can’t afford to slack off. Call me crazy for flying out and talking and meeting people far away in different worlds and lives, but I am just really determined to find my person. 

I’m still hurting a little and I still don’t agree that we’re incompatible no matter how many well-meaning wise people in my life tell me so. Maybe I’m in denial. With every passing day, it gets a little better because I forget a little more. But I’m still unable to just sit still and live with myself. Every memory of her and our conversations is a crucifixion against me in my consciousness. It doesn’t help that we literally talked about and related on every topic you can think of. I really put myself out there and felt I had good reason to do so. The burns hurt, but whatever. I’ll come to terms with it eventually.

TLDR: This weekend I flew across the country to meet someone I had been getting to know for about a month. Apologies if this is a bit long-winded, I’m still reeling from it, and I like to think writing this piece is part of me making peace with what happened.

It’s cold outside. I put my hand into the blaze seeking and expecting warmth, but instead I got scorched to hell.

1fv7w7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1fv7w7l/im_26_weeks_and_my_partner_ended_things_im/,I’m 26 weeks and my partner ended things. I’m devastated and I don’t know what to do ,"My partner (I guess ex partner..) and I are both in our mid thirties. We got pregnant unexpectedly about 5 months into our relationship. At the time, we felt like we could make it work - we were in love, we both had good jobs, we had already talked about getting married and potentially having our own kids someday. It took lots of talks but we decided to embrace the happy accident and become parents together.  I already have two kids from my previous marriage, and a house big enough. It kind of felt like it just worked. 

We had had some issues before the pregnancy, but nothing earth shattering. We attributed it to the growing pains of a new relationship and learning a new person. 

After I decided to keep the baby, I got fired from my job for “business need”. My partner stepped up to help me out. I got a new job a couple months later but it was a tough summer. 

Since the baby and losing my job, my partner would keep doing nice things and then punishing me for it. He would give me money for my mortgage and then later resent me for it because I’m “not grown enough to pay my own bills”. To be clear, I had money saved, but he wanted to help and said it was so I didn’t stress too much. 

He moved in and started doing things around the house. It always felt like he wanted to get rid of my things and replace it with his. From the furniture to the flooring to the paint on the walls. Everything I had done before him wasn’t good enough for one reason or another; and he was going to “fix” it. I pushed back on a lot of it… it’s my house, after all. And I LIKE my things, that’s why they’re here. 

There were instances where i questioned him and his relationship with other women. I found earrings in his bedroom. He was on that FB group “are we dating the same guy” twice. He would keep pictures of his ex up on Instagram but refuse to post any of us, saying he likes to be private and he doesn’t post anyway. He would tell me about coffee shop girls flirting with him (this I laughed off bc… they’re being polite babe). He would bring up another woman he dated who he categorized as a 9/10 and had this perfect body but unfortunately had to move across the country. Stuff like that. So I would tell him how these things make me feel foolish or ugly. And he would tell me I’m just insecure (yes, I agree, these things make me feel insecure about his feelings for me, why is that a problem on me???) and that I should stop accusing him of things and he’s with me which proves he’s not doing anything or thinking about other ppl. (Because cheating just.. doesn’t exist?)

To hear him tell it, I’m overly emotional and unreasonable. I told him I can’t be in a relationship with someone who is dismissive of me constantly (a trait of his that he himself admits he has and knows is wrong). His response was that being dismissed is part of life and I shouldn’t be crazy. I said it’s part of life but it shouldn’t be part of a loving relationship. I specified that I don’t need him to agree with everything I say and feel, but I DO need him to hear me without interrupting me or guessing what I mean or telling me I’m wrong before I finish. He doubled down. Since I’m pregnant I said we should try doing some counseling bc obviously what we are doing isn’t working. He said “it’s not going to work out.” And left. 

There were mistakes I’ve made, for sure. In times where I felt like he wasn’t listening, I would cry and honestly I would get irrational. I would get up and say I can’t deal with this and leave the room.. bc in those moments I really felt like screaming. When he was telling me how hot that other ex was, I asked him where he would rate me. And why is he with me if he is used to someone sooo much hotter? And does he tink of her when we are together?
Stuff like that. 

But it doesn’t matter because I’m sitting here now at 26 weeks pregnant… already a single mom with two kids. I can’t stop thinking how keeping my baby was a mistake. And the thought “I didnt even want a third kid, now I’m stuck here” is over and over in my head and I feel guilty bc I think he can probably sense that in my uterus. 


Anyway. If anyone is still here. I’d love some encouragement. Or stories of ppl doing this alone and it being okay. ",1,1727962480.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

**EPISODE 1: NEW BLOOD**

Batman introduces Spoiler (Stephanie Brown) and Orphan (Cassandra Cain) to the Batfamily. Spoiler, with her playful and rebellious attitude, rubs Batman the wrong way, especially when she immediately starts flirting with Tim (Robin). Orphan, who remains mute, struggles to communicate with the others but proves to be an asset in combat, particularly under Bruce’s tutelage.

Nightwing returns to Gotham to help ease the transition for Spoiler and Orphan, balancing his time between Blüdhaven and Gotham. Tim is attending Gotham University, and we see him trying to keep up with his workload and crime-fighting. Oracle (Barbara Gordon) watches over the team from the Clock Tower.



Nightwing: “*So, how are the new recruits looking*?”

Oracle: “*Spoiler’s a handful—she’s reckless, a bit like you were. Orphan, though...she’s got something different. She’s quiet, but you can feel there’s a storm underneath*.”

Nightwing (smirking): “*Seems like Steph's already got her eyes on Tim.*”

Oracle (laughing softly): “*They’ll make an interesting pair, if she doesn’t get him killed first*.”



Tim’s exhaustion becomes evident early on, as he arrives late to the Batcave, his third cup of coffee in hand. Spoiler notices his lack of sleep, setting up their future bond.

Spoiler teases Tim:

Spoiler: “*Let me guess—you’ve already had five coffees in the last 2 hours*?”

Tim (yawning): “*Three. I’m pacing myself.*”

Spoiler (smirking): “*I’d be impressed if you weren’t also dying*.”


Batman tells Tim he needs to take a step back, but he refuses.

Batman(concerned): ""*Tim, for the love of God, please rest. You're giving Alfred heart attacks, you are like a zombie in your classes despite your high grades and you consider it good work if you manage an hour of sleep a night. Please, son*.""

Tim (fighting back another yawn): ""*Dad, cmon, you know I'm barely Robin these days. I'm at college from 9am till 6pm three days a week and I study every night until the break of dawn to keep up, so I'm already sacrificing a social life. Don't take Robin away from me too.*""
---

**EPISODE 2: TRIAL BY FIRE**

Spoiler and Orphan are put to the test, going on their first major mission to track down a lead on Cluemaster. Spoiler's recklessness almost gets her hurt, leading to a confrontation with Batman, who warns her about the dangers of her impulsive behavior.

 Tim’s workload intensifies as he juggles crime-fighting and his studies in criminology, biology, and chemistry. He starts to pull all-nighters, relying heavily on caffeine. Spoiler begins noticing his exhaustion.


Steph: “*You’ve been up for days, haven’t you*?”

Tim: “*I’ve got it under control*.”

Steph (sternly): “*You’ve got dark circles bigger than your domino mask, Tim. This isn’t sustainable.*”



Meanwhile, Orphan struggles to express her emotions. Batman takes her under his wing, quietly offering her support. Their father-daughter bond is hinted at, with Bruce spending extra time training her personally.



Batman: “*You don’t need words to show your strength, Cassandra. In this family, actions speak louder.*”

Orphan silently nods, showing her respect and trust.




---

**EPISODE 3 : THE FAMILY THAT FIGHTS**

Spoiler’s impulsiveness during a mission results in her barely escaping a fatal trap set by Cluemaster. Batman’s frustration boils over, and he scolds her, causing tension between them. However, she refuses to quit, determined to prove herself.


Batman and Robin go on a patrol together with the two of them reflecting on their time as partners in recent months, since Tim has had to take a backseat and Bruce has searched fruitlessly for Jason.

Batman: ""* He's out there somewhere Tim. He will come back to us. I want him to know how proud of him I am.*""

Robin: ""*he knows, B. I promise you he knows. We all do.*""

Batman: ""*and I'm proud of you too, Tim. You prove yourself as the best thing to ever happen to this family every few days.*""

Steph and Bruce argue again in the Batcave with Bruce trying to be a good father to her, and she runs off out of the cave and back into the manor.
Nightwing steps in as a mediator, trying to ease the growing tension within the Batfamily. He talks to Batman about trusting Spoiler.



Nightwing: “*She’s rough around the edges, but she’s got potential. You need to give her a chance to prove it, Bruce*.”

Batman (sighing): “*I’m not losing another one, Dick. I won’t let her get herself killed.*”



Meanwhile, Tim’s exhaustion reaches its peak. Spoiler, noticing how much he’s pushing himself, takes matters into her own hands and forces him to rest. She drags him to her room, where he finally collapses from fatigue and sleeps for hours in her arms.


Spoiler (whispering): “It’s okay to rest, Tim. You don’t have to do everything by yourself.”

Tim (half-asleep): “I don’t know how to stop.”

Spoiler: “I’ll show you.”




---

**EPISODE 4 : SINS OF THE FATHER**


The next morning, Alfred knocks on the door, entering with Bruce right behind him. Alfred’s polite cough wakes them, and Bruce raises an eyebrow at the scene but says nothing. As they scramble to explain themselves, Nightwing turns the corner, sees them through the open door, and starts laughing.

Alfred (dryly): “*It appears Master Tim has finally found some much-needed rest.*”

Bruce (stern but amused): “*Sleep is important, Tim. Try to make it in your own bed next time.*”

Nightwing (from the hallway, grinning): “*Busted! I knew it!*” (cackling as he walks away)

Tim (blushing furiously): “*It’s not what it looks like!*”

Spoiler (groaning): “*Oh my god, you guys…*”


The Batfamily learns that Orphan’s father, David Cain, is still alive and under Amanda Waller’s control. Orphan struggles with the realization that her father is still out there, alive but more dangerous than ever. She wants to face him, but Batman is hesitant.

Spoiler becomes increasingly protective of Orphan, stepping into a big sister role. The two bond during a quiet moment on a rooftop, where Spoiler opens up about her own father, Cluemaster.



Spoiler: “*Fathers are complicated. Mine...he’s a criminal. But that doesn’t make me him. And your dad...he doesn’t define you either.*”

Orphan (nodding, silently appreciative): “*...Thank you.*”



Meanwhile, Batman and Nightwing track down Amanda Waller to question her about Cain’s whereabouts. Oracle provides remote support, keeping an eye on them from the Clock Tower.



Waller: “*Cain’s dangerous, sure. But he’s useful. You, of all people, should understand that, Batman*.”

Batman: “*He’s a threat. And if you won’t take care of him, I will.*”

Later in the episode, Bruce attends a talk show interview, where he is questioned about his new additions to his family and his family as whole.

Host(nonchalantly) : ""*So, Mister Wayne, why is it you have decided to adopt so many children, when you had quite the socialite past and yet you adopted a child at 25, 23 whole years ago. No biological children?*""

Bruce(comfortable, a smile on his face and a gleam in his eye, clearly relishing the opportunity to talk about his children): ""*Well as you know I never got to have a long fulfilling life with my parents, they died when I was 7. So when I met Richard, who was 7 when I met him, my heart broke and i simply **had** to adopt him. And I honestly couldn't be prouder of him, he owns a security firm in Blüdhaven that makes loads of money and he's very successful from it and he is loving life, and he still gets involved in his security jobs when hes bored. 

Then theres Jason, who is sadly no longer with us. He passed away when he was 12 and it broke my heart in ways I can never explain. If he was with us today then I know I couldn't be prouder of the man he would have become. If I could say one thing to him now it would be that I love him, as I never got the opportunity to say it one last time before he was killed in one of the Jokers rampages. 

Tim became the new light in my life after his parents passed on. Dick and Jason both babysat him along with my aide Alfred and when his parents died I simply had to take him in, and look at him now! Studying 3 majors in college; criminology, biology and chemistry. He's a little genius, although its a nightmare to watch films with him because he always instantly guesses the twist. 

Steph, one of the two girls I recently adopted, is from the Bowery and is Gotham through and through. She's rowdy and rambunctious and has ADHD like Tim, and I haven't technically adopted her since shes almost 19 and I can't legally adopt someone over 18 but she has moved in and is starting a bond with her elder brothers and younger sister. Her story broke my heart, her dad was a crook and killed her mother so I intended to adopt her at 16 but the court case was so long drawn out I was unable to adopt her and simply sheltered her for a year or 2 but now she's part of the family and is in my will and everything.

Little Cassandra is almost mute as a result of the violence her father showed her growing up. I found her when she was sneaking into the Manor to try and get some food, and I took her inside, fed her and took her over to GCPD, had her father locked up and then adopted her so I knew she'd have a place to stay. She's a emotionally intelligent girl, able to advise her siblings on so much without even saying a word. I'm so proud of her.

As for biological kids Jerry, none that I know of, haha.*""

Bruce concludes his interview and then heads home, where he is greeted by his kids.

EPISODE 5 : HEART OF THE KNIGHT

Cluemaster teams up with a mysterious new crime boss connected to the League of Assassins, causing Gotham’s criminal underworld to spiral into chaos. Nightwing returns to Gotham full-time to help deal with the growing threat. His leadership style differs from Batman’s, more laid-back but just as effective.

Nightwing’s relationship with his siblings is explored in-depth. He views Tim and Jason as the true “golden kids,” even though the rest of the family sees him as the ""golden boy."" He also feels responsible for the rest of the Batfamily, constantly trying to balance his role as both a hero and an older brother.


Nightwing: “They all think I’m the perfect one. But it’s Tim and Jason who’ve had it tougher. I just...I have to make sure they’re okay.”

Batman: ""*calm down, Dick. They are all more than capable. It's amazing you feel so protective, but I think you worry to much. That's my job.*""

Bruce smiles and Dick laughs at him

During patrol, Nightwing randomly practices acrobatic moves to keep himself entertained, much to Batman’s bemusement.

*Nightwing (flipping mid-patrol): “*What? Gotta stay flexible.*”

Batman (grumbling): “*Keep your head in the game.*”

Just then Orphan signals for help on her commlink, and Batman and Nightwing race over to help her. 

The three of them easily dismantle a giant drug smuggling operation together and Bruce proudly puts his hand on Cassandras shoulder and she smiles up at him.

EPISODE 6 : THE CALM BEFORE

 The Batfamily takes a rare night off, spending time together at Wayne Manor. Spoiler, Robin, Orphan, Nightwing, Oracle, and Alfred all gather around, enjoying a peaceful moment before the storm. They reflect on the heavy burden of their roles as heroes.

Each member of the family opens up emotionally. Tim finally admits his exhaustion, and Spoiler convinces him to slow down. Jason’s absence is heavily discussed, with hints that his return is imminent. Batman shares a rare moment of vulnerability with Oracle, discussing his fears of losing more of his children.


Batman: “*I failed Jason. I can’t fail them again*.”

Oracle: “*You didn’t fail Jason. He’s coming back, Bruce. You’ll see*.”



Meanwhile, Orphan quietly listens to everyone, and her bond with the family strengthens. They begin to treat her as a younger sister, offering her support despite her silence.

Tims fatigue is clear and he and Steph share a hug in the library while he studies and they sit together. She takes his coffee and tells him to go to bed and she'll meet in him there.


---

EPISODE 7 : RETURN OF THE RED HOOD

Jason Todd (Red Hood) returns to Gotham, and his reappearance shakes the family to its core. Jason’s relationships with each family member are explored—he respects Nightwing, is protective of Tim, and pretends to hate Bruce while secretly craving his approval. His dynamic with Orphan, in particular, is unexpectedly deep as they connect through shared trauma.

Jason’s nightmares from his death and resurrection are revealed in emotional flashbacks. He tries to maintain his tough exterior, but his vulnerability is clear to those closest to him.




Jason and Orphan bond in silence, sitting together in the Batcave as Jason reflects on his pain. Orphan listens without judgment, her silent empathy breaking through Jason’s walls.

Jason (softly): “*You don’t say much, but...you get it, don’t you?*”

Orphan (nodding): “*...Yes.*”

Jason goes out in his old Robincycle, now customised to suit his new aesthetic. He comes to a full stop on a hill overlooking Gotham. 
The batmobile slowly approaches and Batman gets out.

Jason: ""*thought you'd come. You always come to investigate*""

Batman""*Gotham's a big place. Theres enough room for all of us. Probably room for more. So many districts, no wonder its taken 28 years and theres still little progress. You gonna join us, son*""

Jason has a tear in his eye and silently nods. Batman passes him a bag and they eat burgers together, watching over the city together.


---

EPISODE 8 : BLOOD TIES 

Spoiler confronts her father, Cluemaster, during an intense mission. The encounter is deeply emotional, as Spoiler tries to convince him to turn himself in and leave his criminal life behind. Cluemaster, however, remains committed to his crimes, and Spoiler is forced to make a difficult decision: let him escape or bring him to justice.

Subplot: Tim, who has grown closer to Spoiler throughout the series, is present during this confrontation and supports her emotionally. Spoiler hesitates, torn between her duty as a vigilante and her personal connection to her father. Tim steps in, offering a calm and rational perspective, reminding her that her father’s choices don’t define her.



Spoiler (frustrated, tears in her eyes): “*I can’t do this, Tim. He’s my dad...*”

Robin(gently): “*I know. But he’s also Cluemaster. You don’t have to let him control your story. You can make your own choices.*”



Orphan also plays a significant role, quietly supporting Spoiler as they both share complicated relationships with their fathers. Though she remains silent, Orphan's presence strengthens Spoiler’s resolve.


Spoiler (after a long pause): “*Thanks, Cass. I...needed that.*”

Orphan nods, placing a hand on Spoiler's shoulder, silently offering comfort.



Meanwhile, Nightwing and Batman work on dismantling the criminal network that Cluemaster has aligned himself with. This subplot involves intense action sequences where Nightwing's acrobatic skills are highlighted.


Nightwing (dodging bullets with ease): “*You know, I’m starting to think Gotham’s crooks have terrible aim.*”

Batman (gruffly): “*Focus, Dick.*”

EPISODE 9 : REDEMPTION 


Jason Todd (Red Hood) teams up with the Batfamily to take down a major arms dealer who has ties to Black Mask. Jason's methods, though effective, are brutal, and it causes tension within the team, especially with Batman. Bruce tries to keep Jason from crossing the line, leading to heated confrontations between father and son.

Before the major mission, Tim is at Gotham University, struggling to stay awake in one of his lectures. He’s juggling criminology, biology, and chemistry, and it’s catching up with him. His classmates don’t understand how he manages to stay on top of everything. Tim, nursing his third cup of coffee that morning, takes a moment to text Spoiler during the lecture, joking about needing sleep.



Tim: “**Running on 3 hours of sleep. Again. What’s new.**”

Spoiler (teasing): “**Told you, caffeine doesn’t count as sleep.**”

Tim: “**Tell that to Bruce.**”

Spoiler: “**Let’s get you an actual bed tonight. Your bed, I swear. ;)**”

Tim blushes and looks up from his phone and continues his studies

 The dynamic between Jason and Tim takes center stage as the two Robins work together, each grappling with feelings of inadequacy. Jason feels overshadowed by Tim’s intellect and discipline, while Tim fears he can never live up to the legacy of Jason’s sacrifice. During a mission, they are forced to rely on each other, leading to a begrudging respect.

Jason (sarcastic): “*You’re smarter than me, Drake, but don’t think that makes you better.*”

Tim (calmly): “*I don’t. You were Robin first. You have nothing to prove.*”

Jason (softly): “*Maybe not to you. But to Bruce? Always.*”



Spoiler and Orphan continue to solidify their sister-like bond, with Spoiler offering advice to Orphan about trust and family. Orphan begins to slowly open up emotionally, showing more vulnerability in her interactions with the team.



Spoiler: “*Family’s complicated. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned...we don’t have to do this alone.*”

Orphan (quietly): “*...Family.*”

EPISODE 10 : THE LONG NIGHT

The season finale brings all the threads together as the Batfamily faces off against Black Mask and his army of mercenaries. The climactic battle takes place across Gotham, with each member of the family having a pivotal role. Batman and Red Hood confront Black Mask directly, while Spoiler, Orphan, Nightwing, and Robin work to disable a series of bombs planted throughout the city.

 This episode delves into Batman’s relationship with Jason, as Bruce finally opens up about his guilt over Jason’s death. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Bruce admits that he still blames himself for what happened and that he’s proud of the man Jason has become.



Batman (strained): “*I never wanted this for you. Not this path, not this pain.**”

Jason (angry): “*You didn’t choose for me, Bruce. I did. I came back, and I chose this.*”

Batman (softly): “*And I’m proud of you, Jason. For coming back. For being here*.”



Tim finally finds balance between his academic life and his role as Robin. After defusing one of the bombs with Spoiler’s help, he admits that he can’t keep burning the candle at both ends and decides to cut back on his studies, focusing more on his work as Robin.



Tim: “*I can’t keep doing both, Steph. I need to prioritize.*”

Spoiler (teasingly): “*I thought you liked juggling a hundred things at once?*”

Tim (smiling): “*Not anymore. I’m focusing on what matters.*”



Nightwing acknowledges his place in the family, embracing his role as the older brother and mentor. He shares a heartwarming moment with Orphan, who finally speaks her first full sentence to him.



Orphan (hesitant): “*...Thank you. For...everything.*”

Nightwing (grinning): “*You’re welcome, Cass. Anytime.*”

Nightwing returns to Blüdhaven and Robin cuts criminology, reasoning he doesn't have to do it as he is already a world class detective. 

Cassandra calls Bruce Dad for the first time and his heart melts. 

Steph and Tim go on a date and later on Bruce and Tim sit in the cave drinking coffee, and Tim refuses another cup saying he needs to sleep at some point and Bruce smiles.

Jason patrols a part of Gotham, wearing a Batfamily commlink and mentions a potential lead and Oracle answers him.

The series ends with Bruce in front of his parents graves

As the episode reaches its conclusion, Bruce takes a rare moment to visit his parents’ graves. He reflects on the journey his family has taken, from Dick’s early days as Robin to Jason’s death and resurrection, to the current dynamic with Tim, Spoiler, and Orphan. He quietly thanks his parents for instilling in him the values that helped him build this unconventional family.


Bruce (softly): “*You’d both be proud. They’re strong, resilient... better than I could have ever imagined. I’ve made mistakes. But they’ve saved me from them.*”

1fv7unl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1fv7unl/is_it_a_health_code_violation_to_serve_customers/,Is it a health code violation to serve customers milk that is past its best-by date?,"Hello all. I tried to google the answer to my question but I couldn't seem to find the right keywords, so here I am!

I work as a shift lead (sort of) at a coffee shop. My manager also runs other coffee shops (on a college campus) so I am responsible for making sure the location runs smoothly. Unfortunately, I was sick all of last week, and when I came back to work yesterday I noticed that the other employees hadn't rotated our gallons of dairy milk while I was gone. There were 4 gallons that were a couple days past the ""best-by"" date. I dumped them out, reminded my coworkers (most of whom are brand new) to stay on top of rotating our stock, and moved on with work.

When my manager came in later in the day yesterday, though, she was pretty irritated that I had ""wasted"" the milks. She told me that they would be okay to serve for 3-5 days past that date. I literally said ""but isn't that a health code violation??"" and she didn't answer that question but said it would be fine to keep serving them since people drink ""expired"" milk at home all the time.

I am very concerned about listening to her, not just because that's probably a health code violation (it is, right? Or am I crazy?) but also because she keeps technically-expired milk at her other locations and those employees have served people spoiled milk more than once in the past. I don't want that to happen at our location, too--we're the only location on campus that passed the health inspection with flying colors, and I'd like to keep it that way.

So, am I wrong? Is it okay to serve past-date milk to customers? It *feels* wrong.

ETA: btw, I'm asking because I've never been trained in food safety and this has been my first food service job, so I don't really know the rules",1,1727962364.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.67,False

Like most first meets, we agreed to a coffee date in a public and neutral area. I don't know what was different about him, but I immediately felt comfortable. Desired even - I couldn't ignore the way he was looking at me from across the table. We sat there for hours just chatting away at 8am on a random Tuesday. When we were getting ready to go, he asked me my availability for the following week. I was going to be on a business trip for two weeks. So I decided to ask him if he wanted to spend a little more time with me that day instead. I had a hotel room that week, and invited him - impulsive and risky, I know. 

I've been traveling to his town all year for work and staying at the same hotel. So I became pretty close with the hotel staff ladies at the front desk and bar - figured they'd be my witnesses if something happened to me lol. 

But as soon as we got in the room, he literally grabbed my waist and kissed me all over. One thing led to another and we ended up in the bedroom. We took a meal break and then just kept going. It was like we were both deprived. It was EXHILARATING. We both had to get back to work, so we said our goodbyes and went out separate ways. He ended up texting me the evening before I was supposed to leave - asking to see me again.

We've been chatting almost every day and meeting at least every week for almost a year. We've had several overnights at this point too. He's an amazing man and makes me feel like an amazing woman. We've made it clear from the beginning that we aren't looking to change our situations - and we are both still happy with that. This is the first AP I've had who fulfills every need I've been missing. There's something relieving about having a relationship with a man who has absolutely no ties to my personal or professional life.

So now when I think back about my one rule - I'm glad I broke it for this man. I know there's probably a little bit of luck mixed in there too. But I can't be more thankful for such an amazing AP.

1fv7p3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1fv7p3i/extreme_lethargy_cant_figure_out_if_it_was_from/,Extreme lethargy - can’t figure out if it was from dex,"Evening, all! 

For context: I’m on Vyvanse (40mg) with aspen dexamphetamine to supplement the dosage. I used to be on 50mg Vyvanse til the shortages. I take Vyvanse daily but not exactly regularly (time-wise). Usually I don’t take dex during the day unless I’m trying to get work done, but I’ll often take it either in the two hours it takes for Vyvanse to kick in or in the afternoon/early evening when Vyvanse is wearing off.

So, I’ve been a bit stressed over a (very) overdue assignment that’s been kicking my ass recently. It’s 10 days overdue and Monash says after 7 days is a fail, so I’m trying to finish and submit it as soon as I can so I can try chase up a medical certificate for spec con.

This arvo I finally managed to make really good progress on it, and I finally felt somewhat confident in my ability to finish the assignment. I’ve really been struggling with finishing it. Anyway, I noticed my attention begin to wander after a period of hyperfocus, and I given it was around 7pm I figured it was time to go eat dinner and have a small break. So I went and ate dinner, chilled for a bit, then tried to go back to work — key word, tried.

I still couldn’t focus, so I popped a dex and made myself a single shot, very watered down coffee. The coffee thing is a ritual I’ve done for a long time when I know I’ll need to settle down and smash out an assignment, and usually it works. I sometimes wonder if I’ve Pavlov-ed myself into associating coffee with work. Anyway, I popped a dex and sat with my coffee and tried to work.

Next thing I know, an overwhelming wave of lethargy - complete and utter exhaustion - overwhelms me. I just kinda sat there because even moving a muscle felt like it would take herculean effort. My brain felt like mush. 

So like, I genuinely can’t remember what time I took the dex. I know it was after dinner, so some time after 7:30. I texted a friend a little after 8pm immediately after sitting back in front of my laptop, so I assume I took the dex around 8pm. The wave of exhaustion happened around 9:30-10pm. I wondered if it was maybe the dex wearing off? But that can’t be right, it only would’ve lasted an hour, an hour and a half then.

I get tired when I get hot, Vyvanse makes it so I can’t regulate my body temp as easily, and I’d put on my oodie for comfort purposes, so I wonder if I just overheated? But look, I don’t have the best sleep schedule and I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bone-deep exhausted as I did then. There’s still a dull ache behind my eyes from that moment.

I’m trying to shake it off, because I really wanted to get this assignment in by tonight, but after that episode I don’t have much faith I’ll be able to type a thousand words in an hour, when it took me 5 hours this afternoon to write 800 words and that was the most progress I’d made all week. 

Honestly really not sure if it was the dex that caused the lethargy, but it feels like the thing that makes the most sense. I don’t think it was the coffee - the coffee thing is more of a ritual. Firstly, it’s a single, watered-down shot. Secondly, I take a couple sips but I never finish it. I rarely drink more than half, and today was no exception. I usually take a couple sips, put it to the side and it goes cold while I finish my work. Though, on second thought, coffee does sometimes make me tired (when I haven’t taken meds). But never like this, and I couldn’t have taken more than like, 3 sips. And it’s definitely not the first time I’ve had coffee and dex or coffee and vyvanse at the same time, and I’ve never had this problem. 

Yeah, I don’t know. Sometimes it feels like dex works miracles and other times it feels like it doesn’t help at all. Plus, sometimes it feels like it takes an eternity to kick in and wears off far too quick. Anyone else have a similar experience, or have any advice for making the most of dex?

And on a side note, any advice for finally getting myself to finish this assignment? I’m over halfway done now, and while I won’t be getting it in tonight (rip my dreams of getting it in before it was more than 10 days overdue), I really do NEED to get it in by tomorrow, I don’t even know if my GP will give me a medcert or if spec con will accept it. would be a bit of a waste if i spent 11 days stressing about how overdue it is and failed anyway because spec con wouldn’t give me an extension.

I’m still a bit shaky and tired, even an hour later. There’s pressure behind my eyes and as much as I’d like to sleep, I know I need to work on this. Any tips? 

On a side note, I did not take dex and the coffee at the same time. I took dex before I made the coffee, and I made the coffee maybe half an hour after I took the dex at least.

Want to go to a nice grocery store? It's around the corner.

Almost every car is a small hatchback or compact SUV. There are no full-sized trucks in sight, much less a lifted truck.

Cross walks are generally well designed for safety, usually indented into the lane instead of smacked in a busy intersection.

Abundant bike lanes everywhere. Many people zipping around on bikes and escooters.

I'm male in my 30s been drinking caffeine from a variety of sources, mainly green tea and energy drinks, occasionally Coffee but I am not a fan of the taste. I'm 110+ kg I do powerlifting and live a pretty active lifestyle however I drink in excess of 600+ mg of caffeine daily. Sometimes more. I've quite multiple times but I do enjoy the stimulation from caffeine, occasionally I'll go without it on purpose for a few days just to feel it's effect again. Sleep has been awful when I take it too late in the day. Feeling wired but tired, anxious and overstimulated. I've never had any heart troubles, but as I get older I know my luck will run out drinking on occasion 1.2g worth of the stuff in a day. Lol. 

 Typical caffeine side effects but I persist. I've decided now is the time to quit it for good. Not so much because it's having these negative effects but more so how good I feel mentally and physically when I don't take it. Funny how all these horrible feelings I've lived with for a decade I always put down to lack of happiness and dopamine addiction  being part of the adult experience until I quit it and realise the inner child is still there and things aren't as bad as my over-active and tired mind makes it out to be 😂. 

I've tried tapering before but end up just drinking more than the taper amount and having quit cold turkey several times the worst side effects being anxiety, nausea, derealisation/depersonalisation and sleepiness for a few days, usually the headache comes a bit later in the week. Seeing as it's Friday tomorrow I plan to quit cold turkey and live with the tiredness at work and sleep all weekend to get over the initial hump. For those who know quitting caffeine and that afternoon nap that feels like heaven awaits me this coming Saturday and I can't wait.

1fv7got,https://i.redd.it/wgtujqk2kjsd1.png,"Part 4 of 9 Mindfulness Revisited: Advanced Practices for Inner Peace and Well-being ""Mindful Observation""","## Mindful Observation

Let’s explore the practice of Mindful Observation together. This is a beautiful way to deepen your awareness of the world around you, engaging fully with your environment. I’ll guide you through each step to help you experience this practice in a meaningful way.

### 1. **Prepare Yourself**
   Start by finding a quiet space where you can focus without interruptions. This could be indoors or outdoors—wherever you feel comfortable. Take a moment to settle into your environment, allowing yourself to become fully present.

### 2. **Take a Few Deep Breaths**
   Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply, feeling the air fill your lungs, and exhale slowly, letting go of any tension. As you breathe, allow yourself to transition from the busyness of your mind into the stillness of the present moment.

### 3. **Open Your Eyes and Choose an Object to Observe**
   Gently open your eyes and choose an object in your environment to focus on. It could be something simple, like a leaf, a piece of fabric, or even the view outside your window. The key is to select something that you can observe closely and with curiosity.

### 4. **Engage Your Visual Sense**
   Begin by focusing on the visual details of your chosen object. Notice its colors, shapes, and textures. Observe how the light interacts with it—are there shadows or reflections? Pay attention to every detail, no matter how small. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to what you’re seeing, without judgment.

### 5. **Expand to Other Senses**
   Now, bring in your other senses. If you’re observing something you can touch, notice the texture—whether it’s rough, smooth, soft, or hard. If it’s a natural object like a flower, gently smell it and notice its fragrance. If you’re listening to the environment around you, focus on the layers of sound, the subtle and the obvious. What do you hear? How do these sounds make you feel?

### 6. **Notice Your Emotional Response**
   As you continue to observe, take note of any emotional responses or thoughts that arise. Does the object evoke a sense of calm, curiosity, or perhaps nostalgia? Whatever you feel, simply observe it without judgment. This is part of the mindful observation process.

### 7. **Explore with Curiosity**
   Allow yourself to approach this observation with a sense of curiosity, as if you’re seeing this object or environment for the very first time. What new details do you notice? How does focusing on these details change your perception of the object or your environment?

### 8. **Stay Present and Connected**
   Remind yourself to stay present. It’s natural for the mind to drift to other thoughts, but each time it does, gently guide it back to the object or environment you’re observing. The goal is not to achieve perfection but to practice presence.

### 9. **Reflect on the Experience**
   After spending a few minutes in mindful observation, take a moment to reflect. How did it feel to observe so closely? What did you notice that you might normally overlook? How has this practice affected your awareness of your surroundings?

### 10. **Carry the Awareness with You**
   As you conclude your mindful observation, take a deep breath and bring your awareness back to the broader environment. Notice how your body feels, how your mind feels. Carry this heightened sense of awareness with you as you move on with your day, allowing it to enrich your experiences.

### 11. **Practice Regularly**
   The more you practice mindful observation, the more naturally it will come to you. Try incorporating it into your daily routine—perhaps during a walk, while drinking your morning coffee, or even while sitting at your desk. Each time, allow yourself to fully engage with the world around you, enriching your daily life with presence and mindfulness.

By practicing Mindful Observation, you’re training yourself to break free from ""autopilot"" and engage more fully with your surroundings. This practice helps to cultivate a richer, more vibrant experience of life, making even the simplest moments more meaningful.

‘But it’s not even been a week…’ I could almost imagine him saying those exact words to me when he growled back in protest.

“You’re right...But listen, man. You’re dirty. I can feel your presence from here,” I said, standing ten feet away and pretending to cover my nostrils with my finger.

Buster, of course, didn’t care and continued to defy without hesitation.

I put my hands on my hip and sighed. My glance immediately shifted to a hose attached to a tap outside my quarters.

“Tell you what. I’ll make it worth your while. You don’t mind the jet spray, right? In fact, you even tolerate it sometimes,” I said, pointing to the hose located only a few feet away.

“How about a little cooperation now, and I’ll make you your favorite meal a little later?” I asked him, while reaching out to pick a can of chicken liver from the kitchen.

As I dangled the can in my hand, I could see it slowly chipping away at his resolve, his mind grappling with the pros and cons of my new proposal.

A moment later, Buster barked at me twice and slowly made his way out of the house. He sat by the garden tap, ready to receive his bath. 

I took a handful of lotion and began to rub it against his torso to remove all the muck and grime that was sticking to his body.  We had been quite busy lately, guarding the base and conducting multiple patrols along the perimeter every day. The rain a few hours ago certainly didn't help matters, with Buster leaping over puddles of water and actively rolling in the mud to escape the desert heat. I had to use a brush to remove the layers of dirt that had caked all over his body.

It’s been a strange week, to say the least. The days were busy but peaceful, while the nights brought scattered, random sounds. Their origins were a mystery, as they appeared not to originate from the base. But I wasn’t too worried about it, not yet anyway.

There is an air base located a couple of hours away from the facility, and it wasn’t unusual for them to conduct sorties at odd hours in the night. I assumed they were probably testing out some new technology.  

My colleague Joe thought the same thing as well. But we couldn’t take any chances, and we both had a job to do. So we conducted regular patrols around the base just as a precautionary measure.

But deep down, I felt something nagging at me, like I was being watched by someone or something. I couldn’t exactly put it into words.

For a second, I wondered if Buster too felt the same way when I saw him suddenly lift his head up, listening intently with his ears up in attention.

I quickly turned back to check if there was anybody standing behind me, but I found no one. When I turned around to face him again, I saw him looking up at the night sky, his gaze focused and unwavering.  

“What’s it buddy? You see something?” I asked him as I cleared away the foam from his face. Moments went by slowly. And then, just like that, as if nothing had happened, he put his head down and began pawing my leg, urging me to finish his bath. I sighed again and turned on the hose, to wash off all the soap.

He finally looked presentable and I have to admit, his coat glistened beautifully under the moonlight.

Before I could reach for his towel, Buster swiftly moved in to close the gap between us and looked me in the eye dead serious. He then shook his body vigorously, much like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness, and trotted off without bothering to look back.

I laughed out loud as I sat there, drenched in water. I knew I should have seen that coming. However, my smile quickly faded, as it also reminded me of Jessica, my ailing wife.

Before another thought could take shape in my mind, I heard a familiar voice blare across the radio.

“Mike, I need you down here. Get to the post quick.”

It was my colleague Joe and I replied back in the affirmative. I quickly grabbed my gear and signaled Buster to follow after me.

When I reached the post, I saw Joe standing there armed with his rifle. As a seasoned war veteran with two tours under his belt, Joe was a dangerous man and not to be trifled with. But he was also compassionate and wise beyond his years.

“What’s up Joe?” I inquired, as I approached him near the entrance of the base.

“I am not sure yet.  I thought I heard something at a distance. It could well be nothing.” he replied, after a brief pause.

‘Well, we’ve had a lot of that going around all week’, I thought to myself.

He then turned around to look at me. “I want you to run a perimeter sweep first. Then go on patrol again. Take Buster with you” he said, before heading back to his post.

I started the jeep and drove out towards the perimeter. The engine hummed softly as I navigated the rough terrain, with Buster sitting alertly beside me. After finding nothing suspicious during my initial sweep, I decided to broaden my search radius.

A mile into the drive, Buster suddenly started barking, prompting me to stop the jeep immediately. He leaped onto the ground and dashed towards a boulder located a short distance away. I picked up my rifle and cautiously followed after him.

When I reached the spot, I keyed the mic attached to my shirt and said, ""Boss, you need to come see this.""

I knew he wasn’t going to be happy about leaving the guard post unmanned, but I thought he would prefer to come and inspect this himself.

Joe arrived ten minutes later, parking his vehicle next to mine. He walked towards the boulder overlooking a small pond, and switched on his torch to get a better look at the skeletal remains of an animal dumped nearby. Three other animal remains lay next to it, all appearing to be in a similar condition.

“These look like coyotes, probably stopping by to drink water from the pond before they were killed,” he observed, his voice expressing concern. “Did you find them like this?”

“Yes”, I replied. “And they weren’t here when I drove through the same place this morning. I thought it was quite odd to be honest, to find four of them out here all at once in the middle of the desert, that too at this hour.”

Joe simply nodded in agreement.

“What sort of creature do you think did this Joe?”

“I mean it must have a ravenous appetite to chew every sinew of flesh from the bone, and lick it this clean.” I said, leaning in take another look.

“Do you think it could be the Chupacabra or something similar?” I continued, knowing fully well my question was a bit far-fetched, but I had to still get it off my chest.

Joe finally stood up, switched off his torch, and looked around the vast open desert in quiet contemplation.

“This is in fact the fifth sighting in less than a week, Mike, and all have occurred in close proximity to secure government installations. The one before this was even stranger, and happened near a military base, where an old buddy of mine continues to serve.”

“He told me in that instance, the remains belonged to a dog. There were no signs of flesh or connecting tissue from the nasal region to the abdominal section, while the region spanning from the abdominal cavity to the tail bone was left fully intact. The whole thing was carried out with surgical precision, and drew morbid praise from even the medic back at the base.”

""But how is that even possible? What are you suggesting, Joe?"" I asked, surprised by the tone of my own voice and my inability to hide my disappointment upon hearing about it for the first time.

“This is not a hunt for prey, Mike. This is a hunt for attention. Somebody is trying to make a point. And I’d say they are accomplishing their objective.” Joe said.

When we got back to the base, Joe updated the command centre about the new developments. I headed back to my quarters and lay down on my bed. The exhaustion washed over me and I immediately drifted to sleep.

*I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry who was fast asleep on his mother’s lap.*

*In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came in our lane, and rammed into our vehicle causing it to turn turtle.*

*With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin out from the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded and went up in flames….*

I opened my eyes and realized I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It has become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9-year-old kid.

I slowly got off the bed and found my head hurting. I had barely slept since last night’s excitement, and my mood was already beginning to turn foul.

Buster was already awake. I gently patted him on the head as I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil, and turned on the TV.

My attention immediately shifted towards the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.

“Just the kind of news to start the day,”I groaned as I reached for a nearby chair in the kitchen.

‘But what could have caused this?’ I thought to myself a little later, and hoped the damage there was minimal.

I then looked at the clock and set about getting ready for work. I showered, ate my breakfast, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.

Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high-fived as usual, and he began to walk back to his quarters. I settled into my chair, and made an entry in the logbook.

My name is Michael Armesto, a 30-year-old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure area in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium-sized building occupying 7,000 square feet of space.

A 10-meter-high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a few boulder fields and mountains in the distance.

For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times. When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ever had any clue about the kind of work being done here.

Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to open the gates to let them through, once the customary security checks were performed.

These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility until 5:00 PM, and leave by the same bus at the end of the day. In all that time, they never once smiled or waved at me. It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them to not even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.

Anyway, I never took offense to any of that. My job was to provide security to the facility, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.

As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it. A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.

When he arrived at the guard post, I apologized for the inconvenience and Joe simply nodded with a reassuring smile.

As I was about to climb into my jeep, I pointed my finger at Buster and said, “STAY.”.

“Take him with you Mike. She will be happy to see him” Joe said quickly intervening.

“But Boss, I don’t want to leave you here alone after last night.” I protested.

Joe waved his hand dismissively. “Get going Mike. That’s an order.”

“And don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine. Go see Jess and tell her I am rooting for her,” he said, before walking back to the guard post.

I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for lung cancer at St Mary’s Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.

Jess had never smoked once in her life, and for her to go through all this hardship really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far helped me cover most of the medical expenses.

After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.

Buster was standing by the door looking glum. He could see that Jess was unwell. Buster came into my life as a surprise birthday gift from Jess, and he has been a part of our family ever since. The people working at the hospital regularly allowed him inside the premises, knowing fully well that his presence always helped to uplift her spirits.

I came to know from the doctor that Jess had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID complications. While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery within the next 3 days. The surgery alone would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.

I pulled Buster by the leash to tell him it was time to go, but he kept resisting. He wanted to sit by her side for some time, even though she was unconscious and unable to acknowledge his presence. So, I too pulled up a chair and sat beside him. It immediately brought back happy memories of our marriage.

We used to spend our summers going on long drives, visiting natural parks, or idly sitting by the beach, enjoying good food and playing all kinds of sports. Jess and I would also often embark on scenic routes, with no particular destination in mind, allowing the road to guide us towards hidden gems.

Whether it's a visit to a historic village or a hike through a lush green forest, all the shared experiences helped strengthen our bond as a family.

The two of us also enjoyed using Buster to pull pranks on each other. Whenever Jess gave him a bath, she would command Buster to go ‘Shake’ in front of me and I would get drenched in water, leading to fits of laughter all around. It was one of her favorite pranks.

So when I saw my wife on the bed with tubes attached to her mouth, I got the reality check I needed. I stood up from my chair and yanked harder at his leash; he didn’t resist this time and followed after me.

I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions. I had only $2000 in my bank account, and that clearly wasn’t enough.

‘Maybe I could contact an official from the government and apply for a loan?’ I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.

Then, at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.

Yet, I could not spot the base in the distance. Usually, by this time, the floodlights would have been turned on, and the facility would be easily visible for miles.

Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch-black darkness. Something was wrong.

I tried calling Joe on his phone, but he was unreachable. I pressed the gas pedal and drove as fast as I could.

When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open, with no one manning the guard post. The entire building just sat there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling on Joe’s number again. No response.

I then called Joe’s boss, who was stationed in Carson City, to inform him of the situation and possibly request reinforcements. He was unreachable as well.

‘What on earth is going on?’ I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.

I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit, if things turned hostile. I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. After getting down from the vehicle, I softly whistled towards Buster to follow me.

When I walked past the gate and checked the guard post, I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, it was difficult to identify the person clearly, but as I got closer I recognized Joe’s uniform. I ran towards him and turned him around and got the shock of my life. I stumbled back in fear and hit the floor hard.

I don’t know what they did to Joe.

But he was lying there dead! Very dead!

It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted. The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet his uniform looked in pristine condition.

‘How is this even possible?’ I asked myself.

It immediately reminded me of the dead coyotes I found on patrol the previous night.

“Could this all be somehow related? Was this an execution? And was this carried out be the same group of people?” I wondered.

Joe’s rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle. I checked the magazine. He hadn’t fired a single shot.

I then turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility. No one could enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance, was issued an electronic key card to gain access. So I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.

Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first. When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down.

I turned it back on, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.

But the whole facility wore a deserted look. The bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked at the parking lot.

I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward. This was the first time I was setting foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I wasn’t seeing any signs of it.

The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight. All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.

Buster then took off on his own, and dashed towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his fancy and I followed after him. He stopped against a large couch and started barking at me.

I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminum briefcase with blood stains all over it. Someone was obviously holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it underneath as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.

‘Did the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?’

‘Could the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?’

“Are the two countries about to go to war? Is this to be viewed as an escalation,” I wondered.

A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.

I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I saw no point in staying, now that Joe was dead and the facility had also been cleared out. I ran back to my jeep, tossed the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could think of.

Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase, and I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of a telescope inside.

On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright burning Sun with a single eye at it’s center. It also had a name tag attached to it that was labelled Korelo ZX4 – 1969.

The telescope in itself was a strange looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder, and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.

There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counter clockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors, where you could switch back and forth between stations.

The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.

I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eyepiece. With the moon being the only source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing. I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life. I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.

As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left, and the telescope began to zoom in and out.

I could now clearly see the creatures of the desert ….miles away… coming out their holes …looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly… the contours of their own bodies as they moved swiftly across the sand.

As I kept zooming in further, I could also spot the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could not only figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, but also read the number plates on them.

And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And suddenly everything became obscure. It was like staring at a blank wall.

I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the sky, and there were hardly any clouds. I looked into the telescope again, and started zooming back, and my heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering mid-air. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.

Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realized that I was in for an even bigger shock! There were at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.

‘Ok Mike, What else you got?’ I said out loud to myself.

I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again.

The second dot got highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the insides of the spaceship.

The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an X-ray, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one. As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.

Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!

By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed. I turned the right knob one more time.

The last big dot got highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises. Buster who was keeping silent all this while, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn’t stop. It sounded odd and animal like. Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I realized I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.

I think they figured this out as well. Because one of them abruptly stopped speaking, and walked towards a work station, and then punched something on the console.

In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.

I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase and ran towards my jeep. Buster followed after me. I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as I could.",3,1727961214.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

She is quite different than how the rescue/foster described. She’s incredibly fearful (which I am not saying is unwarranted), but it’s been really difficult for all of us. Growling/barking at us (which has gone down a bit) and won’t go anywhere in the house except for our living room rug/under our coffee table (which makes potty time difficult).

At her foster’s home (who she was only with for 5 days which we found out after a kinda rushed adoption), she was with two other foster puppies and an older dog in the home, which I think made her feel a lot more comfortable. I am super worried about her fearfulness with us and it manifesting into reactivity.

I know it takes time for a dog to warm up, but if I’m being honest with myself, I am miserable. The thing is, she’s a really good girl. She goes potty outside and we can leave her alone and she won’t get into anything, although I think that’s a product of her just being straight-up terrified in the house.

She is our first dog (and we've wanted a dog for years now), but we were just not prepared for her extreme fear as she was described very differently and acted very differently when we first met her. We’re being very kind with her, not bugging her, and giving her all the treats, but I am seriously questioning if we made the right decision. I’m crying all the time. I am devastated every single time my husband has to go to work (because I work from home) as I have to sit in the sadness alone. I don't want to eat or do any of my hobbies, it's been a very intense feeling. 

The thing is, the rescue will take her back. I know for a fact there were multiple applications for her, so I know that there would be people who want to take her and she wouldn’t have to go back into a bad situation. I truly think she would do better in a home with a nice older confident dog to show her the ropes. I messaged her foster and she showed me a video of her playing with all the other dogs, and it literally broke my heart because she looked so happy.

I am just venting and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been trying to get in touch with some trainers in my area to potentially come to our house and work with her. I mean, it’s obvious that she really just needs to get her confidence up, but it’s so hard to do anything when she’s terrified of us/everything in our house. 🥹 She seemed so at peace with her foster, and that makes me think it was because she had the other dogs there to make her confident.

I’m really torn between giving it more time for her bond to grow with us (and honestly our bond to grow with her because, although she is so cute and sweet, I am feeling kind of indifferent towards her just due to how sad I am 😞) and contacting the rescue.",2,1727960599.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

&#x200B;

**Is my \[26F\] relationship with my \[29M\] boyfriend over after this incident?**

&#x200B;

I’ll change all the names for privacy, I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend, Miles (29M), for just over a year. Miles is an architect, passionate about his work - constantly sketching and dedicating time to his craft. Overall, our relationship has been great, I genuinely thought he was ""the one."" Recently, though, something happened.

A few months ago, Miles introduced me to Ava at a mutual friend's birthday party. I’d heard about her before and now I got to meet her - she was funny and surprisingly - stylish. As a fashion buyer, we ended up chatting about trends and what's in right now. I never felt weird about her, even though she and Miles have been friends for years. I was sort of glad she was in his life, she seemed like a good influence compared to some of his other friends.

But lately, Miles has been more secretive with his phone, ALWAYS tilting it away from me. I didn’t say anything at first because I didn’t want to be that girlfriend. Last week, I was at his place when his mom showed up, saying her car battery had died, and she needed help jump-starting it. Miles rushed out, saying it wouldn’t take long. He left his phone behind on the coffee table (screen DOWN).

I kept myself busy scrolling through TikTok, but his phone started buzzing repeatedly, I'm not insecure so I wouldn't snoop through my boyfriend's phone but I couldn’t shake my anxiety. After hesitating, I picked up his phone. All I saw were just work messages, making me feel stupid for snooping. But then I checked everything, including the gallery.

What I saw made my heart drop - explicit photos of Ava. Some looked professional, while others seemed spontaneous, but they were all sexual. I felt like throwing up.

When Miles returned, I couldn’t hold back. “Why do you have photos of Ava naked on your phone?”

His reaction was strange, he didn’t freak out or deny it. Instead, he just stared, then said, “It’s not what you think.” He insisted “It’s nothing” and “You’re overreacting,” never addressing my concerns. Eventually, he got defensive, making me feel wrong for ""invading his privacy"". I just decided there and then that I should leave.

He’s been texting non-stop, but I’m too angry to respond. I can’t stop thinking about those photos and can’t eat without feeling sick. Why AVA? Why was she sending him that stuff, why was he even saving them? He can't think I'm that dumb not to find out?

Is this salvageable? What am I supposed to do now?

*“It’s not what you think” is only a valid response if it is immediately followed by the surprisingly innocent truthful explanation that makes total sense once revealed. Failing that, one must assume it IS what you think: you found his wank bank, and Ava is the star.*

&#x200B;

**lordmwahaha**

*This. If it’s “not what you think”, then he needs to immediately follow up with what it IS. He didn’t -because it IS exactly what OP thinks.*

&#x200B;

**francesbabyhouseman**

*Well it all looks clear to me, he’s interested in her, nothing you can do about it  Save yourself some trouble and delete him from your life!*

>OOP: I don't know if I could live with myself not knowing everything that happened between them.

**smallf4iry**

*Don’t worry. You definitely can. Remember wise words from tame impala. The less I know the better*

&#x200B;

**Comfortable-Echo972**

*Do you want to salvage it? And if so why? I could never be with someone I can’t trust. You’ll always wonder every time he picks up his phone and texts, comes home a little late, grows a little quiet. Trust doesn’t come back no matter what people say. What happens is you lower your standards. You go numb. Part of you dies as you bury your head. But the guy who you can trust and who will love you and be loyal is out there and you may miss him by staying with a cheater.*

>OOP: As corny as it sounds it felt different this time, I've dated my share of men before and I assure you this isn't my fear of being single forever speaking, it's more like I genuinely believed he was perfect (that's what I thought at least) we have similar interests and both of us were clingy, that's why this doesn't make sense, when would he even have the time to pull all of this?

&#x200B;

**Update - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

First of all, thank you to everyone who reached out to me privately or responded to my original post. Whether you were understanding or trying to give me a reality check, I genuinely appreciate all of it. I know many of you advised against reaching out to him, but I decided to do it anyway.

I texted him (there were TONS of unanswered messages), and it wasn’t too long before he responded. I invited him to a café we used to get bagels from every Saturday morning to make him feel nostalgic and sad about throwing away our sweet tradition, and partly because I felt a public space would force us to keep things civil. He tried hugging me when he came, but I just wanted to get straight to the point.

The explanation he gave me was honestly confusing. Apparently, he and Ava had dated a few years back? And he thought I’d make him drop her as a friend if I found out? He went on to say that he had deleted her nudes, but because of some storage issue, they were still on his iPad. And when his phone synced with the iPad, the photos got downloaded onto his phone.

This felt like a huge reach, but I decided to play along with it until the next day when I decided to start my own investigation. I found Ava on Instagram through Miles’ following list, messaged her, and asked her to get the story straight.

After about 30 minutes, Ava responded with, ""We never dated.""

Shortly after getting Ava's message, I called her and gave her all the facts. She was absolutely petrified. She said he could not possibly have her nudes. I tried to describe the photos from what I remembered, but she reassured me that not only did she not take pictures like that, there was also no possibility they existed in the first place. I was cautious, but her reaction was convincing.

At that point, I felt like I was going insane. I said goodbye to Ava because this was too much for both of us. I went straight to his house.

When he let me in, I demanded answers and told him to stop bullshi\*\*ing me. That’s when he broke down and admitted the truth. He made AI generated photos with her face. He mumbled something about it being a mistake, but I stopped listening. I just needed to leave.

Avoiding his pathetic attempts to touch or comfort me, I left his place, took an uber home, and spent the rest of the night crying.

He’s been blocked everywhere. He won’t be reaching me again. After I informed Ava about the vile things he had done - she started tearing up. She cried, I cried - it was a mess. I kept apologizing to her. It felt like I had some part in this horrible situation.

The rest will stay private, but I’ll be supporting Ava with whatever she decides to do with this information. I’m just glad it’s over. My friend will be staying over for a few days to help me get through it all. Thank you to everyone who shared kind words and cared. I’m still figuring things out, but I’ll be okay.

**Ok-Willow5217**

*Oh my god he’s a fucking weirdo. How dehumanizing and gross, like I cannot even imagine how he thought this was okay? Sounds like he had some weird obsession with her. Also, the fact that he said “that he wasn’t cheating”, like what do you call making sexual AI photos to jerk off to of one of his friends called? He should be so embarrassed with himself. I hope he stays the hell away from the both of you because this person is not mentally okay and clearly unstable. I had a feeling it was something darker on his end because of how you described her being so nice to you. I feel so sad for you and for Ava. I’m glad you have each other. You are much better off without this freak. Be grateful you saw him for the person that he is so early on and not years down the line! I wish you two girls the best!! Whatever you girls decide to do with this information, I hope it works out and people know what kind of fucked up person he is.*

*Words can't even describe how much of a creep this guy is, and good on you for blocking him and getting him out of your life. This is a violation of trust and privacy of epic proportions, and I can only imagine what Ava is going through right now.*

1fv7632,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fv7632/finding_the_right_armchair_for_your_living_room/,Finding the Right Armchair for Your Living Room: Comfort Meets Style,"An armchair is more than just a piece of furniture—it's a statement that defines both comfort and style in your living room. Whether you’re looking to create a cozy reading nook or add extra seating, finding the right armchair can transform your space. With so many designs, materials, and sizes to choose from, it can feel overwhelming. This guide will help you balance aesthetics with functionality to find the perfect armchair for your living room.

#  1. Consider Your Living Room's Style

Before picking out an armchair, it’s important to take note of your living room's overall aesthetic. Is your space modern and minimalist, or does it lean more toward classic or eclectic decor? For a rustic, laid-back vibe, [rattan arm chairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) can introduce natural textures while adding warmth to the room. On the other hand, if you prefer a more luxurious, elegant look, opt for an upholstered armchair with velvet or leather.

Choose an armchair that complements the design elements already in your living room, whether it's the color scheme, existing furniture, or decorative accents.

# 2. Prioritize Comfort

No matter how stylish an armchair looks, comfort is key—after all, this is where you’ll spend time relaxing, reading, or watching TV. Test out different chair designs to find the level of cushioning and support that works best for you. Look for plush seat cushions, armrests at the right height, and a backrest that provides proper support.

If you're shopping online, check the reviews to ensure that the chair offers both the comfort and durability you need. Pay attention to the materials used for the seat padding, as foam or feather-filled cushions can provide different levels of comfort and longevity.

# 3. Size and Proportion Matter

When it comes to armchairs, size and proportion are critical. Measure the area where you plan to place the armchair to ensure it fits comfortably without crowding the space. The right armchair should harmonize with your living room furniture—neither too large nor too small in relation to your sofa or coffee table.

If your space is limited, consider compact designs with slim arms or outdoor armchairs that are versatile and sleek enough to use indoors. Their lightweight and space-saving features make them a great option for smaller living rooms.

# 4. Choose the Right Material

The material of your [armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) plays a big role in both comfort and aesthetics. Leather and faux leather are durable options that give a sleek, modern look, while fabric armchairs tend to offer more warmth and coziness. If you want an armchair that stands out, consider textured fabrics like boucle, velvet, or even woven rattan for a more organic feel.

For a living room that gets a lot of use, opt for easy-to-clean materials, especially if you have pets or children. Performance fabrics are a great choice for maintaining a clean, fresh look without sacrificing style.

#  5. Focus on Functionality

While style and comfort are essential, think about how you’ll be using the armchair. Will it serve as a reading chair, or do you want it for occasional seating when guests come over? If the armchair will be used frequently, choose one that’s durable and easy to maintain. Armchairs with removable cushions or covers can be ideal for cleaning and upkeep.

For a more versatile option, [outdoor armchairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-armchairs) are designed for both style and durability. These pieces often use weather-resistant materials but can easily be styled indoors, giving your living room a casual yet functional appeal.

# 6. Adding Personality with Color and Pattern

Choosing a bold color or pattern for your armchair can turn it into the centerpiece of your living room. If your space is mostly neutral, a pop of color from your armchair can inject energy and vibrancy. On the flip side, if you already have a colorful or patterned living room, a neutral armchair in a soft beige, gray, or muted tone can bring balance.

Patterned armchairs, whether in stripes, florals, or geometric prints, add a playful or sophisticated touch. Just be mindful of how the colors and patterns interact with your existing decor.

# 7. Don’t Forget the Details

The little details make all the difference when selecting an armchair. Features like nailhead trim, tufted backs, or wooden armrests can enhance the design and elevate the look of the chair. Some armchairs come with built-in ottomans or matching footstools, perfect for those who love to lounge and stretch out.

Also, consider the type of legs or base your armchair has. Tapered wooden legs can give a mid-century modern vibe, while metal or chrome legs can offer a contemporary look.

Finding the right armchair for your living room is all about balancing comfort, style, and functionality. Whether you’re drawn to the natural elegance of rattan arm chairs or the versatility of outdoor armchairs, make sure the design suits your lifestyle and complements the overall look of your space. With a little consideration, you can find an armchair that not only enhances your living room but also becomes your favorite spot to relax.

1fv75ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/seducingwomen/comments/1fv75ss/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Good morning all! I hope everyone is doing well and getting through the work day! I’m here enjoying my second (maybe third?) cup of coffee and would love some company. Join me and let’s be friends or soulmates or whatever we become!

A little about me. I’m a tall, glasses wearing brown haired guy working in the legal field, though I don’t get into any courtroom dramatics. My username here comes from my cinematic hero and all around icon Elle Woods. I enjoy my job, which is mostly research and writing, but I think some people might think it’s boring.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading and enjoying nature. I’m always up for a book recommendation or a good hike. I love to bake as well, though I’m definitely not ready for the tent yet. I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I’m too big a LotR nerd. I speak two languages with various degrees of “this would offend a native speaker,” guess what they are! (One might be more obvious!)

Если вы говорите по-русский, давай говорим! Но я говору очень плохо по-русский.

1fv6zyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1fv6zyc/dad_age_72_wants_to_die/,Dad age 72 wants to die,"I've pondered my first post hear for months now but never have the energy of trying to set it all down. So this is going to be quick and possibly not complete, but it's a start. 8 months ago my dad, age 71, previously healthy (relatively), strong and very very independent went to hospital for the first time ever and hasn't been home since. He was ventilated for 2 months for pneumonia and aki. After he woke up he suffered a haemorrhagic stroke and underwent successful surgery. He went to rehabilitation hospital with limited success and came down with infection and back to hospital and ventilated again. He has now been taken off the ventilator but his swallow hasn't came back. The doctors have told us he will need 24 hour care and possibly 2 people to care for him, hoist etc. He needs help with everything and right now and we hope for improvement but don't expect it. At the moment, some days his speech is OK, some days not. His cognition isn't great at all. His mood hasn't been great throughout all of this trauma but they are working on it. The problem is, since he woke up back in April, and realised his new state in life he has just wanted to come home but the hospitals weren't haply for him to come home, as they aren't now which I understand. They want him to go back to rehab when he's medically stable which won't be for a while. Dad has often said he wishes we'd have left him to die etc which is hard to hear.

As time has past, and especially seeing how the last infection weakened him to the point of icu admission, our hopes of recovery aren't as strong as they were. The doctors have had many tough conversations about how the intubation is weakening him and we can't repeatedly do it and to think about end of life care if he gets so ill he needs icu again. Now, this scares the life out of me. But in the last few days my dad has said he is dying, and he wants to die. He is very low. He is miserable in hospital setting and we have been told we won't be able to care for him at home even though we really do want to try as we think he will be happier there but he won't be ready to go home for a long time.

There's so much more I could say but I'll leave it here and maybe add more later or clarify anything. Im struggling to end this post. I dont know what im looking for.  I suppose what I'm  wanting is to know is, is it a bit risky to take his word for it that he wants to be dnr?  The best life we could hope for is that we have nursing care help us at home and myself and sister fill in most of out spare time helping and bringing him for walks, massage, coffee, meals out, watching movies. This is the best case but don't even know if it's possible. Is it unreasonable to want him to want to live for that? He wears a pad, right now he's bring fed through a tube, he needs a hoist to be moved. His speech and cognition are both not great and he has lots of different problems which required lots of monitoring and appointments. Are we actually being selfish. I just feel awful he never came back home. I read a lot of people here who's parents are suffering and are younger but 71 seems so young.  He is now 72 but was 71 when hospitised.

My mam is the same age and was diagnosed with cancer and has been undergoing treatment the last 6 months. Her prognosis is good though, I think and hope. Her scan is in a few weeks so we will know more then. She isn't as strong as she once was so definitely know she will need lots of help.

The dealer performed a fresh cool treatment, where they pushed a foam/chemical through the evaporator case, but unfortunately, the unpleasant smell has returned. I recall that they also changed the cabin filter during my last service.

What else should I ask the dealer to check in order to resolve this issue? Additionally, I remember spilling coffee on the floor carpet about a year ago, and it took several days to clean it thoroughly. Could remnants of that spill be contributing to the odor?

I love him more than anything and he is by far my favorite person to exist. We did long distance for the first 3 years of our relationship as we met during covid and he was just starting college as I was in my 2nd year. Fast forward to this past January, we live about 10 mins away from each other (both still living at home to save money) so we get to see each other whenever we want. Now I would like to start with the fact that I think him and I have a bit of a unique relationship. We share so many different hobbies together, some that we started together and others that one of us had started and the other joined and we both love doing them together (ie hiking, rock climbing, biking, running, etc..). I love doing all of these things with him but I feel like that’s the only thing our relationship is built on… It’s gotten to the point where in our 4.5 years of dating I don’t think we’ve ever had a weekend together where we weren’t doing one of those things. Anniversaries revolve around it, birthdays will always have one of the hobbies planned in it, and idk it almost feels like the romantic aspect of our relationship isn’t there… i like to think our sex life is okay, i mean he’s very busy with work rn but we probably get to be intimate 2x a week. I’ve mentioned to him before that i’d appreciate him being more romantic towards me and he said he’d work on it but I haven’t seen any changes.. The only time he buys me something is either christmas, my bday, or our anniversary. And don’t get me wrong the gifts are always nice but they are always for one of the hobbies we do lol. I’m not asking him to drop hundreds on me on a random Tuesday, but idk I feel like if he were to just buy me a coffee or like even one single flower or something as a surprise those little actions go a long way for me. He’s never really asked me out on a “date” either. Typically when we go out to eat it’s whatever is convenient on the drive home from one of our hobbies. And again, I don’t expect him to spend a lot of money on a big dinner, hell I’m a cheap date I’d be happy going to a goddamn diner together, it’s just the point that he never asks is what makes me upset. And whenever we go to hangout during the week if I ask it’s always a “its up to u” and idk to me that feels like he’s uninterested.. Like i said, he’s great and I love him and he’s easily the nicest guy I’ve ever met, I just feel like he doesn’t put in enough effort sometimes and it gets me upset… AITAH?",4,1727959770.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

I (30M) have been in a relationship with my gf (26F) for about a year. We moved in together about 3 months into the relationship. She is studying and doing some part time work on the side, making about 700-1100 monthly. I have a very good career and make about 10x what she does and have been paying for everything thus far: rent, utilities, car (which she sometimes uses), food (we mostly eat takeaway), vacations, dates, etc. She sometimes pitches in for a coffee or buys some groceries, but rarely. I do my laundry, she sometimes does it for me too, I do a majority of the cooking or order in, take out the trash. I get a maid in once in a while to clean up, which I pay for too.

I have been feeling that this isn't a fair way to split responsibilities. 5 months ago I asked her to put more effort in, by either pitching in some amount (200-300 USD, when rent + utilities is 1400) or by taking on the responsibility of keeping the house clean (either doing it herself or paying for a maid). She said she doesn't want to be my 'servant', which felt off, because what am I then - a wallet? It isn't about the financials here as I can fully pay for everything and have a bunch left over, I just feel like we aren't putting in an equal amount of effort into our household and day-to-day.

She does clean the house now, except for the room where I work, but constantly complains that she has to do it. She doesn't do it well either and the house ends up being quite disorganized after, I try to gently suggest alternative ways of organizing things, but she doesn't take criticism well. At one point I just took it upon myself to fully reorganize the apartment, throw out old boxes, and useless garbage, and labeled where we should put things. I feel bad about it and honestly makes it feel like I'm 'forcing' her to do this and we keep coming back to the same argument, with her saying I make enough to pay for a maid so why not do it. Sometimes I order a maid in again to just help her.

I am seriously considering breaking up with her, as it feels like I'm putting in a lot, with very little gratitude and reciprocity. I get that she is currently quite busy with university and part-time work, but I feel exhausted and used.

**TLDR:**

After Suggestions on a android based, compact & light device with physical keyboard, landscape orientation. Akin to galaxy tab + keyboard case but smaller. I've seen a second hand Planet Computers Communicator/Gemini online but they are not so common I can get a hands-on or can get a users opinion on if its actually good. 

**Needs:**

External physical keyboard (ideally part of the unit and not Bluetooth)

Portable

Android (obviously) and work profile capable.

**Like to have:**

Phone sized (goal is pocket sized)

**Background:**

 I work in the Uk for a US firm and a lot of my morning I tend to whizz about doing the chores while I wait for my team to log in. Sometimes I can head out and about locally etc, but im always aware that I might need to rush back if something comes in ""overnight"". If this happens, I need to be able to access my work android profile, take teams calls, access a application i work in (that works via a chrome window well on android). 

Currently I tend to carry my laptop but its large and bulky and its not often i need to use it, but i feel i have to carry it should i need to fire off longer emails or get into a work system and start doing some heavier work where screen typing slows me down compared to a real keyboard.

I use my Samsung fold 3 as a daily driver.  but it has the battery life of a mayfly. What id like is a android device so I can work of the android work profile with a physical keyboard suitable for typing out longer messages/work - something i can carry as a just-in-case and can set down in a coffee shop to  cover the odd item, rather than be salve to carrying a full desktop.

  
**Things ive tried:**

I have a galaxy tab5 + keyboard but for what ever reason, this flat refuses to join my work profile. Its also a bit bigger than id like, i would like something pocketable / phone sized. That said if anyone has had success in using work profiles on similar devices id be interested to hear. IT are just as baffled on this on and are not sure why it didn't work.

Ive considered Bluetooth keyboard and a prop stand for my phone, but the fold is crap for battery, and id prefer a self contained device.  I know myself well enough (ADD and forgetful as shit) that ill forget to bring it as an accessory, versus a all in one device.

Ive also seen the Gemini and Communicator from planet computers second-hand which are about my price point, but have no experience of the brand. The communicator was the device that got me thinking about getting a device like this, but trying to google alternatives mostly arrives at Chromebook or tablets which i may ultimately have to come around to one way or the other, but im really hooked on the idea of something super small form factor as a break-glass if shit hits the fan and want to pull a device out of my pocket and get going - rather than having to lug a bag around on the off chance i'm needed, or faff with a Bluetooth keyboard, keeping it charged etc.

  
Pardon the long post, and thank for hanging around if you got this far. Look forward to suggestions!

That's an exert from Rudyard Kipling's ""The Disciple"". I read it reading a biography of Karl Marx when I was 19. I'm neither here nor there on communism. I think you do the right thing or the wrong thing and I think if you don't stay strapped to one idea or one ideology and you can think quickly you'll forever grow and help the growth of others. In our society we have people on the right wanting to vote for fascist parties. Do you understand that in concept, voting, is liberal? Fascists do not allow you to think. You do as your told. Therefore by voting for a far right party, you are being a part of the left. If we trash the ideas of some ridiculous notion that whatever is most helpful for our countries and our world is solely attributed to one idea then I think we will become so much stronger, rather than tipping the scales every four years. We should not be playing with our countries, our economies, like it's a bit of fun because people like to be right in an argument. Our country shouldn't always be in an argument. It should be collusion. Until the day I die whilst we are confined to these systems I will spoil my ballot, or I'll vote Labour, Green, or Liberal Democrat. My mum accosted me in a drunken argument when I was in my early twenties for not voting. She said people have died for our right to vote. Hundreds of millions of men and women have died for our right to vote, so if I do not believe in our system, I should spoil my ballot indicating I have no faith in our current structure. It really got through to me and since then I have either voted Green or Labour. I tried to vote in the last election. I wanted to vote Labour. They told me that although I was registered to vote, I was not registered to vote in the address i'd just moved to. I couldn't vote at my old address, because it would mean that it would not have been my current address. My name needed to be on the sheet of paper they had. Why do we have an age old archaic system with regard to voting? My name isn't on a physical piece of paper? I do not understand why you can't show up, with your UK ID, after registering to vote and vote. If you register online, why does my name have to be on a piece of paper? They should be able to search your name in the polling station, see your information, look at your ID, and you should be able to vote. Why are we voting like it's the fucking 30's? You should be automatically registered to vote when you're 18. You should have to update your voting record every time you update your passport or drivers license so the picture matches your most current physical state. You will have to ask why they make it so difficult.

I believe the above quote and the is a way of littering a poem with religious remarks, so as to put it to the people of the church that the origin of an ideology, or the prophets of our religions are not the problem. It is the people that follow them, not because they believe them, but because they want to be on the winning team who later in life take said ideologies or prophetic teachings and use it for their own personal gain. They seem to be trying to claim I am an undercover Tory. It is and it will always be ""middle finger fuck up like fuck the tory party"". It will never be anything else. You wanna believe someone is falsely interpreting my stories for their own personal gain, be my guest. cough. You're going to absorb that many shots to your culture whilst believing i'm secretly one of you that it's going you're going to burn you over and over again. I don't know how I can make this any clearer. Fuck the tories. Fuck fascists. Fuck that side of the scale. It never was, it never has been and it never will be. Just like a 7up.

I had a thought when I was swimming yesterday. I think part of our issue with creating so many laws regarding not being able to fire people is because of how so many people view leaving a job. If you're fired from a job, you will fight to keep a crap job because you think it is embarrassing to be fired. I don't understand this concept. If I'm fired from a job it's because I didn't want to be there/ I rejected their notions of what employment should be. I did not like their systems. We seem to have a whole system where if someone takes allegations, which are obviously true, we protect them with a bunch of laws so they don't get fired or removed from being famous or popular. If you want to read Charles Manson, I don't give a fuck. If you want to read about Ghandi, I don't give a fuck. It should be an individuals choice.

For some reason, the people of Nottingham have thought me to be some sort of undercover. I think this is because I pulled out some copper wiring twenty years ago and I've done it again recently. You show me a rat fed manipulating addicts, homeless people and the elderly, i'll pull your fucking card you rat fuck. They want to paint me in the same manner of the photos i've taken of them. My people are my people. I'm not having them being manipulated by supposed ""Robin Hoods"" whilst they're part of the government and the church who are trying to kill us for being poor. Being poor is nothing more than having the controlling class not like you. They created currency so as to share it amongst them and their friends and keep it from us. They sent their knights to our farmland to destroy our crops so we had to work for them to buy food. These supposed ""Robin Hoods"" now tell us to sell drugs to our kids so we resign them to being addicts or we change their neuro chemistry so they will be easier to enslave. They tell women to rent themselves to the rich and be used up until they overdose or become one of them. They get us to waste our lives in pointless jobs so they can sit around and go on holiday and call it enforcing ""foreign policy"". They're all in on it together. They do not want whats best for us. They are going on holiday and deciding who has the best idea with which to enslave us en masse, with the money they make off our broken backs. They started calling me an undercover I believe because when I was in employment at a credit card company, I talked to my friends about the absolutely disgusting and abhorrent tactics they used to collect their debts. They targeted poor people with their advertising, taking interest on the top of the loans each month. They say its your fault, your fault for being poor. They charge you when you can't afford to pay, even though they make a tonne of money off everyone's interest and investing that. They told us in training that if someone tells you they're suicidal when you request them to make a payment towards their balance, you should believe they're lying and proceed to get a payment...You should intentionally barrage them with calls, under withheld numbers and use shady tactics in order to procure your payment. They also implored you to use google maps to view their property. They did not give a reason for you to do this. Why, would you ever need to view someone's property when the job is debt collection over the phone? I wonder. I wonder, if debt collectors would take addresses in Nottingham, go to their properties and turn screws and repeatedly call those people...I wonder if they would take the address, talk about the view of the property and use metaphor to indicate they were outside the property. Imagine if you were suicidal and you had children, that your children were all that was holding you together and somebody indicates that they are outside your property with a weapon, when they are not. What might you do? You might make a payment taking food or shelter out of your kids mouths. You get £120 a week to feed yourself and your family, and they want £69 of that to pay off a card you took out when you were working, and they're indicating to someone struggling to keep their kids fed that they're about to break into your house and assault you. That would be speculation. I can only tell you what I infer from their methods of training. I told people this out drinking. I told people I thought it was disgusting. They fired me after not long and within a couple of years their building was reduced to a third in size. If i'm an undercover, it has never been intentional and it never has never been under the premise of working for these disgusting pieces of shit.

Whilst I was working in the catering industry, I decided that I was going to do a project on how kitchens ran. I'd seen such horrendous behaviour that I thought people needed to know it was not just a bit of ramsey raising his voice at you. I worked in one kitchen where two people that worked at the same time topped themselves. One had a family. One was gay. Someone else got stabbed to death. He was from meadows and grew up around gang life but was a nice guy. Always had time to talk to me, go out of his way to say hello and was always polite. Every time we went for a drink we had fun. After he got stabbed, I was upset. I was told in a coded manner, that he had a knife on him. You have created the circumstances with your methods of hypnosis which cause children to be that scared they think they need to carry a weapon, and then you use military organisations to murder them? I don't know what happened to any of the other staff members that worked there at the time as I didn't keep in touch after leaving. I would assume if they haven't felt what I've felt, that they are a part of this. The place was called ""receipts"". It reminded me of an old show on itv. It was there where I started to enjoy working in a kitchen, for sure. But what I enjoyed was standing up to the abuse, both physical and psychological, including having knives and metal trays thrown at me, hot oil intentionally poured into my boots, being spiked...I could go on for hours. Standing up to them and being moved around meant I was one of the only members of the kitchen that could run multiple sections by myself if I needed to and I could work everywhere. If the KP was fucked, i'd help the KP. The majority of people that become head chefs, don't want people that help people struggling. They want them to either sink or swim and the majority of the time due to the abuse that they faced, they want to see people sink. They take it as a trophy to have someone with kids to murder themselves. There's a conversation I had with Alina that started in Aspen. I mentioned that someone sat at our table had taken ten sips on their beer and the liquid level hadn't moved. That he went to the toilet, came back and the majority of it was gone. I told her that I thought they were pretending to drink to take advantage of people that were drunk. A few days later we discussed this sober. She lead me down a path discussing how different crops were not yielding the same results as they need to. I equated it to an over population issue, from the soil being drained from over farming and producing too much food. She told me that there are people in the world that since a convention held after world war 2, where they agreed the world would never resort to war in the same way, they would need to keep populations down using other methods. These people often have hundreds of properties. They have acres of land that get put to use as gardens or grounds for hunting foxes. Drive out to Mansfield. It is unused field after unused field. They have chemicals and fertiliser that can regenerate soil in an instant. They convince people that can be led down their paths, attempting to manipulate their brain waves into believing their bullshit. They want us to live confined to high rise flats and terraced houses which are essentially chicken coups so as to have us believe there needs to be a population reduction, not that they need to give up their land and their wealth. They turn us against each other. Alina, you told me i'd forget the conversation, in which you began to discuss hitler positively. In which you told me that people pretend to drink and do drugs so they can manipulate people. Do you think there is anything else I've forgotten? I told you a long time ago you were going to eat your parents. Who do you think I was talking about? Your grindr addicted father and your sour mother? I couldn't give a fuck about your mason family. Check me being all gay and that. I met your dad in Sneinton market. He didn't see me, but I watched him. I heard he works at the most expensive private school in Nottingham now. Queen Jessy, hey? I heard queens move where they like. Hearing that you stay confined to your house unless you have back up or a mask and a weapon, doesn't surprise me. I rolled outlast night with my hood down for all to see. Did you like my cat calls? Why don't we call you king. king alina of the bag collectors.

I really do care about balance. Lets see how this balances out after the scales have been tipped in your favour for so long. And yo mr sass. You threatened me last night with a fight? I'll put my hands behind my back and stick my chin in the air for you, like I did the day I met your rat son. You think I see what I see and i'd let someone as basic as you pull my card. We're here now g. Wouldn't you rather shoot a middle eastern child in the back? Wouldn't you rather get African and Asian immigrants over here so you know their infrastructure so you can go over and ruin their water supply and their societies? Hearing you chat about womens rights when you discuss these countries is fucking hilarious. Chat that shit you rolling joke. You applaud the suicide of a woman for speaking on how the church set up a system in order to kidnap children from their working class and impoverished mothers so as to sell them to the rich. Yeah, yeah, womens rights. Sure. I know you're reading this Jerry, and your kids are riding for you right now. How would they feel if they knew you and your family have been the ones selling the cocaine to their parents in order to kidnap them for you, someone who ruined your sperm count doing the same amount of said drug. You disgusting, rat pieces of shit, I will see you burn. You're trying to trick me into a physical fight so you can use weapons against me. You believe that me already being a decent fighter, that if you gave me false training in kickboxing and Brazillian Ju Jitsu which I would gravitate towards after being attacked my multiple assailants that I would believe I needed these methods of self defense. You thought that i would then be considered a weapon and therefore you could use a gun or a knife? I told you I stopped playing chess when I was 6. Use your words bruv. Use your words. From my knowledge, you've exhausted them over the last twenty years. Pull my card. Let's take it to the judge. You're trying to make me think if I tell someone i'm not fighting them physically, that it's going to make it look like i'm weak and i'm backing down. We won't back down. And i'm drawn out when i'm drawn out. Test me. Test me you rat sas-sy fuck. And listen the only accolade I hold is an orange belt in Karate I got when I was seven or eight. And if I back down, it doesn't mean everyone would back down. And I don't instruct shit. You think that laptop was smart do you? I robbed you again, and you're not going to be able to use it.

A couple of years ago I'd been out of work for about seven months. I'd been doing agency work since I got back to Nottingham. It was when I was living in the third house I lived in in the Arboretum that I began talking about at the start of the story. Agency work was just better for cheffing with how my mind works. I'd be working for a three star chef for a couple of months learning how to make duck egg basil oil (really green, and plenty of wine), then in an old folks home for a couple of months making food for people that thought ragu is super far out man. I got a bad hip/back injury two years in a row. One time i'd been doing lunges and I felt something ping in my back. I had a back injury working in a warehouse from when I was in my early twenties that had always plagued me and that coupled with this new injury meant I couldn't walk for a few months. It returned the year after however this time I just woke up with the injury. I got put on opiates and I drew a couple of pictures with bubbles and lines. What did I tell you about manipulating my shit. When I had said injury, at the beginning I thought the painkillers would still allow me to get around the kitchen ok. I went to work in an amazon in Mansfield. They put a huge factory there. Apparently it was killing the education system around there because people were going to earn money in the factory believing they would get decentish pay straight off the bat and over the course of the time it would take to go to college and university they would be in the same position financially, with regard to the debt you're in and how long it would take you to get to the same mark. I never did either. I never stayed in any career and I didn't go any further then a few months in any college. Pull my card g. The chefs at amazon didn't like me. They especially didn't like that they were paying me more than the head chef was getting and they were paying me taxi fare to get there each day. They cut off my employment after two days and a week later they didn't pay me. Something to do with a sticky toffee. I queried it with the agency i'd been with on and off for about 7 years. The guy I usually talked to about issues wasn't there, so I had to talk to some other prick. He refused to help and said that they were refusing to pay. I told them then they needed to pay me. Eventually they stopped replying to my emails and repeatedly told me there was no one available to speak to. Sometimes you have to switch styles. I'd quit caffeine and sugar at the time. It meant that they hit me pretty hard like i'd taken a drug when I did them. If I leant into the pain, it meant I stumbled and limped. As I showed you in the gym, I could bite my tongue and walk normally for as long as I wanted and still go round to the house. Apparently I can walk that far I could pass the marine entrance exam with flying colours. So I waited until the streets were quiet from traffic. I put on three different outfits. Whenever I've done this I choose three opposing outfits and I took props. I found an empty beer bottle in the trash and I filled it with a couple of shots of coffee and about four spoons of sugar. The top outfit I used old battered clothes that made me look like an alcoholic and an old beanie I didn't think was mine. Looked like something an old man would wear. I used a pair of shoes I never wore and I strapped a pair of trainers and a baseball cap to my stomach using tightly wrapped cling film and a delivery bag. I put a lightweight hoodie with the hood tucked in as the second outfit. I took a cycling mask and a covid face mask and a pair of cheesy sunglasses and i stared at my feet the whole time, manipulating different walks. Heavy weight on one leg, switching from pidgeon foot to duck foot. Underneath I had a posh student outfit. Everything I had on were either gifts that I never returned but would never wear, stuff I took from my grandad when he passed or shit I bought from primark that had been ragged out. I had a pair of shorts on underneath trackies that were over jeans. I took a different pair of socks. I walked a distance in the first outfit and got to a forest to be shielded from the cctv and changed. I stuck to the side of the exit of my house so I was shielded from the cctv by the bushes and semi hugged the wall walking with a drunk stagger. I figured if I returned home calmly in a different outfit but I left in an outfit and they couldn't see where I left from they couldn't prove shit. By the time I changed I moved faster and i'd finished the caffeine and sugar. I'd made sure i'd gone an unusual route so it didn't look like i'd gone 1,2,3. I'd taken a bike lock with me. The first outfit I took a carrier bag with me so it fitted the look of an alcoholic homeless person. Within the carrier bag was a rucksack I never used. I swapped what I needed and dropped what I didn't. When I got to the building of the agency, I used my motorbike lock on the electric gate they used to lock their car park. It was a tall metal gate, about twelve feet and it ran about ten metres across. I knew that this would mean in the morning when they pushed the buzzer to open it, it would be locked and that these types of locks would take a phone call to the police or a bike shop to sort. I sprayed a message on the side of the wall. I forget what it said..Brain damage they said...This was maybe the fourth or fifth time i'd done something like this. The police were behind me getting out of a riot van when I finished spray painting. But we were in fields. And they don't let cops in fields so they don't know where the one way streets and allys lead you like i do...I can show you, so you don't get lost. I sprinted through the barriers making it a one way street. Vehicle couldn't follow. I took a left so I was downhill. I took a right and a left and I stripped off the top outfit quick and dashed my shit in a bag and launched it through about ten gardens. I put on my new trainers and I rolled out. I went home. On the way home, I used a tool I bought from a bike shop to let the air out of two tyres on the car of a prick. I figured if I just did one they'd change the tyre. If I did two they'd be stuck. Probably have to call aa. How ironic. I figured they kept popping the tyres on my bikes about once a month and stealing the lights. Eye for an eye is it not? You think you got me back on the eye for an eye shit do you. We'll see about that. I reference my story, ""the disapearing eye"".

You think you're speaking of the devil. You talk of one life. You think that you're strong, fast and organised. I showed you my drunken master style after you showed me yours. I know you saw through my mask. Luchadors never confused me. Do you remember? Do you remember like i remember? Because from knowledge when i spoke to you the day after an event your story was different and when i told you to your face what it was you looked shocked and remembered it was my way. Not yours. And it's always going to be this way. Are you still telling people i'm crazy? Full of nonsense? You might be right on that one. I have indeed always had good sense. There's never been anyone i hit that wasn't who i wanted to hit. There was no apology like with you when i grabbed your balls. I heard they only come back now when you ram a needle up your arse. Did you think telling me so and so was so and so's ex partner or so and so was manipulating my x account i'd hit them? I'm sure i'll see you soon. Pull my fucking gym card. Twat.

Subject: Murder Trial Donation-Abby&Libby

 

Good Morning!

 

My name is Redacted, the Chief Probation Officer in Carroll County, Indiana. I also own a small business in our community. I have been authorized, as the small business owner, and a trusted member of the court, to take on the task of arranging the feeding of the family and law enforcement during the Richard Allen Murder trial of Abby & Libby. 

 

It is going to take a significant amount of money to feed 70 law enforcement officials and the 25 members of the family of the murdered girls every day for one month!  Feeding law enforcement and the family is not required; however, a crime of this magnitude is something that just does not happen in our small community. We are trying to wrap our support around the family and the law enforcement that have been working tirelessly for years to solve this crime. 

 

We are asking churches, nonprofits, and businesses to consider giving a sizable monetary donation to make this possible; however, any monetary donation is appreciated. If you are able to give a donation, please make the check payable to Redacted. If you prefer to pay the caterer directly we can arrange that too! Any unused money (the defendant pleads guilty, the trial takes less time, etc) will be donated to the Abby and Libby Park in Delphi, Indiana at the conclusion of the trial. 

 

Sincerely,

 

Redacted 

Owner Delphi Depot/Healthies

The [unsettled production rates at Raenonx](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/info/production), easier to see [if you go ingredient by ingredient](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient) point to Luxray being the [best tomato](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient/12) *and* [oil producer](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient/10) in the game at lvl 60, which I find amazing. Considering Toxicroak doesn't have an island with preferred berry, this leaves Luxray as the better oil producer as of today. Also, Luxray evolves twice, unlike Toxicroak.

Aggron leans to become the best [sausage producer](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient/7), which is especially true considering his self-healing skill, but the difference over Charizard is minimal so Charizard still keeps its value especially with Ingredient Magnet.

Naturally, Vikavolt is the [best coffee producer](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient/17) as of today (rates for the line seem to be settled already), but he [also becomes the best mushrooms producer](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient/2) (tied with Quagsire).

All of this at level 60 and mono farmers (dual when required).

The powercreep, however, is minimal, and while God forbid me becoming a Nintendo/Pokémon Company apologist, it is true that it feels more like a lateral movement rather than a strict powercreep: Aggron produces per day 3 more sausages than Charizard... out of 83 (a 4% raise). Luxray produces 3 tomatoes and oils (?) more than its competitors, etc. **From a f2p pov** this feels more like ""have different ingredient options"" rather than ""use this or lose"". For megawhales, this presents more options with different berry types (tomato farmers Luxary, Victreebel and Abomasnow all have a preferred island).

The new Pokémon are unlike Dragonite and Tyranitar, who produce 50% more herbs/gingers than the next option. The only powercreep is Vikavolt for coffee.

My other thoughts are that this can more or less free space for other pokémon in other roles. For example, monotomato Luxray frees Victreebel to be monopotato (if you don't have a good Meowscarada as is my case). Or Abomasnow to be monoegg. Maybe it is a good idea to keep monofarmers in their secondary ingredients. It also means more chances for great monofarmers. Chances widen to Bellsprout, Snover *and* Shinx for tomatoes, for Croagunk *and* Shinx for oil, etc. This is especially relevant for f2p.

1fv6b2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1fv6b2f/my_gmat_journey/,My GMAT Journey,"How I went from 615 to 675 on GMAT Focus Edition
 
Hey r/GMAT! I recently scored a 675 (Q88, V83, DI80) on the GMAT Focus Edition, and I wanted to share my journey with you all.
 
Quick background: I'm a mechanical engineer working in the railway industry. After a couple of years on the job, I decided an MBA was my next step. Little did I know, the GMAT would become my Everest for the next two years!
 
Prep Overview:
 
• GFE Attempt-1: 615 (Q83, V80, D78)
• Timeline: About 2 years (yes, you read that right!)
• Resources: A mix of online resources, official mocks, lots of coffee.

The Transition:
 
Just as I was getting comfortable with the classic format, boom! New edition. It felt like starting over, especially with the new Data Insights (DI) section. But here's the thing - this transition taught me adaptability, a skill that's crucial not just for the GMAT, but for b-school and beyond.
 
Key Challenges and Strategies:
 
1. Quant:
o Challenge: Improving from ""good"" (70th percentile) to ""great"" (95th+ percentile)
o Strategy: Focused practice on weak areas (Number Properties, P&C, Sets). Focused on improving my weaker areas that helped me save countless hours..
o Result: Accuracy on hard questions went from 60% to 87%, and I shaved off 20 seconds per question!
 
2. Verbal:
o Challenge: Time management and accuracy on hard questions
o Strategies:
▪ CR: Refined my approach, which significantly improved my answer choice analysis. Game-changer!
▪ RC: Focused on passage structure rather than details
o Result: Hard CR accuracy jumped from 63% to 83%, AND time reduced by 24 seconds while boosting accuracy
 
3. Data Insights:
o Challenge: Completely new section, felt overwhelming
o Strategies: Due to time constraints, I primarily relied on my Quant and Verbal skills, coupled with effective time management. Specific approaches included:
▪ Quick skim of all sources in Multi-Source Reasoning
▪ Strategically skipping time-consuming questions (TPA!)
▪ Leveraging verbal and quant skills for DI questions
o Result: Scored 86th percentile despite minimal focused prep
 
Study Approach:
 
I'm a big believer in quality over quantity. Instead of solving thousands of questions, I focused on thorough review and learning from each mistake. Creating an error log was crucial - it helped me identify patterns in my mistakes and focus my prep.
Mock Tests: Took 4-5 serious mocks, scores ranging from 675 to 695. Big lesson: Order matters! Switching my section order to Quant-Verbal-DI (my strength order) boosted my score by 40 points in a single mock.
 
Test Day: Nerves were real, folks! Two pro tips:
1. Keep your markers closed between sections (they dry out fast!)
2. Don't overhydrate (bathroom breaks are a luxury you can't afford)
 
My mantra: ""The only thing that matters is the question on the screen."" I wrote this on my scratch pad to keep myself reminded. It helped me stay focused and not dwell on past questions.
 
Key Takeaways:
1. Consistency > Intensity: It's a marathon, not a sprint
2. Adapt and overcome: Be ready for curveballs (like a new exam format!)
3. Know thyself: Play to your strengths, especially in section order
4. Quality > Quantity: Deep review > Endless practice
5. Mental game is key: Stay positive, stay focused
 
Final Thoughts: This journey tested my limits, but it also showed me what I'm capable of. If you're in the middle of a long GMAT journey, don't give up! It's tough, but so are you.
Feel free to AMA in the comments. We're all in this together!

# Introduction

Honestly, if you’ve ever wrestled with a traditional inkjet printer, you know the struggle is real. Those ink cartridges seem to dry up the moment you look at them, and let’s not even get started on the endless setup procedures that can leave you scratching your head. That’s why when I stumbled upon the **Canon MF644Cdw**, I felt a flicker of hope. This printer claims to tackle all the annoying printer woes—printing, scanning, copying, and even faxing. Sounds dreamy, right? So, let’s dive into this all-in-one wonder and see if it lives up to the hype.

# Product Overview

https://preview.redd.it/ar1mkui49jsd1.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da53819f5cf7fde6066efe208b981245b0fcb00a

# Key Features

The **Canon MF644Cdw** boasts a bunch of impressive features that caught my attention:

* **4-in-1 Functionality:** Print, copy, scan, and fax—all in one sleek machine. Who doesn’t love a multitasker?
* **Fast Printing Speed:** It prints up to 22 pages per minute in both black and color, which is kind of impressive.
* **Quick First Print:** Your first print is ready in about 10.3 seconds. That’s quicker than some people make breakfast!
* **High Capacity Toner:** It uses Toner 067 / 067 High Capacity Toner, so you won’t be running to the store every few weeks for replacements.
* **Versatile Paper Handling:** With a 250-sheet standard cassette and a 1-sheet multipurpose tray, plus a 50-sheet automatic document feeder for two-sided scanning, it can handle whatever you throw at it.

# Many of us need one!

This printer seems tailor-made for anyone from busy parents trying to print school projects to small business owners needing a reliable workhorse. If you’re looking for something that just works, this might be it.

# My Finds:

# Pros

* **High Print Quality:** The prints are sharp and vibrant—seriously, they could rival dedicated photo printers.
* **Fast Operation:** With quick printing and scanning, you’ll save loads of time, which is, honestly, the dream.
* **User-Friendly Setup:** Most folks find the setup a breeze. No more crying over complicated instructions!
* **Versatile Connectivity:** Supports various printing options like Canon PRINT Business, Apple AirPrint, and Mopria Print Service. Printing from your phone? Yes, please!
* **Three-Year Warranty:** Peace of mind with a robust warranty. It’s like having a safety net for your printer.

# Cons

* **Initial Setup Complexity:** I’m not entirely sure why, but some users struggle with setting up features like scan-to-email. It seems a bit wonky.
* **Print Speed for Photos:** While it handles documents like a champ, high-quality photo printing can take a smidge longer.
* **Customer Support Issues:** A few customers have reported a real headache trying to reach Canon's customer support. Yikes.

# In-Depth Review

# Performance

The **Canon MF644Cdw** truly excels in performance. Right out of the box, I was blown away by the quality of the prints. I mean, when someone says, “Prints came out perfect right out of the box,” you start to believe in miracles. The colors pop and the detail is impressive for everyday use.

# Design and Build Quality

The solid build feels like it could withstand a small tornado—okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea. The touch screen? Pretty intuitive. But I have to admit, sometimes the response feels a bit sluggish, like when you’re waiting for your coffee to brew on a Monday morning.

# Ease of Use

Setting up the printer was generally straightforward. Most users report a smooth wireless connection setup, which I appreciated. It supports both Windows and Mac systems, making it versatile. Plus, printing from apps? Game changer! I was able to print a last-minute birthday card while still in my pajamas, which was kind of a win.

# Value for Money

At around $349, I think this printer offers fantastic value, especially given all its capabilities. It stands out among similar products, combining features and performance that make it worth every penny.

# User Feedback

# Customer Reviews

The feedback has been largely positive. Many users rave about its print quality and ease of use. One user even said, “I’m glad I took a chance on it based on even worse reviews for other comparable brands.” Talk about low expectations! Others noted that the **Canon MF644Cdw** is a significant upgrade from their previous inkjet printers.

# Ratings

This printer has received solid ratings—usually around 4 to 5 stars. That’s a good indicator of customer satisfaction, I’d say.

# Comparisons

While the **Canon MF644Cdw** holds its own, some users have compared it to Brother printers. Canon seems to have the upper hand when it comes to color accuracy and overall print quality, but Brother models might edge out in scanning capabilities. It’s like comparing apples to oranges, really.

# Who Should Buy This Product?

If you’re hunting for a reliable, multi-functional device that delivers high-quality prints without the usual inkjet drama, the **Canon MF644Cdw** is your guy. Whether you’re a busy professional or a parent cranking out school projects, it’s designed to meet a variety of needs.

# Conclusion

To sum it all up, the **Canon MF644Cdw** seems to be a strong contender for the title of best all-in-one photo printer. Its features, solid performance, and positive user feedback make it a worthwhile investment. I mean, if you’re looking for something that handles various tasks while delivering quality results, this model is definitely worth a look.

# Now…

are you ready to streamline your printing tasks? Consider the **Canon MF644Cdw** for your home or office. Check it out on amazon!

# FAQs

**1. How does this product compare to Brother printers?** While both brands offer excellent all-in-one capabilities, the **Canon MF644Cdw** is noted for superior color accuracy and print quality, especially for everyday documents and photos.

**2. What warranty or guarantee is offered?** The **Canon MF644Cdw** comes with a three-year limited warranty, providing added peace of mind for users.

**3. Are there any accessories that are recommended to use with this product?** While the printer includes essential components, consider investing in high-capacity toner cartridges to reduce the frequency of replacements and maximize efficiency.

**When:** 31st August - 13th September


**Distance:** ~105 miles


**Links:**
Pictures: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/robertcoleuwn/)


**Trail info:** *""Since Rando-Lofoten was founded a certain number of visitors have told us they would be interested in a trekking itinerary that crosses the archipelago from one end to the other. Crossing a region from north to south or east to west often enables travellers to set themselves a goal when faced with the unknown. But over and above the physical or psychological challenge we believe it is important to remember that hiking is above all about discovery and enjoyment.""* [Source](https://rando-lofoten.net/en/the-long-crossing-from-north-to-south-on-the-lofoten-islands)


I was looking for a Scandinavian hike to go on with my partner, while she has been on multi day bike packing trips, this would be her first multi-day hike. The Long Crossing seemed to provide a perfect mix of a beautiful landscape, nice trail notes, and ruggedness without super long food carries or being too far from bail out points.


**Getting there/back:** We flew from London to Oslo then Oslo to Bodø. From Bodø we took a ferry to Moskenes. On the way out our flight from London was delayed enough that we were going to miss the connection up to Bodø, but SAS were brilliant. They rebooked us onto the first flight the next day and put us up in a decent hotel outside Oslo airport. We ended up getting to Bodø in time to catch the ferry that we originally planned to get.

The way back was pretty similar however we got the ferry from Svolvær to Bodø. This time the weather was kicking off and the crossing was _rough_. It turns out I do get seasick, I just had never been in rough seas before. It was a lot of fun, but yeah, I puked three times...
Booking the ferry tickets was a little tricky, I still can't track down the website I actually bought the tickets from. The website I keep getting back to just gives you details on timing etc. However, tickets are easy to buy on the boats themselves which wasn't an issue for us but could be during more peak season.


**Resupply and water:** Resupply was simple. The most food we carried was 3 days and there were plenty of options in the supermarkets. Gas was easy to buy as well as decent dehydrated meals and all the usually snacks a hiker could want.
Water is everywhere, I didn't treat mine but my partner used a sawyer. A minor challenge is keeping eye out for brackish water as the route bounces around a host of lakes and salt water shore lines, but this is easy to check on a map.


**Navigation:** We both had caltopo loaded on our phones which as local topo maps for Norway! I also made paper maps on caltopo which were printed out and used for the bulk of out navigation. The route isn't way marked so you do have to keep an eye on the maps and there were a few games of 'trail or stream'


**Accommodation and camping:** There are plenty of places to stay on the islands and the decent bus network means that if you wanted to it is easy to travel a bit to get to hard accommodation. We camped or stayed in bivi huts every night bar the half way point when we took the bus from Leknes to Ballstad to stay in some cheaper hard accommodation. We also stayed one night in the paid campsite in Ramberg. This place was great! There is a kitchen and the showers and laundry were included in the price. 
Dispersed/wild Camping is free and easy. However, while camping in Norway is allowed in most places you can't simply camp *anywhere*. The Lofotens are getting a lot more tourists these days and it seems like camping where you shouldn't is starting to have an impact. In some places there are signs to highlight the rules. [There is a great website](https://nordlandsatlas.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=fab455cbf6e8441894efd4ccc99a0b8f) that highlights where you can and can't camp.
We came across a number of three sided shelters and stayed in one of them. They are not as deep as the ones on the AT so might not be great if the weather is coming in from the wrong direction, some have tarps you can string up if this is happening but the one we stayed in didn't. There are also a handful of proper huts that can be stayed in, a number need a key that can be got in advance from a nearby town or village but we didn't use any of these. We did stay in a beautiful turfed hut one night which was very well equipped. It's maintained by a local hunting and fishing group so didn't require a key. It was a shame that it wasn't colder as it had a stove in there, but we would have roasted if it was lit!


**Trail traffic:** Lightish. The normal sort of pattern, things got busier around access points and the main attractions. We met a handful of people out to do the Long Crossing which was fun, always nice to chat about sections and muse over what is to come.
One section that traffic may be an issue is the ridge running from Matmora towards Delp. This was our last day and we camped near by and got over the ridge fairly early, however, it seems like a lot of day hikers come up from Delp and hike the ridge towards Matmora. It might not be too fun trying to pass a group coming the other way on some parts of the ridge, especially if you're a little nervous on more exposed, steeper trail. It could be good to do this section either early or late to avoid having to deal with this when heading towards Delp.


**Conditions:** This took me by surprise a little, we hadn't looked into the finer underfoot conditions in too much detail. It is often boggy and wet feet were the norm. The bog can be deep and where there is more foot traffic things get muddy and slippy pretty fast. There is also a good bit of rock hopping as well as sections that have chains or ropes to help with climbing/descending. On the whole there was more rough ground than maintained trail. There were two ridge sections that could be tough for those who are a little more nervous with exposure, the ridge mentioned above as well as one coming down from Dalstuva. My parenter is less happy on this sort of ground but managed really well!
There are also a few sections of road walking. These aren't bad and we opted to walk all the quieter roads, but did catch busses/hitch hiked rather than walking along the E10 which is the main road on the islands. Seeing as I'm writing about public transport here, there is also a section where a ferry is needed*. If you're going Delp -> Å then this is a quick ~20 min ride from Kirkfjorden to Vinstad. However, if you're going Å -> Delp then you need to get the ferry from Vinstad to Reine then Reine to Kirkfjorden. This isn't a problem as Reine is a nice spot with a cafe, Bistro, and petrol station. So you can use the time there to have a hot meal or do a small resupply. There is also a supermarket there, but it looked like it might be tight to get there and back in time for the second ferry.
Weather wise we had packed and mentally prepared for rain, it can get pretty stormy up there. However, we lucked out on that front and only really had a couple of wet periods the entire time. Wind was the major factor and dictated where we camped a lot. Luckily using a combo of Yr, the Norwegian weather app, and Windy we were able to pick up some pretty good places to finish our days and while there were some good blowly nights we managed to shelter from the worst of it. The temps never dropped below freezing and the coldest it got during the day was probably around 10C, give or take a few either side. So the it was pretty cozy but with some rain and wind chill thrown in it could have been cold.


*I say needed but there is a way to hike over that [Swami mentions](https://www.thehikinglife.com/2020/02/the-long-crossing-of-norways-lofoten-islands/) in his write up. We didn't take nor did we meet anyone who had: 


**Gear:** Not much to put here but I did want to use this to write an ode to older gear. On the run up to this trip we couldn't get hold of a two person tent so ended up taking my old Golite Shangri-La 3. I love this tent. It's not ultralight by modern standards, especially when using the net inner but it can really handle some wind. We ended up nick naming it The Limpet as when it's pitched as low as it can go it really sticks to the ground. It was palatial for the two of us but meant we could roll back the inner in the mornings to brew our coffee inside when it was raining. 
Clothing wise I was really happy with my layering set up. I wore a Montane Allez then had an alpha direct 60 as an additional active layer and a montbell chameece for the evenings or if it got really cold. I didn't need to were everything at any point but it was nice to know that I would have been toasty if the weather had turned sour. The last couple of years I've found myself mostly hiking in hotter, drier places so I have been wearing a sun hoody a lot of the time and had almost forgotten about the montane allez. It's an awesome fleece. I have great faith in the micro grid polartech material which feels old fashioned and quaint in the world of alpha direct and that other one I forget the name of. But it's a tough, warm, and no-nonsense material. Since getting back the UK I've been on some very wet short trips to Wales and have really enjoyed the allez on those trips.
I don't have a gear list for this trip! 


**Concluding thoughts:** This was a brilliant trip to a beautiful part of the world. I'm still pinching myself about how much we saw the sun and blue skies. It was a lot of fun to get an old tent out of storage and put it to good use! I'm thinking about future trips to Norway as it was a seriously stunning place to hike and the mainland looks like it could be a wonderful place to adventure!",11,1727957500.0,Ultralight,2,0.92,False
