1lmtgrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1lmtgrr/what_does_authenticity_mean_to_you/,What does Authenticity mean to you?,"I'm genuinely interested in learning what people trying to live authentically believe. I live in Utah and am an active PIMO in my LDS ward. Not even my TBM wife knows I'm PIMO. I say that to state that the opinions I hear most often about what it means to live ""authentically"" is always negative, and it's essentially just the person saying they don't want anyone else telling them how to live their life. The parable of the Prodigal Son gets thrown around a lot in connection with it. But I don't agree with that idea. 

To me, being authentic means you aren't hiding who you are. It can take multiple forms, and there are many positive Christian and Mormon scriptural examples of people living authentically: 1) Jesus Christ, 2) Shadrach, Meshack, and Abednego (sorry if I misspelled those) choosing not to bow down to the idol, 3) Daniel choosing to openly continue praying to God instead of the king, 4) the sons of Mosiah choosing to preach to the Lamanites because they couldn't stand the thought of anyone perishing spiritually even though everyone around them told them not to do it, etc. 

The difference I think is that being authentic and living your truth in my culture are often seen as trying to give yourself license to sin. To be truly authentic, the only identity that really matters is that you're a child of God. I agree with that part. What others don't realize is that not being authentic means only living a half life where you don't feel safe to show up completely for things. You're always holding some part of yourself back in all of your relationships because you're worried about not fitting in or of being hurt psychologically, spiritually, or physically. You're always wearing a mask, only playing a part, and never get to live fully. While then choosing to live fully could involve doing some things that might be a sin in some cultures, like getting a tattoo,  choosing to try drinking alcohol or coffee to see what it's like for yourself, or even wearing a dress instead of a suit and tie, those things don't define you. In the Trans space, living authentically means letting everyone see the real you, consequences be damned, and that can take many different forms depending on the level or form of transition we want or are able to do. And that should be a good thing, shouldn't it? Now you get to know the real me instead of this mask I've worn my whole life. 

I think I'll close with something my wife has quoted a few times to me and my kids. It's a line from the kids show Daniel Tiger, ""You can change your hair or what you wear, but no matter what you do, you're still you."" So be you, not what everyone else thinks you should be.

1lmt6v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MISTERM0R0SE/comments/1lmt6v9/a_pale_sky_part_2/,A Pale Sky (Part 2),"By the time I walked through my front door, a glance at my phone showed me that it was already three-thirty in the morning. Surprisingly, my circadian rhythm didn‚Äôt seem to care one bit. I was as awake as I had been at any point during the drive to Lubber Run, or my walk, or even the strange, silent drive back home afterward. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt remember being tired at all since waking up in the hospital.

I hadn‚Äôt remembered just how long ago my last meal was until I felt a gnawing, churning pain in my stomach. I grunted in discomfort, nearly doubling over as the sensations overtook me. How long had it been since I‚Äôd felt pain, hell, since I‚Äôd felt anything so intense? I hobbled to the refrigerator, pulling out a slab of sad, days-old steak I'd gotten from the supermarket before my accident. Watching the microwave quickly became torture, and I was practically swallowing whole carrots and handfuls of shredded cheese from the vegetable drawer of the fridge by the time it started beeping. I threw the door open, laying into my steak like a starving animal. It lasted about a minute tops before I washed it down with slices of a lone apple and a water bottle. If anyone else had been watching me, I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed them for thinking I had gone rabid.

After my impromptu dinner, I found myself staring down at the glossy, granite surface of my countertop. I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, but something made me uneasy. I glanced around nervously, trying to find the source of the misalignment. It was no use, of course. I told myself over and over that I was just being paranoid, that my jarring experience at Lubber Run trail was still fresh in my mind, and this was all some side-effect of me processing it. That didn‚Äôt stop my eyes from scanning every inch of my kitchen, my body twisting left and right to leave no dark corner or shady nook unchecked. Once I‚Äôd humored myself enough to calm down, I got up from the table and set my plate in the sink, not in the mood to force myself to clean it. Maybe all I had to do was cut myself some slack; what‚Äôs better for dealing with stress than taking it easy for a little while?

I eventually decided on a cup of peppermint tea from the cupboard, a comfortable playlist, and a nice, hot bath. I couldn‚Äôt help but lose my fear for the time being, my shoulders slumping in release as I took in a calm, deep breath. My lungs filled as much as they could before exhaling a nourishing breath. I was safe.

And I hadn‚Äôt felt that way since the day of my accident.

As I lay down in my bathtub and let the warm water take me, I shut my eyes to the classic rock coming in through my earbuds. Apart from the occasional sip of my tea and the best music the sixties and seventies had to offer, the world was silent. I couldn‚Äôt have been more thankful for that. I found myself almost drifting off to sleep, barely fighting against my suddenly heavy eyelids enough to keep myself conscious. After all, I wasn‚Äôt planning on spending my first night out of the hospital sleeping in my bathtub rather than my bed.

‚Äú...And of course, this is why I'm so concerned And I come back to find the stars misplaced And the smell of a world that has burned A smell of the world that has burned‚Ä¶‚Äù

My eyes shot open as the lyrics rang out. For a second, I was convinced that this was some sort of hallucination. Surely I was hearing things, it was the only explanation that made any sort of sense. Immediately, I opened Google, typing the lyrics in, hoping beyond hope that some song, any song, would show up.

About 952,000 results. First result: ‚ÄúUp From the Skies,‚Äù the first track off of ‚ÄúAxis: Bold As Love‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at that. I‚Äôd heard the song before; it had slipped my mind for a moment, but there was nothing scary about it. Still, the lyrics hit a little too close to home after the past few days. I skipped the song, being greeted by the gentle intro to ‚ÄúThe Crystal Ship‚Äù. It was a welcome alternative.

I‚Äôll admit, the rest of that night is a little hazy looking back. I think that even if I didn‚Äôt feel it for whatever reason, I was exhausted. I can remember draining the tub, toweling off, setting my empty mug on my dresser, and promising myself I would wash it tomorrow morning. I remember climbing into bed, and I remember a night of pleasant, wispy dreams. The next thing I clearly remember is waking up the next morning and turning my phone on to check for notifications. Instead, I found myself glancing at the clock, a concerned look stretching across my face.

‚Äú6:13 p.m.‚Äù

According to my phone, I slept for nearly fourteen hours the previous night. I chuckled nervously, standing up on shaky legs and bringing myself out to the kitchen. Looking out the window by my kitchen table, I could confirm that my phone had been right. I hadn‚Äôt been up for more than a few minutes, and the day was already drawing to a close, the sun halfway down its descent behind the horizon. I shrugged, deciding to treat this particular evening like a morning regardless. It felt normal in a strange way, like I was regaining a little bit of my control, regardless of how inconsequential it truly was. Besides, I was craving a breakfast sandwich anyway, and a cup of coffee or two didn‚Äôt exactly pain me to think about, either.

Once my late breakfast was prepared, I decided to skip sitting down at the table in lieu of the couch in the living room. I flopped down lazily, grabbing the remote from the coffee table before me and turning the television on with a quick snap of my thumb.

When the television turned on, it took a moment to register what I was seeing. I quickly realized it was the evening news, and that part made complete sense to me. The last time I had turned on my TV would have been the morning before my incident at work, and, even though I knew I could just check the weather and any big headlines on my phone, I‚Äôd gotten attached to my small town‚Äôs channel 3 news. It seemed that they were in the middle of a big report, something either very bad or very good by the looks of it. I looked down for the headline, trying to make sense of everything.

‚ÄúLocal scientist discovers new planet!‚Äù

My blood ran cold as soon as I realized what I had read. The phrase twisted around inside my mind, repeating infinitely. Before I could really consider my options, a woman with strawberry blonde hair appeared on screen and began to explain the details of the story that I had already experienced firsthand.

‚Äú...The recruit, Arlington‚Äôs own Ethan Fletcher, said he found the planet and its bizarre moon completely by accident during a routine check of several planets in the L-62-90 solar system! During an interview this morning, he-‚Äù

I finally regained control over my panic and smashed my thumb against the power button at the top of the remote, drowning out the horrible newscast in a sea of welcome darkness. I sat in silence as I picked at my breakfast sandwich. If I believed in luck, I would have been convinced that there was a lightning bolt waiting just outside my door. At the very least, this was something I could explain. Uncomfortable as it was, a newscast on a new scientific discovery was about the furthest thing from unusual to happen to me in what felt like months. I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing, remembering an old trick of mine that dated back to tests in my school days.

‚ÄúBreathe in‚Ä¶one, two, three, four five‚Ä¶breathe out‚Ä¶breathe in‚Ä¶‚Äù

It did the trick as well as it always did; by that, I mean minimally. Sighing, I got up from where I was laying on the couch, not wanting to be anywhere near that damned TV anymore.

For the rest of the day, I tried everything to keep the strange events that had been happening to me out of my mind; I listened to music, I played games on my computer, I even cleaned the entire house from top to bottom. By the time everything was spotless and I had lost interest in everything else, I could still feel resilient pangs of pure anxiety biting into my chest. I tried to exercise, hoping to at least confuse my quickened heartbeat for fatigue. Instead, it left me a sweaty, anxious mess. Annoyed and defeated, I took a quick shower, slipped under the covers of my bed, and reached into my bedside table. Ironically, after everything I had done to put myself at ease, all it took in the end was two Nyquil tablets. If I had to estimate, I‚Äôd say I likely passed out at around nine or ten, but I‚Äôm not quite sure.

When I awoke, I was in complete darkness as expected, but something had changed. Have you ever felt the sensation of someone else‚Äôs presence when you‚Äôre alone at night? Have you ever whipped around to confront an intruder in your home, in your space, and found nothing at all? The fear of that moment beat a thousand times at once in my heart. I was almost too hung up on the feeling of such a raw, primal terror to realize that my breathing wasn‚Äôt as it should have been either. It felt like I had been inhaling grains of sand, almost like the result of falling asleep on the beach face down.

I jolted upright, a scream tearing out of my throat like a rabid animal as I glanced around at the red landscape of that damned planet for a second time. Glancing down at my naked body, I could see that I was right about breathing in sand. I was completely coated in a maroon dusting, the result of what was now very clearly my body lying on Aries. Contrasting horrifically with the reddish-brown hue was the pure bone white of the sky, still milky and unnatural, just as it had been the first time.

As my panic began to settle from its crazed highs to its lingering lows, I took another look around at my surroundings. Just as I had during my first vision, I found them plain and empty. The occasional rocky mountain rose from the ground like a sickening red tumor, but other than that, I saw nothing. Then, as if it were a mirage in the middle of the hellish desert, a pinprick of dark, shining metal struck my eye off in the distance. By the time I had begun walking towards the thing, I hadn‚Äôt even realized why I was willing myself to do so. Surely it would be safer to lie down and wait for the hallucination to pass? But it was like a trance, an irresistible urge that I couldn‚Äôt know or fight against. Reluctantly, I decided to stay calm, breathe deep, and follow that urge wherever it intended to take me.

What I saw when I came over the final hill before the alluring greyish-silver speck is something that, even now, I can‚Äôt force myself to believe. Buildings sprouted from the ground like worms from the dirt, crawling toward the sky on shining bellies. They twisted like a drill bit, forming uniform, helical stakes that stabbed at the milk-white flesh of the sky overhead. All around them lay domes and spheres of the same material as the monoliths. The structures were littered haphazardly around the arid ground as if they had been placed there by pure accident, though clearly, this could not be the case. Every sphere was connected to at least one other structure with a metallic tube, wiring the whole thing together. I was immediately reminded of the poster that sat on the wall at the back of my middle school health class. It was a picture of a human silhouette with a diagram of the circulatory system, showing the veins and their path to and from the heart in the center. If a robot had a circulatory system of its own, I imagine it wouldn‚Äôt be far off. There was no mistaking it, though I wish there had been. This was a city, or maybe some kind of ruin or religious site, and one entirely unlike any on Earth.

What happened next I can only describe as stepping into a memory. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them again, I was gone. I was a religious man, or a religious creature at least. No, I definitely wasn‚Äôt human. I thought in unknown tongues and spoke the same, but I understood every word. In my horror, I turned to look for someone, anyone to help me. I began to call out in words I did not understand, pleading for help. Instead, I found myself face to face with a being unlike anything I had ever seen before.

The first thing that struck me was its skin. It was dry and cracked, like a moldy piece of jerky. The color of its skin was a deathly grey, something you‚Äôd expect to see on a days-old corpse. It had arms almost like a human being‚Äôs, but they ended in hands that held far, far too many fingers. They jutted out at impossible angles, an affront to evolution. As I forced my eyes up to the creature‚Äôs head, it too added to the terror building inside me. It had nothing, no cephalized center coated in sensory organs; just a pit going down into the chest of the creature where it should have been. From the orifice came a myriad of small tendrils that ended in black pinpricks that, due to my own vision, I immediately pegged as eyes. Once I realized that, I didn‚Äôt even bother to look down at the rest of the creature‚Äôs body. I was too focused on how to escape from wherever the hell I was to care about anything but self-preservation anymore. But, even with every neuron in my brain screaming at me to run, my body refused to succumb to its orders. Instead, I stayed stuck in place like a statue as a voice began to speak in unknown words that I understood entirely.

‚ÄúThis is a sin against our god; this is a sin against our god, and you will pay the price in blood. For the watchful moon.‚Äù

The words were echoed by what I realized was an entire group of the demonic beasts I had seen, all chanting in unison. The voices came raspy and sick from the inverted heads of each of them, shaking me to my core as, beneath me, further down the flight of stairs on which I stood, I felt eyes burning into every part of my body, freezing my mouth in place. Amid the chanting, I realized something: the rhythm was deliberate, clearly defined. It never changed between iterations of the chant, and it wasn‚Äôt the only time I had heard such a melody. I thought back to the song I had heard echo through the maroon desert of Aries on my first visit;

‚ÄúZ'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶‚Äù

We see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon.

The two phrases linked together like the pieces of an abhorrent jigsaw puzzle as I glanced down shakily at my hands. I counted two dozen fingers, all clenched in a terror stemming from their own existence. I wanted to scream, to let a cry of pure fear leave my lips. Instead, I sat in painful silence, the chanting of the other members of my order drawing to a close. All eyes were unfocused from me, returning to the steps as they began to climb them again. I found my legs uncontrollable, following their movements up towards the peak. It was the furthest thing from my mind. As I climbed those horrible stairs back into the beloved blankness of dreamless sleep, the translated lyrics to that nightmarish song rang through the void.

‚ÄúWe see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon.‚Äù

Evidently, it wasn‚Äôt my terror that had unraveled the hellish nightmare. When I managed to sit up in bed and catch my breath among the pools of sweat that turned my blankets into a sauna, I recognized the sound of my ringtone, repeated over and over again from my bedside table. I groggily reached for it, glancing at the screen. Through my half-closed eyes, I could see that it was no number I recognized. This was almost preferable; I was in no condition to talk about a return to work as the previous night had shown, and that went double for having to convince anyone that this was the case. I weighed my options before deciding to answer.

‚ÄúHey Paul, it‚Äôs Ethan!...the um, the intern, remember?‚Äù

I didn't recognize the number, but the voice was a different story. So I would have to convince someone or other that I couldn‚Äôt come in after all. I ran through possible explanations in silence as the sounds of birds and wind, and traffic merged into an urban cacophony through the speaker.

‚ÄúUh, Paul? You alright?‚Äù

I suddenly realized how strange it must have been for Ethan to pick up the phone to dead silence. Sheepishly, I piped up in an attempt to explain myself.

‚ÄúOh, sorry, I must have had my earbuds connected. Microphone didn‚Äôt pick anything up?‚Äù

Half-asleep as I was, it wasn‚Äôt a horrible explanation. I even found myself smiling a bit, my guard lowered. Sending Ethan to drag me into work a few days after everything that happened would be low, too low for me to consider it possible.

‚ÄúOh, you're good! It's happened to me once or twice‚Ä¶‚Äù

He trailed off for a moment before continuing.

‚ÄúSo, I was calling to ask if you wanted to go get dinner with me, Johan, and Ben. It‚Äôs been a bit since anyone‚Äôs seen you, we uh‚Ä¶we got a bit worried.‚Äù

Even without being able to see Ethan‚Äôs face while he spoke, I could sense the genuine concern in his voice. It was comforting after what I had gone through a mere few hours before our call, I can say that for certain. Helping that fact was the relief in knowing that, at least for the time being, the higher-ups seemed content to let me rest after my incident. I mulled over the invite in my head, deciding to get a few more details before making a definite choice.

‚ÄúAnywhere in particular?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah, there‚Äôs this um‚Ä¶what was it?... Oh, Italian place! Ben was telling us about it, he said the fettuccine alfredo is amazing!‚Äù

I thought about my other options. Over the past few days, my fridge had been reduced to damn near nothing. By now, I was well enough to go grocery shopping, but the idea was very unattractive. An Italian restaurant would be busy, most likely packed, but at the very least, I would have my own space at a table with my coworkers rather than having to wade through mobs of shoppers. I nodded silently to myself, my choice already made, it would seem.

‚ÄúSure, sounds nice. What time?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, cool! No offense, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to come after what happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

I felt a pang of guilt at that, most definitely one that wasn‚Äôt intended by Ethan. I wondered how worried he'd been finding me passed out and bleeding on the floor by my desk.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm doing a little better, you don‚Äôt have to worry about me.‚Äù

I tried everything in my power to make my tone sound as friendly as possible, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if it worked. Regardless, Ethan seemed to be happy with my response.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm really happy to hear it! I was worried, it was uh‚Ä¶a lot of blood‚Ä¶‚Äù

Nervous chuckles converged from both ends of the connection, and not long after, I was hanging up my phone and searching through my closet for the most presentable outfit that remained outside of the hamper. I settled on ‚Äúbusiness casual‚Äù, which was more or less the fanciest I could find. I took a moment to look at myself in the mirror, surprised to find my lips curled into a smile again. Maybe a night out with my coworkers was what I needed since I‚Äôd come home from the hospital, or maybe I liked Italian food a little more than I thought. Either way, things seemed to be looking up for the first time since before the hiking trail.

‚Äú...Paul? You ok?‚Äù

My eyes shot around the room as I tried to locate the person who had said my name over the sounds of classical jazz and silverware on plates. Something about being surrounded by other people, or maybe being surrounded by such normalcy, put me at ease. I‚Äôd been quiet since meeting up with my coworkers at the front of the building. We'd exchanged pleasantries, both usual and otherwise. Johan wanted to take a look at the scar, Ben chastised him, and Ethan simply said hello and wished me well. For the time being, it felt like my hallucinations and the incident that spurred them on were just a distant memory.

‚ÄúOh, y-yeah! Sorry, I should uh‚Ä¶probably order a coffee.‚Äù

We all chatted a bit, casually discussing our hobbies or interests as we waited for our waitress to make her rounds. I learned that Johan had been digging his old acoustic out of the attic some more, that Ben was getting into some show or another. Ethan seemed happiest following my example and taking up a listening role. I took the opportunity to enjoy the peace I hadn‚Äôt felt in days, convincing myself that everything had just been a series of unfortunate events, nothing worth dwelling on.

I almost got away with it as the waitress returned with a cup of coffee for me, a side of soup for Johan, and a distinct interest in Ethan.

‚ÄúHey, I apologize if I‚Äôm bothering you, but you look familiar! You‚Äôre that intern, right? The one who discovered that new planet?‚Äù

I instantly tensed up at the mention of that horrible planet, sinking a bit lower in my chair as the rest of the table erupted into conversation. In an instant, my peace was destroyed, the topic of conversation bringing flashes of my hallucinations back into the forefront of my mind. Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

‚ÄúH-hey‚Ä¶hey‚Ä¶guys!‚Äù

All at once, eight eyes fixed on me. I felt my heart quicken its rhythm as I grasped desperately for a way to explain away my disdain for such a topic. One by one, the faces of my friends contorted into looks of confusion and concern. I felt like a sick animal cowering in a cage, watched by people who wanted nothing more than to help whether I liked it or not.

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶not feeling good‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôm getting a migraine. I need to leave, I‚Äôm sorry, but I need to be able to drive home‚Ä¶‚Äù

I quickly stood up from the table, reaching into my wallet and gathering a handful of bills. As I placed them on the table to cover my meal and my portion of the tip, I caught a glimpse of everyone‚Äôs expressions.

They were fearful; knitted brows and prodding eyes, lips turned into compassionate frowns. I couldn‚Äôt stand to look at them.

Four missed calls.

Between my three friends, I had received four missed calls by the time I'd gotten home. These would, ultimately, go unanswered. It could have been the embarrassment, the burden of explaining my terror, or something else entirely; regardless, I didn't intend on listening to any messages.

The bottle of whiskey on my kitchen table was the only company I needed.

From the moment I stepped into my kitchen, I had reached for it, not even bothering to grab a glass before tilting it back and greedily gulping down several shots. I was never a heavy drinker, but this was a very special occasion. Whenever I had been drinking in the past, it was at parties, weddings, that sort of thing. This time, I was drinking to keep my sanity.

Buzz! Buzz!

I jumped as I heard my phone vibrate from the kitchen counter. I‚Äôd set it there when I'd first picked up the whiskey bottle, deciding not to bring it to the table so it would be easier to ignore. For the most part, it had worked. I sighed as I raised the bottle to my lips again, taking another swig as the phone rang.

And rang, and rang, and rang again.

By the thirtieth ring, even my drunkenness couldn‚Äôt keep away the growing feeling of something being terribly amiss. I groaned in anger, prying myself from the table as I lumbered towards my offending device. It wasn‚Äôt long before I stumbled, barely catching myself by the handle of the fridge as my body hung heavy beneath me. In the shock of falling, I had managed to turn my head to the side, facing the kitchen table I had stood up from.

Sitting in the chair, snoring loudly with cheeks soaked by spilled alcohol, was me.

I would have screamed in fear, I would have run for the door, and I would have tried to shake or pinch myself awake. But I didn‚Äôt get the chance before a white light filled the kitchen. I staggered back, pressing myself up against the fridge. The light was blinding, it was like looking right into a spotlight. I grimaced in pain as I slammed my eyes shut. Immediately, I learned I had made the right choice, as the room was filled with the sounds of things I never wished to see.

They skittered like a swarm of terrible insects, rushing across the wooden floor like some demented tap-dancing act. I heard their chittering, their wings fluttering and buzzing. The worst of all was the one characteristic that wasn‚Äôt bug-like.

The creatures spoke.

‚ÄúZ'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶‚Äù

Their collective voice was like listening to a throat torn and withered by a thousand years. It cracked and rasped with every sound that passed through it. If the devil had a voice, this was a fair approximation. I screamed as loud as I could, echoing off the walls as the creatures came closer and closer. They were right in front of me, they were chittering in my face, they were brushing against the lids of my closed eyes. I opened them, ready to face death with a terrified, empty stare.

Instead, I found myself in a familiar, pale place.

I stood inside a grandiose structure of white stone, and I immediately knew it to be the one that lay at the top of the stairs from my last visit to Aires. I couldn‚Äôt move, I was trapped where I lay. As I tried to get my bearings, I felt something drip down my arm.

It was blood, I was certain of it. Suddenly, I was certain of exactly what had happened.

I had been brought to the structure, my veins splayed open and my blood spilled in some dark ritual. Were my body alive, I would have sent shudders through its muscles and its skin, but that wasn‚Äôt possible. This form had been dead, it had been dead for a long time. For the last time, I wasn't myself.

Crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶

The sudden sounds drew my attention forward, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of it. They sounded far away, impossibly so, but they were too loud at the same time. Each one impacted my eardrums hard enough to make me wince, whether I could feel it or not. The wind picked up, filling my vision with the red dust of the planet‚Äôs surface. It obscured everything.

But the sound remained a steady crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶crack.

To the beat of the splintering, the splitting of rock and stone, the planet pulsed. Each break a new tectonic shift, a new rumbling beneath and all around me. The dust pulsed, a natural equalizer; the powder that stank of blood and metal danced with the devil. My ears thundered with life.

Then, as the dust parted, I understood.

Z'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶We see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon‚Ä¶Our angelic protector‚Ä¶

I watched on as the moon unfurled, the result of those horrible sounds plain to see. Cracking down the middle and prying itself apart with a final, sickening set of cracks, an insectoid leg swished and twitched from the crater. It waved in the air, writhing like a squashed fly. Several more followed, a band of eldritch soldiers marching through the ivory heavens. Feelers came forth, then several thousand compound eyes that scanned jarringly in all directions. Wings buzzed somewhere out of sight, mandibles chewed through Mani‚Äôs surface like a rat through drywall. Now, I felt the rhythm of the dead again as the world shook. I don‚Äôt know how, but I know the creature acknowledged me; sensed my presence even in death. I screamed silently in my rotting brain, begging, pleading for this all to end. I gazed upward as more of the crust fell away to reveal yet more kicking, twitching legs. There must have been a million, no, a hundred million in total, maybe more; uncountable mandibles and compound eyes to match. It was as if some sick god had mashed a hundred billion insects into one unholy, shared body. The discarded shell rained down, destroying the world around me in a biblical fury. Twisting structures buckled and smashed to the ground, and the stairs before me were demolished with lunar rock. All around, as my dead ears were full of the sounds of destruction, I could still hear an all-too-familiar chanting. It reigned in the end times, here where no God could stop it.

In an instant, I was back home at my table, alcohol running down my cheeks and through my blood. I had blood again, I had a body that could move and feel. I should have been overjoyed. Instead, I began to write.

That was over two days ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been writing, trying to remember every detail, every piece of my visions, everything that led up to them. As you read this, I‚Äôm certain to be rotting away in a morgue. I‚Äôm not insane, I‚Äôve never been insane, and I don‚Äôt want to die. What lies beyond our solar system terrifies me beyond death. I‚Äôm sorry for what I‚Äôve led back here, for what I unknowingly helped discover. I‚Äôm sorry for my team, I‚Äôm sorry that we couldn‚Äôt have just left everything beyond our world alone. I‚Äôm sorry to all my friends, my family, and everyone else who will suffer for our foolishness. I have become the prophet of an age, one that I would rather die than see take shape. Let it be known that the planet Aries has a holy protector, and he is all things ungodly.",1,1751133728.0,u_MISTERM0R0SE,0,0.99,False

I know this sounds like a Florida heatstroke hallucination, but I swear it‚Äôs real. Earlier this week, I was on vacation in New Smyrna Beach with my two daughters (19 and 22, fluent in sarcasm and TikTok) when we stopped at the Orlando International Premium Outlets. That‚Äôs where I met her ‚Äî you.

We had one of those random, surprisingly great conversations. I told you I was visiting from Pittsburgh. You didn‚Äôt flinch. You smiled. You laughed. I don‚Äôt remember what we talked about exactly, because my brain was operating at 40% due to Category 5 swamp ass conditions and SPF 100 slowly melting into my corneas.

And here‚Äôs where I pulled a full Aaron Rodgers:
Started strong, vibing hard, mysterious energy... then ghosted with no warning.
Didn‚Äôt get your name. Didn‚Äôt ask for your number. Just walked off like a Hallmark extra with intimacy issues and heatstroke.

My daughters immediately roasted me and said I ‚Äúfumbled the bag harder than the Pirates fumble literally every season after April.‚Äù Fair. But I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about that moment, that conversation, and your laugh that made me forget I was dripping like a pierogi in a sauna.

So here I am. Back in the 'Burgh. Tossing this Hail Mary into the digital abyss hoping the internet works its strange magic.

If you‚Äôre reading this ‚Äî or if any of yinz know a woman who recently chatted with a deliriously sweaty, kinda-charming Pittsburgh dad near the Nike outlet ‚Äî help a guy out. Let‚Äôs finish that conversation somewhere with A/C and less UV damage.

1lmt4hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lmt4hl/drowned_angel/,Drowned Angel,"Winter took over New York with its biting cold. The snow fell gently, covering the streets in a blanket of white. It was Christmas Eve, it had finally arrived, and Evan Tanner was excited about the idea, his favorite holiday was coming. Upstairs, a small wrapping box was hidden among his clothes; it was a gift for his mother, nurse Sarah Black. Even though he wasn't her son, he had her as a mother, it had been eight years since he came to live with Sarah, his father, Thomas Tanner, had left him in her custody until he returned from his trip, a trip that seemed to last an eternity. In the beginning, Evan clearly noticed the lack of affection and empathy that Ms. Sarah had it with him, but it seems that changed over time. On his tenth birthday, she gave him his first gift‚Äîa small diary. Since then, Evan has written in it almost every day, as if he wanted to keep every memory and one day be able to show his own father all the adventures he had (or almost all of them) in those last years, years that pass slowly.
In the kitchen, the smell of ginger and chocolate filled the air as Evan baked cookies; in his opinion, chocolate gingerbread cookies were the best. He hummed his favorite song, and when the living room door opened, and a girl entered, shaking the snow from her dark hair and clothes, Sarah, a young woman with dark brown eyes and hair, placed her bags on the table and entered the kitchen.
""Hi little angel"" she says with a beautiful and sweet smile.
""Hi mom, you're here, I'm making gingerbread cookies"" the small eyes, one in an emerald green tone and the other in a light gray tone (due to the lack of vision in the left eye) shone when they saw her arrival. He smiled happily and good-humoredly.
""Hmm... they look delicious"" she says, approaching and hugging him ""Will Santa like them?""
Evan laughed, his laughter tinkling like a bell in the wind.
""Santa Claus doesn't exist, mommy"" he says smiling. ""If you imagine hard and believe, maybe it will appear."" he says, while taking a cup of coffee and filling it with tea, taking a sip of it. 
He rolled his eyes in amusement.
""I'm going to pretend I believe""
The rest of the night went by normally, as always. Christmas traditions were very simple, first came the Christmas games, then our Christmas karaoke, supper, placing the gifts on the tree, our snowball fight and finally a hot chocolate in front of the fireplace. It was a special moment. Then we all went to sleep. The next day, when we all woke up, we went to open Christmas presents, Evan had received a small digital camera, something that was never found again, and Sarah a tree of life necklace, she loved it so much that she hugged it so much that she almost killed the poor guy with the lack of air, it was the first time she had received a gift since her family had suffered an accident that made them lose their memory, to this day they don't remember it. The rest of the day outside of shopping and ice skating.
But then time passed. Fast as snowflakes in the wind. Christmas is behind us and the New Year has arrived. That same afternoon, Evan was looking for his camera battery throughout the house, but couldn't find it. Then he went to his mother's room. The battery rested on some papers on the desk, he went over and picked it up, he was about to leave when something caught his attention. His name was written on the paper along with his father's. He took them, sat on the floor and began to read.
As he read the forms, tears fell from his eyes, a searing pain took hold of his chest, as if an invisible dagger was tearing him from the inside.
The truth was there, raw, undeniable. His father would never return.
And his father... had never wanted him.
He went to his room and looked at himself in the mirror, on his face there were two burn marks, one on his cheek and the other right above his blind eye, on the rest of his body there were several others, mainly on his back and arms, it was hot water that caused them. His father spilled it on him when he was a baby, they say it was just an accident, that he slipped and the hot water he had with him spilled on the little one, too bad that's not the truth. He hates him, and now he knows it, he never wanted him and now he knows it. Now he knew his father would never return. He collapsed to the floor, sobbing silently. He took out his diary and wrote. Then he took a shower and, when he looked in the mirror, he saw the reflection of pain on his scarred skin. But he also knew that his mother loved him, both Sarah and Emma (his biological mother who recently died). Sarah loves him, and wants to protect him, he still remembered that she always lovingly kisses his blind eye, as if she wanted to ease the pain in some way. Sarah already knew everything, and she must have felt very sad, and that's why he doesn't hate her, that's why when she arrived that afternoon with the shopping, he smiled and acted as if nothing had happened. He smiled and hid that he knew the truth. Because now he knew one thing: Sarah loved him. And that was enough.
The beautiful fireworks lit up the sky, bringing good news and new opportunities. The glasses were toasted (one with soda and the other with champagne) and health was welcomed.
Four years have passed since that dark day‚Äîthe day Evan discovered the truth. Today on his birthday, Evan's mother had prepared a special surprise for him, when she got home from the hospital, she would show it to him. Evan was anxious as always, he had cleaned the bathroom three times and his room five times, a funny thing indeed, he knew that if he went to the living room to watch TV, his mind would reach the question that insisted on appearing. What is it?
So doing something like cleaning the house always got him out of those kinds of thoughts.
That's when suddenly the phone rang.
Evan got up hurriedly, it was definitely his mother calling, however, his surprise came when he heard who it was on the other end of the line.
""Hi mom, are you coming yet?"" 
""Hi son"" the deep, masculine voice sounded, Evan was paralyzed, that voice was the source of his nightmares and fears. And he didn't need to see it to know who it was.
""Evan, are you still there?"" The man's voice was soft, almost casual.
He wanted to respond, but he couldn't.
""I know you're there son, I'll be over in 10 minutes, I have a surprise for you.""
The call was disconnected, Evan fell to his knees on the floor, a chill went up his spine. Fear took over his being.
Thomas came back.
And I wanted to take him somewhere. But where? Where would they go? He knew he had no option, Evan knew he had no choice. It would probably just be a walk, right? 
He tried to calm himself mentally while taking a shower. ""He just came to visit me and take me for a walk"" he muttered to himself ""That's all, we'll be back soon, he'll leave and mom and I will stay together"". But that wasn't enough. A strange feeling instantly grew in his chest, perhaps it was a premonition? He knew something was wrong, something very bad was going to happen. But fate was against him.
Evan wore a short-sleeved sweatshirt with a burgundy zipper, a long-sleeved black and white striped blouse, dark beige women's cargo pants, and his burgundy all star. She tied her dark brown hair into a low side ponytail, leaving it a little loose. And finally, he put on his mask, which was pale in color and he had cut off the bottom part, in order to hide his facial scars, a shame it didn't work out very well.
Then he went to the diary and wrote a short text, and went to the room. When the intercom rang, he immediately went down to the lobby, and there he met that man. The man smiled. His blue eyes shone beneath his graying blond hair. 
""Hi son"" he said the same ""Get in the car, we're going for a walk"". With no choice, Evan gets in the car and buckles up, he looks out the window and sees the buildings passing by in a blur, that's when the city is left behind. Apprehensively, he looks at Thomas and asks. ""Where are we going?"" But he completely ignores him. ""How is your relationship with Sarah going?"" Frustrated, Evan responds, crossing his arms. ""Mom and I get along really well, in fact, how is your life going with that woman?"" He asked dryly. Thomas just drops his smile, His eyes become cold. ""You've already figured it out, haven't you?"" Evan, just responds ""I want to go home"". ""Apparently I don't need to pretend anymore."" 
The car stopped abruptly.
And before Evan could react, a tissue was pressed against his face, Evan began to struggle, trying to fight it. The strong smell took over his senses and little by little his body became lighter and lighter, his mind emptied completely, and sleep took him over completely.
Suddenly he felt that he was moving. How many hours had passed?
In the background, a distant, almost muffled sound, similar to that of a boat. Would you really be on a boat? He tried to move, but something stopped him. He was tied up.
A shadow moved slowly at the helm.
""Good night, little angel."" said a familiar, almost mocking voice.
Evan looks up and saw him, It was him. Thomas.
He tried to sit up, but the tight ropes around his body didn't allow it. A knot in my stomach grew.
"" What do you want?!"" he shouted, scared and disoriented. ""Where are we going?!""
Thomas didn't respond right away. He lay on his back for a few seconds, staring at the horizon ‚Äî or pretending there was something there beyond the darkness. Then he let out a low, bitter laugh.
""You know, Evan... the world isn't easy. Our family is in a complicated situation, and... you're a burden."" He turned his face slowly, his gaze blank. ""Always has been, actually. Since the day he was born.""
Evan's eyes widened. This wasn't just about money.
"" You took everything from me. Your mother, my freedom, any chance of me having a good life... "" continued Thomas, his voice full of resentment. ""And even so, she loved you more than me. Everyone looked at you as if you were special... But they never saw what you really are.""
Hate invaded Evan's mind like wildfire.
"" You bastard! "" he shouted, mentally cursing him with everything he had, even though he knew it wouldn't help. He tried to free himself, writhing desperately, but it was useless. The ropes were tight and wouldn't come loose that easily.
Then the boat stopped.
Evan felt his blood run cold. The silence around was heavy, almost solid. Only Thomas's breathing and the gentle sound of moving water filled the void.
Thomas stood up slowly and looked at him. A crooked smile ‚Äî one Evan would never forget ‚Äî formed on his lips.
""Well, little angel... it's time.""
He took him in his arms like Evan was nothing. Just a burden to be discarded.
He went to the edge of the boat, like someone getting rid of inconvenient rubbish.
Tears ran down the boy's face. A cry caught in the throat, muffled by fear and pain. Above them, the full moon shone like an indifferent lantern, silent witness to Thomas's sins.
And then, he threw it.
The icy water cut Evan's skin like blades. The weight of the ropes pulled him to the bottom. He struggled hard, in panic, trying to catch the air that was already escaping his lungs.
It was useless.
Everything was useless.
""This is useless... useless...""
The thought echoed, until, exhausted, he stopped moving.
He looked up. The moonlight shone distortedly on the surface. The dark depths surrounded him, drowning his body, his screams, and his hope.
And then, in the icy silence of the waters, a voice whispered.
It was deep. Dark. Almost a distant echo.
""The moon knows about his sins, little angel... and so do we.""
Evan's consciousness faded. And the world was plunged into darkness.
After the murder of his own son, Thomas went to the cabin that was near the lake, and took a bottle of whiskey, sat down in the armchair in front of the fireplace, now lit, and began to drink. He did not appear to have any regret for his mistakes. Little did he know, that in the corner of the room, a demonic presence, so to speak, was lurking at him. An angel half demon came for your sins. Evan's soul was unable to rest. And now he just wanted revenge. And it would be slow and painful.
A macabre smile appeared in the darkness, scaring Thomas. The sound of a soft laugh echoed through the room.
And that night, Thomas's blood painted the walls. 
That was his last night alive.
Weeks passed and the news about Thomas' brutal murder was hushed up by his own family. Thomas' family blamed Sarah and Evan for the murder. At first, Sarah blamed herself and fell into a deep depression, only improving a few years later.
Because she was still young, Sarah continued to live her life for the next few years, always visiting her son's grave, while Evan watched and protected her. 
He saw her get married, have children and he also saw her leave, and once again he found himself alone in the world. 
The wake took place calmly, distant relatives cried for the deceased, while the little angel, sitting in the coffin, caressed his mother's face. Tears of blood came out of his eyes, drops of dark water fell from his hair, his skin was pale and his green eyes were faded.
A dark aura surrounded him. His smile was pale, dead. But within his faded eyes, something awakened.
When he saw the man attack a child, a sobering thought crossed his mind: ""kill him""
And Evan laughed. He laughed, a laugh that gave you chills.
At that moment, an evil force took over Evan, while a macabre smile was seen on his face.
Evan got up, and began to walk calmly, following the police who took the man, while a sweet and macabre song remained.
""I'm half craze all for the love of you...""
He wasn't really one anymore. The one who was sitting in the backseat, smiling at the man, was no longer Evan. 
Evan had died.
As soon as they arrived at the police station, the man was placed in a cell until someone saw him to release him. When midnight struck, the full moon lit up the sky and silence hovered in the cell, the man slept peacefully.
The smell of his filthy sweat filled the air and Angel watched him, his green eyes shining in the darkness and black drops of water dripping from his hair, forming small shadowy circles on the cold floor. 
He approached with the precision of a snake about to strike.
""Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer to...""
Angel's voice came out as a whisper, an omen of something terrifying about to happen. The blade he held glistened in the darkness as he thrust it into his arm as the man woke with a start.
But Angel was not forgiving. It was not a quick death. He wanted to hear the screams. I wanted to see the pain that would come into your eyes. He tortured and would use all his cunning to make him suffer.
Angel tilted his head to the side as the man looked at him scared and in pain. He twisted the blade and grabbed him by the neck, squeezing him until he opened his mouth, and then cut off his tongue. A howl of pain echoed through the silent walls as his aphids were peeled off, his facial skin removed and with a pencil, his eardrums were pierced. He opened the shirt of the man who was screaming as loud as he could, until his lungs exploded, too bad no one would hear him. With his nails, he cut his flesh and opened his chest and belly, put his hand inside and began to play with his organs, always smiling as he removed a new one. When he removed his intestines, Angel exclaimed with joy: ""Look, you can make a necklace!"" 
The cell was filled with screams ‚Äî long, high-pitched and impossible to ignore. Angel smiled, playing with the man's laments as if they were musical notes.
One by one Angel took them out, always smiling, always happy, always having a new joke idea about what to do with them all.
The man, in his last words, begged for his life, but this only made Angel laugh, more cruel than any monster. And when silence finally fell, all that was left were traces... and the promise that it would happen again.
""Do you think you still have the right to life?"" he mocked, while holding his heart. The sadistic laugh echoing through the room.
""Sleep with God, my angel.""
The next morning, the police found the man dead in the cell from a heart attack, but next to him, something caught their attention, a small camera rested under the bed.",1,1751133572.0,creepypasta,0,0.99,False

1lmt1bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1lmt1bq/been_hunting_for_the_perfect_coffee_shop_in_la/,"Been hunting for the ""perfect"" coffee shop in LA for 2 years ‚Äî found something weird in the Arts District that actually broke my pattern","Okay, so I've been obsessed with finding decent coffee in LA for way too long. Like embarrassingly long. I'm talking spreadsheets, rating systems, the whole neurotic thing. Most places are either overpriced Instagram bait or they treat coffee like they're running a McDonald's drive-thru.

I stumbled onto this place called Maru Coffee in the Arts District pretty randomly last month. Was meeting a friend nearby and needed caffeine. At first, I was skeptical because honestly? The name sounds like something a startup would call their meditation app.

But here's the thing that caught me off guard...

# The good stuff:

* **The coffee actually tastes different.** Not ""oh this is nice"" different. Like ""why does every other place taste like burnt sadness"" different. Turns out they source from high-altitude farms exclusively (something about Korean meaning ""mountaintop"" ‚Äî didn't expect a linguistics lesson with my latte).
* **Zero rush energy.** Most LA coffee shops feel like everyone's running late for something. This place has this weird calm vibe where people actually sit and work for hours. High ceilings, natural light, doesn't feel cramped even when it's busy.
* **Consistent quality.** I've been back 8 times now (told you I was obsessed). Every single cup tastes identical. That never happens. Ever.

# The weird/unexpected stuff:

* **They're aggressively analog.** No app ordering, no screens everywhere, no ""download our rewards program"" pressure. Felt almost retro in a good way.
* **The location matters more than I thought.** Arts District has this creative energy that actually affects how the coffee tastes. Sounds ridiculous but I swear it's a thing.
* **People plan their day around it.** Overheard multiple conversations about scheduling meetings there, rearranging routes to stop by. That's... not normal coffee shop behavior.

# The not-so-great:

* **It's not convenient.** If you're not already in the Arts District, it's a trek. No quick grab-and-go situation.
* **Minimalist might feel pretentious to some.** If you like your coffee shops chaotic and loud, this might feel too zen.
* **Spoiled me for everywhere else.** Legitimately ruined my tolerance for mediocre coffee. Now I'm that person who complains about Starbucks.

# If you're thinking of checking it out:

* **Don't go if you're in a rush.** The whole point is slowing down. Fighting that defeats the purpose.
* **Bring work or a book.** The space is designed for lingering. Feels weird to just drink and leave.
* **Go with realistic expectations.** It's not going to change your life, but it might change how you think about coffee shops.
* **Best for people who actually care about coffee quality.** If you just need caffeine, save yourself the drive.

# The weird part:

I've become one of those people who drives 25 minutes for coffee. Never thought I'd be that person. But after experiencing what ""good"" actually feels like, everything else just tastes like compromise.

And because I went full nerd on this whole coffee shop research thing, I ended up writing way more about the psychology behind why this place works so well. Like, what makes people drive across the city for coffee? What's the difference between a coffee shop and a ""coffee experience""?

If you're into that kind of analysis (or just want to see if I'm completely overthinking a simple coffee shop), I put together a longer breakdown [here](https://addictedcoffeebar.com/coffee-shop/maru-coffee-arts-district-los-angeles/).

Honestly, if this saves even one person from the same two-year coffee shop rabbit hole I went down, totally worth sharing.

Anyone else have spots like this that completely ruined your standards for everywhere else?",1,1751133352.0,CoffeeSpotlight,0,1.0,False

Ticuan lacks a swimming pool, however.

I very frequently go to Cacho ‚Äî Brasil Street ‚Äî Alma Verde y Electric Coffee (sometimes for a haircut) and I simply take an Uber from Hotel Ticuan.

I‚Äôm considering the following three hotels:

1. Hotel Palacio Azteca
2. Hotel Lucerna
3. Hotel Hacienda Aguacaliente

Palacio Azteca has a 7.8 guest review, but a fair amount of positive reviews as well.  The primary consideration here is its close proximity to Brasil street.  I‚Äôm thinking about simply visiting the hotel this afternoon after Cacho, and taking a look.

Lucerna, although I haven‚Äôt yet been, is very nice and I know I‚Äôll be happy there.  A little more upscale than the three others here, but reasonable and within my budget.  A little further from Brasil Street, but Uber is of course an option.

Is Lucerna closer to Zona Rio?  I haven‚Äòt yet experienced much of Zona Rio.

Lastly, there is  Hacienda Aguacaliente which has decent guest reviews at 9.0, but it seems further away.

Given that location is important, and I like to walk, seeking feedback from locals and/or visitors on the three hotels above.",1,1751133300.0,tijuana,1,0.67,False

1lmsx9c,https://i.redd.it/2plsfrlohp9f1.jpeg,Drowned Angel,"Winter took over New York with its biting cold. The snow fell gently, covering the streets in a blanket of white. It was Christmas Eve, it had finally arrived, and Evan Tanner was excited about the idea, his favorite holiday was coming. Upstairs, a small wrapping box was hidden among his clothes; it was a gift for his mother, nurse Sarah Black. Even though he wasn't her son, he had her as a mother, it had been eight years since he came to live with Sarah, his father, Thomas Tanner, had left him in her custody until he returned from his trip, a trip that seemed to last an eternity. In the beginning, Evan clearly noticed the lack of affection and empathy that Ms. Sarah had it with him, but it seems that changed over time. On his tenth birthday, she gave him his first gift‚Äîa small diary. Since then, Evan has written in it almost every day, as if he wanted to keep every memory and one day be able to show his own father all the adventures he had (or almost all of them) in those last years, years that pass slowly.
In the kitchen, the smell of ginger and chocolate filled the air as Evan baked cookies; in his opinion, chocolate gingerbread cookies were the best. He hummed his favorite song, and when the living room door opened, and a girl entered, shaking the snow from her dark hair and clothes, Sarah, a young woman with dark brown eyes and hair, placed her bags on the table and entered the kitchen.
""Hi little angel"" she says with a beautiful and sweet smile.
""Hi mom, you're here, I'm making gingerbread cookies"" the small eyes, one in an emerald green tone and the other in a light gray tone (due to the lack of vision in the left eye) shone when they saw her arrival. He smiled happily and good-humoredly.
""Hmm... they look delicious"" she says, approaching and hugging him ""Will Santa like them?""
Evan laughed, his laughter tinkling like a bell in the wind.
""Santa Claus doesn't exist, mommy"" he says smiling. ""If you imagine hard and believe, maybe it will appear."" he says, while taking a cup of coffee and filling it with tea, taking a sip of it. 
He rolled his eyes in amusement.
""I'm going to pretend I believe""
The rest of the night went by normally, as always. Christmas traditions were very simple, first came the Christmas games, then our Christmas karaoke, supper, placing the gifts on the tree, our snowball fight and finally a hot chocolate in front of the fireplace. It was a special moment. Then we all went to sleep. The next day, when we all woke up, we went to open Christmas presents, Evan had received a small digital camera, something that was never found again, and Sarah a tree of life necklace, she loved it so much that she hugged it so much that she almost killed the poor guy with the lack of air, it was the first time she had received a gift since her family had suffered an accident that made them lose their memory, to this day they don't remember it. The rest of the day outside of shopping and ice skating.
But then time passed. Fast as snowflakes in the wind. Christmas is behind us and the New Year has arrived. That same afternoon, Evan was looking for his camera battery throughout the house, but couldn't find it. Then he went to his mother's room. The battery rested on some papers on the desk, he went over and picked it up, he was about to leave when something caught his attention. His name was written on the paper along with his father's. He took them, sat on the floor and began to read.
As he read the forms, tears fell from his eyes, a searing pain took hold of his chest, as if an invisible dagger was tearing him from the inside.
The truth was there, raw, undeniable. His father would never return.
And his father... had never wanted him.
He went to his room and looked at himself in the mirror, on his face there were two burn marks, one on his cheek and the other right above his blind eye, on the rest of his body there were several others, mainly on his back and arms, it was hot water that caused them. His father spilled it on him when he was a baby, they say it was just an accident, that he slipped and the hot water he had with him spilled on the little one, too bad that's not the truth. He hates him, and now he knows it, he never wanted him and now he knows it. Now he knew his father would never return. He collapsed to the floor, sobbing silently. He took out his diary and wrote. Then he took a shower and, when he looked in the mirror, he saw the reflection of pain on his scarred skin. But he also knew that his mother loved him, both Sarah and Emma (his biological mother who recently died). Sarah loves him, and wants to protect him, he still remembered that she always lovingly kisses his blind eye, as if she wanted to ease the pain in some way. Sarah already knew everything, and she must have felt very sad, and that's why he doesn't hate her, that's why when she arrived that afternoon with the shopping, he smiled and acted as if nothing had happened. He smiled and hid that he knew the truth. Because now he knew one thing: Sarah loved him. And that was enough.
The beautiful fireworks lit up the sky, bringing good news and new opportunities. The glasses were toasted (one with soda and the other with champagne) and health was welcomed.
Four years have passed since that dark day‚Äîthe day Evan discovered the truth. Today on his birthday, Evan's mother had prepared a special surprise for him, when she got home from the hospital, she would show it to him. Evan was anxious as always, he had cleaned the bathroom three times and his room five times, a funny thing indeed, he knew that if he went to the living room to watch TV, his mind would reach the question that insisted on appearing. What is it?
So doing something like cleaning the house always got him out of those kinds of thoughts.
That's when suddenly the phone rang.
Evan got up hurriedly, it was definitely his mother calling, however, his surprise came when he heard who it was on the other end of the line.
""Hi mom, are you coming yet?"" 
""Hi son"" the deep, masculine voice sounded, Evan was paralyzed, that voice was the source of his nightmares and fears. And he didn't need to see it to know who it was.
""Evan, are you still there?"" The man's voice was soft, almost casual.
He wanted to respond, but he couldn't.
""I know you're there son, I'll be over in 10 minutes, I have a surprise for you.""
The call was disconnected, Evan fell to his knees on the floor, a chill went up his spine. Fear took over his being.
Thomas came back.
And I wanted to take him somewhere. But where? Where would they go? He knew he had no option, Evan knew he had no choice. It would probably just be a walk, right? 
He tried to calm himself mentally while taking a shower. ""He just came to visit me and take me for a walk"" he muttered to himself ""That's all, we'll be back soon, he'll leave and mom and I will stay together"". But that wasn't enough. A strange feeling instantly grew in his chest, perhaps it was a premonition? He knew something was wrong, something very bad was going to happen. But fate was against him.
Evan wore a short-sleeved sweatshirt with a burgundy zipper, a long-sleeved black and white striped blouse, dark beige women's cargo pants, and his burgundy all star. She tied her dark brown hair into a low side ponytail, leaving it a little loose. And finally, he put on his mask, which was pale in color and he had cut off the bottom part, in order to hide his facial scars, a shame it didn't work out very well.
Then he went to the diary and wrote a short text, and went to the room. When the intercom rang, he immediately went down to the lobby, and there he met that man. The man smiled. His blue eyes shone beneath his graying blond hair. 
""Hi son"" he said the same ""Get in the car, we're going for a walk"". With no choice, Evan gets in the car and buckles up, he looks out the window and sees the buildings passing by in a blur, that's when the city is left behind. Apprehensively, he looks at Thomas and asks. ""Where are we going?"" But he completely ignores him. ""How is your relationship with Sarah going?"" Frustrated, Evan responds, crossing his arms. ""Mom and I get along really well, in fact, how is your life going with that woman?"" He asked dryly. Thomas just drops his smile, His eyes become cold. ""You've already figured it out, haven't you?"" Evan, just responds ""I want to go home"". ""Apparently I don't need to pretend anymore."" 
The car stopped abruptly.
And before Evan could react, a tissue was pressed against his face, Evan began to struggle, trying to fight it. The strong smell took over his senses and little by little his body became lighter and lighter, his mind emptied completely, and sleep took him over completely.
Suddenly he felt that he was moving. How many hours had passed?
In the background, a distant, almost muffled sound, similar to that of a boat. Would you really be on a boat? He tried to move, but something stopped him. He was tied up.
A shadow moved slowly at the helm.
""Good night, little angel."" said a familiar, almost mocking voice.
Evan looks up and saw him, It was him. Thomas.
He tried to sit up, but the tight ropes around his body didn't allow it. A knot in my stomach grew.
"" What do you want?!"" he shouted, scared and disoriented. ""Where are we going?!""
Thomas didn't respond right away. He lay on his back for a few seconds, staring at the horizon ‚Äî or pretending there was something there beyond the darkness. Then he let out a low, bitter laugh.
""You know, Evan... the world isn't easy. Our family is in a complicated situation, and... you're a burden."" He turned his face slowly, his gaze blank. ""Always has been, actually. Since the day he was born.""
Evan's eyes widened. This wasn't just about money.
"" You took everything from me. Your mother, my freedom, any chance of me having a good life... "" continued Thomas, his voice full of resentment. ""And even so, she loved you more than me. Everyone looked at you as if you were special... But they never saw what you really are.""
Hate invaded Evan's mind like wildfire.
"" You bastard! "" he shouted, mentally cursing him with everything he had, even though he knew it wouldn't help. He tried to free himself, writhing desperately, but it was useless. The ropes were tight and wouldn't come loose that easily.
Then the boat stopped.
Evan felt his blood run cold. The silence around was heavy, almost solid. Only Thomas's breathing and the gentle sound of moving water filled the void.
Thomas stood up slowly and looked at him. A crooked smile ‚Äî one Evan would never forget ‚Äî formed on his lips.
""Well, little angel... it's time.""
He took him in his arms like Evan was nothing. Just a burden to be discarded.
He went to the edge of the boat, like someone getting rid of inconvenient rubbish.
Tears ran down the boy's face. A cry caught in the throat, muffled by fear and pain. Above them, the full moon shone like an indifferent lantern, silent witness to Thomas's sins.
And then, he threw it.
The icy water cut Evan's skin like blades. The weight of the ropes pulled him to the bottom. He struggled hard, in panic, trying to catch the air that was already escaping his lungs.
It was useless.
Everything was useless.
""This is useless... useless...""
The thought echoed, until, exhausted, he stopped moving.
He looked up. The moonlight shone distortedly on the surface. The dark depths surrounded him, drowning his body, his screams, and his hope.
And then, in the icy silence of the waters, a voice whispered.
It was deep. Dark. Almost a distant echo.
""The moon knows about his sins, little angel... and so do we.""
Evan's consciousness faded. And the world was plunged into darkness.
After the murder of his own son, Thomas went to the cabin that was near the lake, and took a bottle of whiskey, sat down in the armchair in front of the fireplace, now lit, and began to drink. He did not appear to have any regret for his mistakes. Little did he know, that in the corner of the room, a demonic presence, so to speak, was lurking at him. An angel half demon came for your sins. Evan's soul was unable to rest. And now he just wanted revenge. And it would be slow and painful.
A macabre smile appeared in the darkness, scaring Thomas. The sound of a soft laugh echoed through the room.
And that night, Thomas's blood painted the walls. 
That was his last night alive.
Weeks passed and the news about Thomas' brutal murder was hushed up by his own family. Thomas' family blamed Sarah and Evan for the murder. At first, Sarah blamed herself and fell into a deep depression, only improving a few years later.
Because she was still young, Sarah continued to live her life for the next few years, always visiting her son's grave, while Evan watched and protected her. 
He saw her get married, have children and he also saw her leave, and once again he found himself alone in the world. 
The wake took place calmly, distant relatives cried for the deceased, while the little angel, sitting in the coffin, caressed his mother's face. Tears of blood came out of his eyes, drops of dark water fell from his hair, his skin was pale and his green eyes were faded.
A dark aura surrounded him. His smile was pale, dead. But within his faded eyes, something awakened.
When he saw the man attack a child, a sobering thought crossed his mind: ""kill him""
And Evan laughed. He laughed, a laugh that gave you chills.
At that moment, an evil force took over Evan, while a macabre smile was seen on his face.
Evan got up, and began to walk calmly, following the police who took the man, while a sweet and macabre song remained.
""I'm half craze all for the love of you...""
He wasn't really one anymore. The one who was sitting in the backseat, smiling at the man, was no longer Evan. 
Evan had died.
As soon as they arrived at the police station, the man was placed in a cell until someone saw him to release him. When midnight struck, the full moon lit up the sky and silence hovered in the cell, the man slept peacefully.
The smell of his filthy sweat filled the air and Angel watched him, his green eyes shining in the darkness and black drops of water dripping from his hair, forming small shadowy circles on the cold floor. 
He approached with the precision of a snake about to strike.
""Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer to...""
Angel's voice came out as a whisper, an omen of something terrifying about to happen. The blade he held glistened in the darkness as he thrust it into his arm as the man woke with a start.
But Angel was not forgiving. It was not a quick death. He wanted to hear the screams. I wanted to see the pain that would come into your eyes. He tortured and would use all his cunning to make him suffer.
Angel tilted his head to the side as the man looked at him scared and in pain. He twisted the blade and grabbed him by the neck, squeezing him until he opened his mouth, and then cut off his tongue. A howl of pain echoed through the silent walls as his aphids were peeled off, his facial skin removed and with a pencil, his eardrums were pierced. He opened the shirt of the man who was screaming as loud as he could, until his lungs exploded, too bad no one would hear him. With his nails, he cut his flesh and opened his chest and belly, put his hand inside and began to play with his organs, always smiling as he removed a new one. When he removed his intestines, Angel exclaimed with joy: ""Look, you can make a necklace!"" 
The cell was filled with screams ‚Äî long, high-pitched and impossible to ignore. Angel smiled, playing with the man's laments as if they were musical notes.
One by one Angel took them out, always smiling, always happy, always having a new joke idea about what to do with them all.
The man, in his last words, begged for his life, but this only made Angel laugh, more cruel than any monster. And when silence finally fell, all that was left were traces... and the promise that it would happen again.
""Do you think you still have the right to life?"" he mocked, while holding his heart. The sadistic laugh echoing through the room.
""Sleep with God, my angel.""
The next morning, the police found the man dead in the cell from a heart attack, but next to him, something caught their attention, a small camera rested under the bed.",2,1751133073.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False
1lmswu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1lmswu7/7_m_pregnant_and_emotional_need_advice_with/,7 m pregnant and emotional need advice with husband,"Hi moms.

I‚Äôm gonna try to be as short as I can. I truly appreciate anyone reading or commenting. I lost my mom a year ago and she was my best friend and I sometimes feel like I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to - my friends might judge and I don‚Äôt want to hurt my dad by telling him these things.  

I‚Äôm 27 weeks pregnant. I‚Äôm 27 and my husband is 41. No kids, never married for the context. 

We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half but known each other for years. Baby was a happy surprise- we talked about it but didn‚Äôt want to try until 2-3 years pass. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have kids yet I got pregnant 2 weeks after my doc told me that. My husband was surprised but happy in the end I would think. 

He is a very different guy. Or at least to me. He doesn‚Äôt drink, go out or smoke. He will occasionally grab coffee with his friends or go outside to do something and see his guys. However he is very independent and very protective of his space. Sometimes I feel like he doesn‚Äôt tell me what his plans are just so I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúintrude‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt like me asking when he‚Äôs coming back. Some things I would just hear from him talking on the phone. He would rarely caress me or hug me - I tried telling him that I need that especially now that I‚Äôm pregnant and he said he‚Äôll hug me or tell me he loves me when he feels like it. 

I sometimes travel (business or visa obligations, sometimes pleasure) and we barely talk - I was away for a week we didn‚Äôt talk on the phone not once, we texted daily but briefly. I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to be a bother - he would answer as ‚Äúam I endangering you in any  way‚Äù whenever we have an argument and I would say no but I‚Äôm just emotional and those are the things I need regularly and especially now during pregnancy.

He‚Äôs not the kind of guy who would rub or kiss on my belly. He sometimes touches it but often times says it‚Äôs a weird feeling for him.

I‚Äôm not one of those girls that always wanted a baby. But now- I‚Äôm trying to be as excited as I can and I can‚Äôt wait to give birth so I can focus on her more than him because it‚Äôs driving me crazy. Am I overthinking or overreacting?

By the way- I still work (part time) from home and I make way more than him. I try to clean and cook most of the time. We live with my ill MIL, but that‚Äôs another issue.

He would joke sometimes about my weight. I caught him the other day sending IG model to his friend (I know there‚Äôs more context to it, but still). I try to keep quiet. 

We got to our summer house this weekend (I mostly insisted) so we can be alone and together as I just came back from traveling and I‚Äôm going again next week. We were cuddling once and had sex, but that‚Äôs it‚Äôs . He‚Äôs mostly on his phone or doing something else and I just try to be there and be with him without being too clingy as he doesn‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôm always on the verge of crying. He now left to go hunting and I was emotional because he didn‚Äôt tell me before and I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs going to take (like an hour or 7 hours lol) he got irritated when I asked when he‚Äôs coming back. When I asked what should i do (here options are limited) he said do what you want I wouldn‚Äôt recommend coming with me you‚Äôll get bit by mosquitos

When we lay in bed, I try not to hug him often but I need it to fall asleep. He‚Äôs just his own person and I think doesn‚Äôt really care (he has been single for sooo long)

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm writing all this and venting but it‚Äôs some kind of journal that I want someone to read to offer me honest help.

I moved from abroad here to be with him and closer to my family. I did leave my life on another continent. I don‚Äôt regret it - I‚Äôm just lost. I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs struggled with anxiety and depression before (stopped taking meds when I got pregnant he doesn‚Äôt like me taking them as well). 

I know what advice I would give myself to just focus on me and do my thing. It‚Äôs just hard because I try and I still think of him. I love him. Please help üò≠",2,1751133042.0,pregnant,5,1.0,False

1lmstfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1lmstfk/dealing_with_tinnitus/,Dealing with Tinnitus,"It's about 10 years ago that I (M63, The Netherlands) woke up with Tinitus; a pretty loud constant high-frequency tone. Probably caused by many years of riding my motorbike without proper ear protection. After a few days I started to realize it was there to stay. I had some routine checks done at the hospital, and some hearing loss of high-frequency sound was measured. Tests were performed to exclude a physical cause (tumor or so), and soon the moment came that the ENT doctor said there was nothing else they could do for me.
I recall the panic I felt, as I had read about people that had committed suicide after the diagnosis.
The doc added; 'There are two groups of Tinnitus patients; the ones that want to act, that study the internet, join patient talking groups, read books about it, follow the scientific medical developments, etcetera. The other group tries to accept the situation, and go on with the life they were leading before. Make sure you join the second group'.
I took that advice seriously, and followed it. And I soon experienced that indeed the best cure against Tinnitus is ignoring it: The more attention you give it, the worse it gets. 
After half a year or so I was already experiencing days during which I had hardly noticed the tinnitus. Today, I only notice the tinnitus when I am made aware of the topic, or sometimes when I listen to very soft music. I can live with that, for sure. It's annoying, but so is a midget buzzing around your head, being in a traffic jam, or a mother-in-law asking you for the third time if you want more coffee... don't try to fight it, it's just part of life.
I realize that the advice to pick up your life asap is easier said than done, but it is simply the best advice I can give. The sooner you are able to do so, the sooner the sun will shine again! Best of luck, and take care!",2,1751132804.0,tinnitus,1,1.0,False

1lmssdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lmssdn/a_pale_sky_part_2/,A Pale Sky (Part 2),"By the time I walked through my front door, a glance at my phone showed me that it was already three-thirty in the morning. Surprisingly, my circadian rhythm didn‚Äôt seem to care one bit. I was as awake as I had been at any point during the drive to Lubber Run, or my walk, or even the strange, silent drive back home afterward. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt remember being tired at all since waking up in the hospital.

I hadn‚Äôt remembered just how long ago my last meal was until I felt a gnawing, churning pain in my stomach. I grunted in discomfort, nearly doubling over as the sensations overtook me. How long had it been since I‚Äôd felt pain, hell, since I‚Äôd felt anything so intense? I hobbled to the refrigerator, pulling out a slab of sad, days-old steak I'd gotten from the supermarket before my accident. Watching the microwave quickly became torture, and I was practically swallowing whole carrots and handfuls of shredded cheese from the vegetable drawer of the fridge by the time it started beeping. I threw the door open, laying into my steak like a starving animal. It lasted about a minute tops before I washed it down with slices of a lone apple and a water bottle. If anyone else had been watching me, I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed them for thinking I had gone rabid.

After my impromptu dinner, I found myself staring down at the glossy, granite surface of my countertop. I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, but something made me uneasy. I glanced around nervously, trying to find the source of the misalignment. It was no use, of course. I told myself over and over that I was just being paranoid, that my jarring experience at Lubber Run trail was still fresh in my mind, and this was all some side-effect of me processing it. That didn‚Äôt stop my eyes from scanning every inch of my kitchen, my body twisting left and right to leave no dark corner or shady nook unchecked. Once I‚Äôd humored myself enough to calm down, I got up from the table and set my plate in the sink, not in the mood to force myself to clean it. Maybe all I had to do was cut myself some slack; what‚Äôs better for dealing with stress than taking it easy for a little while?

I eventually decided on a cup of peppermint tea from the cupboard, a comfortable playlist, and a nice, hot bath. I couldn‚Äôt help but lose my fear for the time being, my shoulders slumping in release as I took in a calm, deep breath. My lungs filled as much as they could before exhaling a nourishing breath. I was safe.
	
And I hadn‚Äôt felt that way since the day of my accident.

As I lay down in my bathtub and let the warm water take me, I shut my eyes to the classic rock coming in through my earbuds. Apart from the occasional sip of my tea and the best music the sixties and seventies had to offer, the world was silent. I couldn‚Äôt have been more thankful for that. I found myself almost drifting off to sleep, barely fighting against my suddenly heavy eyelids enough to keep myself conscious. After all, I wasn‚Äôt planning on spending my first night out of the hospital sleeping in my bathtub rather than my bed.

‚Äú...And of course, this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
A smell of the world that has burned‚Ä¶‚Äù

My eyes shot open as the lyrics rang out. For a second, I was convinced that this was some sort of hallucination. Surely I was hearing things, it was the only explanation that made any sort of sense. Immediately, I opened Google, typing the lyrics in, hoping beyond hope that some song, any song, would show up.

About 952,000 results. First result: ‚ÄúUp From the Skies,‚Äù the first track off of ‚ÄúAxis: Bold As Love‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at that. I‚Äôd heard the song before; it had slipped my mind for a moment, but there was nothing scary about it. Still, the lyrics hit a little too close to home after the past few days. I skipped the song, being greeted by the gentle intro to ‚ÄúThe Crystal Ship‚Äù. It was a welcome alternative.

I‚Äôll admit, the rest of that night is a little hazy looking back. I think that even if I didn‚Äôt feel it for whatever reason, I was exhausted. I can remember draining the tub, toweling off, setting my empty mug on my dresser, and promising myself I would wash it tomorrow morning. I remember climbing into bed, and I remember a night of pleasant, wispy dreams. The next thing I clearly remember is waking up the next morning and turning my phone on to check for notifications. Instead, I found myself glancing at the clock, a concerned look stretching across my face.

‚Äú6:13 p.m.‚Äù

According to my phone, I slept for nearly fourteen hours the previous night. I chuckled nervously, standing up on shaky legs and bringing myself out to the kitchen. Looking out the window by my kitchen table, I could confirm that my phone had been right. I hadn‚Äôt been up for more than a few minutes, and the day was already drawing to a close, the sun halfway down its descent behind the horizon. I shrugged, deciding to treat this particular evening like a morning regardless. It felt normal in a strange way, like I was regaining a little bit of my control, regardless of how inconsequential it truly was. Besides, I was craving a breakfast sandwich anyway, and a cup of coffee or two didn‚Äôt exactly pain me to think about, either.

Once my late breakfast was prepared, I decided to skip sitting down at the table in lieu of the couch in the living room. I flopped down lazily, grabbing the remote from the coffee table before me and turning the television on with a quick snap of my thumb.

When the television turned on, it took a moment to register what I was seeing. I quickly realized it was the evening news, and that part made complete sense to me. The last time I had turned on my TV would have been the morning before my incident at work, and, even though I knew I could just check the weather and any big headlines on my phone, I‚Äôd gotten attached to my small town‚Äôs channel 3 news. It seemed that they were in the middle of a big report, something either very bad or very good by the looks of it. I looked down for the headline, trying to make sense of everything.

‚ÄúLocal scientist discovers new planet!‚Äù

My blood ran cold as soon as I realized what I had read. The phrase twisted around inside my mind, repeating infinitely. Before I could really consider my options, a woman with strawberry blonde hair appeared on screen and began to explain the details of the story that I had already experienced firsthand.

‚Äú...The recruit, Arlington‚Äôs own Ethan Fletcher, said he found the planet and its bizarre moon completely by accident during a routine check of several planets in the L-62-90 solar system! During an interview this morning, he-‚Äù

I finally regained control over my panic and smashed my thumb against the power button at the top of the remote, drowning out the horrible newscast in a sea of welcome darkness. I sat in silence as I picked at my breakfast sandwich. If I believed in luck, I would have been convinced that there was a lightning bolt waiting just outside my door. At the very least, this was something I could explain. Uncomfortable as it was, a newscast on a new scientific discovery was about the furthest thing from unusual to happen to me in what felt like months. I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing, remembering an old trick of mine that dated back to tests in my school days.

‚ÄúBreathe in‚Ä¶one, two, three, four five‚Ä¶breathe out‚Ä¶breathe in‚Ä¶‚Äù

It did the trick as well as it always did; by that, I mean minimally. Sighing, I got up from where I was laying on the couch, not wanting to be anywhere near that damned TV anymore.

For the rest of the day, I tried everything to keep the strange events that had been happening to me out of my mind; I listened to music, I played games on my computer, I even cleaned the entire house from top to bottom. By the time everything was spotless and I had lost interest in everything else, I could still feel resilient pangs of pure anxiety biting into my chest. I tried to exercise, hoping to at least confuse my quickened heartbeat for fatigue. Instead, it left me a sweaty, anxious mess. Annoyed and defeated, I took a quick shower, slipped under the covers of my bed, and reached into my bedside table. Ironically, after everything I had done to put myself at ease, all it took in the end was two Nyquil tablets. If I had to estimate, I‚Äôd say I likely passed out at around nine or ten, but I‚Äôm not quite sure.

When I awoke, I was in complete darkness as expected, but something had changed. Have you ever felt the sensation of someone else‚Äôs presence when you‚Äôre alone at night? Have you ever whipped around to confront an intruder in your home, in your space, and found nothing at all? The fear of that moment beat a thousand times at once in my heart. I was almost too hung up on the feeling of such a raw, primal terror to realize that my breathing wasn‚Äôt as it should have been either. It felt like I had been inhaling grains of sand, almost like the result of falling asleep on the beach face down.

I jolted upright, a scream tearing out of my throat like a rabid animal as I glanced around at the red landscape of that damned planet for a second time. Glancing down at my naked body, I could see that I was right about breathing in sand. I was completely coated in a maroon dusting, the result of what was now very clearly my body lying on Aries. Contrasting horrifically with the reddish-brown hue was the pure bone white of the sky, still milky and unnatural, just as it had been the first time.
	
As my panic began to settle from its crazed highs to its lingering lows, I took another look around at my surroundings. Just as I had during my first vision, I found them plain and empty. The occasional rocky mountain rose from the ground like a sickening red tumor, but other than that, I saw nothing. Then, as if it were a mirage in the middle of the hellish desert, a pinprick of dark, shining metal struck my eye off in the distance. By the time I had begun walking towards the thing, I hadn‚Äôt even realized why I was willing myself to do so. Surely it would be safer to lie down and wait for the hallucination to pass? But it was like a trance, an irresistible urge that I couldn‚Äôt know or fight against. Reluctantly, I decided to stay calm, breathe deep, and follow that urge wherever it intended to take me.

What I saw when I came over the final hill before the alluring greyish-silver speck is something that, even now, I can‚Äôt force myself to believe. Buildings sprouted from the ground like worms from the dirt, crawling toward the sky on shining bellies. They twisted like a drill bit, forming uniform, helical stakes that stabbed at the milk-white flesh of the sky overhead. All around them lay domes and spheres of the same material as the monoliths. The structures were littered haphazardly around the arid ground as if they had been placed there by pure accident, though clearly, this could not be the case. Every sphere was connected to at least one other structure with a metallic tube, wiring the whole thing together. I was immediately reminded of the poster that sat on the wall at the back of my middle school health class. It was a picture of a human silhouette with a diagram of the circulatory system, showing the veins and their path to and from the heart in the center. If a robot had a circulatory system of its own, I imagine it wouldn‚Äôt be far off. There was no mistaking it, though I wish there had been. This was a city, or maybe some kind of ruin or religious site, and one entirely unlike any on Earth.
	
What happened next I can only describe as stepping into a memory. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them again, I was gone. I was a religious man, or a religious creature at least. No, I definitely wasn‚Äôt human. I thought in unknown tongues and spoke the same, but I understood every word. In my horror, I turned to look for someone, anyone to help me. I began to call out in words I did not understand, pleading for help. Instead, I found myself face to face with a being unlike anything I had ever seen before.

The first thing that struck me was its skin. It was dry and cracked, like a moldy piece of jerky. The color of its skin was a deathly grey, something you‚Äôd expect to see on a days-old corpse. It had arms almost like a human being‚Äôs, but they ended in hands that held far, far too many fingers. They jutted out at impossible angles, an affront to evolution. As I forced my eyes up to the creature‚Äôs head, it too added to the terror building inside me. It had nothing, no cephalized center coated in sensory organs; just a pit going down into the chest of the creature where it should have been. From the orifice came a myriad of small tendrils that ended in black pinpricks that, due to my own vision, I immediately pegged as eyes. Once I realized that, I didn‚Äôt even bother to look down at the rest of the creature‚Äôs body. I was too focused on how to escape from wherever the hell I was to care about anything but self-preservation anymore. But, even with every neuron in my brain screaming at me to run, my body refused to succumb to its orders. Instead, I stayed stuck in place like a statue as a voice began to speak in unknown words that I understood entirely.

‚ÄúThis is a sin against our god; this is a sin against our god, and you will pay the price in blood. For the watchful moon.‚Äù

The words were echoed by what I realized was an entire group of the demonic beasts I had seen, all chanting in unison. The voices came raspy and sick from the inverted heads of each of them, shaking me to my core as, beneath me, further down the flight of stairs on which I stood, I felt eyes burning into every part of my body, freezing my mouth in place. Amid the chanting, I realized something: the rhythm was deliberate, clearly defined. It never changed between iterations of the chant, and it wasn‚Äôt the only time I had heard such a melody. I thought back to the song I had heard echo through the maroon desert of Aries on my first visit;

‚ÄúZ'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶‚Äù

We see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon.

The two phrases linked together like the pieces of an abhorrent jigsaw puzzle as I glanced down shakily at my hands. I counted two dozen fingers, all clenched in a terror stemming from their own existence. I wanted to scream, to let a cry of pure fear leave my lips. Instead, I sat in painful silence, the chanting of the other members of my order drawing to a close. All eyes were unfocused from me, returning to the steps as they began to climb them again. I found my legs uncontrollable, following their movements up towards the peak. It was the furthest thing from my mind. As I climbed those horrible stairs back into the beloved blankness of dreamless sleep, the translated lyrics to that nightmarish song rang through the void.

‚ÄúWe see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon.‚Äù

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidently, it wasn‚Äôt my terror that had unraveled the hellish nightmare. When I managed to sit up in bed and catch my breath among the pools of sweat that turned my blankets into a sauna, I recognized the sound of my ringtone, repeated over and over again from my bedside table. I groggily reached for it, glancing at the screen. Through my half-closed eyes, I could see that it was no number I recognized. This was almost preferable; I was in no condition to talk about a return to work as the previous night had shown, and that went double for having to convince anyone that this was the case. I weighed my options before deciding to answer.

‚ÄúHey Paul, it‚Äôs Ethan!...the um, the intern, remember?‚Äù

I didn't recognize the number, but the voice was a different story. So I would have to convince someone or other that I couldn‚Äôt come in after all. I ran through possible explanations in silence as the sounds of birds and wind, and traffic merged into an urban cacophony through the speaker.

‚ÄúUh, Paul? You alright?‚Äù

I suddenly realized how strange it must have been for Ethan to pick up the phone to dead silence. Sheepishly, I piped up in an attempt to explain myself.

‚ÄúOh, sorry, I must have had my earbuds connected. Microphone didn‚Äôt pick anything up?‚Äù

Half-asleep as I was, it wasn‚Äôt a horrible explanation. I even found myself smiling a bit, my guard lowered. Sending Ethan to drag me into work a few days after everything that happened would be low, too low for me to consider it possible.

‚ÄúOh, you're good! It's happened to me once or twice‚Ä¶‚Äù

He trailed off for a moment before continuing.

‚ÄúSo, I was calling to ask if you wanted to go get dinner with me, Johan, and Ben. It‚Äôs been a bit since anyone‚Äôs seen you, we uh‚Ä¶we got a bit worried.‚Äù

Even without being able to see Ethan‚Äôs face while he spoke, I could sense the genuine concern in his voice. It was comforting after what I had gone through a mere few hours before our call, I can say that for certain. Helping that fact was the relief in knowing that, at least for the time being, the higher-ups seemed content to let me rest after my incident. I mulled over the invite in my head, deciding to get a few more details before making a definite choice.

‚ÄúAnywhere in particular?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah, there‚Äôs this um‚Ä¶what was it?... Oh, Italian place! Ben was telling us about it, he said the fettuccine alfredo is amazing!‚Äù

I thought about my other options. Over the past few days, my fridge had been reduced to damn near nothing. By now, I was well enough to go grocery shopping, but the idea was very unattractive. An Italian restaurant would be busy, most likely packed, but at the very least, I would have my own space at a table with my coworkers rather than having to wade through mobs of shoppers. I nodded silently to myself, my choice already made, it would seem.

‚ÄúSure, sounds nice. What time?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, cool! No offense, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to come after what happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

I felt a pang of guilt at that, most definitely one that wasn‚Äôt intended by Ethan. I wondered how worried he'd been finding me passed out and bleeding on the floor by my desk.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm doing a little better, you don‚Äôt have to worry about me.‚Äù

I tried everything in my power to make my tone sound as friendly as possible, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if it worked. Regardless, Ethan seemed to be happy with my response.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm really happy to hear it! I was worried, it was uh‚Ä¶a lot of blood‚Ä¶‚Äù

Nervous chuckles converged from both ends of the connection, and not long after, I was hanging up my phone and searching through my closet for the most presentable outfit that remained outside of the hamper. I settled on ‚Äúbusiness casual‚Äù, which was more or less the fanciest I could find. I took a moment to look at myself in the mirror, surprised to find my lips curled into a smile again. Maybe a night out with my coworkers was what I  needed since I‚Äôd come home from the hospital, or maybe I liked Italian food a little more than I thought. Either way, things seemed to be looking up for the first time since before the hiking trail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚Äú...Paul? You ok?‚Äù

My eyes shot around the room as I tried to locate the person who had said my name over the sounds of classical jazz and silverware on plates. Something about being surrounded by other people, or maybe being surrounded by such normalcy, put me at ease. I‚Äôd been quiet since meeting up with my coworkers at the front of the building. We'd exchanged pleasantries, both usual and otherwise. Johan wanted to take a look at the scar, Ben chastised him, and Ethan simply said hello and wished me well. For the time being, it felt like my hallucinations and the incident that spurred them on were just a distant memory.

‚ÄúOh, y-yeah! Sorry, I should uh‚Ä¶probably order a coffee.‚Äù

We all chatted a bit, casually discussing our hobbies or interests as we waited for our waitress to make her rounds. I learned that Johan had been digging his old acoustic out of the attic some more, that Ben was getting into some show or another. Ethan seemed happiest following my example and taking up a listening role. I took the opportunity to enjoy the peace I hadn‚Äôt felt in days, convincing myself that everything had just been a series of unfortunate events, nothing worth dwelling on.

I almost got away with it as the waitress returned with a cup of coffee for me, a side of soup for Johan, and a distinct interest in Ethan.

‚ÄúHey, I apologize if I‚Äôm bothering you, but you look familiar! You‚Äôre that intern, right? The one who discovered that new planet?‚Äù

I instantly tensed up at the mention of that horrible planet, sinking a bit lower in my chair as the rest of the table erupted into conversation. In an instant, my peace was destroyed, the topic of conversation bringing flashes of my hallucinations back into the forefront of my mind. Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

‚ÄúH-hey‚Ä¶hey‚Ä¶guys!‚Äù

All at once, eight eyes fixed on me. I felt my heart quicken its rhythm as I grasped desperately for a way to explain away my disdain for such a topic. One by one, the faces of my friends contorted into looks of confusion and concern. I felt like a sick animal cowering in a cage, watched by people who wanted nothing more than to help whether I liked it or not.

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶not feeling good‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôm getting a migraine. I need to leave, I‚Äôm sorry, but I need to be able to drive home‚Ä¶‚Äù

I quickly stood up from the table, reaching into my wallet and gathering a handful of bills. As I placed them on the table to cover my meal and my portion of the tip, I caught a glimpse of everyone‚Äôs expressions.

They were fearful; knitted brows and prodding eyes, lips turned into compassionate frowns. I couldn‚Äôt stand to look at them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Four missed calls.

Between my three friends, I had received four missed calls by the time I'd gotten home. These would, ultimately, go unanswered. It could have been the embarrassment, the burden of explaining my terror, or something else entirely; regardless, I didn't intend on listening to any messages.

The bottle of whiskey on my kitchen table was the only company I needed.

From the moment I stepped into my kitchen, I had reached for it, not even bothering to grab a glass before tilting it back and greedily gulping down several shots. I was never a heavy drinker, but this was a very special occasion. Whenever I had been drinking in the past, it was at parties, weddings, that sort of thing. This time, I was drinking to keep my sanity.

Buzz! Buzz!

I jumped as I heard my phone vibrate from the kitchen counter. I‚Äôd set it there when I'd first picked up the whiskey bottle, deciding not to bring it to the table so it would be easier to ignore. For the most part, it had worked. I sighed as I raised the bottle to my lips again, taking another swig as the phone rang.

And rang, and rang, and rang again.

By the thirtieth ring, even my drunkenness couldn‚Äôt keep away the growing feeling of something being terribly amiss. I groaned in anger, prying myself from the table as I lumbered towards my offending device. It wasn‚Äôt long before I stumbled, barely catching myself by the handle of the fridge as my body hung heavy beneath me. In the shock of falling, I had managed to turn my head to the side, facing the kitchen table I had stood up from.

Sitting in the chair, snoring loudly with cheeks soaked by spilled alcohol, was me.

I would have screamed in fear, I would have run for the door, and I would have tried to shake or pinch myself awake. But I didn‚Äôt get the chance before a white light filled the kitchen. I staggered back, pressing myself up against the fridge. The light was blinding, it was like looking right into a spotlight. I grimaced in pain as I slammed my eyes shut. Immediately, I learned I had made the right choice, as the room was filled with the sounds of things I never wished to see.

They skittered like a swarm of terrible insects, rushing across the wooden floor like some demented tap-dancing act. I heard their chittering, their wings fluttering and buzzing. The worst of all was the one characteristic that wasn‚Äôt bug-like.

The creatures spoke.

‚ÄúZ'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶‚Äù

Their collective voice was like listening to a throat torn and withered by a thousand years. It cracked and rasped with every sound that passed through it. If the devil had a voice, this was a fair approximation. I screamed as loud as I could, echoing off the walls as the creatures came closer and closer. They were right in front of me, they were chittering in my face, they were brushing against the lids of my closed eyes. I opened them, ready to face death with a terrified, empty stare.

Instead, I found myself in a familiar, pale place.

I stood inside a grandiose structure of white stone, and I immediately knew it to be the one that lay at the top of the stairs from my last visit to Aires. I couldn‚Äôt move, I was trapped where I lay. As I tried to get my bearings, I felt something drip down my arm.

It was blood, I was certain of it. Suddenly, I was certain of exactly what had happened.

I had been brought to the structure, my veins splayed open and my blood spilled in some dark ritual. Were my body alive, I would have sent shudders through its muscles and its skin, but that wasn‚Äôt possible. This form had been dead, it had been dead for a long time. For the last time, I wasn't myself.

Crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶

The sudden sounds drew my attention forward, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of it. They sounded far away, impossibly so, but they were too loud at the same time. Each one impacted my eardrums hard enough to make me wince, whether I could feel it or not. The wind picked up, filling my vision with the red dust of the planet‚Äôs surface. It obscured everything.

But the sound remained a steady crack‚Ä¶crack‚Ä¶crack.

To the beat of the splintering, the splitting of rock and stone, the planet pulsed. Each break a new tectonic shift, a new rumbling beneath and all around me. The dust pulsed, a natural equalizer; the powder that stank of blood and metal danced with the devil. My ears thundered with life.

Then, as the dust parted, I understood.

Z'gnac‚Ä¶Zagaz‚Ä¶√Ürebor Zagazen‚Ä¶a‚Äôkanos lo ero‚Ä¶We see a holy, pale sky‚Ä¶For he is a watchful moon‚Ä¶Our angelic protector‚Ä¶

I watched on as the moon unfurled, the result of those horrible sounds plain to see. Cracking down the middle and prying itself apart with a final, sickening set of cracks, an insectoid leg swished and twitched from the crater. It waved in the air, writhing like a squashed fly. Several more followed, a band of eldritch soldiers marching through the ivory heavens. Feelers came forth, then several thousand compound eyes that scanned jarringly in all directions. Wings buzzed somewhere out of sight, mandibles chewed through Mani‚Äôs surface like a rat through drywall. Now, I felt the rhythm of the dead again as the world shook. I don‚Äôt know how, but I know the creature acknowledged me; sensed my presence even in death. I screamed silently in my rotting brain, begging, pleading for this all to end. I gazed upward as more of the crust fell away to reveal yet more kicking, twitching legs. There must have been a million, no, a hundred million in total, maybe more; uncountable mandibles and compound eyes to match. It was as if some sick god had mashed a hundred billion insects into one unholy, shared body. The discarded shell rained down, destroying the world around me in a biblical fury. Twisting structures buckled and smashed to the ground, and the stairs before me were demolished with lunar rock. All around, as my dead ears were full of the sounds of destruction, I could still hear an all-too-familiar chanting. It reigned in the end times, here where no God could stop it.

In an instant, I was back home at my table, alcohol running down my cheeks and through my blood. I had blood again, I had a body that could move and feel. I should have been overjoyed. Instead, I began to write.

That was over two days ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been writing, trying to remember every detail, every piece of my visions, everything that led up to them. As you read this, I‚Äôm certain to be rotting away in a morgue. I‚Äôm not insane, I‚Äôve never been insane, and I don‚Äôt want to die. What lies beyond our solar system terrifies me beyond death. I‚Äôm sorry for what I‚Äôve led back here, for what I unknowingly helped discover. I‚Äôm sorry for my team, I‚Äôm sorry that we couldn‚Äôt have just left everything beyond our world alone. I‚Äôm sorry to all my friends, my family, and everyone else who will suffer for our foolishness. I have become the prophet of an age, one that I would rather die than see take shape. Let it be known that the planet Aries has a holy protector, and he is all things ungodly.

I would like to ask for your advice - mostly guys, but hey, ladies, I would like your opinion too. So, I (30, F) work in a big company, just a regular boring office job. There is this guy, he is working in different building. He is a manager and he is very busy, often seen in photos from some events, often travels. I'm telling you this so you can picture that he is somewhat recognizable and easy to find on social media etc. I've seen him in person like two times. He is more or less my age (cause most coworkers are like 40+, I am 30). I would really like to get to know him, maybe even ask him out, but I really don't know how. I can't show up in his office cause like, that would be super creepy I think? Workwise we don't have anything in common, there is no reason for us to contact in work. I thought maybe I could message him on insta or facebook, something like 'hi i saw u 2 days ago at this work.event and I thought u r really cute, maybe you would like to have coffee sometime?'. In my head it is not as creepy cause like I said, he is pretty easy to find and really majority of people know his name. But maybe it is creepy? I mean I am 90% sure he doesn't know who I am. How do you guys react to something like this? Is it flattering and cute when a strange woman approach you?
 And, to make things ever more scary, I don't even know if he is single. His social media are pretty work-focused and he is somewhat new here in town, but you never know. I would hate to be hitting on a guy who is taken. So, please, help me out, what do I do??

1lmsq6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lmsq6z/caffeine_induced_lpr/,Caffeine induced LPR,"Hello all! So for as long as I can remember I've had a weak lower esophageal sphincter. For many years I noticed that after a nap I would get really bad heartburn and I always had this weird morning voice, where I felt like I had fluid buildup and that it took 2 hours to sound fully right. However, I wouldn't consider that to be reflux yet.

Last year I started drinking coffee, around August. And I'm pretty sure that's the cause of my reflux now. After drinking coffee every morning for months, I started losing my voice in January, and every night the acid would burn my voice. For a month I lost my voice all the time, and it felt as though the mucosal layer of the vocal cords was getting acid sprayed while I was asleep. I managed to get it under control by having dinner earlier, but after my voice getting burned again last month I decided to end this problem once and for all.

I researched and I realized that coffee, specifically caffeine, relaxes the LES, and I'm wondering whether after an extended period of intake it can cause the sphincter to chronically (not permanently) weaken and cause the reflux to flare up. I'm not a person who's ever had reflux, but it seems that all of this started right after I started taking coffee. So a few days ago I cut it off. I'm still suffering from the effects of my last burn 6 days ago, but I'm getting better now that I stopped it. I'm having dinner strictly at 6pm now, and not eating anything after. So thanks to that I've managed to eliminate the heartburn entirely. 

So I have a few questions:
1) Should I eliminate my chocolate intake as well? If it also relaxes the sphincter, I wouldn't wanna continue taking it so as to not worsen my reflux.
2) Can I wean off the reflux and strengthen the LES by cutting out caffeine, and therefore go back to how I've been my whole life?
3) Has anyone else had such a negative experience with coffee? Especially the withdrawal has been hell.
4) And what about tea or matcha?",1,1751132579.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had other attempts before where I felt achy or nauseous, but this time I feel decent. 

I quit caffeine because I‚Äôve been struggling and feeling off for the past 4-5 years. I think doing intermittent fasting plus black coffee had some negative effects on my body, and I‚Äôve since developed moderate reflux, gained a ton of fat that I can‚Äôt lose, lost muscle, and noticed greatly increased anxiety. I know my body needs a break. 

I haven‚Äôt noticed a ton of positive benefits yet with any of my issues, but it does seem like my skin is a bit calmer and less prone to irritation, and my reflux is lessened. However, I still struggle with anxiety and haven‚Äôt noticed much change with my weight.

I recently built a minimalist day planner app called¬†**todari**¬†that helps you organize your day and manage your expenses‚Äîwithout the clutter or overwhelm.

Unlike most planners,¬†**todari**¬†is designed with¬†*recurring tasks*¬†in mind: subscriptions, birthdays, seasonal chores (like swapping tires or planning summer trips), and other repetitive responsibilities that don‚Äôt always need a specific date.

**One unique feature**: You can assign tasks to an entire month‚Äînot just a day. This avoids constant rescheduling and lets you focus on¬†*doing*¬†instead of¬†*dragging*¬†tasks from one day to the next.

**Key Features:**

* **Free to use**¬†(with limitations),¬†*no ads, no sign-up, works offline*
* Clean, minimalist interface focused on¬†*clarity*¬†and¬†*calm*
* **Day planning + Expense & Subscription Tracking**¬†in one place
* Monthly view for recurring or seasonal items (e.g., ‚Äúbuy gifts in December‚Äù)
* Built-in¬†**library of 100s of pre-made items**¬†to get you started fast
* **Statistics**¬†to understand your spending and productivity patterns

I‚Äôd love your feedback‚Äîwhat works, what‚Äôs missing, and what you‚Äôd want in a tool like this. Thanks for checking it out!

Don't worry ‚Äì I've got the intel you need to never miss out on those legendary morning bites again.

Here's the deal: Chick-fil-A wraps up breakfast service at 10:30 AM sharp. That's your hard deadline, no negotiations. Miss it by even a minute, and you're stuck with lunch options while your heart yearns for those buttery biscuits.

# The Chick-fil-A Breakfast Timeline: Know Your Window

Chick-fil-A breakfast hours end at 10:30 a.m. But let's break this down like the breakfast strategy it really is.

Most [Chick-fil-A](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/menu) locations fire up their breakfast game at 6:30 AM Monday through Saturday. That gives you exactly four hours to get your fix ‚Äì but here's where it gets interesting.

**Peak Hours (8:00-9:30 AM):** This is when the breakfast rush hits hardest. Lines are longer, but the energy is electric. Perfect if you don't mind the crowd and want that authentic morning hustle vibe.

**Sweet Spot (6:30-8:00 AM):** Early birds get the worm ‚Äì and shorter lines. Your food comes out faster, and you've got pick of the parking spots.

**Last Call (9:30-10:30 AM):** Cutting it close? You're playing with fire, but sometimes that adrenaline rush makes the [Chick-fil-A menu](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/menu/breakfast) taste even better.

# Why 10:30 AM? The Method Behind the Madness

Chick-fil-A didn't just throw darts at a clock to pick 10:30 AM. This timing hits the sweet spot between breakfast and lunch crowds, giving their kitchen crews time to transition from morning specialties to their famous chicken sandwiches and waffle fries.

Think about it ‚Äì by 10:30, most people are either already at work (having grabbed breakfast earlier) or starting to think about lunch. It's brilliant timing that keeps both breakfast lovers and lunch crowd happy.

The 10:30 cutoff also ensures food quality stays top-notch. Instead of letting breakfast items sit around getting stale, they make a clean break and focus on what's next. That's the Chick-fil-A quality game right there.

# Location Variations: Not All Chick-fil-As Are Created Equal

Here's where things get a bit tricky ‚Äì not every Chick-fil-A follows the exact same schedule. Mall locations might start later, airport spots could have different hours entirely, and some college campus locations play by their own rules.

**Standard Locations:** 6:30 AM - 10:30 AM breakfast service **Mall Locations:** Often 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM (mall hours matter) **Airport/Highway:** Can vary wildly based on traffic patterns **College Campus:** Sometimes extended hours during exam periods

Your best bet? Check the Chick-fil-A app or give your local spot a quick call. Takes 30 seconds and saves you from that devastating ""sorry, we're on lunch menu now"" moment.

# The Sunday Situation: Plan Around the Closure

Remember ‚Äì Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays. Period. No breakfast, no lunch, no exceptions. It's been their thing since day one, and they're not changing it.

This means Saturday breakfast hits different when you know there's no Sunday backup plan. Stock up on those Chick-n-Minis if you're the type who needs a weekend morning ritual.

# Must-Try Breakfast Items Before 10:30 AM

The [Chick-fil-A menu](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/menu/breakfast) isn't just about timing ‚Äì it's about maximizing those morning hours with the right choices.

**The Classics:**

* **Chick-fil-A Chicken Biscuit:** The OG breakfast champion that started it all
* **Spicy Chicken Biscuit:** Same great concept with a kick that'll wake you up better than coffee
* **Chicken, Egg & Cheese Biscuit:** Triple threat of protein perfection

**The Health-Conscious Flex:**

* **Egg White Grill:** Grilled chicken, egg whites, cheese on an English muffin ‚Äì clean eating without sacrificing taste
* **Greek Yogurt Parfait:** Light but satisfying, perfect with fresh berries
* **Fruit Cup:** Simple, fresh, and pairs great with heavier items

**The Indulgence Play:**

* **Chick-n-Minis:** Four mini chicken biscuits that are basically bite-sized happiness
* **Hash Brown Bowl:** Crispy hash browns with your choice of toppings
* **Breakfast Burrito:** When you need everything wrapped up in portable form

# Pro Tips for Never Missing Breakfast Again

**Set Multiple Alarms:** One for waking up, one for ""get moving,"" and one for ""last chance to leave the house."" Trust me on this.

**Use the App:** Order ahead and just swing by for pickup. No waiting, no stress, no missing the cutoff because you're stuck in line.

**Know Your Backup Plans:** Have a second location mapped out. Traffic happens, and sometimes your usual spot is packed.

**Weekend Warrior Strategy:** Hit Chick-fil-A early on Saturday, then find alternative Sunday breakfast spots. Variety keeps life interesting.

# The Economics of Breakfast Timing

Here's something most people don't think about ‚Äì breakfast combo deals and pricing often change throughout the morning. Early bird specials aren't always advertised, but some locations offer better deals before 8 AM when they're trying to build momentum.

Plus, ordering during off-peak hours (that 6:30-8:00 AM window) often means fresher food since turnover is lower and they're making items to order rather than keeping them warm.

# What Happens After 10:30 AM?

Once breakfast service ends, Chick-fil-A transitions to their regular menu. No exceptions, no ""just this once,"" no amount of charm will get you a Chicken Biscuit at 10:31 AM.

But here's the thing ‚Äì their regular menu is pretty solid too. The Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich has its own following for a reason. Sometimes missing breakfast just means discovering something new.

**Lunch Menu Highlights:**

* **Original Chicken Sandwich:** The sandwich that built an empire
* **Spicy Chicken Sandwich:** Perfect balance of heat and flavor
* **Grilled Chicken Sandwich:** Healthier option that doesn't skimp on taste
* **Chicken Nuggets:** Available in 8, 12, or 30-count because sometimes you need options

# Making the Most of Your Breakfast Window

The key to Chick-fil-A breakfast success isn't just knowing when it ends ‚Äì it's maximizing your opportunities when you're there.

**Order Strategy:** If you're trying multiple items, go for variety. Get a classic biscuit, something healthier, and maybe a sweet option. Cover all your bases.

**Drink Game:** Their coffee is solid, but don't sleep on the orange juice or sweet tea if you're feeling adventurous.

**Sides Matter:** Hash browns are a must, but the fruit cup adds freshness that cuts through richer items.

# The Cultural Impact of the 10:30 Cutoff

Chick-fil-A's breakfast hours have created their own subculture. There are people who plan their entire morning around making that 10:30 deadline. Social media is full of ""made it with 5 minutes to spare"" posts and ""missed it by 2 minutes"" tragedies.

It's become a test of time management skills, a breakfast badge of honor. Making it to Chick-fil-A before 10:30 on a busy morning? That's a small victory worth celebrating.

# Planning Around Special Events and Holidays

Breakfast hours can shift during special events or holidays. New Year's Day, major sporting events, or local festivals might affect timing. The key is staying flexible and checking ahead when you know something's happening in your area.

Some locations extend breakfast hours during major events (like college football Saturdays), while others might start later due to staffing. When in doubt, check the app or call ahead.

# The Future of Chick-fil-A Breakfast

While 10:30 AM has been the standard for years, the breakfast game keeps evolving. Some fast-food chains are extending breakfast hours, adding all-day breakfast, or creating hybrid menus.

Chick-fil-A has stuck to their guns so far, maintaining that focused approach that's made them successful. But consumer demand and competition might eventually influence their strategy.

For now, though, 10:30 AM remains your deadline. Work with it, plan around it, and respect it.

# Quick Reference Guide

|Day|Breakfast Hours|Key Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Monday-Saturday|6:30 AM - 10:30 AM|Standard hours, may vary by location|
|Sunday|CLOSED|No exceptions, plan accordingly|
|Holidays|Varies|Check app/call ahead|

# Wrapping Up Your Breakfast Game Plan

**What time does Chick-fil-A stop serving breakfast?** 10:30 AM sharp, Monday through Saturday. No Sunday service. Location variations exist, so verify locally.

The beauty of this knowledge isn't just avoiding disappointment ‚Äì it's about maximizing opportunity. Now you can plan your mornings, set your priorities, and never miss out on those breakfast favorites again.

Whether you're team early bird or last-minute scrambler, respect the 10:30 deadline. It's not just a rule ‚Äì it's part of what makes Chick-fil-A breakfast special. Limited availability creates urgency, urgency creates value, and value makes that first bite even better.

Your morning routine just got an upgrade. Use it wisely.

My boyfriend is an Aquarius sun, not sure his rising (maybe Capricorn), with a Virgo moon, and Pisces Venus. We‚Äôve been going out for more than a year and have been officially together for about 8 months. 

We‚Äôre both avoidant-leaning and pretty emotionally detached. He‚Äôs expressed that he has a hard time feeling connection to anything or anyone but he recently told me he loved me for the first time‚Ä¶over text. And he keeps expressing wanting a future together. 

I didn‚Äôt feel confident saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù back and I expressed that I needed him to be patient with me. There have been moments where I did feel for him strongly but it‚Äôs not an every day thing. I don‚Äôt express my strong feelings (when I do have them) often and I‚Äôm scared of being too clingy for him because he seems aloof when I do let my more clingy side come out. The thing is, I need to feel emotionally safe and close to someone before I can even let myself even feel for them properly. And that requires a certain level of consistent effort for connection. That requires being okay with me being clingy like a couple times a month. My boyfriend is very much a homebody and we both go like hours and hours without texting. Usually that doesnt bother me because I‚Äôm busy, but these days I wonder if that‚Äôs stunting our relationship. We don‚Äôt really call or facetime during the week. We only really see each other during the weekend, and a lot of times that consists of hanging out at each other‚Äôs homes and watching movies. He‚Äôs very good at conversation and asking me questions over text but not so much at conversation in person, at least not often. He‚Äôs very good at being alone and I have a hard time feeling emotionally close to him. 

I have ADHD so I always need a certain level of novelty, new experiences to talk about and connect with, new adventures, conversations that are aimed at connecting to each other with depth. My boyfriend is very much‚Ä¶the opposite. 

Is this certain level of emotional distance in a relationship typical for an Aquarius man? In my last relationship, it was very different (he was Aries man). We communicated quickly and I felt excited to talk to him and spend time with him because even if we were doing something mundane his personality always just provided something novel. I don‚Äôt really feel that way in this relationship. In fact, my boyfriend feels passive and aloof a lot of the times. He provides stability, openmindedness and thoughtfulness in a way my past relationship didnt though. Maybe we‚Äôre incompatible or maybe this is just the maximum capacity of emotional connection my Aquarius boyfriend can give me. He has expressed that he feels like he‚Äôs scared of losing me because he can‚Äôt emotionally connect well. But I do see his love in different ways (doing things for me like filling up my water bottle or mowing my lawn or heating up my coffee, being there for me, wanting to communicate when things are off and being patient with me, trying his best to understand me, sending me music or mushy gushy memes, opening up about his feelings)‚Äîbut to me, those just seem like a given in a relationship? Maybe that‚Äôs a wrong mindset to have. Maybe we need different things to feel love?

I don‚Äôt know if this is normal for Aquarians‚Ä¶please help a water sign girl out 

tldr; my Aquarius boyfriend is really good at being alone and taking his space. He‚Äôs also really good at communicating over text but not so much in person or over the phone. I have a hard time emotionally connecting with him. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal. ",2,1751132314.0,aquarius,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1


Ashlynn



I sat in our Ford F350 truck, pulling a horse trailer behind it, my cheek against the cool window of the truck. Mom was driving now, giving me a break, humming along to some old country song. I wasn't even paying attention to what it was at this point. We had been on the road for three days now. Three long days. I couldn't wait to get there.



I let out a loud audible sigh and turned to my mother, ""How much further till we stop? I've gotta pee.""



She looked down at the gas gauge and over to the GPS that was on the dash console. She shrugged her shoulders, ""I'd say another twenty minutes till we hit the next gas station. Can you wait that long? Or you want me to pull over and you can find a bush."" She smiled, knowing I did not want to ""find a bush"". Especially not in unfamiliar territory.



""I can wait."" I sat up straighter and reached over to the radio, pushing the eject button for the CD she had playing.



""Hey,"" she looked pissed. ""I was listening to that.""



I shrugged. ""It's making me sleepy. We need something more upbeat. I don't know how you can stand to listen to that for hours on end.""



""The point dear daughter, IS for you to sleep."" She smiled but it didn't go to her eyes. I stared at Mom for a few minutes. She looked tired. She looked tense. She kept looking in the mirrors, I'm guessing she thought someone would follow us. She had her long hair thrown up in a pony tail, little wisps of her brown curls falling out around her face. My mother was beautiful. She always had been. The bruise on her cheek was now a faded yellow, almost gone. I sighed and looked away, rubbing my sore thigh. We just have to get there, and we would be safe.



Three Days Prior



I had just graduated Veterinary School. I was home with my mother during the day, a rarity since I was typically at school. But now I was finished. I was Dr. Ashlyn Cane. I was working on my resume and looking over some near by postings for Vets. Mom leaning over my shoulder giving her opinion now and then. She knew more about these places than I did. She had been here most of her life.



My father wasn't home. I was glad. He was drunk most of the time. He was loud and over bearing. He spent a lot of time at the bar, hitting on the waitresses and tossing back whiskey like it was water. It took a lot of liquor to get our kind drunk. Werewolves had a high tolerance, since our metabolisms were so fast, it burned off quickly. If I had to guess, I'd say Grady Cane (that was my father, but I rarely called him Dad), drank about two gallons of whiskey a day. His stupor generally lasted long enough for him to fuck some floozy at the bar, and then come home and knock my Mom around a bit. He'd sleep it off and then get up and go to work the night shift at the lumber mill. My opinion of my father, he was a piece of crap. But Mom was mated to him, so she felt the pull that made her stay. She also felt it every time he was cheating on her, pain in her stomach. I would hear her sometimes, laying in her room, crying. I hated him.



Mom was just pulling dinner out of the oven, as I was packing up my laptop and papers to go put them away. Grady stumbled in the kitchen door, his eyes instantly on me. ""What the fuck are you doing here?"" he growled out.



""Um I live here."" I continued to try to make my way to the stairs, to head to my room.



He growled at me. Actually growled. I stopped dead in my tracks, looking him in the eyes. His eyes were blood shot, and the smell of liquor was heavy on him. I glanced nervously at Mom, as she set the pot roast on the counter and turned to him. ""Grady, leave Ash alone. She's done with school. She's trying to work on her resume and find a job. Now let's get ready to eat dinner before it gets cold."" Her voice was soft, timid. I knew she was trying to defuse something that I wasn't even truly aware was happening. I glanced back to his face, he was still staring at me. He hadn't even looked Mom's way.



""Don't fucking tell me what to do Carolyn,"" he shifted his gaze to my Mother again. She took a step back from the counter, inching towards the other end of the kitchen island. I stood there, paralyzed. I wasn't sure what I should do, but the moment he lunged for me, I shifted. I was not going to allow him to try and hurt us. Since he was so drunk, he couldn't shift.



Grady must have realized what was happening, because he grabbed a kitchen knife that had been laying on the counter and swung it at me, as I lunged at him. It stabbed me in the leg. I whimpered as I hit the floor, blood oozing from my leg. I instantly shifted back to my human form, placing pressure on my thigh. Grady had never hurt me before, but I was also not typically home at the same time as him



Mom screamed at him, ""What the hell are you doing Grady?"" I lay on the floor, holding pressure on my wound, as I watched him stalk towards my mother, a menacing look on his face. He had dropped the knife on the floor the instant it hit my leg. I looked at it, then back at him as he kept moving towards my mother.



I watched as Grady slammed his fist into my mothers face. He was huge and my mother was petite, he sent her flying back. Her back hit the refrigerator hard and she slid down it to her butt. ""You don't raise your voice at me! This is my fucking house,""he was seething, his spittle hitting her in the face. Mom sat there with her hand against her eye. She just sat there, looking at the floor, not making eye contact.



I was pissed. I picked up the knife, grabbed my cell phone and limped out the back door. I was going to call my Uncle. He was the Alpha. Our house sat at the very edge of Pack Land, closest to the human town, but far from other pack members. My father never wanted to be near other pack members. He liked his privacy. I would assume so he could terrorize my mother without anyone knowing. Specifically the Alpha.



We had five acres, a pasture out back that was fenced in, and horse barn. I had two horses out in the barn. I had trained them myself, something I was proud of. My father hated that I was talented at taking care of animals. He would always make comments about how he was surprised that someone as weak as me could tame any animal. He was an asshole.



I limped over to the barn, dialing my uncle. He answered on the first ring. ""Hey Ash, heard you graduated! Congrats.""



I whimpered as I bumped my leg on the fence as I climbed through it. He heard me. ""Ash, what's wrong?""



""I think you need to come here as fast as you can. My father is drunk. He stabbed me in the leg and he's inside with Mom. He punched her in the face."" I started crying, something I rarely did.



My Uncle didn't know that my Mom was being abused, she never told anyone. She was embarrassed. She would stay away from the others when she had visible injuries. She told me to never tell Uncle Tobias. This time, I didn't care. My father had to pay. I heard the my Uncle hang up the phone, without so much as a word. I knew it would be just a few minutes before he got there with some of the enforcers.



My Uncle Tobias arrived five minutes later, with his Beta and three enforcers. He saw me sitting in the pasture, my back resting against a fence post, holding pressure on my leg. It had almost quit bleeding. I just needed a couple of stitches so it wouldn't scar, but I couldn't quite get to the barn to grab my suture kit from the office. I was shaking inside. Tobias motioned to his Beta to come to my aid, as he made his way into the house, one enforcer remained outside, his eyes trained on me, and shifting back and force to the screen door that my Uncle had just gone through.



I heard some yelling, but couldn't make out what they were saying. The Beta helped me stand and we made our way to the barn. I quickly cleaned my wound and put a few tight stitches in. We made our way back outside. As were walked towards the house, I suddenly saw Grady get tossed right out the door into the yard, the two enforcers that had been inside were right behind him. My Uncle came out a couple minutes later, carrying my mother in his arms. Her whole face was bloody, her lip busted open and a trickle of blood coming down her forehead. I could hear her softly whimpering.



The enforcers grabbed Grady by his arms, hauling him up. The third enforcer starting pounding into his face. My Uncle said something to them, so quiet I couldn't hear it. They simply nodded, threw Grady in the pack of one their trucks and drove away. My Uncle snapped his head my way, making eye contact. ""Ash, get in the car now. I need to take your mother to the doctor. Then we are going to have a serious chat."" He strode the car, laying Mom down in the back seat. The Beta helped me hobble to the car and get into the back, me gently putting Mom's head in my lap. She sat there crying quietly.



And that is how we ended up leaving Northern California and our beautiful Red Woods forest behind. We both were treated at the hospital, then went to sit with my Uncle as he made a few phone calls. He asked me if I thought I could drive with my leg the way it was. I could. It was my left leg, and the truck was an automatic. We went back to the house, and packed up some things, loaded my horses and tack, and hit the road, heading to Montana. We were going somewhere outside Great Falls. If we were both in tip top shape, it was an easy 2 day drive. But we would need to stop more frequently to let our wounds heal. We weren't going to be able to shift while traveling, it could be dangerous. And shifting was the fastest way to heal.



I had no idea we even had family in Montana, but apparently I had another Uncle, and he was Alpha of the Lone Wolf Stables in Montana. The name was of course a cover up, so the humans didn't catch on. And it really was a horse ranch, which excited me. I was going to be their Veterinarian, much to my surprise. It was part of the deal my Uncle made, so we could start a new life. He didn't want my mother to feel ashamed of what had happened, so he gave her the one thing she asked, let us move away and start over.



Chapter 2


Ashlynn



We pulled into the little gas station that was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. We were somewhere in Idaho. I thought I saw a sign that said Idaho Falls, but since I was half asleep, I couldn't be sure.



Mom pulled in next to a gas pump, handed me the card, so she wouldn't have to go inside. She didn't want anyone seeing her face. It was still healing, and she didn't want people staring. I opened the door, a little bell jingling as it opened. There was a guy behind the counter reading a magazine. He looked up, his eye catching mine. Instantly I knew, Werewolf. We must have crossed into another Pack's territory. We better make this quick, and get moving.



I walked to the counter, acting like it was no big deal that we were here. I handed him the card, ""Gonna fill up on pump 2 please."" He glanced out the window and saw Mom had pulled the pump handle and was standing there waiting to pump the gas, as she glanced around on high alert.



He snatched the card from my hand and swiped it and handed it back, without a word. ""Thank you sir, can I use the restroom?"" He grunted and pointed at a sign to his right that said restroom. I smiled a thank you and walked to the bathroom. I quickly handled my business and walked out. There was now another guy in the little mini mart. There was no other car outside, so I found this odd, but just kept walking. 



""Hey girl,"" the man from behind the counter said. I turned to look at him, one eyebrow cocked.



""What happened to her face?"" He pointed out the window towards my Mom who was now staring at me through the glass door, all her injuries clearly visible.



""Ummm, she got in a fight."" I didn't know what else to say. Our kind didn't allow domestic violence, it was punishable my death. Speaking of, my father should be nearing his death sentence. Alpha said they would torture him a bit, wait for him to sober up and then deal his sentence.



The other guy in the store approached me. ""You two ladies in some kind of trouble?"" He was looking me up and down. I had on a pair of denim shorts, my now healing wound visible.



Shit, I thought in my head. I looked at the guy behind the counter and back to this other one who felt like he could undress me with his eyes. ""Just passing through to Montana. We are fine."" I went to walk away and the guy grabbed my wrist. 



""You don't look fine."" His voice was soft. I took another look at him, now that he was close. He was handsome, with dark brown hair and two dimples in his chiseled face. He had a five o'clock shadow, which only added to his allure. He had on a pair of cowboy boots and tight wranglers. Any other time I might be inclined to talk more, but we needed to get out of there.



I abruptly pulled my hand back. ""We don't want any trouble. We just have to get back on the road. Thanks for your concern."" I walked as fast as I could to the door, the little bell jingling as I walked out. I looked at my Mom, mind linking her to get in the truck now. Her eyes grew big, as I heard the door open behind me and Mr. Handsome followed me out. He stopped about two feet out of the door and stood with his hands in his pockets, not taking his eyes off me. I jumped into the passenger seat and closed the door, looking back at him as we pulled out. He stood there staring at me as we drove away. I sighed and sunk into my seat, willing Mom to drive faster and get us the hell out of this town.



***



We had just turned off the main interstate, somewhere outside Great Falls. I pulled the truck into the huge truck stop. It was filled with huge semi-trucks and big pick ups, some pulling trailers. Mom was asleep in the passenger seat, the seat layed back as far as it would go. She was wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. I looked over at her, tapping her on the shoulder. Then I hopped out to gas up the truck, stretching my back. We were almost there.



Mom must have woke when my door slammed shut. I heard the passenger door close and she walked around the front. ""Hey Ash, I'm going to go inside and use the bathroom. You want some coffee or something?"" I gave her the thumbs up and she pulled her hood up over her head, trying to hide as much of her face as she could.



I leaned back against the truck, closing my eyes for a minute, waiting for the pump to click, signaling it was finished. Once I was done fueling, I took a look around. There was a big grassy patch off to the side of the gas pumps. I pulled my truck in over by the grass and hopped out to exercise the horses. They had been cooped up in that trailer for days now. I had tried to let them out to stretch as much as I could.



Walking back to the rear of the trailer, I swung the door open and latched. I jumped up to grab my horse Bailey and let her stretch. Bailey was a roping horse, and I used her to work the cattle back at our old pack. I was hopeful that she would be of use where we were going. I felt just a little twinge in my leg, as I stretched my leg. It was pretty much healed. The tiniest of scars would remain, but otherwise it felt pretty good.



I was walking Bailey back and forth in the grass, when she stopped, ears perked up. I walked up and rubbed the side of her face, ""What's up girl? You nervous?,"" her nostrils flared at me. I looked around but didn't see anything, then went to put her back in the trailer. I was inside tying her lead rope and backing up Buck. Buck was my gelding. He was a Buckskin, hence his name. I wasn't any more creative than that I guess. Mom comes around showing me my coffee.



""You want me to drive?"" she says sipping her cup.



""Nah I'm good. We are almost there, right?"" I asked, as I stepped out of the trailer, swinging Buck's big butt around to the side of the trailer.



Mom looked around, pulled her phone out of her pocket, checking our location and her directions. ""Yep, looks like we have maybe two more hours. I grabbed us a couple of breakfast burritos from inside. They actually look edible,""she half laughed. ""I'm going to jump back in the truck, I don't like people staring at me. I got plenty of weird looks in there."" She went to walk away. I touched her arm.



""Mom, you need to stop worrying about what other people think. It's all going to be fine,"" she nodded her head. I had to ask her, ""Um, did you scent any other wolves in there?""



She looked back at me, a little smile on her lips. ""Maybe a couple. For sure some cute cowboys in there,"" she winked as she went to the cab of the truck. She knew my weakness.



Pacing Buck up and down the grass for a few minutes, I was talking to him, rubbing his thick dark mane of hair. He was a huge Buckskin. They weren't usually as big as he is, but he was a gentle giant. He didn't spook easily. So when he suddenly stopped short at the back end of the trailer and snorted, I knew something was up. I looked over to the tree line. Standing just barely out of sight was a huge chocolate brown wolf, his sparkling green eyes staring back at me. I wasn't sure what he was doing, if he was trying to scare me, or was just observing. He didn't try to come any closer, and it didn't appear anyone else could see him there. My trailer was blocking the line of sight. When the wolf made no effort to move, I turned and walked Buck to the back of the trailer to load him. I had my eye on the wolf in my peripheral vision.



As I jumped back out of the trailer, and latched the gate shut, the wind shifted and I caught a scent. It was the most amazing scent, like a combination of musk and leather. I tilted my head toward the tree line, the wolf was still there watching me. Oddly, I didn't feel threatened. I walked to the cab, and climbed in. As I closed the door and started up the truck, I took a peek back to the woods. The wolf was gone. Hmm, that was weird.



Chapter 3


Ashlynn



We made our way down the paved road for a couple hours. We weren't on interstate anymore. It was a two lane, country road. It was mostly lined with trees, and occasional house peeking out here and there. We slowed as Mom guided me to make a right onto a dirt road up ahead. I glanced at the road sign. Red Wolf Road. Well that wasn't obvious or anything.



About five minutes down the dirt road, we came upon a huge gated road. There was a wrought iron sign over head that read Lone Wolf Stables. We had arrived finally. We pulled up to the speaker and I pressed a button. A rough voice answered, ""Who is requesting entrance?""



In the most cheerful voice I could, I announced, ""Carolyn and Ashlynn Cane"". It was quiet for a minute or two. Then the gates started to swing open. I pulled the truck in and the gate quickly shut as soon as the trailer cleared it. I looked around as we had driven through the gate. I saw several cameras pointed to the entrance and what appeared to be a movement sensor. Wow, I thought. Lot's of security.



The road was paved surprisingly. We drove down a long winding road, and suddenly there was a huge clearing, pastures on both sides. They were all fenced with immaculate white wood fence posts and rails. I shook my head, that was a lot of upkeep. There were cattle in one of the pastures and horses in the other. This made me happy. I looked over at Mom, she had a big smile on her face. She must be happy too.



It wasn't long and we came upon, what I can only assume is the main house and stables. The house was three stories with a wrap around porch. It looked like a log house, but huge, stone coming halfway up the front wall. It was beautiful. The main stable looked to be at least two hundred feet in length, it was white with brown trim. As I brought my truck around, I saw a long breezeway in the middle. This was the most beautiful ranch I had ever seen. Mom pointed a spot and told me to park.



We both jumped out, initially it didn't seem like anyone was around. We started to walk towards the main house, when a huge man came out of it, a big smile on his face. He was easily the largest man I had ever seen. He was at least six foot, six inches, and was a wall of muscle. He had dark brown hair and had the same eyes as my mother. I looked over to her and back to him and instantly knew, this was my Uncle. Mom ran up to him and threw herself into his arms. He picked my Mom's tiny figure up and swung her around like a kid. ""Carolyn, it's so good to see you,"" he had a deep voice. It suited him.



My Uncle set my mother down, and looked over at me. ""Well you have to be Ashlynn. I see you got your mothers good looks,"" he winked at me. ""I haven't seen you since you were about two,"" he added. I looked over at Mom confused. I didn't think I had ever met him and she didn't talk about him.



Mom gave me a little smile, ""Ashlynn, this is your Uncle Gabe. He left when you were a toddler to come run this ranch for your great grandfather. He's not been back since. Gabe,""she turned back to him. ""Meet my daughter Ashlynn.""



Uncle Gabe didn't wait for me to move to him, he was so big, he covered the ground in three long strides and picked me up and swung me around too. It was like I weighed nothing. To be fair, I was much taller than my mothers petite 5'3"" frame, she was tiny for a wolf. I was 5'8"", lean muscle, with a round ass that filled out my jeans, and breasts that I often had to lock down in a tight sports bra, especially when I was training or riding horses. ""Welcome home Ashlynn,""my Uncle chuckled when he saw the look on my face that said ""what the heck?""



""You both must be tired. You've on the road for a few days, right?"" he asked. Mom nodded her head. That's when my Uncle took a good look at her face. He suddenly looked pissed, as he walked up to her and grabbed her chin in his hand, turning her face side to side. He let out an angry growl, then dropped his head. ""Carolyn, I wish you would have told Tobias about this when it first started. It wouldn't have gotten to this. And you need to shift so that can finish healing."" He started to walk towards the house. ""Follow me,"" he motioned with his arm as he strode towards the house.



I suddenly felt like I was being watched. I looked towards the stable. There leaning against the frame of the breezeway was the guy I had seen at that gas station in Idaho, the one who had grabbed my wrist. I'm sure my eyes were bugging out of my head as I looked at him. He had on boots, a pair of dark blue wranglers, leather chaps over them, and a button up black shirt. He had on a black stetson, his eyes lasered in on me. It was then that I noticed, even from this distance, he had some of the brightest green eyes I had ever seen. He didn't say anything, just gave me a smirk, pushed off the wall and headed back down the breezeway. I shook my head wondering if it was a mirage, but nope I watched his very nice ass walking away from me.



Uncle Gabe was on the porch. I am not sure he could see what I had been looking at, but he cleared his throat. ""Ash, I see you're admiring the stables. I hope you like it here. Come on in and we will get you guys situated and chat for a bit, then you can put your horses to pasture so they can get some exercise."" His voice snapped me out of my daze.



""Oh um, yeah ok,"" I muttered, walking up to the main house, joining him on the porch. He ushered me in the front door. My eyes fell on my mother, who was seated on a huge leather sofa, her feet curled up under her. She looked relaxed, a cup of tea in her hands. She was talking to a beautiful blonde lady, whom I was guessing was the Luna. My suspicions were correct, when my Uncle introduced me to his mate, Jenna. She was a sweet as she was beautiful.



""So I hope you don't mind, but we are going to put your Mom up here in the main house with us. It's where she belongs,"" Jenna smiled. I looked over at my Uncle and he smiled back and gave me a nod. ""We decided that since you're going to be our Veterinarian here, you should have the loft over the stables. It's where we usually have our previous Veterinarian's stay. It gives the quickest access to the animals and your clinic,"" Jenna went on to say.



""My clinic,"" I breathed out. I was so excited to have my own clinic, but I kind of doubted it was an actual clinic. My Uncle made that theory go out the window immediately when he piped in.



""Yes, we have a full clinic here, complete with a surgical area if it's needed. You have a staff as well, three vet techs. There will always be one on call, any time of the day or night, in the event of emergencies. We have access to any medications you may need, xray's and state of art equipment. These are expensive horses we have here, so only the best for them,"" My Uncle informed me. I just sat there with my jaw on the floor like an idiot.



My Uncle laughed and pushed out of the chair he'd been reclining in. ""Let's go Ash. I will show you to your living quarters and then to the clinic. After that, we can turn out your horses. Sound good?"" he asked as he strolled towards the door.



""Uh yeah, great, "" I replied as we headed out the door. I'm sure I had the stupidest grin on my face, but I couldn't help it. I was suddenly the happiest I'd been in a long time. As I glanced back at Mom, I realized she was also happy. And for the first time since I was little, she looked relaxed. This was going to be good for her.

I knew the second that woman turned towards the stable, who she was. She was the one I had tried to talk to at that gas station in Idaho Falls. She wasn't limping anymore, so I could assume that the injury I had seen on her thigh had healed. That's the great thing about being a werewolf, you heal faster than humans. After she left Idaho, I had gone out back and hopped in my Dodge, bidding my cousin good bye. I had been there for his sisters mating ceremony and was now heading back to Lone Wolf Stables, where I had been living and working since I was 18. The Alpha had offered me a place in his pack when he saw me working horses at a trade show in Helena, and I had been here since. It was an honor to work here, it was known for the best horses in the country. My Alpha had no issues with it when I told him I wanted to align with this pack, he knew it was a good opportunity. My Mother was a wreck about it, but she has since grown used to me not being there. I go home a couple times a year to visit and for family events, Alpha Gabe is good about giving us time off when needed.



I had leaned my big frame up against the entry way to the breeze way, just to watch the interaction. When I first heard the truck pull up, I thought it might be our new Veterinarian. I was shocked to see the Alpha hugging the two women. Our hearing is excellent, so when the one named Carolyn introduced Ashlynn to her Uncle Gabe, my jaw about hit the floor. I admit, I had stopped at that truck stop outside Great Falls as well. I was putting gas in my Dodge, when her big F350 pulled up to a pump a few lanes over. I recognized it right away. I knew for sure it was them when I saw her Mom climb out, the remains of a fading bruise on her left cheek bone.



When she pulled her truck over by the grass to stretch her horses legs, I went and parked behind the truck stop, between two semi's and walked into the woods. When I was far enough in, I undressed and shifted. I wanted to get a better look at her. I sat in the tree line for a bit, concealed by a bush. She was good with the horses. I heard her whispering to them, offering comfort. She had her long brown hair pulled back into a baseball cap. She wore no make up, but she was naturally beautiful. She had the most striking blue eyes and long eyelashes, so thick I could see them from my hiding spot. I watched as her wrangler clad ass moved with confidence and ease, as she guided her horses. I caught her scent on the breeze. It was exactly as I remembered it from the gas station. She smelled like fresh rain, and I loved the rain. When I crept forward to the tree line to try and get a better whiff of her scent, her Buckskin alerted her. I stayed perfectly still when her eyes caught mine in the trees. I watched her put her horse back in the trailer and climb into her truck, then I ran back, threw on my clothes and got the heck out of there. What was I even thinking? I needed to get back to the ranch and get to work. I took a short cut down a back dirt road, throwing up dust behind me. I beat them to the ranch by about an hour. Imagine my surprise when she was standing there in front of me a short time later.



It is just my luck that she's the Alpha's niece. She noticed me leaning in the doorway and stared at me. Her mouth was slightly open, a look of utter surprise on her face. I gave her a smirk, and walked my ass away. She was off limits. The Alpha's niece, yeah not happening. I shook my head with disappointment. On a good note, at least I was going to have something beautiful to look at every now and then.",1,1751132172.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Bio

Meet Carra, a sweet 6-month-old female pup who's still learning about the world around her! From our observations, Carra seems to have a dainty and gentle play style, often preferring a calmer environment. While she can be playful and affectionate with people, she may need some time to warm up to new canine friends. Carra might do best in a quieter home where she can build her confidence at her own pace. Come meet Carra today!



Carra is at risk for euthanasia due to the current shelter capacity. Currently the shelter is above capacity to adequately house and care for animals. Carra would benefit from individualized attention with a foster, adopter or rescue partner.



Medical Notes

06/14: Not responding to doxy.  Worse- is BAR but has mucopurulent nasal discharge and sneezing.  Add clindamycin.

06/11: The dog is BAR. Coughing has bilateral clear nasal discharge. 

RX: Doxy 100mg 1 tab SID for 10 day



This dog was showing symptoms of Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex, commonly known as ‚Äúkennel cough‚Äù during examination today. We have started a 10-day course of an antibiotic called Doxycycline to treat these symptoms. This is a common illness in places that house many dogs, and we expect a full recovery with treatment. Please monitor your new dog at home to ensure these symptoms are resolving. Additional symptoms to look for would be yellow/green nasal discharge, increased frequency of sneezing or coughing, lack of appetite and sudden changes in energy level. If symptoms do not improve or worsen at home, or if you have any other concerns, please follow up with your regular veterinarian for additional care. Also note that even after symptoms resolve, the germs that cause ‚Äúkennel cough‚Äù may still be shed for up to several weeks.



Shelter Observation

06/05: able to enter kennel with them very sweet would jump on me a lot allowed pets tail wagging and is playful



Volunteer Daycation

06/23: How did your dog do in the car? Eh, I tolerate riding in the car

Which of the following activities did the dog enjoy? Going on a walk, Lounging around a dog-friendly coffee shop / restaurant / bar



How did they interact with strangers? I love meeting new friends!



If they saw any cats, how did they react? N/a



If they saw any other dogs, how did they react? She does need some more socialization with other dogs besides her littermates. She was a little uncomfortable when she saw dogs but it seems she is just fearful. I would strongly advise slow intros with any resident dogs in a new home.



If they met any children, how did they react? She‚Äôs very gentle and seems to gravitate towards children



How did I walk on the leash? (Examples: excited/pulling/timid/awesome walker)Was a little nervous at first, but got the hang of it after a few minutes



How were my manners and do I know any tricks? Good manners



Did they show any of the additional behaviors listed below? Warms up (timid at first), Love bug, Solicits pets



The best part of my Daycation was when.......Seeing how happy she was to get out of the shelter. Throughout the day, she definitely opened up and is a very affectionate.



Any additional notes you would like to include about the dog? She‚Äôs a very sweet dog who needs a patient owner who can socialize her as she seems to be a little nervous, especially around other dogs. But with patience, she is the sweetest girl.



Playgroup Assessment

06/23: EPG2 & NO PLAYSTYLE: Fearful, distances self from other dogs. Could act defensively if not given space and may give over corrections.

06/06: EPG1 & DG - DAINTY & GENTLE: Dog was skittish when entering yard and had fearful energy with the others. Mostly kept to self and would bark and growl at dogs that got close. Would do better in slower, calmer yard.

However..,"I just want to express how much bloxburg has done for me growing up. I found a new hobby and a new form of self expression. 7 years ago in 2018, a year after making second roblox account..I stumbled across a bloxburg roleplay channel. I got hooked. You got to build and play house, its a kids dream. For me anyway when I was 11. I made friends and I had fun. I grew up with roblox. I grew up with bloxburg. Bloxburg grew into something better. Building tools became more advanced and I really started to get into it. It's why I chose to do carpentry and design after my GCSEs. It's bittersweet to see the old map go, but that little touch of the model town in the city/town Hall was really nice. The game has needed this and it being here really is just..weird right now but in the best way. I got to explore some of it while talking to others..at first I was really worried, some textures was different. So after exploring I got into build mode and to my relief.. they had the classic grass. I may not love the ui, but i mostly build so it doesn't impact me at all. But this map is something I can truly get behind. I know dozens of posts like these will be made, and the devs will never see this. But I feel like I had to share why this game is so important to me, and i hope it grows into something bigger and better than it already is. So I want to thank the devs for working their butts off with this update. Of course this would never be possible without them, community feedback and obviously Coeptus. He was the first domino to be put in place, making a game that so many would come to love. I feel like this community is really fortunate that Coffee stain has tried their best to stay as close to what bloxburg really is, and not stray far from it. I personally haven't found any games like it. Sure adopt has role-playing, building, trading.. but it doesn't have the same effect. Same with royale high, you can build in your dorm and what not and I've seen some incredible things done.. but so much of it is behind a pay wall. Sure the transform tool is robux on bloxburg, but it feels worth it if you're really into building. Bloxburg isn't every other game on this platform. It still has that charm. I'm sorry for going on lol, but idk. This game has really changed my life. Sounds silly, but it's true. If I end up winning the lottery.. just know there will be signs.. (I'll be building my own house).",7,1751132048.0,Bloxburg,3,1.0,False

Just a couple weeks ago we got the chance to finally come.  It was our 2nd wedding anniversary and a long awaited honeymoon.

We were staying at Mexico but they upgraded us for free to Arte because it was our honeymoon.  They kept saying there were no kids so no noise. 

In the first 2 full days we had to call the lobby because there was ants all over the food/coffee and the porch.  It took 3 calls before they fixed the in room ant issue but the porch remained covered.  We also had things in our room falling off the walls like an access panel in the washroom and towel hooks.

On day 3 we got food poisoning at Tah-xido and we're up all night.  Trying to rest on day 4 and we couldn't because the bass from the rooftop pool shook the room.  That wasn't nearly as bad as the screechy violin coming from a neighbouring room non stop.  We called the lobby, they said they were on it, nothing changed.  I managed to get to the lobby (keep in mind I was using the washroom about every 30-60 min) and they said the person is not supposed to be playing in their room and will be told to be quiet.  Ya, that didn't happen.  Finally on the third call they offered to move us.

The new room was a downgrade.  Smaller, ground floor with no view or natural light.  First morning I woke up to 12 millipedes in the washroom.  I had to stuff the door with a towel every night and would still find a couple every morning.

The new room also vibrated with noise untill 2am because of La Cantina which was 3 floors and a good walk away.

My wife got a bit better but I was still running to the washroom after every meal or even just having water. (This lasted till I went home and got antibiotics.  10 days in total).  It made for a very romantic room service dinner on our actual anniversary date.  My wife at the table, me in the washroom looking through those really cool windows ü§£.

We also tried visiting the 24hour on-site doctor but they never answered the door.

We did manage to salvage a bit of the trip (basically, I just didn't eat and drank little sips until we were back at the room).  We got on one bus, I thought I saw something but figured it was nothing. Got on a different bus the next day and saw 2 cockroaches bury into the seats.


I really wish we had a better experience and hope everyone else does.  The parks that we managed to get to were a lot of fun and we do plan on going back to them one day.

1lmsghg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmsghg,"JAKUB SCHIKANEDER ‚Äê A STREET IN WINTER, 1905","The artist captures a moment in Prague that feels both fleeting and eternal. The sky above is a deep, inky blue, with the promise of more snow. The street is covered in a soft blanket of white, untouched save for a few faint footprints that trail off into the distance, as if someone wandered through and vanished into the night. A solitary figure stands near the edge of the scene, a woman, her back to us, her form concealed in a dark coat. She is alone, her posture hinting at a probable moment of contemplation, or perhaps hesitation before continuing her journey. Is she waiting for someone? Or is she simply lost in thought? Schikaneder does not tell us her story. We only wonder. The snow muffles all sound, and the silence is almost palpable, broken only by the imagined crunch of her boots.

Schikaneder‚Äôs style is rooted in late 19th- and early 20th-century realism, but it leans heavily into a moody, almost impressionistic evocation of atmosphere, which sets him apart from purely documentary painters. In this piece, his brushwork is deliberate yet soft, rendering the snow with a textured, almost tactile quality, and the buildings with a weathered authenticity. This realism grounds the scene in the everyday life of Prague‚Äôs working-class neighborhoods. His style feels deeply tied to the soulful, reflective spirit of Czech art and literature from his era, echoing the works of writers like Karel ƒåapek and poets like Otokar B≈ôezina. Their stories and verses often wove concepts of solitude and a quiet search for meaning, and you can sense that same mood in his painting, like a shared heartbeat of the time.

What‚Äôs really special is that Schikaneder was part of a lively group of artists, writers, and musicians who gathered at the Caf√© Slavia, a beloved spot just across from the National Theatre. Back then, this caf√© was like a second home for creative minds, a place where they‚Äôd sit for hours, sipping coffee and diving into conversations about art, politics, and what it meant to be Czech in the shadow of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

1lmsd06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmsd06,Finished this week's restaurant goals with a day to spare :),"TLDR: Hoard oranges. 

Actually I didn't use the oranges *that* much, but I use them strategically: if I'm close to a certain level goal, like the next prize on the river or the Coin chase, I pop out a max order which pushes me over the line, makes sure I get 1st place and maximise the prize. Then I use the prize to build the next orders and stay ahead, rather than needing to wait for the energy recharge and hope I'm still in time. 

But I think the game is nevertheless conspiring to thwart me; these past few days alone I've had: 
- two seafood towers
- two lobster tails
- a bagel
- two subs
- 2 level 10 coffees 
- 2 double-tank diving thing
- 2 fancy teapots
- and right now I'm doing my *2nd* Dino floatie just for today. 
I've had to use 4 energy vials as well and haven't really been helped by frozen items: just the bagel, and I used a rainbow gem for one of the seafood towers.

Hi, I‚Äôm Sajith.

I‚Äôve been in the food and beverage industry for over 12 years, including 7 years here in the UAE. I‚Äôm starting a small pastry supply business and I‚Äôm looking for a like-minded investor to join me.

What I‚Äôm Planning:

I want to set up a small kitchen in Ajman (to keep rent and costs low) and supply fresh, handmade pastries to:

Specialty coffee shops

Offices

Events and private gatherings


This is a B2B model, so no dine-in or retail space. That means low overhead, no wastage, and a more stable income.

Why It‚Äôs a Smart Move:

Very low-risk and low setup cost

Products will be limited to just 5 items, all high-quality, in house baking, means more controlled production.

No daily leftovers like in caf√©s

High demand from coffee shops and corporate clients across the UAE


What I Need:

AED 96,000 total .
this covers setup and 4 months of running cost including salaries.

I‚Äôll handle everything , kitchen setup, production, delivery, and finding clients

I‚Äôm just looking for someone who believes in the idea and wants to grow it with me


If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd be happy to share the full plan and product details. Feel free to message me any time.

I put in about 6.3 g coffee per 6 cups of water and steeped it in the fridge for 24-48 hrs. It‚Äôs ok but not really concentrated the way I was hoping for‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if this brewer style is designed to make cb concentrate though.

However, I prefer to steep in the fridge and not on a countertop at room temperature but it‚Äôs way too big to fit in my fridge. My questions are, for the full size brewer:

1. do people generally steep their coffee on the countertop or are they able to fit it in their fridges? If steeping at room temp, is there a potential for bacteria growth?
2. I like that the compact brewer has a separate brewing container that you then attach to the carafe to drain. Can you separate the brewing container of the full size from the stand while steeping or do you have to leave the entire the structure intact, even if you aren‚Äôt draining it yet? I think I could fit the brewing container to steep then drain on the countertop if it‚Äôs possible to do so

and finally, for those who have the compact brewer:

3. do you you like the compact brewer and find that it makes good cb? Are you able to make cb concentrate or just regular cb?

1lms63z,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1lms63z/american_airlines_has_beyond_terrible/,American Airlines Has BEYOND Terrible Communication,"Currently sitting at the gate for my flight today, that was supposed to be yesterday. Now, I'm glad we originally didn't take off because there was a mechanical issue that they weren't able to fix. 

The problem is that our flight was to take off at 5:30pm, and it wasn't till about 10 or 11pm we got our vouchers because the airline couldn't decide fast enough if they should fly in a different plane to use. By the time they DID make that decision, they weren't able to then find a crew because it was so late. We get told the plane will now depart at 9:30AM the next morning and of course nobody is happy but what can you do? 

We finally get our vouchers for the hotel but then our next challenge is; baggage claim. Now you'd think because they KNEW the flight wasn't going anywhere today, theyd have no issue getting our bags, that haven't gone anywhere, back to us right? Oh so wrong, because it was over another hour of everyone waiting to get their bags as well, and even then, they only sent out a few bags. Now, to their credit, there was another flight that also got canceled so they were waiting as well, but I (and nearly every single person there) asked why its taking so long for us and the only answer was ""I just checked it'll be about 20 minutes"" but considering we were told around 9:30PM to start to go to our bags at the claim, I don't think 20 minutes is accurate. I'm not sure how long it was before we got our bags exactly but we understand at this point nothing else can be done till tomorrow, so me and my wife just go to the hotel. 

The entire time, my wife is on the phone on hold for 2 hours and fourth minutes before she gives up because at this point we're more than tired. We show up this morning, and arrived at 11:45 because plane said it departs at 2PM. That's a change for sure. Wasn't alerted. No text. No communication at all and even other passengers confirmed they didn't know until they checked the app. 

Still, ""nothing we can do about it"" is the mantra, and so we just sit and wait. Then, completely unrelated, but this elderly woman falls. Bystandard effect suprisingly didn't happen andneveryone EXCEPT any American Airlines workers rush to help. Im talking about I litterally physically cleaned the spill up from her coffee myself. The lady behind the desk was NOT moving quick enough for how serious a fall this was. The lady wasnt able to gey up without assistance. After making sure the woman was actually getting her help and having a freaking JANITOR have a faster response time, the cherry on top to all this? Our flight got pushed more, and its now ""not departing till 6"" and I only say that in quotes because even the guy at the counter right now isn't sure that it'll be tonight because they JUST sent the parts the road crew needs for the maintenance. HUH!?

 At this point, we're BEYOND frustrated. I'm more upset at how shitty the response was for the lady who fell. One guy asks why this is happening and we get the best kind of news; they never sent a new plane. They lied. Be it due to the weather, unable to find one, or whatever, it just never arrived despite that being what they told us. Per a gentleman named Michael, ""that was the original plan but they have decided something different."" So we're now possibly leaving 24 hours after, possibly more. Wife is currently trying to get us booked on something else (Currently on standby for another flight) but by God, American has GUARANTEED that I will never use their services because why would I? Every airline ive ever flown with has had a far better track record of at least communication. Couldn't even trust them to take care of an old woman who was clearly hurt. Do better, seriously.

Edit: Apologies for it not being clear but the help needed is in knowing if there's any channels I can go through to get rebooked because currently we're just on standby for another flight as our current one is still pending maintenance and they keep pushing back the departure time without communication.

1lms40k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lms40k,I made this app especially for INFPs ‚Äî I'm one too.,"A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop, rewatching an old interview with Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer. She talked about how decision anxiety and choice paralysis can have a long-term impact on mental health.

It made me realize ‚Äî the stress of choosing doesn‚Äôt just come from big, life-altering decisions.  
Sometimes it shows up in the smallest, most everyday moments.  
Even something as simple as ‚ÄúWhat time should I go to bed?‚Äù can spiral into overthinking ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre tired, overwhelmed, or just trying to feel in control of the next day.

So I added a new feature to *got*: a sleep time calculator.  
You just tell it what time you want to wake up, and it‚Äôll suggest the best times to fall asleep ‚Äî based on real sleep science. It uses 90-minute sleep cycles to help you wake up at the end of a full cycle, not in the middle of deep sleep. Which, honestly, makes a huge difference in how your morning feels.

At first, I built this app mostly for myself. But I realized it might help others too ‚Äî especially people with personality types like INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ISFP ‚Äî those who feel everything, overthink a bit, and often get stuck in loops.

It‚Äôs called *got*.

The idea is simple:  
A minimalist decision-helper that lets you make quick either-or choices ‚Äî  
Should I go out or stay in? Ramen or hotpot? Text them or let it go?

And it comes with a little widget that shows daily quotes from writers around the world ‚Äî calm, clear, gentle reminders to accept your choices and feel okay with moving forward.

The design is fun ‚Äî like a tiny ‚ÄúFortune Cookie Universe‚Äù floating on your iPhone screen.  
Each day, a quote gets ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù on your widget to gently nudge you toward confidence and clarity. Just one line, but sometimes that‚Äôs enough.

On the surface, *got* is a super simple tool.  
But underneath, it‚Äôs all about emotional regulation, cognitive overload, and mental well-being.

We often get stuck in the gap between two roads ‚Äî  
Big choices like *Which university should I go to?* or *Should I accept this job offer?*  
And tiny ones like *What to wear today?* or *Should I reply to that message?*

If you‚Äôre already torn, it means you can‚Äôt confidently predict which future will be ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù  
That‚Äôs when your brain starts burning willpower. And worst case? You avoid the decision entirely.

*got* helps you let go of the fantasy that the ‚Äúother‚Äù path would‚Äôve been perfect.  
You don‚Äôt need proof. What matters is what you do after the choice ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the meaning comes from.

Decision fatigue is real.  
People get stuck trying to make the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù decision, then spiral into imagining regret, blaming themselves, and freezing up.

So I built this little app to remind you:  
Whatever choice you make ‚Äî it‚Äôs the right one. Always.

Chapter 1: Patient X

Dr. Lena Corwin paced the corridor of Halcyon Institute for Neuropsychiatric Research, a gleaming fortress of glass and steel perched on the edge of the forest. It was nearly midnight, but she couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not while he was here.

Patient X had arrived thirteen months ago, strapped to a gurney, his face bloodied, clothes torn, and eyes wild with panic. He had been found in the middle of a crowded caf√© downtown, screaming about a fire and a mind invasion. He attacked a barista with a broken espresso handle before police subdued him.

He wouldn‚Äôt give his name. He wouldn‚Äôt speak for weeks.

And when he did, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Dr. Marcus Vale.‚Äù

Lena had dropped her coffee cup the first time she heard it. Marcus Vale was her former mentor, presumed dead in a lab fire five years ago. He had been working on radical treatments for memory fragmentation and personality transfer.

Now this man‚Äîdisheveled, intense, brilliant‚Äîclaimed to be him.

Chapter 2: Mirrors and Doubt

The man was lucid. He recalled intimate details of the Halcyon Institute. He sketched experimental devices Vale had invented. He spoke of Lena‚Äôs childhood, her Ph.D. dissertation, their late-night research sessions.

He even said, during one session: ‚ÄúYou used to hum when you were focused. Tchaikovsky. Pathetique.‚Äù

No one else knew that.

But DNA didn‚Äôt match. Fingerprints yielded no government records. He had no medical implants, no identifiable scars matching Marcus Vale‚Äôs autopsy.

Her colleagues laughed it off. A master manipulator, they said. Possibly a former assistant with an obsession.

But Lena felt something break open inside her. Dreams returned. Flames. Screams. Her own voice crying for help.

She started humming again without realizing.

Chapter 3: Slipping

Soon, the cracks widened. Lena found notes in her own handwriting, written on stationery she never bought: ""He knows the code. Don‚Äôt let him see your eyes.""

One morning, she woke in a hotel two towns away, dressed in unfamiliar clothes, holding a burner phone.

The messages on it read:

*""You need to get out.""

""The mirror lies.""

""You're not Lena.""


She brought the phone to her lab and ran fingerprints. The results were inconclusive. Smudged, partial. But the lab software detected something else:

A match. To Dr. Marcus Vale.

Chapter 4: The Locked Door

In her apartment was a locked second room. Always locked. She had assumed it was storage. When she moved in years ago, she never questioned it. But the notes kept mentioning it.

""Check the other room.""

She searched frantically, tore through old files, upended drawers. Finally, in an old medical dictionary, she found a key.

The door opened.

Inside, pristine white walls. A bed, strapped. Monitoring equipment. Cameras.

And shelves lined with journals.

Each was labeled meticulously. Dr. Lena Corwin - Day 233. Dr. Lena Corwin - Day 512.

She opened one.

> Subject still believes she is Lena. Progressing well. Emotional resistance high. Personality scaffold stable. Memory of original identity remains latent.



She froze. Her hands trembled.

Who was writing these?

And then the monitor in the corner lit up.

A live feed.

Patient X.

Smiling.

In a lab coat.

Behind a desk.

He looked straight into the camera.

Chapter 5: The Truth

""Welcome back, Lena,"" he said.

She backed away, shaking her head.

""I‚Äôm the doctor,"" she whispered.

""You were,"" he replied. ""You created me to help you process your guilt. The fire, the accident. Your research crossed lines no one should cross. You were never meant to fragment yourself. But you did. You created Lena Corwin.""

She fell to her knees.

""No...""

""You are Dr. Marcus Vale.""

Silence.

Then a memory surfaced, unbidden.

A fire. Screams. Injecting herself with a prototype serum.

A mirror cracking.

Her face.

No‚Äîhis face.

She looked up at the camera.

""How do I stop it?""

""You already did,"" he said softly. ""You asked me to wake you up when you were ready. You‚Äôre ready.""

The screen blinked.

Everything went dark.

Chapter 6: Emergence

Lena woke up in a hospital bed.

No‚Äînot Lena. Not anymore.

The man in the mirror was Marcus Vale. Gaunt. Older. But unmistakably him.

He exhaled.

The fragments had settled.

The therapy was complete.

He walked to the terminal and typed a note:

> ""Subject reintegrated. Session complete. Corwin construct terminated.""



He paused.

Then added:

> ""She was strong.""

I learned french as a kid through to the end of high school (not french immersion, just regular classes), so i'd probably place myself as an advanced beginner. I know most verb conjugations, have the vocabulary of a 2 year old, and my grammar is pretty shit. 

I've tried to get more serious about learning french over the years, but I've only ever used duolingo and a bit of the ""coffee break french"" podcast. I feel like i need something that's more structured so that I don't drop off. 

Any recommendations? I'm ok with paying for online courses. I really just want to get to a level of french where I can hold down a conversation and be able to understand whats being said in french media. ",4,1751130926.0,learnfrench,3,1.0,False

We‚Äôve known each other for almost 4 months and have been in a relationship for 2. She told me she is bipolar and discovered she had psychosis when she was in her teenage years (around 15 years old).
I wasn‚Äôt aware of how a bipolar person would behave or react to things, as I had never met one until my girlfriend. I‚Äôve been tracking patterns and trying to understand when she‚Äôs having manic episodes. The ones I noticed happen every 2 or 3 weeks . she gets very self-destructive and says things like she‚Äôs worthless or that she‚Äôs a burden on me. Then she stops talking and becomes extremely dissociative for a couple of hours, and afterward, things go back to being good again.
But 4 days ago, we went on a date and everything was fine . we ate sushi and went to a nice coffee shop. We listened to music together, we were vibing and having quality time. But suddenly, before she got home, a bee stung her and she became very upset about it. I tried to comfort her and assure her that it was going to be okay, but after a few minutes, her mood completely changed and she repeatedly asked me to get her home. I thought she was uncomfortable or something, so I did, and I gave her a rose before she went home safely (she didn‚Äôt say anything about it).
But then, when I texted her, she was saying very dark and self-destructive things, like how she thinks she‚Äôs terrible and that letting me into her life was a mistake because I will suffer and never get anything from this relationship. She kept pushing me away. I gave her space but kept assuring her that I‚Äôm going to be by her side and that I chose to be with her, while not expecting much from her until she feels okay.
I recommended therapy, but she declined (due to financial and time issues).
I am really frustrated right now, and I don‚Äôt know how I should handle this in the future. I feel like the relationship is falling apart and that she‚Äôs in deep pain, while I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I love her so much and I don‚Äôt want to lose her like that.
How do I deal with a bipolar partner in general, and specifically in my case?

Share a little chit chat
Talked about experience,hobbies 
And a little bit of the past

A little bit of sorrow,a little bit of joy
A few cherry moments as we grow 
Feeling  a sparkle  of interest in places
Songs, movies and the jewelry you wore

It's not the  first time I have talked with a guy
But a first time,admire a baby you carried inside 
But the first time, I didn't get a creepy vibe
With full curiosity,I chose you to spend more time 

 went to the movie, Pop-corn with coffee 
You and me ,our friends within it
You're on black, I was on blue 
Wanted to capture the time and the feeling was true

It was not the first time 
Somebody held my hand
Played with my fingertips 
Patted my head with a beautiful chant

Put his head on my shoulder 
 And Lean toward me
Hold me closure and my 
Hands with tight grip

But those feelings were unstoppable 
A Little bit of confused 
Mixture of limerence ,sense of loss 
And overwhelming confusion,a huge

Softness of touches,so full of manhood's sign 
With him,I never doubted to let my feminine side shine 
Feelings were so beautiful, truly divine
I wish for time capsules to hold those memories and time 

But the feeling was first 
When I found your lips ,eyes and hair
Found kisses amazing like something out of fairy tales 
Your hugs were so warm and the sound was truly exciting when you turned on my dear 

It's not the first time,but the feeling is strong 
 I am Willing to make memories,even with my memory of gold fish 
I wanna cross my boundaries and share with you a lot
Query on my mind,am I doing it right or not?

Known from Worm moon
Pink and flower had passed 
Now it's strawberry moon, buck is ahead 
Hope for the best- who knows what comes next,

It was a pleasure,so I pleaded to a god please 
A short And beautiful chapter of mine,
Say Epheron,
It can't stay long at ease

1lmrzkr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmrzkr,I built a tiny app to help overthinkers make choices ‚Äî even when to go to sleep.,"A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop, rewatching an old interview with Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer. She talked about how decision anxiety and choice paralysis can have a long-term impact on mental health.

It made me realize ‚Äî the stress of choosing doesn‚Äôt just come from big, life-altering decisions.  
Sometimes it shows up in the smallest, most everyday moments.  
Even something as simple as ‚ÄúWhat time should I go to bed?‚Äù can spiral into overthinking ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre tired, overwhelmed, or just trying to feel in control of the next day.

So I added a new feature to *got*: a sleep time calculator.  
You just tell it what time you want to wake up, and it‚Äôll suggest the best times to fall asleep ‚Äî based on real sleep science. It uses 90-minute sleep cycles to help you wake up at the end of a full cycle, not in the middle of deep sleep. Which, honestly, makes a huge difference in how your morning feels.

At first, I built this app mostly for myself. But I realized it might help others too ‚Äî especially people with personality types like INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ISFP ‚Äî those who feel everything, overthink a bit, and often get stuck in loops.

It‚Äôs called *got*.

The idea is simple:  
A minimalist decision-helper that lets you make quick either-or choices ‚Äî  
Should I go out or stay in? Ramen or hotpot? Text them or let it go?

And it comes with a little widget that shows daily quotes from writers around the world ‚Äî calm, clear, gentle reminders to accept your choices and feel okay with moving forward.

The design is fun ‚Äî like a tiny ‚ÄúFortune Cookie Universe‚Äù floating on your iPhone screen.  
Each day, a quote gets ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù on your widget to gently nudge you toward confidence and clarity. Just one line, but sometimes that‚Äôs enough.

On the surface, *got* is a super simple tool.  
But underneath, it‚Äôs all about emotional regulation, cognitive overload, and mental well-being.

We often get stuck in the gap between two roads ‚Äî  
Big choices like *Which university should I go to?* or *Should I accept this job offer?*  
And tiny ones like *What to wear today?* or *Should I reply to that message?*

If you‚Äôre already torn, it means you can‚Äôt confidently predict which future will be ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù  
That‚Äôs when your brain starts burning willpower. And worst case? You avoid the decision entirely.

*got* helps you let go of the fantasy that the ‚Äúother‚Äù path would‚Äôve been perfect.  
You don‚Äôt need proof. What matters is what you do after the choice ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the meaning comes from.

Decision fatigue is real.  
People get stuck trying to make the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù decision, then spiral into imagining regret, blaming themselves, and freezing up.

Bio

Cream Cheese is a sweet and gentle 5-year-old lady who seems to enjoy socializing with other dogs. From our volunteer observations, she often approaches others to sniff and interact but also likes to take time to relax by herself. Cream Cheese appears to be calm and friendly, wagging her tail and allowing pets. During her recent outing, she showed good manners on the leash and seemed to enjoy meeting new people. Come meet Cream Cheese today!



Cream Cheese is at risk for euthanasia due to the current shelter capacity. Currently the shelter is above capacity to adequately house and care for animals. Cream Cheese has been in shelter for over 30 days and would benefit from individualized attention with a foster, adopter or rescue partner.

firstly, when we went to a crystal shop together, they had a few jars of crystal satchets based off of zodiac signs. in the four jars they had, only 2 satchets were left- one for her sign, and one for mine.

we went to lowes together while it was heavily raining. obviously all my car windows would be up while driving in the rain. when we came back out from shopping, all 4 of my car windows were rolled down completely. nothing was stolen.

the other night, we had just gotten into bed, and suddenly one of my music boxes started playing. i hadn't touched that thing in months, and there was nothing near it to make it start playing. we weren't even moving, we were laying still and cuddling to wind down for the night.

we were out of town for a trip, and as we were walking out of our airbnb, a coin fell from seemingly nowhere and dropped right in front of my gf. could have fallen from a tree above us, but i still find it odd that there was a coin there at all!

i was not there for this one, but she claims that one day while i was at work and she was at home, she walked into the living room and found one of our coasters standing vertical on the coffee table. she hadn't left it that way.

she has more smaller 'signs' in her notes, but these are the most significant ones i can remember off the top of my head. even if they can be explained, the oddness and mystique of them mean something big to me. especially since they have been occuring so frequently after we started dating.",11,1751130097.0,Unexplained,6,0.82,False

My husband works weekends, so I took our 3 year old to a coffee shop this morning for a special treat just the two of us. I'd texted my husband to ask if he wanted anything as we were leaving and he didn't respond until I'd already ordered, so when my son was ready to leave I stopped at the counter to grab his pastry on our way out. My hands were full with my coffee and my son's leftovers, so I couldn't keep a hand on him and he went to wait by the door (not very far from the counter). I wasn't worried about him waiting there because in the past he's always been good about waiting for me before leaving somewhere and I was watching him the whole time. Just as I was finished paying, he turns bolts out the door as fast as he can. I've never seen him run so quickly. He ran straight down the ramp and in front of the exit to the drive through before I even reached the door and was all the way to the other end of the parking lot before I managed to catch him, running as fast I could and calling for him to stop. 
I've never been so scared in my life. If the car waiting in the drive through had been ready to leave, there is absolutely no way they could have seen him coming in time to stop. If someone had been backing out in the parking lot they almost certainly wouldn't have seen him. He's fine, but he so easily could have been hurt or killed. I feel like the worst mom, my most important job is to protect him and I fell down on that so hard this morning. My husband and my mom told me not to blame myself, but it feels like of course it is because I was the one responsible for him and I didn't manage to prevent something so dangerous from happening. Of course I will not be letting him away from my side again and if we're out anywhere he will be holding a hand, I just won't be taking him places or getting into situations where it's not possible to hold his hand again anytime soon. But still, I feel terrible about what could have happened and like I can't trust my judgement about my son or trust myself to be a decent guardian to him. ",6,1751130075.0,toddlers,8,1.0,False

Hey folks! Ever looked at your 9-to-5 job and thought, *‚ÄúWhat the heck am I doing here?‚Äù* ü§î You‚Äôre not alone! So many of us are craving something more, and let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì with AI tools popping up everywhere, the clock‚Äôs ticking to carve out your own niche in the creator economy. 

I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to wake up when they feel like it, right? But where do you even start? Let‚Äôs break it down together. Here‚Äôs your **Beginner Creator‚Äôs Growth Guide** to kickstart those entrepreneurial dreams before the AI overlords take over!

### **1. Find Your Passion (and Make it Profitable!)**
Do you have a hobby that you could blabber about for hours? üçïüé® Whether it‚Äôs food, art, tech, or even cats in tiny hats, laser in on that! Some things to consider:
- What do people come to you for advice about?
- Is there a need or gap in the market related to your passion?
  
For example, if you love cooking, why not start a food blog or an Instagram account? 

### **2. Leverage AI Tools (Before Everyone Else Does!)**
Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. AI is like that friend who shows up just in time to help you out without stealing your spotlight. 
- **Content Creation:** Use tools like GPT-based apps to draft your blog posts, email newsletters, or even social media captions.
- **Design:** Canva has AI features that make creating stunning graphics a breeze.

But remember, balance is key! Use AI as a tool, not a crutch. It should enhance your creativity, not define it. 

### **3. Build Your Brand (But Keep It Real!)**
Your brand is essentially your personality on the internet. 
- Be authentic! People resonate with realness.
- Share your story! Your struggles, your triumphs‚Äîit‚Äôs all part of your unique vibe.

You know what's wild? People are WAY more likely to engage with you when you show your human side. Who doesn't love a good relatable struggle? *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs me failing at that banana bread‚Ä¶again.‚Äù* üòÇ

### **4. Networking is Key (And it Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be Awkward)**
Networking doesn‚Äôt have to mean a stuffy conference with bad coffee. 
- Join online communities‚Äîlike this wonderful space we have here!
- Collaborate with other creators. Maybe swap guest spots on blogs or podcasts?
  
And hey, **don‚Äôt shy away from reaching out** for help or mentorship‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs been there!

### **5. Experiment and Iterate (Fail Forward!)**
Fear of failing can keep you stuck in that comfy corporate chair. 
- **Try new things!** Post that TikTok, experiment with different content types, or launch that course you‚Äôve dreamt about!
- Learn from your ‚Äúoops‚Äù moments. What failed miserably and why? Use that knowledge moving forward!

Remember, every successful creator has a backlog of fails before hitting the jackpot. Why not start your collection?

### **Final Thoughts to Chew On...**
Being new to the creator scene can be intimidating, especially with AI buzzing around like it‚Äôs at a rave. üéâ You could feel like you're racing against the clock, but take a breath. The key is to carve out your space while you still can.

Decide today that you will take that leap, even if it‚Äôs a tiny hop. Who knows what incredible things await on the other side?

Let‚Äôs hear your thoughts! Have you taken the plunge to ditch the 9-to-5 yet? What dreams are you working towards? üí™‚ú®",1,1751129903.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1lmrmum,https://i.redd.it/pcaoe9s28p9f1.jpeg,Married with a Machine? [‚Ç¨1000],"Hi all!

We‚Äôre getting married soon and my parents asked me what present we would like. We‚Äôve been dreaming about a proper machine for ages, so we knew quickly what we want. Or at least, vaguely.

I‚Äôve dived head first in the black hole called espresso machines and grinders. Lance and James have been binged, but I‚Äôm not sure yet what to do.

First option is to divide the 1000 euro budget into both a somewhat proper grinder and a machine, say a Silvia or a Gaggia Classic and a DF64 or comparable. That would make a great starter kit.

However‚Ä¶

Since its our wedding, I would love the present to last a long time. And with these machines, I suspect there‚Äôs a big chance I‚Äôd like to upgrade in the future. So the other option is spending almost all budget on the Profitec Go. That would be a machine that will last a long time, based on reports on quality and functionality.

We would then spend some of our own money on a grinder. But after a weeding and a new house, budget would be very limited. Like a Starseeker E55 or a Baratza Encore. That would likely be upgraded in the future, it this hobby sticks. (I think it will‚Ä¶)

What would you do, coffee community?

It‚Äôs a Chinese made, solid top, laminated ‚Äúrosewood‚Äù (just the outer layers) sides/back. In addition to having a missing machine head, and being a bit scuffed up, it had a ‚Äúcoffee table hole‚Äù in the back (a punch hole from hitting the corner of a table). To be clear: I do repair and set-up work on guitars, and have built some solid bodies. I bought this mainly to learn to do stuff on, and I‚Äôll likely keep it as a banger for taking to the beach, etc. I‚Äôve never patched a hole like this, and enjoyed doing it (put a patch on the inside of the body and used a combo of wood filler epoxy and bits of the outer veneer that were still attached to rebuild it). I could just sand and spray some fresh poly on it, and call it done, but I want to learn more from it. Realizing that it‚Äôs a bit crazy, one thing I would like to attempt is doing a French polish finish on the body and headstock (never done a French polish before). I‚Äôve never removed a poly finish, though I‚Äôm seeing lots of heat gun/scraper when I Google. But I‚Äôm concerned that at the very least I‚Äôll lose the plastic binding if I do that, and might loosen glue joints on the braces (I‚Äôm already assuming I‚Äôll remove the neck and bridge). 

So for one: thoughts on removing the existing poly? Because of the laminate sides/back I‚Äôm leery of sanding through with just sandpaper. But as noted, I‚Äôm also leery of using too much heat on an acoustic. 

Assuming I release the binding, just reattach, or should I cut some maple binding and dress it up even more? 

Again: I‚Äôm not looking to create value here, just learn some stuff I‚Äôve never done before on a guitar I don‚Äôt care about, and maybe have a spare beater guitar when I‚Äôm done.

This is the second time. The first was about a year ago. We had an argument after I helped a pregnant woman to her car in a mall, even though there was never anything between us. Things got heated, she yelled, accused me of disrespecting her, and then slapped me across the face in the parking lot. She apologized the next day, blamed her jealousy, said she didn‚Äôt know what came over her. I believed her and chalked it up to a one-time thing.

It‚Äôs not just the slaps‚Äîit‚Äôs everything in between. She‚Äôs become controlling in subtle but persistent ways. I‚Äôve caught her snooping through my phone when she thought I was asleep. Once, I saw my WhatsApp open and active on my lock screen when I came back from the bathroom in the middle of the night. She denied everything, even laughed at the idea that she‚Äôd ‚Äúlower herself to spy,‚Äù but the signs were obvious.

Arguments are routine now, and they follow a pattern. She yells, curses, and throws personal insults. I stay calm, try to talk things through, and somehow I always end up being the one to apologize. She says things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a man‚Äù or ‚Äúno one else would put up with you.‚Äù It used to hurt. Now, I just feel numb. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. In public, she has no issue embarrassing me either. A few months ago, during a dinner party, I made a light joke‚Äîsomething about how she takes forever to get ready. She threw a drink in my face in front of everyone and acted like it was just a joke. Everyone laughed awkwardly, and I played along because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the night. But it stuck with me.

Financially, she insists we keep separate accounts, which is fine, but she must know where I am sending money, even if 5 gets out, I am answerable to her. I am even expected to play cheap and have no money for my only sister's wedding. I told her how about she gets me something too? Gifts for both ways. When I push back even slightly, she accuses me of being cheap or not caring about her.

Intimacy has also turned into a power game. There have been stretches of months where she just shuts down emotionally and physically. I‚Äôve tried bringing it up gently, just asking if something‚Äôs wrong, or if there‚Äôs something we can work on. Every time, it gets flipped into me being selfish or needy. ‚ÄúAll you care about is sex,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think about what I need.‚Äù But the truth is, I do. I always have. It just doesn‚Äôt seem to matter anymore. I can say the same thing? She doesn't care about what I need for once or takes the first move once(no exaggeration of number '1')

What really messes with my head is how quickly she threatens to leave whenever she doesn‚Äôt get her way. I‚Äôve heard the words ‚Äúmaybe I should just go‚Äù more times than I can count‚Äîover the dumbest things. Once it was because I bought the wrong brand of coffee. Another time, because I forgot to reply to a meme she sent during a work meeting. It‚Äôs always this threat hanging over me, like I should be grateful she hasn‚Äôt packed up and walked yet.

Last night‚Äôs slap wasn‚Äôt even during a major fight. We were disagreeing about weekend plans‚ÄîI wanted to visit my family, she wanted to stay home. I said I was still going to go, and that set her off. She raised her voice, told me I don‚Äôt ‚Äúrespect her decisions,‚Äù and then just hit me. No warning. No buildup. Just that same open-handed slap to the face. She walked away after that and didn‚Äôt speak to me the rest of the night. No apology. Just silence.

This morning, she acted like nothing happened. Like it was just another day. And now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering‚Äîhow many more times am I going to tell myself it‚Äôs not that serious? I know some people will say ""everyone has issues"" or ""relationships take work,"" but I‚Äôm starting to feel like this isn‚Äôt a relationship anymore. It‚Äôs a slow grind of being chipped away at until there‚Äôs nothing left of me.

But still let's be honest she fulfils her duty of obedience and taking care of the house iff she is 'ok' and is kind to other people.

Helpful tips are appreciated.,"Solitude has been a part of me for some time now, yet I always seem to feel differently about it. Some days, I hunger for it‚Äîlife becomes unbearable, and I seek it out. On other occasions, though, it feels like a cage. A cage within myself. To sit with myself is scary.
I see someone lost and in need of care‚Äîsomeone who needs compassion, not from outside entities, but from me.
And yet, I can‚Äôt seem to allow myself to fail, to break, to learn, to discover.
I find myself always getting in my own way, and that creates a deep sense of irritation toward myself.

When I sit in solitude, I can‚Äôt hear myself.
I see myself sitting in fear, but I can‚Äôt communicate with that part of me‚Äîand rage burns inside.
I want to scream at myself after spending so much time alone and still not knowing what lies within.
I want to be able to look in the mirror and sustain my gaze.
But all I see is disappointment.

I thought I had gotten past it.
But it has only grown deeper inside me.
And I wander, day to day, stumbling, begging for validation:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve done this, and that, and this again‚Ä¶ is that enough? Is it too much?
PLEASE, SAY I‚ÄôM ENOUGH.‚Äù

I lay in bed, and I don‚Äôt have trouble sleeping‚Äînot because I sleep peacefully, but because I‚Äôve grown used to sleeping through war.
It‚Äôs a necessity, not a luxury.

Every day, I feel my sanity slipping away, leaving me in darkness.
My solitude is dark.
It‚Äôs hot.
It‚Äôs quiet‚Äî
Like a black hole, not allowing light to escape.

The duality is intense.
A black hole is one of the darkest objects in our universe‚Ä¶ and yet, one of the brightest.
I don‚Äôt let them see me bleed, even though I agonize in my words and it‚Äôs obvious.
Still, I tell them not to worry.
So they don‚Äôt.
And I bleed and mend myself the best way I can.

It has become such a burden to be so needy for outside affirmation.
I silence myself just to hear others speak low, meaningless words.
 
So what does all this mean?

I fear I‚Äôve silenced myself for too long.
I need to let myself in.
Serve coffee.
Hear my own worries, my needs, my desires.

Solitude is a light, revealing my inner flaws.
And still, I can be beautiful.
I can be loved.
I can reassure myself.

I need others, yes‚Äîbut I need myself more right now.
I desire freedom from the crutches.
I want to wander off and see new sunrises, new sunsets.
Quiet streams and roaring rivers.

I want to lose myself in life.
To explore the unexplorable.
To free myself from their morals and lies‚Äîlies made to serve those who seek convenience over truth.
I want to experience struggle, knowing I can count on myself to pull through.
To fight.
To see more.
 
I guess solitude is telling me to listen to myself more.
Who would‚Äôve figured?
Hahaha.

I know that someone who has a halal diet just ate cake with gelatin and milk in it. They do not know it. I am not 100% sure who the people are who are on this diet but earlier when main meal were eaten there were a few people who were extremely interested what was in what food. So l would assume they had some dietinary restrictions. 

So my question is; should l tell them? It is too late now they have already eaten the cake that was not Halal.

##Event Details

The Of Dice and Dens Podcast is proud to announce that we are once again putting on our three day online streaming marathon of tabletop gaming one-shots to help raise money for Boise‚Äôs [Simply Cats](https://simplycats.org/), a cage free, no-kill cat shelter. The online streaming event will be held June 27-29, from 12pm to 8pm Mountain time.

Initially conjured up in 2020 during the shutdown, the Meowrathon started as a half-baked idea to run a live-streamed one-shot adventure to supplement Simply Cats‚Äô donations through the statewide crowd-funding event, Idaho Gives. Within a week it had grown into a [two-day extravaganza of 6 games](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cto3DV0f-w-w-vBTT54xupOPM3c3aIZ). We were joined by folks not only from all over the country, but from all over the world! We were also able to entice [Captain Shaw himself, Todd Stashwick](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick) to join us! We were able to raise $1,550 to help cats and kittens find homes.

Thanks to the success and fun of the first year, we decided to turn it into a yearly event, only bigger, moving to three days. With more time to plan we were able to have a wider variety of games and more Idaho locals to play with. Since then we‚Äôve had lots of great folks help us out. Todd came back and brought a bunch of his friends with him, including David Blue and Alicia Marie! Our very own Jason Klamm also managed to wrangle James Urbaniak and Riley Silverman to join us in a game. In the last few years we‚Äôve raised over $5,500 for Simply Cats.

If you or someone you know would be interested in participating, either as a player or game host, or if you just want to watch along please feel free to visit https://Meowrathon.com.

I‚Äôm 32, Filipino, and somewhere between introvert and daydreamer. I write most days but it‚Äôs not my day job, game to unwind, and read like I‚Äôm looking for answers. (Lately, books about yearning. I‚Äôll share if we click.) I also write a bit  ‚Äì essays, dialogue, maybe something personal if I trust you enough.

You‚Äôll usually find me at home: dress on, book in hand, music in the background, my dog watching me like he knows I‚Äôm about to overthink something. But I love to travel too, the kind of travel where you learn how people live, not just where to take the best photos.

I have a few movies that I have seen a thousand times that I can watch it in my head! I love different genres but I have a limited list of movies I have seen. LOTR is the best in my books. Revenge of the Sith is my favourite and many stories that make you ache in beautiful ways. Book favourites include The Five People You Meet in Heaven, The Song of Achilles, The Little Prince and a whole lot more that if i share here, this will be a longer read!

If you game, read, write, or wander‚Äîmaybe we‚Äôll get along. If you don‚Äôt mind a little emotional depth and some dry humor with your coffee, even better.

I have started to notice that when I say/do/think things in a way that differs to how he does it he makes remarks, never anything particularly bad. 

A couple of examples are that he was reading something in one way, and I understood it in a different way and when I said how I understood it he scoffed at me and said something along the lines of ""of course you read it that way"".

It doesn't sound dramatic, and they are always about really minor things but happens every time I suggest a different viewpoint/thought process behind something. It makes me feel like he thinks I am weird or thick.

He will scoff at things or make remarks.

Another example is that I bumped the table when we were out for coffee as my glasses slipped off the back of my head and I went to grab them and bumped my hand on the underside of the table. He sighed, shook his head and made a remark like ""for God's sake, can you not go for a coffee without bumping the table"".

Or once I pulled a pan from the cupboard and it made a few fall over. He rolled his eyes, sighed and said ""well done"" as if I did it on purpose (bearing in mind he put the pots away balanced like that)

I have mentioned it a couple of times and that it makes me feel stupid but it gets glossed over as if I'm being dramatic. He's just blown up because after the label incident I told him he was making me feel stupid for no reason and he snapped back that he just wont speak from now on then if he is clearly always offending me.

We generally get on really well and rarely argue but since ive started to become more aware of these little digs I am noticing them more and more.

ONS is thicker than regular powdered milk or skim milk, which makes it harder to dissolve and bind with water or eggs.

Always mix the ONS with water separately first, stir well, and then add it to the pan ‚Äî don‚Äôt pour the powder directly into the pan.

If you want to add extra flavour (e.g., coffee), make sure to mix the ONS with water first, then stir in the coffee powder.

We are in a different country but come from the same country for context. We met through mutual friend and passed months from the moment that we meet so he will make a move. First date I was not interested, I make sure that I say all the skeletons in my closet.
I am stubborn, hardheaded, slept with 20 people (not so common to have that many people that you slept with for a woman in my birth country, from where he is also). I make sure to throw all the bullets on him, try to speak about other women that we will match with him etc...
We were great like friends, I was not interested‚Äîperfect strategy. This is happening in one small country in Europe.
We went second time alone on date and we end up having sex. I am still not interested in this point and the sex is so and so but let's see, I am getting some so.. hahha.
I am very sexual person so this worked for me. He is in love almost, putting perfume, trying to look great etc. He told me he didn't make a move for long time as he was sure he is out of my league like a lot.
After the sex I am making clear is an open relationship and he agrees. Second date I went a mess not properly arranged down there with period but was like WTH lets get some sex.
Third date feels right. He mentions is open relationship and before we sleep he send me home as he was feeling so strong emotions and make sure that he doesn't fall in love.. I felt this was real.
Fourth date I am getting interested. I asked to close the open relationship. I told to Rick ej I wanted a close relationship and he replies, (because he is a chicken..) I was waiting you to say this first!
We started dating and everything is perfect, he is the perfect boyfriend‚Äîcarries the bag for me, helps me with everything, he is always here for me etc.
Imagine a man that God make just for you, custom made for you.. that perfect. I would like to mention I had my fair share of dates so is not few. I know what is perfect when I see one or maybe not but let's get there.
Also I am separated happily with a child, and he is also.. which is perfect. I don't want a baby as I already have and he has a child also so perfect.
We started participate with our children lives, his child lives abroad in our home country but we often talk with her all of us.. me, my child and him with his daughter.
He is working a lot and we live far from each other and we were seeing each other for 2 days a week when he is free. I don't work at the moment as I am between jobs so I have plenty of free time.
It was a Friday I went out with my female friend, we went for drinks. I send a message to him when I got home just he knows I am home.
Saturday went out to the beach with my male friend stayed all day, we met my boyfriend at his work. He works security near the beach in a hotel.
My friend left after that to pick up his girlfriend from work. I stayed on the sunbeds as my boyfriend give me bracelet to look like I am a guest. I didn't order anything as I don't know how it works‚Äîmaybe they put the bill on the rooms‚Äîand remember I am not a guest hahha. I just have a bracelet as my boyfriend gave me hahha.
The waiter bring me a coffee that I order with security (I never order with security guy, my boyfriend order it for me). Cute surprise. And he came 20 minutes later to give me his water. So caring and loving all day, not just that day all the time, giving his maximum‚Äîthe perfect boyfriend in every way‚Äîwhile working a lot and earning a little bit as he is new in the country that we are living and there is a bit of complications so he needs to do this for a while.
Later that day when he finished work I spoke with him about him giving his maximum when he was very tired and I explained that he needs to tell me as I can't see this as I am perfectly rested all the time. I am not working so I sleep and enjoy the time only.
Just an hour later he tells me he is confused and not sure about us OUT OF THE BLUE. No signs. I see emotions, care, and jealousy a bit from his side‚Äîjust the perfect amount. I process, he almost had a panic attack, doesn't give me details info.. but looks like I am out of his league and he can't keep up giving his 100% as he is constantly tired from his work and trying to be perfect just so I keep him in my life.
Let's make it clear‚Äîhe never communicated this, just I felt it and he will confirm this later on this journey, bare with me.
Also I like to mention he told me is not my fault as I was always supporting, caring etc.. I insisted to leave but he insisted me to stay and sleep in his house.
I stayed and in the morning I told him I am ready to end up this, I am not a person who stays in relationship that person not sure..
I had a lot of things in his house. He told me that at least he can do bring it to my house as we both don't drive for the moment and there is a lot of things and they are heavy.
He said will bring it week later but wanted to see me. I could feel it. Wrote me Monday for Tuesday to bring them. I said I was busy as I was still processing the situations. So we decided we meet Friday.
(Also I am a mom and is the first boyfriend in 5 years publicly that I showed to my friends and online from the time that I am a mom). This is very important detail as was week ago and as single mother there is a lot of attention to my personal life from everyone.
We decided not to tell anyone for now and just keep the photos as I need to reveal the breakup slowly to my friends as I am feeling that will be a lot of attention, especially after posting him online. (I come from conservative country and I live in not so conservative country but there is plenty of people from my country living here also, EU country)
Now to the part he is starting to show his true colors, actually stubbornness. Sunday I broke it off as he is not sure. Monday he messaged me to return the things. We agree to meet Friday and not Tuesday as I said I was busy.
Interesting detail‚Äîhe told me is free all day and night to return me the things hahhah.
Tuesday nothing.
Both Wednesday, my friend asks me if we broke up‚ÄîI said no, but we are fighting, as is still a secret that we broke up.
I go to see the timeline of his.. the picture of us is deleted. We both posted story where posted (me at the beach normal usual, he at a hotel normal but song was ‚ÄúLook What You Made Me Do‚Äù / ‚ÄúI'm with somebody new, baby baby, dancing with a stranger‚Äù hahahha).
Child right? Teens act like this. I am shaking how angry I was because he deleted the photo as this was cover up till I find a way to say to everyone that we broke up.
And he told me it was hurting his feelings to see it etc etc but he didn't delete my comment with a kiss on his profile (also we never visit our profile on Facebook so this doesn't make sense and if he wanted to date he could give his Insta).
Also he is not a guy who flirts first or really dates a lot.. I want to mention I am that person‚ÄîI was, maybe still I am depending how this post goes. If he is the Asshole I mean.
Thursday he calls me, he sounds sad and we agree that we don't share info that we broke up for now. All good.
Friday he called me just to ask me how I am feeling. I was cold and short (he said that he felt the urge to call me every day. I felt this also but not from my side. I was fine).
We met to give me the things and I expect a heartfelt apology as I know he loves me. I can feel it. He tries to run away and just give me the things.
I invite him for a coffee in my house.
Conversation long story short:
I guessed this but all the ""Data"" that I had and he confirmed. He is insecure what I do while he is working a lot.. He is anxious all the time what I am doing.
It feels heavy on him. He was thinking that he will overcome the feeling that I am too good for him but didn't manage. I am initiating all the conversation because he is a chicken.
Of course he lost weight so much in a week and looks like toothpick (nothing against skinny people but this was emotional losing weight that‚Äôs why I am explaining it).
I am saying I am angry you didn‚Äôt talk to me so I can support you through the journey to feel better about yourself. I am not seeing you like out of my league but you didn‚Äôt talked with me.. just trying to make me down so I will get in your league (in a way if he makes me feel insecure I will ""run"" after him so his confidence will grow).
This is child play.. he insisted to leave as he is a chicken and doesn‚Äôt know how to argue. I said if you cross the door we are done. He closed the door that I opened and saw an opportunity and hug me..
Asked me if I want to be with him.. I took a step back as I was still not sure and said it I am not sure what I want..
Why I said this?
He didn‚Äôt come clean. He didn‚Äôt said ""listen I am insecure I love you, I still feel like you are out of my league and I can‚Äôt cope, what we should do?"" or something like this..
After this moment that I said I am not sure about us, he said I know is time for our relationship to grow but I am not ready.. I said that that‚Äôs easy for me then you should leave (I was calm not shouting or anything) you are not sure.. so that‚Äôs a No for me I said.
He ask me to give me a hug. I said yes sure. He got a cold tap on the back from me and he hug me strong from his side and left..
I am the person in relationship with the pants but I did everything right‚Äîsupporting, loving and he told me that he is not sure for us?
Just to bring me down to his level to feel secure in our relationship.. and now he expected me to say yes I wanted to be with you after he was the one initiating that he is not sure with our relationship?
(After this conversation I broke it off of course as I don‚Äôt stay with person who are not sure for me or our relationship)
Who is the asshole for real?
I see is him as he is the one not communicating and backing off trying to get a power that he never lost, and I was caring, loving and supporting girlfriend as he said it also.
I was secure in his feelings and that I deserve a princess treatment which was done more than expected I would like to mention, but he broke everything for me for trying to manipulate me instead of getting clean what happened and how he feels.
There is no one else in both parties guaranteed. But I am thinking to start going out with other people.. he made his decision by being so stubborn. He is blind and trying to hurt me just to get a reaction and reclaim the power..
Is ridiculous I feel like dating a 15 year old boy not a 35 years old man..
What would you do?
I am thinking to start dating again‚Äîis enough time wasted? If he doesn't believe he is enough I should just trust his judgment.. What do you think?

First two tries were definitely under extracted with a grind of 23 and 22 on the virtuoso and 195F water.

Third try was a 20 grind setting and 200F water, probably my best try so far, but still relatively flat and a lot of acidity.
Today I tried an 18 grind setting with 200F water and got a little bitterness as I started drinking but after the first few sips its pretty flat with mostly acidity coming through. As I finish the cup the only thing I taste is acid.

I'm looking for people who would like something that's more than just a catch up friendship and have some meaningful friendships again. We can be each other's support class <3

About me:
- Name's Logan (yes, like wolverine)
- South African (GMT +2)
- I am a feral little freak.
- a walking, talking comorbidity.
- I am both chronically online & ill.
- a being made up of health issues and spite.
- low empathy autistic
- Special interests include: cats (the OG), dnd, Guild Wars 2, House MD, witchcraft & astrology, reading, coffee, crafts such as crochet & embroidery, fountain pens & their inks.
- I've collected all the demi identities like my own infinity gauntlet. (Demi-girl (she/they), Demiromantic and Demisexual)
- lesbian with a wife (aka my girlfriend who I call my wife)
- I'm a nonbinary barista stereotype by trade.
- I'm more active on tumblr than any other social media, and most can tell.
- I am your favourite liberal's favourite liberal. Objectively too woke for modern society. If you can think of an issue, assume I've got a liberal stance on it.
- I have 10 cats
- a lot of people tell me their first impressions of me are that I am confident and self assured but what they don't know is that many moons ago on the recommendation of my therapist I started making jokes about being way too smart and/or how amazing I am at something instead of making self deprecating jokes and then accidentally grew an ego. Oops.
- I love writing poetry. I have this vision of writing an anthology of narrative poems based off of one of my own world's from my worldbuilding.
- All of my favourite media are my favourites because of their worldbuilding.
- MASSIVE DROPOUT FAN, brennan lee mulligan my beloved
- Epic: The Musical lover extraordinaire
- court jester at heart
- as you can probably tell, a yapper
- it's been determined that my fatal flaw is loyalty. I'd let the world burn in favour of helping those I love.

I honestly have high standards for my friendships, so be prepared for that. But I also don't think that I am unreasonable. I don't expect you to be available go talk 24/7 but when we are talking I expect you to put in actual effort and not use chatgpt or whatever ai to talk to me. (Yes, this has happened to me.)

I am not easily an agree to disagree person. If it's trivial things like peanutbutter and jam vs peanutbutter and syrup, I'll happily agree to disagree but I refuse to do that with any of my politics or morals.

Ask me about my job as a barista! I've got latte art pics to share <3 or ask me about my sons' full names (2 kittens named Cosmo and Valerian) or ask me about my views on magic

If I seem intriguing, comment or send me a message!

Please DO NOT message me if you have creepy intentions. I am purely here for friendship.

I am NOT interested in talking to the vast majority of cis men because in my experience on reddit they just want to use me to get off. So just don't.

 I would also appreciate a little introduction into who you are as a person or why you feel we'd get along well, please. Send me a üåô if you read everything please.",0,1751128611.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I‚Äôm from Malaysia and was diagnosed with PCOS by ultrasound. My periods are regular so that‚Äôs not a problem. My main issues are:

1. Excess facial hair on my chin (needs threading every 2‚Äì3 weeks or weekly if I epilate)
2. Weight gain even though I don‚Äôt eat much rice or sugar


From March to April, my doctor gave me birth control pills plus myo-inositol 500mg + D-Chiro-Inositol 12.5mg + folic acid 100mcg daily. Then in May, she switched me to Carbamide Forte PCOS Support (myo-inositol 2000mg, 40:1 ratio).


On the first inositol (March‚ÄìApril):
‚úÖ My skin was glowing
‚úÖ No sugar cravings
‚úÖ My weight went down


After finishing the 2000mg myo-inositol in May:
‚ùå Hyperpigmentation came back
‚ùå My face looked darker
‚ùå I had terrible sugar cravings


My doctor keeps telling me to just thread my facial hair and says it‚Äôs normal.


I also feel my body is very sensitive to sugar and carbs even eating a small amount of rice for a few days and 1 cup of tea or coffee with brown sugar makes me gain 1kg and losing weight is extremely hard.

I‚Äôve also spent tons of money on this doctor and now she has created another problem. One of her birth control pills arrived late and I had to start taking it one week after my period ended on April. My cycle was late the next month (May) and this month (June), I still haven‚Äôt gotten my period even though I took a pill that‚Äôs supposed to make it come.

So how can I solve my facial hair problem and lose weight? Should I continue with the higher dose of myo-inositol or go back to the lower one? What should I do about my periods being messed up now?",3,1751128435.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

I never realized how often I reached for ice until I didn‚Äôt have to anymore‚Äîthis thing produces it faster than I can run a dishwasher cycle. It‚Äôs a compact, lightweight machine that fits snugly right next to my espresso machine without hogging valuable prep space. Waking up groggy-eyed and pressing a button to summon bullet-shaped ice cubes in minutes feels like living in some futuristic ice age we all deserve.

If anyone‚Äôs ever hosted a small get-together in summer with lukewarm drinks, they know the dread of running out of ice mid-party. That was me last July. Not anymore. This unit can crank out up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, and yes, I tested that capacity over a chaotic weekend BBQ. My friends kept asking if I secretly ordered ice deliveries from a truck parked outside.

**Design and Build Quality**

You wouldn‚Äôt expect a budget-friendly, portable home ice maker to feel solid, but this one surprised me. While made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The black color scheme blends right in with stainless steel appliances, and the transparent lid helps keep tabs on ice levels without the risky ‚ÄúDid it stop working again?‚Äù lid lift. At 12‚Äù deep by 9‚Äù wide and 14‚Äù tall, it‚Äôs skinny enough to tuck under cabinets without awkward angles, and it ships with an ice scoop, basket, and manual‚Äîwhich is refreshingly useful for once.

**Performance in Daily Use**

I‚Äôve tested this little powerhouse daily for over a month‚Äîmornings for iced matcha, afternoons for smoothies, evenings for keeping drinks from becoming lukewarm insults. It consistently produced nine medium-sized bullet ice cubes in just about six minutes. During back-to-back use, it kept up the pace without overheating, which honestly impressed me for something drawing just 160 watts. The option to choose between two ice cube sizes is a feature I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I tried dropping a smaller cube into a bottle of kombucha. It fit. Perfectly. Game-changer.

[Don‚Äôt miss Silonn SLIM07B deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0cjy6jkks/)

**Noise Levels and User-Friendliness**

The noise level is best described as a soft hum‚Äînot unlike a well-behaved refrigerator doing its thing. It didn‚Äôt interrupt Zoom meetings or TV time, which is rare for countertop appliances. The control panel is wonderfully straightforward: fill the tank, hit ON, choose your desired cube size, and let it go to work. There‚Äôs even a LED alert when the water‚Äôs running low or the basket‚Äôs full. No need to guess or babysit it. And yes, I forgot the basket full one time‚Äîthe built-in sensor shut it off automatically.

**Highlights**

- Ice production in just six minutes
- Two size options for ice cubes for versatile uses
- Whisper-quiet operation (under 35 dB)
- Slick, space-saving design that doesn‚Äôt look cheap

**Shortcomings**

- No dedicated freezing‚Äîice will gradually melt if left too long
- Needs to be manually drained if unused for a while
- Scoop holder would‚Äôve been a nice touch‚Äîmine lives in a drawer
- Water reservoir cap is a bit awkward to access in tight spaces

**Product Contenders**

Comparing this machine to rivals like the GE Profile Opal or the Igloo ICEB26HNSS, there‚Äôs a very noticeable difference in price tiers and functionality. The GE Opal looks gorgeous and makes nugget-style ice (arguably superior for chewing addicts), but it's significantly louder, bigger, and many users report leaks and serious humidity buildup. The Igloo has a similar footprint but lacks the ability to select cube size, and it tends to be slower on the ice turnaround. Silonn‚Äôs model nails the basics‚Äîspeed, efficiency, quiet operation‚Äîwithout being a cash sink or needing constant babysitting. Yes, it lacks the frills of smart connectivity, but honestly, my fridge doesn‚Äôt talk to my phone either and it‚Äôs doing just fine.

**Smart Spending**

This model sits right in that sweet spot where affordability meets functionality. It‚Äôs easily among the most budget-friendly options that can make 26 pounds of ice per day without sacrificing usability or reliability. You don‚Äôt get gimmicks‚Äîbut you do get clean, fast ice without plumbing or kitchen remodels. I‚Äôve looked at some other units in the same category that skimped on build quality or made weird-tasting ice due to poor materials. That‚Äôs not an issue here. The Silonn model uses a good refrigeration system (R600a refrigerant) and hasn't once failed to produce clean-tasting cubes. Plenty of reviewers online echo this too, especially parents stocking coolers for soccer games or grandparents fueling sweet tea pitchers in the South.

""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" is a hierarchy, recycle should be a last resort, recycling is just propaganda for packaging businesses to get away from accountability. Incinerating the plastics like Japan does is also not an option because of the environmental impact the production brought in the first place.

Decomposition: there are news about microorganisms either evolving or being created to decompose plastic quicker than the geological ages it normally takes, as plastics are an unnatural substance. However, even if those are viable, it's too little too late and those plastics get decomposed into microplastics, this generation's asbestos. We don't know what microplastics could do to our bodies, but we must prepare for significant harms. Unfortunately, getting rid of microplastics is impossible.

Origins: plastics came to be because the growing middle class wanted to show off their ""wealth"" and, if the new products used pre-existing materials, there would be a lot of shortages and environmental issues. Humanity could probably live sustainably if this obsession with status didn't exist, but no... As we are a social animal, egalitarianism is evolutionarily counterintuitive (and somehow periods aren't).

Necessity: however, we can't get rid of plastic completely because they are vital and irreplaceable in some applications, like packaging for sterile medical material, vegan-friendly cold-weather clothes (apparently plant-based fabrics are awful for climates colder than Miami's) and drink straws. Also, as plastic is cheap, it makes some basic necessities more affordable. For example: people in Finland have to pick either the expensive ethical wintergear or the cheap wintergear made with plastics and borderline slave labor. And even Finland has people who can't afford the ethical wintergear. And, about the straws, some people need them due to a disability or sensitive teeth (90% of beverages taste awful at room temperature) and may forget their reusable straws at home when going to a restaurant or some other place with drinks. And it seems that restaurants can't ""lend"" washable straws because every existing material is inappropriate for some situation, like lack of flexibility (some people need to drink while lying down), sensory issues, the risk of shattering the client's teeth when they experience a seizure, incapability of dealing with hot beverages (yes, some people need straws to drink coffee), allergies (and an edible straw like those edible ice cream cones would be too porous) and lack of toughness (some people would bite the straw).

So I‚Äôve been on 300mg of Wellbutrin for almost two years now (was on 150 for a year prior) and I‚Äôm starting to not feel so great right after I take it and I was wondering if anyone else experienced stuff like this after years of being on it?

When I first started I had the usual effects for like two weeks and then it was fine. But I‚Äôve noticed for like the last two months or so, anytime I take my med, like an hour or so afterwards I feel cold and clammy, nauseous and like I‚Äôm gonna faint or something. It feels like I‚Äôm moving through water and I‚Äôm sweating like crazy. It‚Äôs even worse when I come out of the shower. Like right now I‚Äôm drenched in sweat with two fans on me laying down and I just got out of the shower a few mins ago. I just ate some toast to try and see if that would help but I still feel crummy. It got so bad the other day I missed two days of work. 

I haven‚Äôt changed anything about my morning routine with my meds. I wake up, have some water and a few sips of coffee, have some like string cheese or a small yogurt cup and then take my pill. I haven‚Äôt missed any doses so I‚Äôm really confused as to why this is happening. 

Obviously I need to talk to my doctor but I was curious if anyone here started experiencing stuff like this after being on it for awhile. ",2,1751127534.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

Beginnings are really hard, so let‚Äôs just begin:

**INTRO :**¬†Hi hello, I‚Äôm¬†[Sam!](https://imgur.com/a/X66xkE1)¬†I‚Äôm 29 and have been around the sun enough to want to find my forever person. Currently I'm looking to do my grad program - I'm thinking, Graphic Design and Digital Media; I've always been an artsy sort, I'd love to do it professionally at long last.

**WHERE YOU AT? :**¬†Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and¬†*the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? ‚Äì \[YES\] :**¬†To me, an ideal relationship isn‚Äôt just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say ‚Äúyeah, might as well.‚Äù It‚Äôs¬†*all*¬†of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as ‚Äúbabe, dude, lover‚Äù all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we‚Äôll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR :**¬†Truthfully? I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image¬†*is*¬†that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior‚Ñ¢! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them,¬†*amazing*. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :**¬†I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil (again, lemme do it professionally, universe, c'mon.) I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

**CONCLUSION :**¬†If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here. The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose. That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was. Thank you and, take care out there <3",1,1751127484.0,DatingAfterTwenty,0,1.0,False
